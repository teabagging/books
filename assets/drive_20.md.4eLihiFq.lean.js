Try it!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"I must admit, I was a little skeptical about this book; after all, most novels that follow movies usually don't do a good job. However, this was not one of those novels. Tomorrow Never Dies was fantastic! I found myself reading this novel as I ate, before I went to sleep, and basically before I did anything else! It was that hard to put down! I've read it many times, and I still can't get enough! I loved it! I recommend it to anyone who's just starting out in the James Bond series."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"A disappointing novelization. It doesn't do justice to the film's witty and thrilling screenplay. The prose lacks vividness: take, for example, the dramatic scene where Bond discovers the dead Paris Carver in his hotel room. We're simply told that Bond is &quot;overwhelmed with shock, grief, and anger.&quot; No authentic drama is created.The novel also spends too much time explaining the obvious: &quot;The world's business and all news reporting depend upon communication satellites, for without them modern civilization would be crippled.&quot; As if we didn't know that! Indeed, such passages insult the reader's intelligence. To make matters worse, the novel doesn't work as a thriller because it lacks suspense. There are no dynamics in the action narratives; instead, we encounter boring, clunky sentences, as shown in the BMW car chase scene: &quot;The first sedan exploded spectaculary, and the second plowed into its rear with a resounding screech.&quot;Like his 00! 7 inauguration, the dismal &quot;Zero Minus Ten,&quot; Benson takes pleasure in displaying his Bondian knowledge to readers. In the love scene between Bond and the Danish linguist, we find references to Fleming's Bond (his school days in Eton) and Sean Connery's Bond in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (the business about Bond studying Oriental Languages at Cambridge). Unfortunately, the principle readers of this book (Bond fans) are already familiar with this information. We therefore encounter nothing new about the Bond character. Hence, the novel has really nothing to say.To forget this nonsense, I had to leaf through Master Fleming's &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;From Russia With Love,&quot; two of the best James Bond novels."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"I have Loved The James Bond Movies, and I have almost seen all, ( Well maybe not Casino Royale ) But Raymond gives this book with information, it tell what happens, how, when,where and why.

This is the Bible we are talking about here, not which translation of Dostoyevsky capture's the essence of the author's work. The review by Trevor Jenkins below is unfair. It most certainly would not be good for Martin to endorse a translation. He picks on the NIV because it has become the de facto standard. This is the point. He is trying to steer us back to high standards when choosing a translation. The NIV doesn't cut it with the exception of &quot;readability&quot;. But that should not be the main criteria. Accuracy should be, and Martin does a good job of supporting his argument. Should be read by all thinking Christians."},{"Title":"Accuracy of Translation: The Primary Criterion in Evaluating Bible Versions With Special Reference to the New International Version","review":"...and Martin hits the nail on the head. This' a short book but should be seriously considered by all believers.If a translation is to be accurate, it must translate the words God used. Given that there is no perfect translation, some are better than others because of how they translate the words God used (and what manuscripts they use). In particular, on the issue of what Bible to use in churches for worship, teaching and for public readings, etc., Martin rightly points out that the more accurate the words are translated the better. Otherwise, the doctrine of inspiration is not being upheld. Still, he does not explicitly support one version over another (and even has an appendix with serious questions about the 'KJV only' stance).On a more personal level, the issue he applies to Bible translations applies to all of us is - do we choose the Bible we like or use for some subjective reason or is it because it best fits with the doctrine of inspiration? Indeed, do we consistently apply the doctrine of inspiration to all areas of life? God has used this book to open my eyes to the necessity of doing that more than any other (apart from the Bible itself).- Mark"},{"Title":"Accuracy of Translation: The Primary Criterion in Evaluating Bible Versions With Special Reference to the New International Version","review":"This is simply the best book out there on the subject of Bible translation. It debunks the myth that we need (or should) dumb down the Bible. All you NIV addicts (as I once was) should read this."},{"Title":"Accuracy of Translation: The Primary Criterion in Evaluating Bible Versions With Special Reference to the New International Version","review":"Reviewer Trevor Jenkins seems to condemn Robert Martin as a proponent of Formal Equivalency, as if being a proponent of Dynamic Equivalency sets you on a higher plateau in regards to translation philosophy. The theme of Martin's book can best be summed in his sentence, \\"The dynamic equivalence translator tends to be relatively unrestrained in his theologizing. What a formal equivalence translator generally does only as a matter of necessity, the dynamic equivalence translator often does as a matter of choice.\\" Consider an example. Proper names should be translated formally. No one thinks of substituting Jerusalem for Washington. Yet where Gehenna shows up in the NT (a Greek equivalent of the Hinnom Valley in the OT), the NIV translates it as *Hell*. This is interpreting the text, not translating it. (The same can be for Hades and Tartarus.) There are about 11 words used in the English Bible for *Lord*, but the NIV translators refuse to translate the proper name Jehovah/Yahweh, and the reason given in a private letter was a profit motive. So accuracy (and integrity to the source text) is indeed lacking in the NIV, and other &quot;Dynamic Equivalent/Paraphrased&quot; Bibles that have followed suit. Use the NIV, or any other DE translation, but only with a FE/Literal translation close by."},{"Title":"Accuracy of Translation: The Primary Criterion in Evaluating Bible Versions With Special Reference to the New International Version","review":"This book is concerned with the popularity that the NIV translation has acquired over the past twenty years. Dr. Martin gives strong argument for his perspective, which will make the reader consider if the NIV, TEV, or NEB are appropriate translations for a serious student of the Bible.Dr. Martin gives numerous examples of the insidious nature of a translation that uses &quot;dynamic equivalence,&quot; a method which the NIV resorts to quite often. &quot;Dynamic equivalence&quot; is a way of translating the Greek text &quot;idea by idea&quot; instead of &quot;word by word.&quot; Superficially, this method of translation sounds very appealing to a student who is beginning to study the Bible, but Dr. Martin perspicaciously points out its dangerous effects, namely that this method of translation necessitates that the translator become an interpreter of theologically important issues. Dr. Martin assesses the issue fairly: &quot;While dynamic translations have their value, they should not be used as . . . the standards by which we derive our personal or corporate theology.&quot;Throughout the book, there are many examples of the inadequacies of the dynamic equivalence method of translation. There are also some excellent studies of selected verses of the Bible.In summary, this book is important for anyone who desires to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of Bibles that use the dynamic method of translation. It is by no means an exhaustive study of the material, given its brevity, but it does deal with the important issues well.I plan on giving a copy of this book to some of my acquaitances who use the NIV Bible."},{"Title":"Accuracy of Translation: The Primary Criterion in Evaluating Bible Versions With Special Reference to the New International Version","review":"The author attempts to check the &quot;accuracy&quot; of translation of the New International Version. However, he is not clear as to what his criteria of accuracy are. After a very hurried and yet opaque discussion of the two extremes of translation formal and dynamic equivalence Martin focuses upon the intent of the translators of the NIV itself. It soon becomes obvious though that Martin is himself a proponent of formal equivalence. He is very disparaging of dynamic equivalance as a concept and resorts at one point to calling it paraphrase. There is none of the excitement over translation that there is in, say, Phillips' &quot;A Ring of Truth&quot;.Martin would appear to be a cessationist from the references he cites, e.g. Warfield. His understanding of doctrine is at times bizare. For example, his version inspiration of closer to Islamic dictation of the Koran than to Godly inspiration.The most disturbing sentence in the book, when talking of formal equivalence is &quot;we do not, however, encounter passages which cannot be understood by the average literate adult Christian who is willing to make an effort to study them&quot; (p20). Martin suggests that the average Christian has better reading ability than the average man. Given that 97% of (British) people are habitual non-readers this is a hard claim to swallow. He goes on from this statement to assert that the Bible should not be made easy to read; this despite the comment earlier in his tirade that Koine Greek was the common man's language. The conclusion of such an argument as his is, of course, that every Christian should be fluent in Koine Greek themselves and there by eliminate all necessity of translators.Martin castigates the NIV translators for having their own &quot;favoured interpretation&quot; when deciding to add (or omit) words in the text. However, for this to stand we must be clear that Martin himself therefore also has a favoured translation but he is not couragous enough to tell us what that is! In his critisms of the removal of technical terms he makes the statement &quot;familar (and more accurate)&quot; but without justifying that assertion.At the start of the book Martin quotes J Gresham Machen by saying &quot;the differences between the manuscripts is 'infinitesimal in comparison with what they have in common'&quot; and yet he goes on to make point out the similar small differences in the NIV wording. A glance at an edition of the Greek New Testament (e.g. UBS4, NA27 or earlier) will show the minutia that both Martin and Machen ignore. Worse perhaps is that Martin implicitly argues for a KJVish dialect of English as the only correct wording. The is not quite a KJV-only tirade but that thought is close to the surface the entire time.Martin says that the NIV translators indulge in unwarranted paraphrase but in most of the examples he cites (ad nauseum) what he calls &quot;paraphrase&quot; would more correctly be called modern English. He prefers stilted and arachaic English that is nothing better than transliteration of the Greek text into English words. Despite his suggestion that the removal of technical terms makes the resultant text hard to read it is actually this extereme literalism that makes the Bible text difficult to read. Martin's style of literalism only obfuscates the text rather than clarifies it. One random example is that he prefers the expression &quot;did not know her&quot; (in Matt 1:25) over the NIV translators choice of &quot;had no (sexual) union with her&quot;. Such an expression as &quot;knew in the Bible sense&quot; can only be considered quaint by any modern reader.Throughout Martin mentions linquistic principles. However, it is clear to even those with the minimum understaning of such principles that Martin is not one of them. He seems unaware of the work underlying either Mona Baker's on translation in general (In Other Words) or of the excellent summary from Cotterell and Turner of the application of linguistics to Bible interpretation (Linguistics and Bible Interpretation). Although both these books post-date Martin's by only a little while the material that they cover would have been available to Martin. Overall his tone is strident hardly an attribute of a man of God and not exhibiting &quot;speech seasoned with salt&quot;.Does he prove his point about the (in)accuracy of the NIV? No, I don't believe that he does. He does not make the case for formal equivalence over dynamic equivalence. I cannot recommend this text to a general audience. The appeal of the book will be limited to only two groups of readers: those who are already presuaded of the same position as Martin and those involved in translation work as a warning of the critisms that their work will be subjected to."},{"Title":"Ancient Egypt (Crash Course (Libraries Unlimited))","review":"This pocket book would be my first recommendation to an interested archeological layperson who has an interest in, but no prior knowledge of, ancient Egyptian society, art, history and religion.

Musical taste is far too subjective and there simply are too many records to choose from--no one has heard everything! But, as Colin Larkin stated in his intro, it does accuratley reflect on current popular public opinion (over 100,000 votes contributed from &quot;critics, journalists, and...the fans&quot;--that's a pretty decent poll, wouldn't you say?) I do have a couple of complaints, though:1. There is too much emphasis on music primarily appreciated by British audiences (e.g., Primal Scream, Manic Street Preachers, Pulp, Suede, etc.). I understand that the book tries to assign equal weight to the musical tates of both countries, but if you're going to do that, why not poll Japanese people as well...that would significantly change the shape of the list also...2. Don't get me wrong--I love the Beatles--but FOUR of the top 10 slots (including 1, 2, and 3)?? It either shows that people really do love this band tons more than any other or simply that people follow trends.3.

Ms. Reeves also helps the reader to avoid common errors of judgment when attempting to size up those who interact with, or appear interested in, children. She provides valuable tips on what signs to look for, that make it easier for us to recognize and analyze certain behaviors in potential child molesters or pedophiles. I especially appreciate the way she clarifies that women are child molesters and pedophiles too. Precious little information is available to the public about female child sexual molesters; too many people still believe women don't hurt children the way some men do.

Though I am now retired, I still read a great deal on matters related to various types of violent crime, victims, and the justice system. Without question this book is the most comprehensive I've ever seen, and it's a quick read. It's very straightforward and written in a down-to-earth manner. Most important, it looks at every conceivable aspect of child sex abuse, (and some things of which even I was unaware). For example, though I new that the concept of \\"reunification\\" of an abused or neglected child with the offending parent was a common goal in social service as well as judicial circles, I had no idea that it was a federal mandate. I am also painfully aware that it rarely works. Sadly, many children die every year in this country because they were reunited with the wrong parent. Reeves discusses in her book why reunification must be stopped, and how to go about doing it.What I liked most about the book is that private citizens as well as professionals can benefit from the vast information contained in the pages. Reeves doesn't simply identify the problems and leave the reader feeling overwhelmed and helpless, she offers step-by-step advice on exactly what (and what not) to do from the moment abuse is suspected. Lastly, she offers adult survivors of child sex abuse the hope and encouragement they need to start healing and \\"reclaim\\" the life their abuser stole.I highly recommend this book to not only professionals who have chosen to work with children, but to anyone who cares about our children, our future."},{"Title":"ChildHood: It Should Not Hurt","review":"This book deserves a long lease on life and should be studied in schools.Reeves is a no-nonsense child advocate with decades of experience both in and outside the court system. When she shoots from the hip, people listen.Readers will discover a no-nonsense approach throughout her book and won't need a PHD to understand it! Reeves describes the quagmire of the court system and social service agencies that so often fail and drop the ball.Often, with books on child abuse and especially if written in a memoir format, the author's message will involve some form of forgiveness of the perpetrator as she or he rides into the sunset 'happily ever after'. How I wish it were that simplistic. Unfortunately, the message that many of these 'Mother Teresa complex' self help books deliver looks good in print but fail to provide victims, survivors and concerned citizens with concrete help and practical guidance. Fortunately, Reeve's book delivers the right stuff."},{"Title":"ChildHood: It Should Not Hurt","review":"Forget about monsters. Forget about ghosts. You can even forget about the latest horror movie full of blood, guts, and teen exploitation. The most frightening book I've read in years has to be Childhood: It Should Not Hurt!Claire Reeves recounts true stories of incest and childhood sexual abuse and uncovers some of the myths and unsettling truths surrounding the issue.Do you think you could \\"spot\\" an abuser? Read this book then ask yourself again. You probably already know at least one abuser--and at least one victim.Reeves may not be a great writer, but when she writes about incest and childhood sexual abuse, you feel every ounce of her passion and compassion.When I first reviewed this book for my own newsletter, I rated it 3 out of 5 because I was focused on the writing.

I can't think of a single person who couldn't benefit from this book. Abuse is abuse regardless of where it comes from (family, social workers, the system itself, ignorance, etc.) and the effects of that abuse has devastated lives nationwide. No one comes away untouched. What a great tool for all of us. Thank you Claire. This book should be required reading for any 'professional' dealing with children."},{"Title":"ChildHood: It Should Not Hurt","review":"This writer has a clear view of the multisysytem problems that impact the victim and families of the victims of child abuse. Reeves is courageous in sharing her insights, knowing there will likely be negative feedback from the accused, the guilty and the cowards.It will be tremendously rewarding for victims and their families to see that they were not crazy, but that the system is so wrong, so far off base and so contributing to the traumatization of the victim.Reeves' career has likely just begun in that she will be flooded with an enormity of requests for her undaunted assistance.Hopefully Reeves will succeed in educating the therapists, doctors, and anyone who treats this population, will give them courage to stand up for the needs of their clients and to the system that continually fails them. Perhaps Claire's work will sufficiently embarass the judicial system that fails to protect, that wears out the protector and returns victims to their perpetrators. Maybe her honesty will offer rehabilitation for the whole system from police to Judges, doctors to therapists, and above all, the perpetrators.While her disdain for such heinous abuse is quite clear, so is her understanding of the cycle of abuse. There is at least some hope her compassion for victims will reach those who have gone on to be perpetrators and they will seek and get the help they need.I have never read any book or article of any kind that so eloquently and realistically describes the cycle, system and generational supports of abuse and offers hope through her candor.Five stars all the way around for Claire Reeves.

This parent was concerned because I have 2 children. I assisted this parent in reporting on behalf of her son. Then, I was left with nothing but the possibility that something might have happened with my 3 year old daughter who had spent so much time with this young teenage girl in question. The only thing for me to do was arm myself with education.I searched on Amazon.com & found, purchased & read your book. As an adultsurvivor of child sexual abuse, I had no intervention or support & was at a loss as to where to begin. Your book really saved me, taught me & educated me. Then, only a few weeks later after reading your book my 3 1/2 year old daughter disclosed to me that she was being sexually abused by this teenager.Had I not read your book, I would not have had the education or knowledge to assist my child. I knew to believe her, support her, not over question her all from your book. I was repeatedly told by professionals that they were impressed with the manner in which I handled the disclosure.Over the course of the last few years, I have advocated heavily on my daughter's behalf. In May of 2005, I joined the Vermont Victim / Survivor of Crime Council as a board member. There have been many agencies & parties that I have worked tirelessly with to try & change existing laws which DO NOT support children.I wanted to thank you for writing & educating so many people. You have really made a difference in my life & the life of my now 5 year old daughter.Lori Nadeau"},{"Title":"ChildHood: It Should Not Hurt","review":"Claire writes easy to read accounts of the injustices in what we call a \\"justice system\\".

First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"I had this years ago, and enjoyed it very much again.A ** MUST HAVE ** in the library.Eternal Truths for first steps into the inner-court."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"The author posits a simple explanation of three major themes in Ephesians - \\"sitting,\\" \\"walking,\\" and \\"standing\\" with God.

That is what this book is, it is a small book but it is very profound. In a nutshell, Mr. Nee is saying, FOCUS ON THE SAVIOR AND NOT THE BEHAVIOR. He is saying to stay focused on Jesus by sitting at His feet(staying in His presence), then walk with Jesus through obedience and outreach, and stand on the Truth (Jesus) in order to stand against the wiles of the devil and our sinful propensities.The first part: sitting is resting in Jesus and we absolutely MUST rest in Jesus and focus on Jesus and seek to dwell in His presence. Many Christians fail in this area and it is the first and foremost place that a Christian must achieve.True Christian work which most people strike out on their own and do what they want and call the work, the will of God but Mr. Nee emphasizes that True christian work focuses on:1. The true revelation to our heart of the eternal purpose of God.2. All divine work/purpose must be conceived by God3. \\"All work to be effective must depend for its continuance upon the power of God alone.\\"4.

I would recommend it to everyone who wants to know how to live life with God simply and lovingly."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"Though this is a small book, it contains powerful insights for those seeking a closer relationship with our Savior. I am giving copies to friends for Christmas."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"Sit, Walk, Stand is a short book which aims to treat the progression in Ephesians from our relationship to the completed work of Christ, the nature of our growth and action in the world, to the spiritual warfare in which we make use of the authority we possess in the name of Christ. Each step in this progression makes use of a single word to cement the concept:1. Sit describes our position of dependence on the complete work of Jesus, which provides foundation for the remaining steps.2. Walk describes the action of conforming ourselves to Christ's image, living with the full understanding that our old self is dead and buried in Christ; that we are new, with the power based on our position to respond to God's voice.3. And finally, Stand declares our position of victory and the need to recognize that spiritual warfare is executed from that position of victory - an act of holding the ground Christ has already won, not allowing Satan to gain territory in our lives, and approaching prayer with faith based on our understanding of God's will and our conformity to it.Nee's text is easy to read, and his wording well-matched to the topic. With his insight into the work of Christ, he is able to bring a number of metaphors and images together into a complete package. Though the book is quite short, in just a few words Nee is able to explain our life in Christ better than most other more \\"wordy\\" books on discipleship and spiritual growth. And the pastoral experience of calling believers into a deeper commitment to Christ seeps into the pages calling for practical response to the Bible and the word of God. This is not a heady or theoretical treatise on discipleship or the Church. It is a directed infusion of spiritual energy into the bloodstream of the church.I am overwhelmingly impressed by his use of illustrations in this book. In many cases, illustrations intent on shedding light on Biblical truth lack the power to move texts forward. Too many authors offer illustrations that share too much detail, causing the reader to lose the simple truth needing to be expressed. And too many illustrations are simply too complex to really do justice, or have lost something in transmission from source to page. Nee's illustrations are powerhouses, concise little motors that propel the reader on to understanding. One example that was particularly striking is on page 21:\\"A brother in South China had a rice field in the middle of the hill. In time of drought he used a waterwheel, worked by a treadmill, to lift water from the irrigation stream into his field. His neighbors had two fields below his, and, one night, made a breach in the dividing bank and drained off all his water. When the brother repaired the breach and pumped in more water his neighbor did the same thing again, and this was repeated three or four times. So he consulted his brethren. \\"I have tried be patient and not to retaliate,\\" he said, \\"but is it right?\\" After they had prayed together about it, one of them replied, \\"If we only try to do the right thing, surely we are very poor Christians. We have to do something more than what is right.\\" The brother was much impressed. Next morning he pumped water for the two fields below, and in the afternoon pumped water for his own field. After that the water stayed in his field. His neighbor was so amazed at his action that he began to inquire the reason, and in course of time he, too, became a Christian.\\"With such a compelling image he was able to show the difference between seeking what is right or just, and seeking Christ himself. Such a walk that puts Christ as our guide, rather than rules, requirements, expectations of justice and fairness won't be met by all with approval, but I think is a compelling response to a worldview that clings to its \\"rights\\" and exalts in the special status of being a \\"victim\\".And while this book was written in shortly after World War II, I was struck in a number of places by the ease with which Nee's text could be translated to the world today. Written in a time of greater openness to the gospel in China, before the political upheavals that pushed the church underground, there is much that finds proximity with our own time and place:\\"Too many of us are caught acting like Christians. The life of many Christians today is largely a pretense. They live in a \\"spiritual\\" life, talk a \\"spiritual\\" language, adopt \\"spiritual\\" attitudes, but they are doing the whole thing themselves. It is the effort involved that should reveal to them that something is wrong...\\" (p. 27)Nee brings Ephesians home, illustrating vividly our position in Christ, our call in Christ, and our victory in Christ."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"This study on Ephesians was apparently based on a series of lectures Nee gave in Europe during a trip there. Unlike the later, plain cover books written in his name during recent years, this book is authentic Nee. His teaching is clear, balanced, practical, and DEEP. But unlike the spurious Nee books of recent years, the teaching is also balanced and biblical. Gone are the super-spiritual speculations. This is pure grace lived out in radical obedience. The last chapter tells a story so cool it makes the whole book worthwhile. Great book to read with young Christians.- Dennis McCallum, authorOrganic Disciplemaking: How to promote Christian leadership development through personal relationships, biblical discipleship, mentoring, and Christian community"},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"This is an excellent and insightful little book based on Ephesians. It shows how a Christian is called to accomplish all by trust and rest in Jesus' already completed work on the cross. When we know how to sit (in heavenly places) we will be able to stand before the enemy also. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"While I agree with the other 5-star reviewers, perhaps a different perspective would be helpful.Nee shows that in Ephesians Paul presents the basis for our Christian life, is for us simply to ACCEPT that through Jesus, God has ALREADY \\"seated us with Christ in the heavenlies.\\"Nee shares this RADICAL understanding: once we have accepted that God has already given us our identity, we are released from the need to strive to be \\"better\\" Christians: our Christianity flows naturally from our new identity with Christ.Nee goes on to say that once we accept that we \\"sit\\" with Christ, our life (the \\"walk\\") in the world will be the Christian life. Then, Nee shows from Ephesians, we will be prepared to \\"stand\\" -- that is to resist Satan.What this requires of us is FAITH -- the belief in things not yet seen.Sometimes when I taught adult Sunday school, I would place a five or ten dollar bill in front of the class, and tell them that it was a gift to anyone who would pick it up. Sometimes no one would take it. A couple of times the recipient wanted to return it. This was an object lesson, whose point is that a gift is utterly useless to us if we do not pick it up and use it. God's gifts are just like that. When he seats us in heavenly realms with Christ, this does us little good until we accept that this really is our position in Christ. We did not earn it. We cannot earn it. But it is the gift God wants us to have and live in.After reading Nee and Ephesians, it became clear that the New Testament used several images to convey the same reality of being seated with Christ. Jesus' images of the vine and the branches. \\"We have the mind of Christ.\\" \\"We are dead to sin.\\" \\"You must be born again.\\" Etc., etc. They all describe the same reality -- the reality Jesus prayed for in John 17, that we be one with him and with each other.Most of us, never having read Nee, would agree that Jesus has done all the work; but then almost all of strive to be \\"better.\\" No striving needed: just a big dose of the faith which is the victory that overcomes the world."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"You can hardly go wrong with Watchman Nee. This book changed my life when I read it a few years ago. I have reread it since because it is good to review. Based on Ephesians, this book clarifies some misconceptions a lot of Christians have about the Christian life. It is not what we do for God but what he has already done for us. Sit: as believers we must see ourselves as seated with Christ in heavenly places. Walk: we walk by faith just like we were saved by faith--no striving involved. Stand: we stand in faith, not looking for victory but as already possessing it because Christ has obtained it."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"This book is very small, but it packs a heck of a message for the limited amount of space it uses. All that this book does is pick apart the book of Ephesians from the Bible.

This work is such a nice balance between an exegetical verse by verse analysis of Ephesians and truly devotional fleshing out the implications of that study in a very applicable way. He has real insight into how we must first understand our position in Christ and how we rest in His salvation in order to work it out in our lives. I think he really nails what Paul is getting at, and yet leaves you with his own deep understanding of the implications of that worked out in our lives. I wish we had more modern day Christian thinkers like him, who expressed themselves so well. His work is truly theological but does not come off a dry or purely rational work. It is a real example of how our reflections should lead to our obedience."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"While the book is only 78 pages long, the content is deep and the principles are life changing. It's amazing that such a small book can hold so many \\"Big Ideas\\" about living as a Christian. This is not your typical Christian book, that sounds great, but leaves you wondering how to actually apply its principles in every day life. This is not your typical author who takes their time getting to the point. He's to the point and every point is profound from page to page. Nee's discussion of this expression, these three little words, provides a great framework to live by - Sit, Walk, Stand.

What a committed Christian who provides his wisdom with us."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"Sit, Walk, Stand is based on the three key words which divide the book of Ephesians into its basic sections. Our position in Christ is one of sitting, our life in the world is one of walking and our attitude toward Satan is one of standing. The Christian's entire life is to be founded and lived out from the finished work of Jesus. In it's 78 pages the book concisely sums up a massive amount of Biblical theology and applies it to the believer's every day life. Watchman Nee takes the grand theological treatise of Ephesians and breaks it down into simple, memorable and practical statements. \\"Christianity begins not with the big DO, but with a big DONE\\" (pg. 14). \\"The all important rule is not to \\"try\\" but to \\"trust,\\" not to depend upon our own strength but upon His\\" (pg. 38). \\"Our task is one of holding, not of attacking. We do not fight for victory, we fight from victory\\" (pg. 55). This is only a sampling of many profound statements, which have launched hundreds of sermons. The spiritual truths outlined in Sit, Walk, Stand are simple but profound, critical but often forgotten. The book is a great source for reminding us of these truths. Most of the works of Watchman Nee are wonderful. I recommend the novice to his writings start with this one. It is easy and quick to read yet covers the key understandings further explained in his larger volumes."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"This book is great! The more you read the more information you attain. Watchmen Nee does and excellent job defining the threefold division of Ephesians. He emphasizes that first we must sit and find out just where we are with Christ. Next he explains that we must then walk with the integrity of our Lord. Finally Mr. Nee discusses the importance of standing your ground against the wiles of Satan. This book is a must have; It's easy to read, pocket-sized and it abounds with spiritual treasures essential to your relationship with Christ."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"Watchman Nee has been inspiring Christians all over the world for many decades. His Asian worldview informs his Christianity in such a way that he brings a completely different understanding that is refreshing to Western readers able to follow what he writes.In &quot;Sit, Walk, Stand,&quot; Nee tackles the book of Ephesians discussing the Christian's placement in Christ. First, he notes how a Christian must start his journey with Christ by sitting--resting alongside the Savior who has done all the work. And because Christ has done all the work, the Christian is given the peace of knowing there is nothing he or she can add. Walking comes from being seated as the Christian merely lives out the Christian life by claiming his place seated alongside Christ. Our ministry comes via the finished work. And lastly, in standing, the Christian holds the territory Christ has taken from Satan by calling on the name of Jesus and living out Christ's triumph.As with all Nee works, the outright simplicity and wisdom of his writing cuts to the soul and spirit. For those who struggle in their Christian journey, the author's words come as a joyful balm since he shows how we can stop trying to do it all by ourselves and let Christ rule.With so much packed into such a short book, this is a fantastic resource for anyone who wants to find peace in Christ while living out a more vital existence. A must read and truly worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"This book has changed my life entirely. It is very thorough, and is entirely supported by scriptural reference. It allows one to enjoy the mercy of God, and rest in the salvation, bought for us, by Jesus Christ. This book makes one desire to reconstruct the personal methods of dealing with everyday life. It gives step by step instructions on how to live an easier, happier Christian life. It also, at the same time, gives inner peace, confidence and strength, through the teachings in the Bible. It is a great resource for those interested in personal spiritual growth. Watchman Nee was a prolific writer and led a inspirational life. He has a truly unique writing style. His work is both thorough and easy to understand. It is truly a book for the new and experienced Christian alike. This book is rather short, and rather cheap. It is a definite must-have!"},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"Ever since I was a child, I'd heard about Watchman Nee and his wonderful writings. It wasn't until my adult years that I finally ordered three of his books - and I haven't been disappointed. Sit, Walk, Stand is a very simple, yet deeply profound explanation of the Book of Ephesians. The book is an easy read and short - only 78 pages long - but don't let that fool you - Sit, Walk, Stand has more packed into these 78 pages than most books over 300 pages (and it takes 1/10 the time to read!).If you want a book that will give you a wonderful explanation of the Christian life - that will bring to life the Book of Ephesians - then get this simple and profound book. Every college student should have one of these in their backpack, it makes a great gift to a friend - you can even mail this little booklet to a friend far away.My version is published by Tyndale House Publishers and I ordered it online for $5.00.

One reading is enough to utterly convince, and change your perspective forever, but you'll not read it just once. You'll never look at Ephesians the same way again, either!

I picked it up since I was teaching on running away. Before I read the book a mere week before the retreat I had formed a conclusion based on study that the way to stop running away from God, problems, people, was to learn to walk by faith and then to stand (Ephesian 6). But Watchman Nee's brilliant little (only 67 pages) book on Ephesians had me adding in sitting as the critical foundation of it all.For those of you not familiar with Nee (1903-1972), he is one of the leaders of the indigenous church in China independent of foreign misionary organizations. He was also a prolific writer. He was arrested in 1952 and imprisoned for his faith until his death in 1972.Two excerpts to whet your appetite:\\"Only those who can sit can stand. Our power for standing, as for walking, lies first in our having first been made to sit together with Christ. The Christian's walk and warfare alike derive their strength from his position there. If he is not sitting before God he cannot hope to stand before the enemy.\\" (pg. 44)\\"God never asks us to do anything we can do. He asks us to live a life which we can never live and to do a work which we can never do. Yet, by his grace, we are living it and doing it. The life we life is the life of Christ lived in the power of God, and the work we do isteh work of Christ carried on through us by his Spirit whom we obey.\\" (pg. 58)You'll be able top read this book in one sitting...but you'll want to savor it."},{"Title":"Sit, Walk, Stand","review":"I am impressed with the depth of Mr. Nee's insight into the Christian life, warfare and in his breaking down of scripture into both deep and easily understood.

The translation (1) has a flowing literary style that does justice to the rich feel of reading Plato's own prose, (2) is remarkably precise in its reflecting of the original language, with the result that, when one notices something interesting going on in the language of the translation, one will consistently find it is reproducing what is found in the Greek. In both these ways, this is a very trustworthy text--the reader can confidently presume to be experiencing Plato's writing. The dialogue itself--Plato's _Phaedo_--has few parallels for philosophical, literary and cultural depth and importance. It is the conversation Socrates has on the day of his death with a number of philosophical admirers. It is a rich discussion of the nature of knowledge, the nature of virtue, the ultimate nature of reality and especially the nature of death itself. The introduction by the translators is also uncommonly good for putting the reader in a position to read the text well. This is the only translation of the _Phaedo_ that I will assign to my classes. This translation is a fantastic accomplishment."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books. What we know of Socrates comes from contemporary accounts and students, most particularly Plato.Set in 399 BCE, the Phaedo is a reconstruction of Socrates final conversations with friends on the day he died. We do not know when this dialogue was written, but it was probably before The Republic (Plato's most famous work, also featuring the figure of Socrates). Like The Republic, this dialogue features a well developed theory of Forms -- these are introduced gradually here, slowly filling out the details of each step. This develops the story of the caves idea from Plato's earlier work in epistemological, metaphysical, moral, and semantic terms. Plato also advances the 'imperfection argument' here -- the idea that when we sense something, it is never perfectly the thing we are thinking of, and that idea or standard to which we relate what we see, hear, feel, etc. is tying into a more perfect Form.However, the idea of the soul is rather less developed here than in The Republic. The soul is simply mind, or intellect - all emotions are here placed as bodily aspects. This is rather Pythagorean in a fashion, that only the soul grasps the perfect Forms, and so should consist of nothing but reasoning ability, for emotions distort and cloud the perceptions and judgments.In the end of the Phaedo, we witness Socrates drink the hemlock, without fear or trembling, as a philosopher should know the value of life and welcome death with a firm hope. The story is almost religious in nature here.However, there are other possible readings, and this edition opens these up. This translation is part of a series done by the translators and Focus Publishing of the Plato dialogues. It has an introduction and a glossary of Greek terms, as well as a brief bibliography. The translators avoid a clunky translation by doing some interpretative work, but explain their reasonings in the introduction.

The Phaedo preserves the moment where Socrates earned his immortality, forced to commit suicide by the Athenian democracy.Oxford's edition is the only accessible volume to give the Phaedo the individual treatment it merits. Gallop's translation is clear, dramatic, naturalistic, and compelling. Included are an extensive introduction, an outline of the arguments of the dialogue, and copious explanatory notes, as well as a bibliography for further reading.To hear Socrates lecturing his students on the nature of the soul and his assurance of the life to come as the moment of his execution approaches is inspiring and uplifting. As great as any Greek tragedy, the Phaedo recreates a moment where one of the greatest of men shuffles off his mortal coil and &quot;puts on immortality.&quot; A powerful, moving, and transforming read; not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"The Phaedo is a third-person account of the philosophical discussion between Socrates and his friends on the day of his death. Socrates accepts his fate most amicably, arguing that death is the means by which to achieve the aims of true philosophy, for only by escaping the evil of the body can the soul truly acquire wisdom. Socrates renews his argument that learning is in fact recollection, supposedly proving that the soul exists before birth. He also argues that everything comes from its opposite; if death comes from life, then life must come from death. The proofs he offers for his belief that the soul is eternal do not strike me as very convincing.As the account of Socrates' final hours, the Phaedo is a corollary of sorts to the Apology and Crito, but it addresses certain themes those earlier dialogues did not. In many ways, the Phaedo is a precursor to much of the philosophy of The Republic, in which the concepts of the eternal soul and the invisible Forms addressed here are threshed out much more satisfactorily. Given the importance of these concepts later in The Republic and the formative yet lengthy discussion of them here in the Phaedo, this is a crucial dialogue in terms of understanding the overall philosophical arguments of Plato."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"My reading in Plato begun with Parmenides. Which is pity, to think about it, since Parmenides is to this day considered to be one of the most esoteric. Contrast to Parmenides, where young Socrates stands up against this old thinker, Phaedo reveals old Socrates who now discusses things in fully down-to-earth terms. In fact, Socrates at this time is a dying one. And his tragic end is so well presented that it actually reads like a novel. Back to my point, this book is, I think, the most appropriate as a starter. Then you could trace back to Plato's more abstract discussions. Nowhere in Plato's works his conception of the idea is more clearly explained than in Phaedo. This also summarizes Plato's outlining of philosophy. A must-read."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"This book is combination of poetry and philosophy.

That is because this is the metaphysical core of the teachings of Socrates (the main character) as told by Plato. As is emphasized in the text, death is the main topic of concern for the true philosopher- and that is what is covered here. However, there is nothing morbid about it. This is a message of hope, for Socrates establishes the divinity and immortality of the soul. The good man, he who has purified himself through the love of wisdom (Philosophy) goes to a higher, purer realm to be with like-minded souls and the gods themselves. The bad man also goes to his just reward with those of like character._If I was to abstract the core truth here it would be that the true philosopher is always trying to free his soul from the body- for only then is the soul free of the distractions and distortions that can corrupt it and keep it from direct perception of the Ideals (Absolute Truth, Good, Beauty, and Justice.)_You easily see where the Church borrowed so much of its basic theological underpinnings. In fact, reading this work abolishes forever in your mind the idea that the pre-Christian pagans were in anyway necessarily savage or barbaric in their deepest spiritual beliefs. This is spirituality more pure than anything preached by the Church- and it is supported by reasoned argument and not appeal to empty faith and authority._The closing of the dialog is probably the finest depiction in Western literature of the death of a great and good man.

It emphasises the monster in us that need to be slayed to free ourselves. That monster, ie the Minotour, is originated in the opening passages of Phaedo.Phaedo explains why there is a considerable gap of time between the sentencing and the carrying out of the execution. He refers to the myth of Theseus saving 14 people from the monster Minotour.Socrates is the Theseus, he is saving the 14 people who are with him at that time (see 59B for a list of the 14 companions of Socrates). The Minotour is the fear of death and the fear of argument (logos).The book itself is also divided into 14 sections:I. OpeningII.

Though his arguments often make bold jumps that are difficult to reconcile, he does a more than admirable job of molding a logical argument for the existence of the soul, by taking on a number of possible objections to the theory, objections which are both abstract and somewhat scientific in nature. By likening the soul to the Forms, or the basic abstract properties of the universe, he argues that the soul not only must exist, but must also exist indefinitely, due to its very nature. This book is no doubt worth the read, as it provides an exceptional reflection on death and human mortality, and is a great starting point for Plutonian philosophy."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books.

Is the soul immortal? Why does the philosopher seek death but avoid suicide? What is so attractive about death to Socrates?This is a masterpiece of a book. While Socrates does not prove the immortality of the soul, his arguments for such, as in the \\"law of opposites,\\" the \\"theory of recollection\\" and the combination of the two, make way for a very interesting and mind enhancing read and is a hell of lot more valid, intelligible and religiously inclusive than any of the biblical literalist's security hold in fallacious illusion, or was Socrates and Plato infallibly inspired? Was Homer infallibly inspired? Of course not. In turn, Socrates is counter-argued with the \\"theory of attunement\\" and subsequently argues back for the immortality of the soul.His thoughts which entail the body as the inhibitor of obtaining true wisdom, that philosophy aids a man to go beyond his body, so that at death he can be released from the body and use his wisdom to achieve a higher realm of true wisdom, as the body acts as a place of desires that prevents men from perceiving the world of ideas apart from the world of appearances. The death of the body is the release of the soul and the condition of the soul, either that controlled by desires or that of philosophy that has brought it to a higher realm, will determine where the soul travels to after death.Socrates further gives us a description of the round, spherical earth. This exposes the fallacy of biblical literalists who attempt to prove biblical divinity by quoting Job 40:22 and Isaiah for the spherical earth, or does that make Socrates inspired? His further description of the earth's hollows by water and the place called Tartarus brings us to the identical words of St. Paul, who certainly was influenced by many non-Christian teachings, which permeated his entire belief system. Also Socrates gets Eastern in the reincarnation of the soul back to the world of desires, including that of animals and insects, which makes this book a fascinating read to say the least. This book is a gem and great masterpiece to contemplate on. I love Plato - and Socrates too."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"I guess the main idea here is whether or not the soul is immortal.Does the soul exist outside of this physical, earthly experience ?I've only begun reading Plato after years of reading a lot of other new age type books such as the Edgar Cayce material and Dr. Brian Weiss.Plato is often consistent with those new age ideas but he expresses his thoughts in a more poetic way.Plato and those others believed in reincarnation and even being reborn as an animal.A new age theory about this is that if you go back to 10,500 BC and beyond you had a lot of people running around with for example the body of a human being but the head of a horse, tree branches for arms, etc..Most people had tails back then.This was a result of people projecting themselves into this physical dimension and getting entangled in the animal and plant worlds. As they did this across multiple incarnations they started to develop those animal appendages in their physical bodies.It was in ancient Egypt around 10,500 BC that the priest Ra Ta and other Atlanteans helped these \\"things\\" to rid themselves of these animal characteristics.That \\"mystery of mysteries\\" the sphinx is a creature that is part human and part lion. Don't think this doesn't have some very deep and hidden meaning.Another key point in the book is the death of Socrates. He dies like a true philosopher, not in fear, but calmly.At one point Socrates actually proves that one plus one is not equal to two.

According to the authors of the commentary, it is a dialogue written to steel Socrates' friends, and through them us (the readers),for the final inescapable act in life--our dying--and to show through Socrates--his courage in the face of present death, and his words of encouragement to both companions and friends as he slowly approaches death's doorway--that a life lived well (which is what Socrates himself tried to do) is proof enough, or ought to be, against our fear of entering the unknown world that awaits each of us upon our death.The commentators--professors at St John's College--offer an interpretation of some of Plato's symbolisms in the dialogue that is both surprising and deeply revealing. (But I won't spoil things by announcing what these symbols are and mean; you'll have to read this wonderful book for yourself to discover that--and perhaps grow from it,too, as Plato/Socrates would have desired.)I have read this dialogue, in other translations, more than 20 times, at least, since college--yet surprise after surprise greeted me as I read through this truly insightful introduction. The authors ought to be given the ancient Greek Olympic prize (free food for life) for their brillance and insight. It is indeed an \\"Olympic triumph!\\" In brief, this is a dialogue--cum commentary--which any thoughtful, inquiring soul will desire to possess--and learn from...and remember, as he himself approaches life's final and inescapable boundary."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"This book is organized in a very odd way. Most translated pieces like this (Illiad, Odyssey, etc) have the verses numbered in the margin of the page. This particular piece is organized into a number of sections, something like 90 or more. However, this book did not mark any of them. Also, it seems like this piece wasn't edited at all. Many of the passages have random characters like c& just left in the middle of a sentence. Also, whenever there is a translated verse which has caused controversy among the translating community, the book will add parenthetical statements as long as a paragraph to discuss (in a very convoluted way) the different translations which may be substituted.All in all: I'm really not sure what I bought, but I had to do my entire reading assignment by finding Phaedo online for free. This book was a complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"This translation manages both to translate the Greek precisely, as well as capture the sense of the dialogue. Although the closest studies of a work always require one to read it in the original language, this translation is as good as you can get without learning ancient Greek. I highly recommend it to readers both beginning to read Plato and those well seasoned. The introduction is informative, and Brann's expertise in classical Greek and philosophy shines through."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"\\"Phaedo\\" is one of Plato's best and most important works. Though well worth reading by itself, the fact that it is widely anthologized - e.g., in The Trial and Death of Socrates - makes it very hard to justify a standalone.Though apparently early and not as complex or philosophically influential as later ones, \\"Phaedo\\" is immensely important in portraying Socrates' death. Along with the aforementioned dialogues, it is our clearest picture of the historical Socrates and would be invaluable for this alone. Indeed, I have read hundreds - perhaps thousands - of books, and this is one of my ten or so favorites, mostly because of how moving the depiction of the great man's last days is. The story of Socrates' last moments is part of world literature's very fabric, an immortal part of Western cultural heritage. However, the works have great value even aside from this; a few have indeed questioned their historical veracity. This does not affect their philosophical, literary, and political worth, which is of the highest, making the book doubly essential.\\"Phaedo\\" ostensibly details Socrates' last moments, including his last look at his wife and child, his last dialogue, his last words to friends, and his actual death. A large part of Socrates' image comes from this, and its potential historical value is inconceivable, though its historicity can easily be doubted since the work itself strongly suggests that Plato was not there. Even so, it is likely accurate in regard to the things that really matter and certainly a fine account of how it very well could have been. It is extremely moving; shot through with pathos, it is one of the most affecting things I have ever read. One can surely not read it without being overcome by emotion; I can hardly even think of it without misty eyes. Anyone who respects and admires this central Western civilization figure will be profoundly touched; his famous last words seem comic out of context but are very much otherwise here, telling us much about Socrates and moving us yet further. This would be one of the greatest works of all-time if it had no other aspect, but it is also a fine dialogue appropriately dealing mostly with death. Plato examines perennial questions like the soul's immortality and metempsychosis very thoroughly and thought-provokingly, and the conclusion - unsurprisingly, given the circumstances - has uncharacteristic certainty. It may not convince our cynical, empiricist, science-loving, twentieth century-surviving age, but the argument is certainly well-made and in many ways admirable. The dialogue touches on other important subjects also and is generally seen as the culmination of Plato's early, Socrates-centered thought.The ever-important translation issue must also be kept in mind. It goes without saying that anyone who cares about intellectual issues, especially applied ones, must know Plato, as should anyone who wants to be even basically well-read. However, this is far easier said than done for most; he is so different from what now passes for literature, to say nothing of pop culture, that he is virtually inaccessible to general readers. Yet the importance of persevering cannot be overemphasized; the payoff is well worth the effort. As nearly always in such cases, reading him becomes far easier after the initial difficulty; no attentive reader will ever think Plato easy reading, but he is utterly absorbing once we get used to his style. He has a near-poetic beauty that all agree has never even been remotely approached in philosophy, and such mesmerizing prose is rare in any genre. His dialogues are an incredible form at once intellectually and aesthetically pleasing - an inspired combination that has perhaps never been bettered; many have appropriated it, but none have matched it. All this means that picking the right translation is probably more important with Plato than any other writer. This Benjamin Jowett translation is now quite old but still very accessible; it will work quite well for most, but anyone struggling should try a more recent version. For the average reader, the more recent, the better is generally true. The important thing is to read Plato in some form, and those who happen on a translation that does not work for them should keep trying until their mind opens in a truly new way - and once done, it will never close again."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"I have no desire to critique Plato or to give a synopsis of his Phaedo. What drew me to this review is actually the translators' introduction. Brann, Kalkavage and Salem do, what I think, is an excellent job at breaking down the imagery and themes of the piece while adding a tremendous amount of background. If this were my first encounter with Plato or Greek thought in general, I would find the introduction to be infinitely valuable. For example, the translators point out that Socrates' execution is being postponed due to a celebration. As it goes, each year the Athenians, in accordance to their vow to Apollo, send an emissary to Delos. Before they return, the city must keep itself pure and not put anyone to death. This is to commemorate Theseus' recovery of fourteen young Athenians from the Minotaur of Crete. Now in the Phaedo, Socrates is Theseus, the fourteen present are the same from the Minotaur's labyrinth and the Minotaur represents death itself. Personally, I found that little bit of information both charming and useful. The introduction is jam-packed full of such goodies that will help the reader gain a deeper understanding of this piece than if he or she were to just read it alone."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"If it was up to me to preserve just one of the dialogues of Plato for posterity it would be the Phaedo. That is because this is the metaphysical core of the teachings of Socrates (the main character) as told by Plato. As is emphasized in the text, death is the main topic of concern for the true philosopher- and that is what is covered here. However, there is nothing morbid about it. This is a message of hope, for Socrates establishes the divinity and immortality of the soul. The good man, he who has purified himself through the love of wisdom (Philosophy) goes to a higher, purer realm to be with like-minded souls and the gods themselves. The bad man also goes to his just reward with those of like character.If I was to abstract the core truth here it would be that the true philosopher is always trying to free his soul from the body- for only then is the soul free of the distractions and distortions that can corrupt it and keep it from direct perception of the Ideals (Absolute Truth, Good, Beauty, and Justice.)You easily see where the Church borrowed so much of its basic theological underpinnings. In fact, reading this work abolishes forever in your mind the idea that the pre-Christian pagans were in anyway necessarily savage or barbaric in their deepest spiritual beliefs. This is spirituality more pure than anything preached by the Church- and it is supported by reasoned argument and not appeal to empty faith and authority.The closing of the dialog is probably the finest depiction in Western literature of the death of a great and good man. You truly concur that Socrates was indeed the wisest and justest and best of all men."},{"Title":"Phaedo; (The Little library of liberal arts, no. 30)","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books. What we know of Socrates comes from contemporary accounts and students, most particularly Plato.Set in 399 BCE, the Phaedo is a reconstruction of Socrates final conversations with friends on the day he died. We do not know when this dialogue was written, but it was probably before The Republic (Plato's most famous work, also featuring the figure of Socrates). Like The Republic, this dialogue features a well developed theory of Forms -- these are introduced gradually here, slowly filling out the details of each step. This develops the story of the caves idea from Plato's earlier work in epistemological, metaphysical, moral, and semantic terms. Plato also advances the 'imperfection argument' here -- the idea that when we sense something, it is never perfectly the thing we are thinking of, and that idea or standard to which we relate what we see, hear, feel, etc. is tying into a more perfect Form.However, the idea of the soul is rather less developed here than in The Republic. The soul is simply mind, or intellect - all emotions are here placed as bodily aspects. This is rather Pythagorean in a fashion, that only the soul grasps the perfect Forms, and so should consist of nothing but reasoning ability, for emotions distort and cloud the perceptions and judgments.In the end of the Phaedo, we witness Socrates drink the hemlock, without fear or trembling, as a philosopher should know the value of life and welcome death with a firm hope. The story is almost religious in nature here.David Gallop's translation is good and true to the original (in as much as I can tell from my small Greek learning). It is somewhat tending toward the formal side. This is serious stuff, but in a small number of pages manages to capture much, and this makes it all the more relevant."},{"Title":"Kanji Idioms (Power Japanese)","review":"Kanji Idioms (Power Japanese)is not my favorite book in the Power Japanese series. Personally, I have found the time spent trying to memorize idioms and use them is better spent on learning other things like verbs. However, it is a handy collection of idioms, and because I have been lazily skimming through it over the years, I can recognize many of the phrases I encounter in written and spoken Japanese.THE IDIOMS ARE ACTUALLY USED IN JAPANESE-------------------------------------------For example, just recently I came across gongo doudan '''' in something I was reading. I knew what it meant, thanks to having first encountered it in this book, but if I had wanted to look it up, the entries are arranged alphabetically, so it would not have been difficult.HOW TO USE IT-------------------------------------------It is not an exhaustive list of idioms. I would guess that it only has about 300. More complete collections exist, but they usually don't give good translations, and few actually put them in sentences for you. Take it along with you next time when you head out the door. It fits in your pocket, so you can take it out and thumb through it while you are standing in line or riding the train. It is meant to be read, not put on a shelf as a reference book. Over time, the content actually manages to lodge itself in your brain!"},{"Title":"Kanji Idioms (Power Japanese)","review":"This book has some fun phrases to use. You shouldn't try using them if you're at the beginning level, but it's real fun if you're good enough. I only wish that there were more of them, particularly more four character phrases which come from Classical Chinese."},{"Title":"Information theory and esthetic perception (Illini Books)","review":"Moles talks about an intriguing intersection of Shannon's Information Theory with the idea of esthetic perception. So he goes into the maths of Shannon's definition of information. Thus far, a quite conventional foray into that field. But he then proceeds to apply the formula for information to several original examples.One is to measure what he terms the sociocultural originality of a musical program, consisting of typically 5 compositions. An \\"originality coefficient\\". Where he keys off the known relative occurrences of these works, across many previous concerts.Another example is to measure the complexity of social groups.The book is well worth reading for inspiration in how to apply information ideas to hitherto unappreciated contexts. It was written in the 60s. You might well wonder now, with far more computing power, and with the Web and the rise of social networks, that the book offers an interesting approach to understanding those networks. Unfortunately, Moles died a few years ago, and so we won't see an update to this book, that might have tackled the new environment."},{"Title":"Information theory and esthetic perception (Illini Books)","review":"An important contribution in the knowledge of the image grammar and its applications."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"I am still working through this book, but so far I like it very much. The continuing story through which the reader learns new vocabulary is extremely amusing. It is worth noting that the vocabulary words are not conversational. (Although not many people have conversations in Latin.) For example, the first few words the reader learns are woods, mule, watches (verb), scared, and slow. Or something similar to that.I bought the book with two audio tapes, which don't appear to be offered here. The tapes were the short stories being read.One thing about this book that could be improved is the number of practice exercises. I could definitely have used more of them. Also, it would have been nice if the book had had more straightforward grammar explanations. For example, instead of giving examples of verb endings they could have come right out with a chart telling all the endings for the different categories of verbs. However, the grammar explanations were mostly very clear and easy to learn.I had not taken any Latin classes before reading this book, and did not have difficulty understanding anything. I reccommend this book highly for anyone interested in learning Latin."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"This is an excellent book which provides the reader with a very user-friendly approach to learning latin. Nota Bene, however that the book focuses on Medieval (ecclesiastical) Latin, not Classical Latin (although it does mention it occasionally)"},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"This is one of the least painful introductions to Latin that I have seen. It doesn't assume any knowledge of grammar terms, and it doesn't dump whole declensions in your lap in the first lesson (unlike most of the other Latin textbooks lining my shelves). If you ever thought that Latin looked too frightening to tackle, this is probably the book you want."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"This book is a brilliant introduction to the Latin language. I first bought this when I was fourteen and worked my way through it, and I then followed it up with the textbook Wheelock's Latin: the two together got me admission to Oxford University's Latin and Greek program, into the same advanced stream as British students who had studied the language from childhood and had full A-levels (about an AP in the US) in Latin.Sharpley's book works for two major points: 1) it provides a gradual exposition of grammatical concepts in a manner that is easy and straightforward to understand, and 2) it does so in a way that stresses that grammar is a natural part of language, and even languages that are 'dead' today were living and spoken at one point in time.The book works by guiding the reader through a story which is set in a mediaeval monastery in Northern Europe. This does not, however, mean that the book teaches Mediaeval or Ecclesiastical Latin instead of Classical Latin; the forms used and taught are, in fact, the Classical ones that would have been familiar to Cicero and Vergil. (To be honest, the book really does not delve into areas sophisticated enough for the differences between Classical and Mediaeval versions of the language to be felt.) It introduces grammatical concepts a little at a time; there are few prohibitive complete verb or noun tables in the first sections of the book until the reader is able to develop a firm grasp on concepts of case, tense, and so on. Vocabulary is given in similarly small doses, and the language is presented in as accessable a way as possible. Every chapter also includes selections from 'real' Latin literature (with translations) that are not meant to be fully understood, but rather to be absorbed by the reader.One deficiency with the book is that it does not mark the difference between long and short vowels; while in some ways this makes it easier to 'get a gist' of the language, vowel length will have to be learned in a later textbook because it is central to understanding Latin (even when it is not printed in literature, it must be known). The book does not adequately equip its reader, either in terms of grammar and syntax or vocabulary, to read with fluency either Classical or Mediaeval literature; what it does do, however, is provide a solid introduction to grammar concepts for the student working without a teacher. It also presents an excellent idea of the way the language works, as well as a taste of the richness of Classical (and even Mediaeval) Latin literature.By the end of this course, you should know whether or not you want to go on to study Latin more thoroughly, and be able to understand the grammatical explanations of more difficult and more complete textbooks of the language. It will make the first few chapters of most standard textbooks feel like review, and will give you a sense of power as grammatical concepts lie within your understanding. The book, moreover, will give a real internal grasp of the rhythm and feel of the language. (The cassettes are not really necessary for this; I never had them, and didn't really miss them!)I would recommend following this book on with either Wheelock's Latin (the standard North American first year college textbook, but difficult to understand without a teacher or a good background in grammar, as Sharpley provides) or the JACT Reading Latin course (which is more common in British universities). In either case, Sharpley's 'Beginner's Latin' will provide an excellent and useful gateway to the Latin language."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"I must rave about this book. It does what many haughty titles in this category fail to do, and that is teach Latin clearly and effectively. So deftly does this book lubricate the brain to gently accept this grand language, that I hardly noticed how much it assisted me in learning OTHER languages completely unrelated to Latin. By describing grammar in terms of anticipation - i.e., that our brains anticipate language and whether what we hear makes sense is directly related to our process of anticipation - Sharpley breaks the mold for language teachers. How else to help an english speaker understand the many noun/verb/adjective tense agreements that are so common to world languages, but non-existent in english to any great extent. His pithy insight not only had me understanding Latin from the first pages, but also what to expect in my journey to learn Latin. There are no tricks, and there are no easy answers. However as teachers go, I agree with the vast majority or reviewers here who appreciate the sheer talent of the author to bring Latin to life, one bite at a time. I never felt like this language was difficult or complex, but that is was logical and quite understandable. You cannot go wrong with this book, and once the basics are under your belt (and this book offers more than basics with a quite extensive explanation of grammar and a hefty vocabulary) other books such as Wheelock's will be much easier to conquer."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"This book is EXCELLENT! I was using Baumeister's &quot;New Missal Latin&quot;, but found it to be rather dry (good for ecclesiastical latin vocabulary though). On the other hand, this book is very easy to read and I have made more progress on my latin in the last few days than I had made in the previous months of studying with other books! This book is very well laid out. The rules of sentence structure are given up front, the conjugations are taught in a common sense manner, and the reading exercises are great! Before you know it you'll be reading latin! I would have gladly given this book a higher rating, but five stars is the max you can give! I can't recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"I am a law student. Prior to law school I went through Wheelock's Latin to aquire a basis for the language. Wheelock's is an excellent introduction to the language which I recommend going through before purchasing this book. The beauty of the Teach Yourself book is that it is so engaging, fun, and concise. It is an excellent supplement to Wheelock's because it cements together everything you have already covered and provides a worktape by which you can check your pronunciation. It would be difficult to come away from this book and not have a very solid basis for the language.There is another review here whereby a person claims to have mastered Latin through this course and Wheelock's to such an extent that it got him into Oxford. Having gone through both these texts myself, I have no doubt that this is true. I cannot overemphasize the quality of this course and the extent to which it brought the language alive for me."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"We are using Sharpley's this year for homeschool, and after Latin Primer 1 and Minimus we found this book a bit of a challenge, but well worth the effort. Yes, you do have to study whereas we found our previous courses very easy without additional work, we are actually progressing at a rapid pace with Sharpley's. We are reading and translating in a way I think would have taken several years had we used the standard homeschool products out there. I would recommend using Minimus first for the beginner, but Sharpley's is where your actual progress will begin. It's very exciting. The book is the main part of the study. The tape is only to check to make sure you are reading the story with the correct pronounciation, which in actuality, no one is sure of anyway. My daughter is 7th grade adn some of the extra inserts about the history of the Latin language can be a difficult for her to read, but the actual text is clear for her. She likes the cartoon story and we found a written translation on his website, http://.../She also likes having a teacher with an English accent! Right from the start, Sharpley teaches you how to read Latin using the endings of a word, and you progress into long sentences almost immediately. There is a lot of vocabulary and I really like the way he gives definitions that are not absolute, so you translate more with reasoning than with memorization. Instead of 'you sit', you learn 'sits' and you learn teacher can also mean master, etc. Those are simple explanations, but I think you get the point. I find this to be an excellent course for those who don't want to spend years learning Latin and don't want to spend a fortune on some of the less academic Latin curriculum offered in the homeschool community. This course is more fun, too!"},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"Sharpley's approach to teaching the reader Latin is very clear, and lighthearted.

If you are a table-thumping bigot, either pro- or anti-Christian (I suspect like my fellow-reviewer) then you may not dig the humour or impartial tone this writer adopts in treating the subject in his story. The pagan stuff is fascinating and the Christians are included with warts and all. And it's fun. I've just finished the course and never thought Latin could be so lively. And yes, it fixes on European history, not American, not Japanese. But Latin was an old European language, wasn't it? And grammar ? Well, that is where this coursebook steals a march on its rivals.

The stories about Paulus, mulus, Lucia, and Benedictus turn an otherwise boring book into a fun, hugely comical introductory approach. The illustrations are light-hearted and humorous. After about a week of reading this book and having a prior knowledge of Spanish, I found myself able to roughly decode the Latin Vulgate Bible.The Living Latin excerpts are also highly motivational for people who want ot be able to read Latin classics after going through this book. Also, Roman and medieval cultures are also explained very well in this book. The glossary and declension charts in the back of the book are also hugely helpful.My only complaint about this book is that its binding is a bit too tight, causing it to be a bit hard to keep open for underlining.For a more complete or advanced book about Latin, I would recommend \\"Teach Yourself Latin.\\" The Collin Gems Latin dictionary is also very helpful for Latin beginners. For those who would want to read more basic Latin texts outside of this book, I would recommend the New Testament Gospels in the Latin Vulgate Bible."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"As a major in Latin and then one day going for masters in Latin: Oral Proficiency, it disturbs me that many, at least in the USA, feel that Latin is dead. If it was dead, as they say, there would not be any interest in the language or as many books composed in Latin, either from Antiquity or in Neo-Latin.The glory of this language is that it is \\"dead\\" in the sense that is doesn't change. The grammar is solid and so is its syntax. Thus, once you can handle the grammar and learn some vocabulary, a great conversationalist you can become in this language. Go! Teach others in this language. We owe it to our future generations.Remember, Latin was an oral language before it became written. And like English or any other language, Latin too had dialects. Think of it through the eyes of the Hispanics. There are many different forms of Spanish throughout the globe, but anyone of these speakers can understand each other, even if there are differences in spelling and pronunciation. I do not think that they are calling Spanish dead? So, feel free to pronounce the language as you see fit. Want to pronounce \\"ae\\" as \\"ay\\", go for it; why not. Or, do you feel like \\"vidi\\" to sound like \\"veedee\\" instead of \\"weedee\\", no problem. Or, do you want to use a \\"j\\" instead of the consonantal \\"I\\", as in \\"Jesus\\" vs. \\"Iesus\\"? Sure, you can do that. It is in these \\"gray areas\\" that the language is as alive as English or any other \\"modern/alive\\" language is today. However, I must warn you, there are other gray areas in the language, but what language doesn't? That is where the fun lies in learning a new language.Never let anyone say that Latin is dead. It received this bad rap during the Cold War because Latin wasn't going to get any American to the moon or defeat Communism. Ergo, Latin is not dead; it just became begotten. It just faded away, but is not dead. No, it is as powerful and enriching, as it was when it was first created some 3000 years ago. In sum, learn it; speak it; cherish it!As for the book, this is a great beginners book for a person from 5th grade to age 92. The story is quite creative and grows in difficulty as you learn more and progress further in the book. There could be more exercises, but there are more advanced Latin textbooks that can do that for you once you learn a firm foundation, which this book provides when you finish it."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"Despite another reviewer's statement here, this book's grammar is based on Classical latin.

You end up with grammar treatises that are unsuitable for the beginner. This book is an exception; it is designed for normal human beings to learn latin and a measured pace, in a suitable manner that alows them to learn without being discouraged.The author was very astute in how he laid out his lesson plan, leading the learner to feel like he is accomplishing the language even from the first lesson. That being said, I cannot say his method is flawless. Latin has a very complex grammar compared to most modern western languages. I could have used a tad bit more explanation (or examples) in some of his lessons, although I appreciate he was trying to keep the size of the book down. I also was not into the story he uses for translation exercise, which takes place in the Christianzed dark ages, and is more suitable to Catholics learning rather than those more interested in classical latin. His story is a bit ridiculous, and he could have expanded the glossary of latin terms to include more of the words he uses in the story.His lack of macron use is the biggest mistake; macrons are part of every major latin textbook in the last 150 years, as they are important in determining the meaning of homophones such as Liber & Liber (can't tell the difference without them, can you?) Having beginners study without macrons to guide them can create bad habits, and inhibits learning since long vowels are best learned through example, which in turn requires enough exposure to them. For an academic instructor as the author is, I'm not sure why he let them publish this book without the macrons."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"This book offers and easy and fun way to learn the basics of Latin. It is extremelly useful if you have to start learning from scratch as I did. Its simple but complete content allowed me to grasp the language inmediatly and also falled in love with it. It is definitely a choice for beginners."},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"One of the very best beginner/refresher Latin publications. About the only problem I've had with the book is the British idiom of the text, (e.g., the definition of the Latin &quot;silva&quot; as 'wood' rather than 'forest' or even 'woods'....). This is quite a minor gripe, since overall the book is superb and gently walks you through the process of learning a somewhat difficult language.A compact tome but a mighty learning aid!"},{"Title":"Beginner's Latin (Teach Yourself Book & CD)","review":"I really enjoy this approach to learning languages. Stories are told. They are funny stories that I remember, and I want to make up my own. Mulo silwam spectat. Mulum silwa spectat. That means the mule watches the woods. The woods watches the mule. The mule is a fun character, afraid of the woods, who doesn't like to carry all the bags and food, who doesn't like horses who get to play all the time and never work. It's a fun story that builds. The book alone is fun.The CD is great. I have searched amazon and see no other spoken latin for beginners. This is it. The stories are told by drama actors who do the voices well. Apparently Sharpley also produces plays in Latin, and it shows. Ihave seen a website where you can buy or stream dramatic videos in Latin.

As was repeatedly explained to me in my two undergraduate years in Latin courses, Latin as spoken (aside from ecclesiastical Latin) is a dead language. Debates range on as to how it actually sounded in daily use. My point? It's not a language to learn for conversation, but for literary translation. If you're looking for a conversational language, learn one that's still being spoken in the world today: French, Spanish, Italian, etc. If you want to translate Classical texts, then learn Latin, and don't worry over your pronunciation.

It claims to be both Classical and Medieval, but I could not really find much classical latin inside except some scant quotes that they throw at you which you can't read even after you complete this book!! There seems to be some religious bias here, too. The readings are about some monks somewhere in Europe, and most of the dialogue makes fun of the classical \`pagans\`.Then, using it solely as a grammer review, I quickly noticed there were almost no examples of the grammer.Don't waste your money on this book.

I wanted to get as much exposure to the vocabulary and inflections of the pronunciation as possible. Unfortunately, the audio quality of the tapes made them useless.The speakers, and there are several which provide a wide range of ages and both sexes, sound like they gathered together in a large room and spoke into a single microphone placed somewhere in the room. The level of the audio varied greatly from speaker to speaker, and there was the same emphasis on low frequencies in the audio as you get when taping the audio from a television show on an [inexpensive] cassette recorder using a microphone placed in front of the television speaker.In summary, the audio was unusable for me. Maybe your ears are better than mine, and maybe I just got a bad tape, but my hearing isn't really that bad, and there were a couple of voices who seemed close to the microphone, so I have to blame the recording process.If I'd known that the tape was this quality, I wouldn't have bought the set.

I pray this prayer everyday. It is on my refrigerator as a reminder to pray and thank God for His blessings that He has already promised in His Word to His children. The prayer of Jabez is found in I Chronicles 4:9-10. After the author of Chronicles has gone through the long list of members in the family tree of the Hebrew tribes, he comes to the tribe of Judah. The reader has to read forty-four names of the descendants of Judah's tribe in chapter 4 before the short story, consisting of only two verses that many of us have missed when reading through the Bible, shines through. I had missed this light previously. It was only through the leadership of the Holy Spirit, which came through several Christian friends, that I finally read the book and received the richness of the contents of this Godly prayer. Bruce Wilkinson challenges us as Christians to believe and receive the blessings that are rightfully and legally our own. I am praying this prayer for myself, my family, and my church. I am claiming the power of God in my life which He continues to reveal in and through His people by the workings of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit that gives life to the Word. He quickens His Word in us and the Word becomes alive in us and flows out of us revealing God's power in and through us. Our faith in Him and our belief that He is working in us will motivate us to act upon what He has promised. This action of faith on our part will release the power of God for us and bring about changes in our lives. We will be blessed, indeed and our borders and territories will be enlarged. God will be faithful to keep us from evil that we may not cause grief or be grieved. The power of God is unlimited. Bless us, indeed, Lord. Enlarge our territory - the whole world is God's territory and we are His heirs and joint heirs. He is our Keeper. He keeps us from evil. When we are weak, He is strong. He knows how to stretch us and make us His warriors. If you, as a Christian, are ready for the transformation that God has available for His people, read this book. As Bruce Wilkinson says in His book, &quot;You know beyond a doubt that you were redeemed for this.&quot; I want to encourage God's people to behold the identity that God has given to us! We are not paupers. We are priests and kings through Christ Jesus! We all need to claim our blessings that God has bestowed upon us."},{"Title":"The Art of The Shmooze","review":"I bought this book hoping for some tips on relationship building and was completely satisfied!

You can learn some pool tricks and remember that most people like to talk about things they are interested in and things they like.

This book is the first volume of a two part work. The second volume is 'Lineage of the Absolutist State' Those two volumes cover the whole history of pre-capitalist Western world from Greco-Roman antiquity to Absolutist monarchies. It's incredible how one research could cover that range of time. Moreover, he maintains his distinctive perspective throughout two volumes. His problem is the same one as Marx and Weber posed: the formation of capitalism. But Anderson's problem is somewhat narrower: why did the capitalism emerge in Europe rather than in more advanced China, India or Islamic world at that time? To answer the question, he traces back to Greco-Roman antiquity. His answer in the first volume is this: it's because the West was formulated through combining antiquity and feudalism. It doesn't seem distinctive at all. But he questioned in the line of Marxist tradition and his answer could have meaning only in that line. his terminology is different from traditional Marxist one. He recasts the conventional definition of antiquity and feudalism: he contends that the antiquity and the Western feudalism had idiosyncratic modes of production. For example, the slavery itself, which was the dominant mode of production in antiquity, could be common in that time. But outside Greco-Roman world, the slavery was not dominant mode of production. Moreover, the Western feudalism was formed through fusing totally different modes of production: a synthesis of Greco-Roman society and German society. So features of Western feudalism are restricted to its own context, not catholic ones. If we treat it as universal, Anderson argues, we can't explain why the capitalism merged only in the West. To prove his proposition, Anderson compares the different paths Western Europe and Eastern Europe followed. Furthermore, he redefines the relationship between superstructure and infrastructure. As Braudel maintained with his jargon, longue duree, Anderson asserts that components of superstructure, such as the state, religion, value, law, convention, also affect the mode of production."},{"Title":"Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism","review":"Superb work of Marxist historiography. Not a history, strictly speaking, but an essay on state forms in transition from the ancient slave societies of Greece and Rome to the fragmented monarchies of early medievalism.

It is an informative and opinionated overview of the historical background behind the Austrian School of Economics. The Austrian School began in the 1870s with the pioneering work of the Austrian Carl Menger. The School was focused in Vienna, which at the time was the head of the \\"multi-cultural\\" Austro-Hungarian Empire. (I imagine it wouldn't qualify as multi-cultural in the eyes of today's leftists because of its allegiance was to the crown and Christianity, rather than PC ideology). Although its focus was in Austria, there were significant followers in Germany, as well as some Czechs.The Austrian School was on the side of liberalism (which at that time meant less government) and its central opponents were members of the German Historical School, which supported statist economic policies and was allied with the Prussian monarchy. A good part of this essay is focused on this dispute.The philosophical underpinning of the School was the rationalist philosophy of Kant and Leibniz, with the influence of philosophers such as Brenanto (who influenced Husserl).Certainly Ludwig von Mises was the right man to write this essay. He was acquainted with Menger and was a student of Bohm-Bawerk. He was involved in the controversies that this work addresses. Von Mises wrote it near the end of his incredibly productive life, and I found interesting the pessimism that pervades the work."},{"Title":"The historical setting of the Austrian school of economics","review":"Historical Setting is a good little book for those interested in turn of the century history of economic thought, or with Austrian Economics in general. Mises was in an ideal position to write a history of Austrian economics because he was old enough to be heavily involved with prewar Austrian economics, but young enough to be in the middle of interwar and postwar Austrian economics. Unfortunately, Mises wrote mainly about prewar AE in this volume. My own interest is in the Interwar and Postwar years, so I would have benefited from an extension of this work into at least the mid twentieth century. That being said Historical Setting is still a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Heart Grown Bitter: A Chronicle of Cypriot War Refugees","review":"This work was written by Peter Loizos, a man who at the age of 29 first went to Cyprus to visit his Greek Cypriot father's ancestral village, Argaki, to conduct research in social anthropology. He was raised by his English mother and did not speak any Greek(till after he visited Cyprus) and relates on page 10 how he was an Englishmen in every way but he had a Greek name and was made fun of for this name in school. When he visited his Greek relatives in Argaki and experienced their warm hospitality(philoxenia) he realized being teased for his Greek name all those years was worth it. This marks a turning point in his life, his transformation from an Englishmen with a Greek name, to someone who has a more developed sense of his Greek Cypriot identity.This book describes the social relations, politics and customs of the Argaki Greeks before the Turkish invasion, and afterwards their plight as refugees. Little is written about the Argaki Turks for two reasons, most of the young Turks left for Turkish enclaves of their own will and Loizos did not want to cause trouble with EOKA-B or the Greek Cypriots by interviewing them extensively during a period of tensions. On page 41 according to the census there were 1,219 Greeks and 72 Turks in 1960. With most of the Turks in Argaki being outnumbered so badly and being elderly because so many of their young had left for areas where there were more Turks, the claims of attempted genocide that persist from the Turkish side are laughable, as seen from this village microcosm.The strength of this book is in its anthropological approach, in other areas it is rather weak. On pages 60-61 he rather naively comments that if only Makarios was more conciliatory to the Turkish rebels maybe things could have been different. He ignores that the Turkish Cypriots seemed to have transmitted their historic views of Greeks as inferior Christians subordinated to the sharia even after muslim rule was superceded by the British, and no compromise could be reached for this reason and not because of EOKA-B supporters preventing Makarios from being more flexible as his &quot;wiser&quot; friends suggest. Also too much blame is put on the EOKA-B supporters for the invasion in this book. The divisons in the Greek Cypriot community were fostered by the superior Turkish position in the international arena because Turkey shared a border with the USSR, which was important in the Cold War, and the British playing off the minority Turkish Cypriots during their colonial rule and creation of the 1960 Constitution to prevent Greek desires for enosis. Loizos in this work states that even Makarios supported enosis initially but abandoned this for support for independence, but fails to see how the superior Turkish position in the international arena, the unity of the Turkish Cypriots and the intense disunity of the Greek Cypriots were some of biggest causes of the Turkish invasion. It would have been nice for him to point out how the Communists in Cyprus played a large role in the invasion. The fact is Greece is a small state and Cyprus an even smaller one; every small state more or less looks for a more powerful foreign patron, in this case the USSR or the United States. The USSR, a nation that did not have much of a blue water navy till the 1960s was no alternative as a foreign patron for an island like Cyprus and the Greek Cypriot Communists towing the Soviet line so fanatically(the author takes them to task for subscribing to the Soviet line in crushing the Hungarian Uprising) and Makarios flirting with the USSR and his non-aligned games only enhanced Turkey's and the Turkish Cypriot position, along with the unpopularity of the Greek junta internationally.This review is of the paperback edition which is 219 pages long."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Techno","review":"Tim Barr with the help from some other writers has done an outstanding job on this rough guide.

He does a great, &quot;rough&quot; job, but even so, is very detailed. Artists from Europe, America and Japan are covered. Unlike the Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass, Barr's descriptions are more interesting, more enlightening, and less biased.

It improves with each reading, as more and more of the subtle pieces Ms Loft weaves into the story fit together. In addition to the principle story line already mentioned, I am fascinated with the way all the peripheral characters allude to characters in other Biblical stories. The inn keeper's story seems to be the man the Good Samaritan saved, for example. I can imagine Jesus hearing these stories as a child, and using them later in his ministry. Very believable. For lots of reasons - this book stays with you!

The story of Mary and Joseph is written in their time but as if it was happening to everyday people - hence their honest reactions to the situation are readily identifiable to the reader. The 3 wise men are again ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.

Almost half of the book is dedicated to the conversation about cannibalism as a tool of cultural prejudice -- whether it is applied by colonialist Europeans or Ku Waru of New Guinea.William Arens' argument of cannibalism not existing anywhere else than in the imagination of biased white anthropologists is invalidated more often than once. These dispassionate essays deal with the issue of anthropophagy never losing their scientific calmness. The subject is observed from different viewpoints in different essays.The only thing to complain is that the book is not very comprehensive. It is only about 150 pages thick and it mainly concentrates on New Guinean data. Anyway, it is better than previously mentioned, partly outdated older collection The Ethnography of Cannibalism -- which, it has to be mentioned, is by no means incompetent.Buy this if you are interested in New Guinean cannibalism or the study of cannibalism in general."},{"Title":"Showdown","review":"Flynn's second effort, SHOWDOWN, comes nearly 10 years and a lot of tough times after BEAM ENDS. While the book could have used a hard-nosed rewrite (there are some heavy-duty themes one wishes he'd developed more), it's still a fun read. Flynn tells the story of Seamus O'Thames, a young boat captain recovering from injuries and illness, haunted by a lost love and talked into taking an interesting mix of people up the New Guinea coast. Overall, it's a romantic tale, but there's a slightly disturbing bitterness throughout as well. Watch for Errol's comments about hero Seamus O'Thames' mother, and how the relationship between Seamus and Cleo develops. There's an obnoxious parrot named &quot;Hedda&quot; (as in &quot;Hopper&quot; the 40s gossip columnist)and a bratty child star. As with his first effort, BEAM ENDS, there's a lot of promise here, although the demons are beginning to close in on him. Had Flynn been slightly more disciplined and temperate, this novel might have succeeded critically. But never mind that now; put the Jimmy Buffet on, grab a cold brew and enjoy. Flynn's a great story teller and this book is worth a sunny afternoon's effort."},{"Title":"Showdown","review":"Errol Flynn's life was as fascinating off screen as it was on. He was truly a unique persona, with a wide variety of special talents that were often overlooked or underestimated. I believe he was tremendously underrated as an actor and unhappily pegged into the action hero role for most of his acting life. Perhaps this came naturaly to the studio since Flynn seemed to be a true-life action hero. I find it sad that he was not allowed the opportunity to do more comedy, since he was very good at it and had a natural wit that came through on the screen as well as in the books he wrote. You'll find plenty of it in this book. Though one can see some common threads in the characters and some of the stories in this book and the ones in Flynn's autobiography \\"My Wicked, Wicked Ways,\\" the characters and story lines here are fully, clearly and colorfully developed. Flynn definitely had a distinct talent as a writer. His powers of description are more than enough to make you feel that you are there with these characters and able to take an adventorous trip to places and experiences that most of us, unlike Flynn, will never be able to experience ourselves.I would highly recommend this book, as well as Flynn's autobiography, for anyone with even a mild interest in Flynn himself, or anyone who just has a taste for a good, exciting, well fleshed-out adventure story.Jana S."},{"Title":"Showdown","review":"While the title seems made for a trite western film, this book could be nothing farther from that and is instead a happy surprise for the reader. It is very entertaining and well written. The characters are well-developed and nothing short of colorful.

The author does a fine job conveying the varied emotions of the characters, especially those of Captain O'Thames from childhood through adulthood. There is plenty of action in the book and the plot and subplots move along well. This is a book that the reader will want to read again \\"in case the reader has missed something,\\" and a second reading is just as much fun. This is a solid follow-up to Beam Ends, the author's first endeavor. It is sad that the author gave up writing extended pieces so early when he clearly has the talent and that talent would have been honed with more serious and dedicated production."},{"Title":"Showdown","review":"The second of Flynn's book's once again set against the absorbing atmosphere of the sea, with its insight into the lives of a group of Hollywood stars set against a New Guinea background"},{"Title":"Have a Go: Key Words Reading Scheme 2B (Ladybird Key Words)","review":"&quot;Have a go&quot; is number 2b in a series (1a, 1b, 1c, etc.) which takes beginning readers slowly through the process of learning several new words in the context of everyday adventures.

I believe all of us seek to be better people and to have emotions. It is simply not easy growing up in this fast paced world. We are taught the things we need to succeed in the workplace and lack the ability to have relationships, even families. We are so caught up in ourselves that we often do not care what the problems are around us. We figure if the problem does not directly affect us there is nothing we should do and therefore we sit and let the world and humanity be destroyed. I am hung up on the use of emotions as I feel it is a brilliant idea and one that lacks so much in this world. Perhaps that is why there are increased divorce, child abuse and neglect. This books tells us the reality of people as people and how they interact in society. We should all respect one another and see past differences that will ultimately create seperation and hatred. This book also helps us see the reality of our planet and how we are destroying it for ourselves but more importantly for our offspring. We eventually will leave nothing and life as we know it will be gone forever.

I thought Mr. Krieglstein presented his ideas and hypotheses very well, with much information to back them.

I finished reading your new book a couple weeks ago and found it to be a thought-provoking and very worthwhile journey. I particularly appreciated how readable the text was, making even complex scientific and philosophical ideas palatable and understandable to the general reader. I also enjoyed the interweaving of intensive academic research with recounts of rich personal experiences -- for example, your thoughts on Tony Robbins' seminar and different encounters you've underwent in the world of theater.Under the category of philosophies of the &quot;new&quot; or &quot;third enlightenment,&quot; I think that Transcendental Perspectivism is a viable alternative to some of the New Age concepts that are currently floating around. In contrast to the somewhat illogical, commonly contradictory, and too loosely organized theories of New Age philosophies, Transcendental Perspectivism follows more reasonable lines of thought and is outlined in a sufficiently formal fashion here on your website as well as in your recent publication.Because I am in the process of considering a career in education, I read your chapters on the latter subject with special care and found your description of &quot;the partnership way&quot; to be in perfect harmony with my ideal method of instruction. Thank you for that insightful contribution to the field of education! I will be giving my presentation on education and the theory of multiple intelligences in class soon.I also appreciated your work's continuous challenges of traditional, Western dualities -- i.e., mind vs. body, soul vs. body, reason vs. emotion, etc. Helping people truly perceive themselves, the world, and life as truly whole is an extremely important educational and personal mission to pursue."},{"Title":"Compassion: A New Philosophy of the Other (Value Inquiry Book Series 134)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Compassion: A New Philosophy of the Other.

In his book, however, Remini seeks to address just one side of the controversy: the political. He concedes that there was much good in the BUS from a strictly economic perspective and destroying it without a concrete plan to replace the monetary institution undoubtedly did harm to the American economy as a whole. But, Remini argues, it was the political implications of the War - not the Panic of 1837 or the subsequent failure to adopt central banking in the US for nearly a century - that had the more far-reaching consequences.It has been argued that Jackson was the first modern president. It is undeniable that the power of the presidency took a giant leap forward during Jackson's two-terms and Remini shows that those monumental gains in power came mostly during and because of the Bank War.In particular, Remini argues that the Bank War is directly responsible for three areas of enhanced presidential power: 1) the use of the veto to reject legislation for purely political rather than constitutional reasons, thus inserting the president into the legislative process and, in effect, making his opinion count for two-thirds of both Houses of Congress; 2) even though Remini believes that the majority of Americans didn't support the president's stance on the BUS, Jackson made the election of 1832 a referendum on the bank issue and claimed henceforth that he represented the will of the people and was there one representative; and 3) Jackson's sacking of Secretary of the Treasury Duane for his refusal to remove the government deposits from the BUS exerted the president's right to remove Cabinet members at will, further strengthening the executive's grip over the government.In short, there is stunning agreement between Remini and Hammond on a number of issues. For instance, Remini concedes that Jackson's veto of the BUS re-charter in July 1832 was pure demagogic class baiting with indefensible charges against the BUS's operations. He also rejects the notion that Jackson's re-election was a popular show of support for his attack on the BUS and he credits Nicolas Biddle with running an efficient, although by no means perfect, central banking organization. Thus, on economic grounds, Remini really sides with Hammond. But, Remini maintains, the economics of the issue was a distant second to the politics of issue. The cause of the War was political - namely, Jackson's refusal to bend or even appear to bend to a political challenge - and the most significant results of the War were political. Remini's case is sound."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson and the Bank War (Norton Essays in American History)","review":"Remini comes to the conclusion that the Bank was not all bad, it was simply a political struggle between Jackson and Biddle. I don't agree. It's a good detailed acount of the events, and I'd recommend it for such, but if you're a supporter of hard money (the Jackson position) you may consider looking elsewhere or complementing this reading. I'd recommend Murray Rothbard. He addresses some of the authors (mis)information on hard money in \\"A History of Money and Banking in the US.\\"It's great to read a book about the President actually checking the power of the Congress and Court in a struggle over what's authorized in the Constitution. A President disagrees with a Supreme Court ruling, and actually challenges it. Not something that happens anymore, and that's unfortunate."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson and the Bank War (Norton Essays in American History)","review":"This is an excellent book on Andrew Jackson's battle against the Second Bank of the United States. This is an often overlooked episode in American history and Remini does a very good job covering it. The book is just the right size. The Bank War does not warrant a 500 page tome, but this book is just long enough to provide sufficient depth."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson and the Bank War (Norton Essays in American History)","review":"Today, most folks are getting a glimpse of what happens when banks and governments inflate the currency. As banks began to fail and/or were bailed out by the government, folks began to withdraw their money and once again put it under their mattress. Jackson's dealing with the banks was an important lesson in how to deal with today's economic problems. History does repeat itself and Remini, I believe in part because of when this was written, seems oblivious to the crimes committed by Central banks. Those crimes do in fact far outweigh any good coming from them. The public will be compelled to learn this the hard way. Today's economic bubbles are just the tip, of the tip of the tip of the iceberg. Students that left comments such as \\"boring\\" will be the first ones shocked when the cash become worthless. They should pay closer attention to this debate. I would hope that even Remini knows better by now. I suggest reading, The Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin for a better understanding of what goes on with Central Banks and why we should do away with them and the forced acceptance of U.S. currency in trade. While Jackson stopped the Second Bank of the United States, we must also remember that it was during his administration that the budget was balanced and the U.S. was in the black. Central banking was unconstitutionally reintroduced and we have never, not once, been in the black since. Instead, we have charged our waste and extravagance to all the children and grand children. We are just now starting to see the system unravel. Few Americans know what to do about it. The answer is harsh. Quit borrowing money. If you do, the dollar will become more valuable and things will cost far less than they do today, even foreign goods seeking those valuable dollars."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson and the Bank War (Norton Essays in American History)","review":"It's a hoot to read and as much at home on the beach as in the classroom. Sounds like the one fellow who slammed it in another review here just didn't want to take the course in which it was required reading. (I am very conscious of writing skill and have used Amazon to diss a number of extremely well researched books because they are poorly written. Sacred cows I do not recognize.) Remini takes what should be a deadly dull topic - banking - and turns it into a drama (and comedy) describing the clash between two bone-headed men: Pres. Andrew Jackson and Bank of the United States president, Nicolas Biddle. That clash changed the United States forever. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson and the Bank War (Norton Essays in American History)","review":"Remini's book, Andrew Jackson and the Bank War, is a very good book in the way of information. Although it is not a &quot;page turner,&quot; it satisfies in giving the information. I would not have purchased this book except it is needed for my American History course."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson and the Bank War (Norton Essays in American History)","review":"This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life, therefore making it a waste of my time to read it. I would not have bought the book unless if I wouldn't have had to write an essay on it for my History 1050 class. I do not recommend this book for casual reading, in fact, I do not recommend this book at all. However, if you are involved in History as a profession, or if you are excited by History, then this is a book for you. It provides tons of information, but to me it is all irrelevant. If you are a college student with many other things to do like myself, I will personally tell you right now to leave this book on the shelf."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand's insight is phenominal. Even though this book was written long ago, it is significant in the times we are living today. Good re-issue timing."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am still struggling with this book. Only about 5 chapters in and not finding enjoyment. I promised a friend I would finish the book so we shall see."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"There is much to be admired in the writings of Ayn Rand. Objectivist thinking is sadly missing from a world now dominated by postmodern ideas, and Rand offers a viable counter-thesis to the misguided notions of the subjectivism of our day.American thought was once anchored in a search for objective truth, but is now ruled by a belief in the ABSENCE of objective truth. In We The Living, Rand poignantly depicts the end of the path we are following - and it is not pretty.In spite of the vigor of her objectivism, it is wrongly grounded in faith in individual humans rather than in the designs of the Creator. Worked out to its own ends, objective individualism (Rand's philosophy) leads to the very same desperate wickedness as subjective, collectivism (the Soviet experiment). Rand did not bother herself with this problem, however, because she was satisfied that the &quot;fittest&quot; among us would ultimately achieve theri own happiness - and to hell with everyone else.But even in her own story, we find that such an outlook leads to destruction - not only of society, but of self. Each of hero(-ines) - Kira, Leo, and Andrei, meets an unsavory end no better, and perhaps worse, than those whom she despises.While she accurately portrays the depravity and stench of the lives of so many of her villains, she unjustly vilifies the true heroes of the novel, Irina and Sasha, for clinging to their faith in God. When I read this book, I was an agnostic and a believer in many of Rand's ideas. But in my own search for objective truth, We The Living helped drive me to the Bible - and it is there I will stay!Unwittingly, Rand sets up Irina and Sasha as a type of heroine and hero. Though it could be argued they were not entirely faithful to their religion, it is only they in the story who maintained hope in a greater purpose, controlled by the Higher Being, and as such, only they could truly endure what they were dealt.Perhaps Irina and Sasha COULD HAVE and even SHOULD HAVE done more for themselves and their family. They had as many human flaws as the other characters. But their faith brought them to endure and anticipate a reward for someone greater than themselves - their Creator - and to give themselves up for His glory, not their own, nor that of the state."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was new 60th anniversary hardback.

The characters were typical Rand, cardboard cut outs of humans. The setting in the early post revolutionary Russia is valuable and informative. Rand was a refugee of sorts from this culture and her insights are key to understanding the corrupt and worthless Soviet system. This book will not change the minds of any Clintonite socialist ... It will provide a peak behind the iron curtain for those of us who wondered about the day to day of the Soviet state. In her descriptions of life in the post revolutionary period we see what a farce the planned economies of socialism are. This is not the book that \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" or \\"The Fountainhead\\" was, it is simpler and the theme is less complex. Rand's philosophy and themes were not yet fully developed at this point in her career. It is a worthy read."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The first few pages talk about a government that takes over banking and businesses and takes over more and more and more. It talks about the government getting students involved in volunteering for the government. One of the government projects is telling on people who don't agree with their new policies.It was hard for me to distinguish between history in Russia so long ago and today under Obama's government. I was frightened and still am.Rand ran from this horrific place to America where she never thought this was possible. She would be glad she is no longer around to see it happening here also. History is repeating itself now - different time, different place, same scenario."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I will not critize Miss Rand's more famous novels compared to 'We the Living'.Even though it's far from funny, when this novel was published, critics screamed that she \\"didn't know what she was talking about!\\" That this novel \\"wasn't a true picture of life in the Soviet Union\\". Well, we now know how accurate a picture she'd drawn for all to see, if they chose to look. Not only a picture of the old Soviet, but as she states in her foreword, \\"This is a story about Dictatorship, any dictatorship, anywhere, at any time...and that this novel might do its share in helping to prevent a socialist America.\\" Sadly, today \\"the Left\\" still spews lies, but that's all they can do, having given up the mantle of reason long ago, and \\"the Right\\" is mired in the death throes of religion. We're closer to the precipice than you think.Speaking for myself, I owe such an incredible debt of gratitude to her, for all her written works, that words nearly fail me. This is a brilliant novel, passionately written and beautifully told. Read it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I admit I read Atlas Shrugged years before reading We the Living even they were written in the opposite order. I recommend reading WTL first as Atlas Shrugged is far superior. They are similar in that both feature a heroine involved with two heroes, eventually choosing one in the end.Rand is not shy in promoting her objectivism of the self. She presents her philosophy masterfully in rich narration and thoughtful dialog.I found myself bored in the first half of the book. The second half read faster. I did not quickly connect emotionally with the characters; I kept reading because I enjoyed Atlas Shrugged so much.I did learn about life inside the U.S.S.R. and the dirty politics therein. I wonder if Rand was as familiar with similar dirty politics in democracy and capitalism."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As others have written, this novel is story driven. It's not filled with polemics. Primus Stoves are also mentioned frequently."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I really enjoyed this novel becuase it dealt with something that the author never mentioned in her later two novels: war. It is a heartbreaking tale of totalitarianism and very readable. Since this is apparently a novelization of her life, it made the story even more compelling. One of the interesting things about this book that makes it different from 'Atlas Shrugged' and 'The Fountainhead' is that it seems written in a wholly different style, which is very stimulating. The reader from Los Angeles is correct in that this book does not contain a point by point refutation of Marx' dialectical materialism. Whereas that would come under the purview of theory, Rand chooses to chronicle the practice (of course, the argument is that it was not applied correctly, yet any capitalist will tell you that the United States of America has not had the ideas of the free-market applied correctly for most of this century, due to elements of socialism creeping in here and there). For a critique of the theory of dialectical Marxism I would suggest von Mises' &quot;Theory and History.&quot;"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Have read this three or four times and have never tired. 'Twas a real eye-opener to this native-born American who grew up in a shelterd home in the 40's and 50's. This should be required reading in our high schools. Reads easier than Atlas or Fountainhead."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read the Fountainhead first, then Atlas Shrugged, then We The Living. We The Living is by far the most moving, engaging, and realistic of these novels. How interesting that this was her first novel; written, presumably, before her Objectivist Philosophy had taken full shape, and taken over all other considerations. The novel's strengths lie in the believability of the characters; their motives are human and their actions and circumstances realistic rather than idealistic. I was truly drawn into all of her novels, however We The Living made clear to me the problems in her later novels-- in the later novels, Ayn Rand ceased to consider plot and character as useful ends unto themselves, and began utilizing them solely as mechanisms by which to disseminate her philosophy. We the Living is strong because her characters struggle to maintain the heroic integrity she assigns them. In her later books, the love stories she created lack the passion and innocence (and believability) found in We The Living. If Ayn Rand's goal was to present to the world a philosophy for man to live by on earth, We The Living is the only one of her fictional novels in which the plot and character are believable enough to have have existed on this earth."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book, although is a rommance, is the closest to a autobiography that Ayn Rand ever made. In the time it was written, the book was probably despised, since in those years, the intellectual environment was socialist, and could never accept the views from Ayn Rand. But the truth is: Ayn Rand lived what she wrote, and that is what makes We the Living one of the most reliable and interesting books ever written about the first year of the Communist Revolution in Russia."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is one of my very favorites. Kira Argounova takes you through Russia immediatly following the Revolution. Through her eyes and others, you will see the painful life Communism set for all Russian citizens. Horrific details of the sacrifices people made for eachother, the hunger of the citizens and the dying. Although it is painful to read and finish, it gives you a strong feeling of hope. No other fictatious book about Russia at this time will let you feel with the Russians as this will!!!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"To me, this book was a very big surprise. It was loaned to me by a friend who had borrowed a few of my books and was wanting to reciprocate. When she first gave it to me I was not at all excited, but once I picked it up I honestly could not put it down - even at work sometimes! I had thought her books were very philosophically surreal, but this book was very real and very easy for &quot;non-philosophical&quot; types in addition to those who are constantly in search of a higher meaning. Do keep in mind that it is an emotionally wrenching book, and other than that you need no introduction aside from what is on the back cover of the book. I look forward to reading Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead, once I am able to get over this one and the lessons it teaches have sunk in completely."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is billed as a great philosophical tour de force, a marketing strategy clearly meant to appeal to Atlas Shrugged readers who may have missed her first work. Instead, most of the time it reads like a conventional love story, with many more shades of gray than one will find in her all-or-nothing works like Atlas. This disappointed me."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I love this book. Kira is so much more human and affable than all of Rand's later heros. Yes, it is a youthful attempt and you can tell it. However, the tale is pure passion and joy, without being bogged down with pages of intellectual support of it. You can tell that this writing was closer to Rand's heart, than her brain."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"So maybe I am not the best person to write a reveiw of this book, since I am a big Ayn Rand fan. But of my two most favorite books I have read this one is my second favorite (Atlas Shrugged is #1). This book is one of those I-read-it-all-in-one-sitting-because-I-couldn't-put-it-down books. In one way you could read it as only a love story with a few twists, and what a wonderful story it is in it's own right. However, to explain the characters, to teach the reader, to show this philosophy, it is shown in an easy to read book. While still remaining very in-depth. For people who are intimidated I recomend this: 1- Read this book first for the story. 2- Read this book again for the philosophy. 3- Read it again and enjoy what you have learned. 4- Then you can move on to The Fountain Head and Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am sure the intended purpose of these reviews is to show both the good and the bad of a work. As I read the comments of others, I was disappointed by being unable to find anyone who did not appreciate this book. Surely there must be one? It probably is probably just his luck not to have the internet.But I digress, We the Living is Rand's most digestable work. The reader needs to understand that she was in Russia during the revolution; she witnessed the hardships that took place, and that is why this book is beautiful. It has not been tainted by her theoritical objectivism idealogy. I find it quite a shame that this work will always remain in the shadows of Ayn Rand's other works. Perhaps that is the way she wanted it. We the Living is unlike all her other writings; it is her one innocent novel. Yet to be spoiled by her objectivism idealogy, it simple shows, through a sublime plot, what happens to man when he submits his freedom"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As far as I'm concerned, this is the only real novel that Rand ever wrote. Lacking the soapbox diatribes of her later works, this novel is filled with a savage beauty, deft characterization, and beautiful poetic prose. It is the story of a young woman who must endure the turmoil of revolution and the imposition of a totalitarian state &amp; who ultimately risks everything for freedom. Don't avoid this novel just because you don't like objectivism (this was written before she started her philosophical movement) or you'll definitely be missing out on one of the best novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We The Living is one of the best books I've ever read.

I was born in Russia, and came to the US when I was nine(I'm 15 now). My parents frequently talk about Russia, and tell me about it, especially the Stalin/Lenin Era. This book shows that there is no difference between Soviet Russia and Czar Russia. People lived in the exact same conditions, there were secret anti-government societies, and people were forced to believe that the goverment in always right. Despite all the BS about how &quot;Soviet Russia has a bright future, comerades!&quot;, people suffered just like they suffered under the Czar's rule. I cried when I read some parts, especially the end. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book should be forced down the throats of new-left credit-card communists who still think communism can work if it is applied correctly"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is interesting in light of Rand's other writings and to illuminate her historical perspective. She said herself that this book was as close to an auotbiography as she would get, an autobiography in emotion and philosophy not in exact circumstances. Rand grew up in communist Russia, and the world that she creates for you in this book is as vivid and painful as it must have been for her. The plot can be slow in spots, and you may find yourslef wanting to scream at her main character at times. All in all this is a valuable reading experience if you are looking for more insight to Rand, or communist Russia, or just another good book from this masterful writer"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was a very dark book.

It can happen here!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand has written many great works of fiction but this is the one that most mirrors the events of her life. If the story itself wasn't interesting enough, the publication history provided in this book (dealing with resistance by socialist elements)shows how real the influence Rand was trying to resist was. A great read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"My copy of \\"We the Living\\" says that it's as near to an autobiography as Ayn Rand will ever write. She grew up in Russia during the revolution. It saddens me that countries with such amazing resources would have revolutions that didn't end as favorably as America's. We have the Declaration of Independence and the same philosophies as guided our nation's founders to fall back on. Russia had bread lines and a failed philosophy that still lives on.The book takes place in Russia five years into the Bolshevik revolution and we watch as a bourgeois family is pitted against tidal waves of bolshevism. The party's ideologies are so indoctrinated that people may start believing them. But Kira and Leo never will fall for it. Their lives are tried and hemmed in on all sides. What COURAGE! It is a compelling love story, but not just love between consenting adults, but love for freedom, love for individualism.Along with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", this is an important book for any who wants to see where socialism inevitably leads. Save America!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Tragic, uplifting and defiant Ayn Rand's unique philosophy comes through in its infant form. A must read for all would be objectivists."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"A page-turner and tear-jerker that conveys the immense strength of will of one woman struggling to live a human life, and who falls in love, while under a totalitarian dictatorship. Whatever happens to Kira, her spirit remains uncompromised. An intense early treatment of Ayn Rand's theme of individualism vs. collectivism examined more thoroughly (among other themes) in her later brilliant works."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is a novel that examines the problems of Communism and its ideals, as well as illustrating the people whose lives are impacted by it. It is not only about Communism, however, but also about the fight of the individual against oppression and their struggle for freedom; a common theme in Ayn Rand's books and a core part of her philosophy, Objectivism.I would definitely recommend this book, although not as enthusiastically as Ayn Rand's other novels like The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. We the Living is certainly a good book to reach for if you are looking for an entertaining, thought-provoking novel."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Probably one of the greatest books of the twentieth century, Ayn Rand's &quot;We the Living&quot; is a non-stop course in the early history of society in Soviet Russia. I was extremely thrilled with this novel both in writing and plot. The story is semi-autobigraphical combined with dramatization of the mass sentiment. Rand presents characters the reader can almost feel. Without a doubt the novel exuded depressing elements, but even at it's conclusion you feel a sense of relief. &quot;We the Living&quot; is an easy read, and no matter what your taste you will be glad you read this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is a great book and by far Ayn Rand's best. She wrote it before the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and before she started seeing evil everywhere. The book works because of its context which is Soviet Russia and Rand shows convincingly how communism is destructive of anything valuable. It is not as well crafted as later novels but at least in this case, she's on solid ground and not trying to be a know-it-all."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I've read three of Rand's books and this is by far the best, not because it's the shortest. In &quot;We the Living&quot;, you definitely get a more personal view from the auther. This book is about Kira, a young woman from a once majestic and respected family who returns from spending the more violent part of the Russian revolution in a smaller, less affected town, to find St. Petersburg destroyed. She and her family have to struggle just to survive as Communism becomes vile and corrupted. Later, she must choose between her family and her lover, Leo because of political differences, but when Leo catches tuberculosis, Kira must do things that would make anyone sick. She gives up all her dreams of education and of a suuccessful future, puyting everything she has into escaping the oppresive communists and their tyranny at the end. This is definitely not a light read, but it is a book I would recommend to anyone if you want a painful, but realistic version of the triumphs and tragedies of life itself."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read ATLAS SHRUGGED several years ago in 2004 and I had just finished THE FOUNTAINHEAD right before I started WE THE LIVING. That said, I was gripped up until the very end of WTL by the vivid descriptions of life in Russia during the post revolutionary period of the 1920's. Even if you dislike Rand and her philosphy you will like WTL as a great novel."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"There is so much talk about Atlas Shrugged lately so that will be the next book I will read. However some reviewers recommended this book to \\"get your feet wet\\" on Rand's ideas, and, at 400+ pages, it is more manageable than Atlas. It took me a while to get into the book due to lack of time and the fact that the life portrayed is quite depressing. After about 200 pages though I finished quickly. I got to know the characters and started caring about their fates. It's an amazing portrait of what happens when an all powerful government tries to destroy individualism. Each character reacts differently to this destruction-of-self, but it has a healthy effect on no one. Some embrace the collectivist mentality, some play act to fit in, some rebel in subtle ways, some scam the system, some go underground and join the black market, some plot a counter revolution, some accept their fate with hopelessness.As I read the book, it was also depressing to realize that \\"it could happen here\\". Energy rationing via cap and trade, enviro-nazi regulations, NIMBY policies for energy production, high prices, CO2 limitations, \\"smart\\" grid, computerized electric meters, etc., etc. Medical care rationing including life and death decisions via government-run health care. The end of private property as, post Kelo, the government absconds with property will nilly. Thought control via hate crime legislation, speech codes, frivolous lawsuits against those with non PC opinions, fairness doctrine renewal, etc. Making everyone dependent on the government for everything via nanny statism legislation, high taxation, nationalization of industries, destruction of personal worth via recessionary and hyperinflative monetary policies.In the book, Timshenko (I think) said that thousands of brave, noble men died so that a million bureaucrats could live well. Well that's pretty much what is happening here. It just took us a lot longer to reach this sorry state. After all, a communist is just a socialist in a hurry.I say 4 stars as it is better than average fiction, but it's not Shakespeare. By the way, did I mention that it was really depressing?"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I have read this, Atlas shrugged and the Fountain head. I love all. Brilliant - compeling entertaing and engrossing. Rands novels have not only stood \\"test of time\\", they could not be mroe relevant for readers today.Read for yourself, Think for yourself, decide for yourself...You don't have to like it, But-if you experience and read for yourself the opinion will be formed honestly... It will be your own opinion. My biggest fear is the hightened interest in these consistanly popular novels and Author will bing on media attacks and attempts to discredit."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Thankfully I read this book before The Fountainhead (which I didn't enjoy at all). We The Living is a story about a triumphant woman never giving up on herself, the people she loves, and her dreams.The story was extremely well written and I was transformed to a time and place that I had been previously unfamiliar with. I quickly developed a fondness for the main characters and was anxious to read how things worked out. On a romantic level We The Living was frustrating, encouraging, and heartbreaking. I could not decide who would be a better match for Kira. Leo because of her love for him or Andrei because of his love for her?I highly recommend this book and guarantee it will become one of your favorites."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This novel is very poignant; set in post-Revolution Russia, a young girl on the point of going to University finds herself living in a world she cannot accept.Kira is depicted very well as a very young, emotional and sometimes impulsive woman who loves the wrong guy for the wrong reasons, sacrifices everything for him and learns that a life not lived as one wishes is not worth living. The tragic character of the Communist official Andrei is incredibly well-done.This book is a bit raw in places, showing the deep feelings that Rand must have experienced as she re-lives the world she left behind along with a family she never saw again. It is not as well-crafted a novel as The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged, but it is the most deeply emotional thing Rand ever wrote and well worth reading."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\" \`Society, Kira, is a stupendous whole.' \`If you write a whole line of zeroes, it's still- nothing.\\" Chapter 3; Kira and VictorThis quote sums up Kira's attitude about the Collective, and mirrors author Ayn Rand's attitude on it as well. We the Living is a novel set in Russia during the Russian Revolution, and a young girl named Kira who refuses to settle for anything less than what she desires and deserves. The characters in it represent what every true individual can aspire to be if they believe in themselves. Leo, whom Kira loves and worships as her only god, is an example of one who had the potential to be great but who did not have the guts. Almost everyone surrounding Kira are examples of those born without potential or initiative. Kira is an example of someone who did all that she possibly could to be what she knows she can be, but the country and time period she lives in will not allow her to be anything but just another person in the great mass of people.Ayn Rand admitted that this is the closest she has ever come to writing an autobiography. She said that the events in the book are fiction, but Kira's ideals and values are her own. This book, like all of Ayn Rand's, will definately make you think, and it is an interesting read as well."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"When I first picked up Ayn Rand, I was warned that some of her ideas are a bit strange and that she loves bringing them up in her books. I shrugged that off, and read the book. I won't deny that I don't really understand what part of her philosophy is in her writing. When I read her books, I see fiction, and that's what I see here - a great work of fiction.\\"We the Living\\" is about revolutionary Russia. It's a fascinating book about people trying to live their lives and because of what they believe in, they cannot do that. The book has many examples of children paying parents' prices. The book shows us how people tried, and failed to live.The main character Kira, while the central figure in the story, is not exactly the most interesting. While a strong character, I didn't particularly love her, because she's not the sort of character to fall in love with. Instead, I was intrigued by her actions and mostly I was just curious. I found that I liked the side characters more than Kira, though she is certainly interesting and is definitely drawing.Much of the story centers around Kira's love troubles. There is her lover, Leo, who is a lot like Kira. He does what he believes in, no matter the cost. Here, it means not being a communist. Half of the story revolves around his and Kira's troubles at home, in life and love. Then there is Andrei, a communist who loves Kira. She uses him for money, help, and sometimes pleasure. He is the more interesting boy, with more of a personality and more interesting moments.There are a whole host of side characters, however, whose stories are just as fascinating as Kira and her boys. There is the story of Irina, Kira's cousin, who ultimately goes to jail for hiding her fiance/husband. There is the story of Victor, Irina's brother. Victor, the son of a man once wealthy like the rest of the family, chooses the \\"other\\" path, and rises to the top. There's the story of Pavel Syerov and Sonia, two communists, also living, but not quite. These side stories add a lot to the general idea, showing us more and more about Russia at the time through different people's eyes.I don't know what Ayn Rand wanted us to get from this. All I know is that I enjoyed reading this immensely. Once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. I grew close to the characters, and when the end arrived, I felt relieved, satisfied, and sad all at the same time. The writing style is so clear and understandable, but at the same time it's all beautiful. This is a wonderful work of fiction - and I don't care about what the philosophy is. Even if someone's told you that Rand has strange beliefs, read this book. It doesn't have to be philosophy. This is fiction, and it's incredible.Happy reading."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"When I read Atlas Shrugged, I could not help feeling the novel was almost science fiction in its depiction of a world where capitalism is not allowed to flourish freely because the government tries to regulate it, and consequently, the intellectuals and inventors abandon the rest of society. And then, I read Ayn Rand's first novel, We The Living, and within the first few pages realized she was not only depicting the very world that would exist if the government controlled everything, but that such a world had existed in the Soviet Union, and she had been a first hand witness to it. Atlas Shrugged was less a fantasy than a nightmare she had already lived through without as successful an ending as her greatest novel.The novel begins at the end of the Russian Revolution and depicts the lives of several of the younger generation trying to survive in the increasingly communist world as the state squelches individual freedom more and more. Having myself grown up during the Cold War, I foudn the novel rang true to many of the stories I heard about life in the Soviet Union--people standing in line for hours for a little bit of food for example. What is amazing is that it was written by someone who actually lived through those experiences in the early 1920s in Russia.Ayn Rand states the novel is \\"as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. The plot is invented, the background is not. I was born in Russia, I was educated under the Soviets; I have seen the conditions of existence that I describe.\\" One wishes she had written more of an autobiography because she states the main character Kira's experiences are not her own, although her ideas and convictions are.The novel follows Kira as she attends the university where true learning is replaced by learning only about the state, communism and Marxist idealogies. Kira submits to this social pressure to survive and to help her family, but she cannot come to believe these ideologies. The living conditions of the novel are intolerable as people are crammed, entire families into one or two rooms of a compartment, as people must wear worn out clothes because there are non new, and worst of all, as people are unable to think or discuss anything except the socialist ideologies.Saddest of all is Kira's attempts to find love. Both men she becomes involved with are unable to stand on their own because they fear the state or try to work underground to make money to survive because they cannot feed themselves in a society that does not allow free enterprise. Kira finds herself caught between these two men as she tries to survive and help them. In the end, she can help no one except herself and she makes her decision to escape abroad. Most readers I think will be disappointed by the ending, and I think Rand could have provided a stronger one to affirm life, but the final pages are dramatic and suspenseful.The novel is not as pointed or as much of a page turner as Atlas Shrugged, but it makes one understand better the events that led Ayn Rand to develop her philosophy of objectivism. The reader is left wanting to know more about the history of the Russian Revolution and communism. The book reminds one of the more popular Dr. Zhivago, although it is questionable if that book is any more powerful. Most of all, one wants to learn more about Ayn Rand's personal life in Russia and how she escaped to America. I intend to read an autobiography of Ayn Rand next.- Tyler R. Tichelaar, author of Iron Pioneers and The Queen City, available on Amazon"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Among several circles of religious scholars and fundamentalists, Ayn Rand has been condemned for her philosophy of Objectivist Ethics on the basis that selfishness, in her terms, has been extolled as a virtue and that the essence of man is his rational, potential being. Since no references were made regarding a personal god, Rand and anything associated with her were thus branded by several clergymen as heretical. What is misunderstood is her application of the word selfishness, which is, in essence, the prerequisite to valuing the lives of others as well as understanding the pleasure and pain principles that underlie mankind's existence. Was Jesus, the epitome of virtue, not quoted as saying that we are to do unto others as we would have others do unto us?Though I am not a Randian and have several qualms about the contemporary postulates that Rand's intellectual heirs have placed in terms of how government and society should be run, I do find merits in the Objectivist Ethics that, in my opinion, have been well espoused by its founder, Ms. Ayn Rand.I will not go into the details of the characters in We the Living, but I do want to point out key themes that make this book worthwhile, but first, let me note that had it not been for the rise of Communist Russia, there would likely not have been Rand's Objectivist epistemologies. Instead, we would probably be stuck with the forerunners Locke and Nietzsche as guides or references for trying to formulate, with not so much success, a systematic, philosophical construct such as Rand's.In the story, pervasive is the disillusionment that seems to be both sweeping and seeping, though quietly, among those who have been told about a new and better tomorrow for Russia, which was under the rule of Lenin in 1922. Among the dumbfounded are those who made up what were once deemed as the bourgeoisie, namely middle and upper class merchants and professionals who are witnessing their personal and property rights being stripped by the new government officials in the name of equality throughout Mother Russia. Despite so-called aims to balance the scales among the classes, the average and poor citizens, who are supposed to be the benefactors of government change, are finding themselves less able to afford the basic necessities of food, shelter and clothing. With no clear solution before them, if they complain, then they will, at best, be promised, over and again, that progress will come and to be patient or, at worst, be condemned and tried as an enemy of the state.Reverberating within and around the continuous demands for Russia's people to be patient is the likely requirement that each individual renounce any claims or markers that once gave him or her any kind of personal distinction or unique identity. For instance, if your talents, be they technical, aesthetic or esoteric, did not fall in line with what was in accordance with the objectives of the new government, then you would have to disavow your uses of them or else suffer the consequences.Upon reflection, as a reader, such as myself, would continue to analyze, with the mind's eye, the day-to-day living, or dying, that would go on in 1920's Russia, the quote that the road to hell was paved with good intentions comes to thought.In We the Living, this hell is reflected by the challenges and obstacles that are placed before the protagonist, a young eighteen year-old woman named Kira. Kira is not the good person in the sense of moral purity, but she is a youth who wants to find her place in the world. She wants her own career, she wants to bond with the man of her choice, she wants to live in a home of her liking, and she wants to blaze her own trail, not one already prescribed or predetermined by others. And the longer Kira maintains those ideals, the more she is isolated as an enemy of the state, a totalitarian authority that will likely put to death those they perceive as threats, even if they are merely from a philosophical standpoint.In the starting pages, personalities and perceptions, at first, seem diverse, ranging from youthful idealism present in those who anticipate positive changes in Russia's government reforms to cynicism among those who are pessimistic about or are slow to change period. But as time passes, the frequency and intensity of totalitarian tones set forth by the communist government increase and ultimately result in a unifying mindset among virtually everyone, namely fear. This regression to such a primal state is gradual, and it is one of several elements that make We the Living great and seemingly realistic. It is not an engaging chapter-by-chapter sequence like Rand's nonfiction works, including The Virtue of Selfishness. However, it is a unique fictional, though nearly autobiographical (as Rand said it was), exposition of what happens when the wrong ideologies are institutionalized to set up and run a government or state.As Rand repeatedly published in her myriad volumes, to constantly ignore personal pursuits in the name of perceived morals could lead to improperly placing the fate of your well-being in the hands of others, as in the case of totalitarian regimes. Even the revered George Washington, himself, asserted that a good, effective government can only be established with the acknowledgement that men are more motivated by their self interests than they are by seemingly virtuous ideals. Throughout man's history, theocracies were doomed to failure for trying to do it the other way around. Even similar attempts but that would completely leave God out of the equation would create an establishment that would lead to the needless suffering of so many, such as the one Rand so effectively described in this early masterpiece of hers."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am not an Ayn Rand fan. Yet, this novel cannot be ignored by those that are rational and honest.To me, every great author has a \\"signature novel.\\" (For example, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is Hemingway's \\"signature novel.\\") This, to me, is Rand's \\"signature novel.\\"LOVERS OF SOCIALISM/COMMUNISM: Those that admire socialism/communism should read merely one portion of the Introduction to this splendid book. Rand wrote:'A young Russian had said to her [Any Rand] at a party in 1926, just before she [Any Rand] left for America: \\"When you get there, tell them that Russia is a huge cemetery and that we are all dying.\\"'That was in 1926, and little did anyone know that the situation in Russia/USSR would become far worse than a cemetery.Socialists, communists, collectivists that read this book will be challenged to defend their impeccably ludicrous, transparently preposterous belief-system. Will they admit it? No.\\"We The Living\\" is a powerful, bleak, grim tale of \\"Kira Argounova,\\" a young lady that wants to leave Russia. She faces one problem: It is illegal to leave Russia--so much so that it is punishable by death or a stint in the Gulag.Kira Argounova will use anyone and any method to leave. She is the hero. It is a book about escaping a terrible situation at any cost.This is Rand's most passionate, realistic and powerful novel. It is a masterpiece for those of us that have studied the history of the Soviet Union and have observed the abject repression--\\"repression\\" is a mild word for it--of those who suffered under Lenin, Stalin (who was born Iosef Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili and changed his name to Stalin, meaning, literally, \\"made of steel\\"--a title that fit him well), and others.This is her masterpiece.This is the book that will be remembered far, far after her other works are forgotten.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The two stars I give this book are for the extraordinary writing of Ayn Rand. I give her zero for creating such a predatory, egomaniacal heroine as Kira Argounova. Although she cloaks herself in lofty philosophical armor, she's no different than the scrungy females you see on Jerry Springer or Ricki Lake--all they want is &quot;their man.&quot; Kira destroys the only noble character in the book: her admirer/lover Andrei. She uses him ruthlessly to help save her sleazy, hoodlum boyfriend, Leo when he needs expensive treatment at a TB sanatorium. What she really wants is Leo's majestic body. Although he's as hard and indifferent as a robot, this is the man Kira gives us everything for. What's really disturbing is that Rand harps continuously about how one should never hold up anything higher than one's ego. Yet, she becomes the common street woman who wants to get this particular man in bed. So much for Kira's noble aspirations. Andrei was the only decent person in this book--besides Irina, Kira's cousin, and Irina's lover, Sasha, both who ended up in a concentration camp to die. When Kira is killed at the end, there was no sorrow from this reader. For someone who betrayed ,leeched and destroyed Andrei, the most admirable of any of her characters, her death was deserved."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"In the early days after the Russian Revolution, one might have easily slipped into the false idea that communism was a passing fad and life would soon return to normalcy. This is the backdrop for the masterful novel by Ayn Rand which follows three young adults as they learn about themselves and the ways of the embryonic communist government. \\"We the Living\\" is a world loosely held together, but which never seems to completely fall apart.Rand places much of the focus of \\"We the Living\\" on Kira, whom the author has suggested possesses many characteristics of herself. Kira's physical appearance is given an unflattering description in the initial pages, but which evolves positively as the story progresses. Kira can be described as an idealist, formerly of the wealth of a bourgeois family. But as many her age in all times and places do, she is searching for something. Leo is haunted by the death communism caused his father and begins to openly seek to sabotage the system. The only strand that seems to prevent recklessness is his bond with Kira. Andrei, although a communist, struggles with his beliefs in the face of the burgeoning love triangle. Perhaps Andrei is the most tragic character in the book.While Kira seems to have chosen Leo early in the novel, the realtionship is built on unstable ground. Circumstances lead Kira back to Andrei, causing an already confused woman to further question her direction. While the story digresses into some slower moving points, it is emblematic of the stereotypical image Westerners have of a depressed life in the Soviet Union. As one may expect, the ending reflects the stereotype. While the ending may be somewhat expected, readers are still eager in their anticipation.Though the pacing of \\"We the Living\\" seems uneven at times, the critical points in the plot make the novel tough to discontinue reading. Rand is masterful at putting an image to the faceless phenomenon of socialism."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is another one I read when I was in high school. A teacher recommended it to me, &amp; I will be forever grateful for that. I'm not a real fan of Rand's other works but this one is stunning. There are parts of it that stay with me every day. The struggles of all the young people in it against a heartless crushing bureaucracy become even more resonant as I get older. And there is one small section, where one character watches the love of his life disappear on another train as they're separated &amp; sent to different parts of Siberia, that I challenge you to read without tears. That section alone makes the book worth it--I've never forgotten those few paragraphs &amp; never will."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is an amazing and completely heart wrenching first novel of Ayn Rand and to me, her best, as it not only captured the destructive effects of collectivism but also the emergence of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Set in post-Russian Revolution, We the Living portrayed the chaotic uncertainty and political changes that robbed many Russians of their rights as individuals.As Ayn Rand experienced life under communist tyranny firsthand, she breathed life into the three main characters and slowly unraveled a moving story as their lives became intertwined. Kira was an independent spirit as she refused to succumb to the brutal regime and its suffocation of her individuality. She represented the epitome of all young innocent idealists. Leo, her one true love, another character we all have ran into our life, handsome, dashing, and yet completely unreconciled. He took Kira's unconditional love for granted as she helplessly trying to save his spiraling descent into bitterness and anger. He was targeted as an enemy of the state due to his post-status of Bourgeoisie as the new regime completely pummeled his rational consciousness. Finally, Andrei, an officer of the Soviet Secret police whose idealism was also completely shattered when he questioned the underlying fallacy of Communism. The love triangle of Kira, Andrei and Leo was completely entrenched with a sadness that paralleled the realities of an affair, in this case, not just of the heart but of the battle of \\"the individual against the state\\" also. However, I do find Kira hiding behind her convictions, and somehow justified her abuse and maltreatment to Andrei disturbing. I suppose if you totally believe in objectivism, for her it is justified. My heart definitely goes out to Andrei, the only decent characters who was true to his heart until the end, even if his beliefs change over the time period, he still stayed true to his moral ethics.This novel was not well received at first due to its controversial nature and had a hard time getting published in the 30's. It wasn't until after the success of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" that Ayn Rand managed to get this book more widely accepted. We the Living successfully denounced not just Communism, but of every entity that claims the right to sacrifice the supreme value of an individual human right or life. There is no book out there that fully captures how bad it was when communism massacred the spirits of the people. She managed to portrayed \\"the absolute concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\" (Objectivism) in a novel form. Indeed, this book will resonate and haunt for the rest of the reader's life"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book was unlike her later books. It's more of a look at actual history and the effects of an actual change in government. There were many here in the US who have wanted to duplicate Russia and change our government to Marxism. They came here soon after the fall of Russia, in the very early 1900s. They called themselves \\"Marxists\\" which didn't go over well. They then stole the term \\"Progressives\\" from the conservatives and are once again using that term. Today, they have finally come into power in our current congress (Pelosi) and the puppet masters pulling their strings such as George Soros & International Answer.Another book that most haven't read is her first book. It rates a VERY high recommendation and is again much unlike her other books. \\"Anthem\\". I believe this was Ayn's 2nd book and the only one of this type she wrote.I couldn't help but think that it inspired \\"1984\\" and \\"Planet of the Apes\\". It was a short, quick read that was entertaining and thought provoking. Like all her books, it doesn't compare two shades of gray, but black & white. I've long used this technique in analyzing questions relating to physics, geometry, math & life."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Unlike Rand's other novels--supporters will be hard-pressed to state that she is a butle writer--We the Living is a historical snapshot, a supposedly semi-autobiographical novel that does wonders for evoking a specific time period. The characters are beautiful, colorful, and interesting, even against the backdrop of one of the most colorless regimes in modern history. There's no six-page diatribes or harsh anti-religios fervor in this novel, which is surprising given the nature of both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. On the first level, this is a solid novel, written with suspence and surprise, genuine plot-driven episodes and (to use a trite phrase) a great way to capture the imagination of the reader."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. One thing I liked about it was that the amount of philosophy you had to plow through in order to get the point was pretty minimal compared to The Fountainhead. The story made for interesting reading. One thing I do not feel is true, though, is that it is a truly accurate picture of the inside of Communist Russia. I think that One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, Doctor Zhivago, and Red Army Stories are all better. They seem to be a little more brutal, but one of the key things is that the protagonist is not the only good guy. In the other books the protagonist usually runs across at least one somewhat inspiring character who is surviving within the system and perhaps even making it work. I just feel these novels represent a more accurate portrayal of what went on in Communist Russia than what Rand shows the reader. One final note: (This applies in The Fountainhead as well as Anthem, but it is not quite as important, as the endings in those books are somewhat if not completely predictable.) DO NOT READ THE PLEIKOFF INTRODUCTION AS IT WILL COMPLETELY GIVE AWAY THE ENDING!!!!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I thought this was an excellent novel. If you have issues with Rand's political ideology (I certainly tend to disagree with her) there is still much to enjoy about this novel. Don't prejudge the novel and decide not to read it because you dislike Rand. The story is genuinely moving and the characters, particularly the main character, are well drawn. I understood why she felt the way she did, and why she made the choices she did. Rand created some very evocative images in the novel -- I felt like I was there. I got totally pulled into the story. I can't say that the picture of Communist Russia at that time is particularly accurate or not, as I don't have enough knowledge on the subject to comment on that. I read the book because I was interested in the story, and the characters, not the politics. It does, however, raise some good, thought provoking questions about the dangers of totalitarianism. Thus, I can reccommend the book on two levels -- it will satisfy readers who just love a good story, and those who are interested in politcal systems and political ideology. The book might be hard to track down, but it will be worth the effort."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am seventeen and I have never read a book like this one . I was profoundly affected and I believe anyone who reads this book will be , too . Kira is an unbelievable character . Her story is poignant and real . The book is real . There are no mushy fake scenes of perfect love or happy endings . Life isn't that way and niether is this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is Ayn Rand at her greatest. Her phenomenal writing talent moves the story along at a fascinating pace. The characters are totally believable. They don't become the non-human symbols of people which populate her other two masterpieces (although they're all fascinating, you can't relate to them on a human level). She manages to interweave her philosophy in bits and pieces, rather than the page-after-page rants in Atlas Shrugged. Kira, though, is a frustrating heroine to admire. While she treats Andrei like crap, she pours her life into Leo, a fascinating but brutal hero. Also, if a basic tenent of her philosophy is self-reliance, of holding no one higher than one self, one wonders why Kira becomes dependent on Leo, and sacrifices so much for him. In re-reading this masterpiece again and again, I kept thinking of how Rand was using Greta Garbo as her heroine. Also, the Italian movie made of &quot;We the Living&quot; is an absolute must-see for any admirer of this book. It runs over 3 hours and is amazingly faithful to the book. To think that this film was made in Italy and not in Russia is a shock. And to think it was made right at the height of World War II, with bombs exploding all over the place, makes it even more extraordinary."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am a big, big fan of Ayn Rand. While I doubt few people agree with 100% of Randological thought and reason (she was very eclectic in terms of her system of belief), I tend to agree with her far more than disagree. Personally, I started with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", which is considered her masterpiece; then moved onto \\"The Fountainhead\\"; and most recently \\"We the Living\\". Quite by accident, I read these books in reverse order in the way she wrote them. As such, it has been interesting to see how Rand's thought process, beliefs, and writing style evolved over time.\\"We the Living\\", while certainly not to the scale or quality of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", is nonetheless a very informative and enjoyable book. Mainly, it informed me about Rand herself. While this is not a direct autobiography of Rand in her Russia years, by her own account, it is the most autobiographical of all her works, and many points of the book can directly be reflected in her own life. For example, Kira's family was a bourgeoisie class business owner, as was the case of Rand herself. The bourgeoisie class became repressed and looked down upon by the leadership of the proletariat or working classes in the early days of the Soviet Union. It is these type of dynamics that are represented so well in this book, and the reader comes away feeling informed about the early beliefs and failings of the Soviet system in the immediate aftermath of the civil war there.If you are a Rand fan, this is a must read. If you are unfamiliar with Rand, I suggest starting with \\"The Fountainhead\\", then \\"We the Living\\", and finishing with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Of course, there are many more Rand works to read and enjoy as well."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"If you only can or only want to read one Ayn Rand book, read \\"We the Living.\\" Unlike \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead,\\" \\"We the Living\\" never feels bloated lengthy sermons or superfluous detail. Readers of Rand will recognize characters from her other works in this book, but here she did it best and she did it first. Emotionally this is her most moving piece. More is explored and communicated in the 450 pages of this book than in her 1100 page behemoth \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" If you think Ayn Rand can't write compelling fiction, read this book. It will change your mind (it did mine). If you enjoy good literature, read this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"** spoiler alert ** I was drawn into the miserable life of Kira and her family in Soviet Russia and my heart went for them. The filth, the hunger and the frustration against the new government's \\"social\\" policy.I love the philosophical debate in Rand's books. I really enjoy books in which I need to stop and think about what I read and how the story is entwined with my own life - for better or for worse.However, I was greatly disappointed that strong willed Kira, who risked her life for her ideals would become a doormat to her vain and ungrateful lover.Obviously, I was engrossed by the book, hence my anger towards its main protagonist [a fictional character] but I believe that the way the story ends doesn't serve the idea behind it.I know that in real life idealism may not work out and it doesn't mean that one must abandon one's ideals because of that. But it was frustrating that she eventually lost her life, not to her ideals, not to the cause - but due to her unwise choice of lovers."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is the first Ayn Rand book I have ever read. Its length wasn't nearly as intimidating as ATALS SHRUGGED, however once I started reading it the subject matter made me re-think whether or not I wanted to read through this. The depth of political and philosophical issues made me wonder if I had the energy to withstand something of this magnitude. As it was I did have to take a break from reading it half-way through the book. Rand, herself, admits that this is closely autobiographical, yet it is written so that you keep rooting for the good guy hoping that they come out on top in the end, but as Communism kept a firm grasp on the USSR for decades we know that there is little chance that the oppressed citizens are going to find themselves living comfortably in the end. After reading this though, one can understand why Rand promoted the philosophy that she did and championed THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS. Once forced to think about everyone but ones self, a person eventually begins to think only of herself. Politically, socially, psychologically or otherwise people cannot live without balance and by forcing its citizens to live for the collective the Communist party eventually forced them to live for themselves, even unto death.The writing was descriptive making the realness of Communism more than just history and illuminates just how twisted their campaign became. The revolt that led to the Communist inception was noble indeed, but as the years past it can be seen how fear led them to the same lengths of control that they had previously accused the Czar of perpetrating. Having read 1984 and ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell I found this to be much scarier as not only did this narration depict parts of the Orwellian books that had already played out in Communist Russia it also foreshadowed ideas that are seemingly materializing in the United States; the idea that people were afraid to have their own thoughts, among them.There were parts of the story that I bristled at. Particularly, Kira's continued devotion to Leo even in the wake of his disrespectful treatment of her. I don't understand how she had the courage to not get married, yet didn't have a problem with his shabby treatment of her. This personal dynamic detracted from her initial desire to be an individual. She wanted to be an engineer, but when that possibility was taken from her she lived for Leo rather than for herself. Victor was, also, a considerable thorn. Part of a classified bourgeois family who find difficulty in acclimating to the new political environment Victor threw his self heart and soul into being accepted by the proletariat to the point of betraying his family. Devotion to one's political convictions should not preclude the protection of one's relatives.Though it took me a couple of months to read, as it forces the reader to think, I would encourage people to read it. We live in a society that largely over-estimates the abilities of the government and this book shows what can happen when the government is completely in control."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is another one I read when I was in high school.

The characters were intriguing as well. For those of you who aren't Ayn Rand readers, this book is completely unlike her others. The one quarrel I have with the book is its depression factor. Perhaps I become too emotional while reading, but this book really sank in and had a high sadness factor. Yet, overall, it is a must-read!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read &quot;We the Living&quot; a couple of months after reading &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; in that order. I was more than pleasantly surprised that the author started her writing career with the best book of them all. The objectivists hype &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; like its a bible which must be read to understand their philosophy. They should concentrate on promoting this book instead.Some reviewers from the &quot;Left Coast&quot; have assailed the book for its attack on Communism and total lack of objectivity. This is totally missing the point. It is not Communism that is on trial - it is any political philosophy forced upon the masses in an attempt to subvert individual will to the will and greed of those who have but only &quot;The deepest concern for his fellow brothers&quot; that is under attack here. When I grew up in the 60's and 70's many on the left stated that the USSR would make Marx twirl in his grave. The point is clearly made in the book that what starts off as good ideas and good intentions are eventually corrupted by those who know how to take advantage of the system and that everyone - sincere followers, those who dare to take a stand and those who just simply try to get on with their lives, are the eventual victims.The ending of the novel left me emotionally drained, and very moved. If you are to read only one Ayn Rand novel, this should be it!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First, a disclaimer: I am not a member of the cult of Ayn Rand. This is the first book I've read by her. I did not read it because I believe in Objectivism already, or am attracted to its tenets, with which I am completely unfamiliar. All I know of her, and that knowledge is dubious, is that she is the darling of many (what I would call) fundamentalist capitalists. I was looking for a good novel, knew that she was both reviled and adored, and figured it would be interesting reading, at least. For the record, most would call me a liberal.I was blown away. I'm still not looking to join the cult, mind you, but I will read other books by her because this one showed evidence of a warm heart, an uncompromising intellect, and a fever for living well. Ideology was not permitted to run roughshod over plot or character. It's an astonishingly accomplished first novel, and ought to be a candidate for every serious book club and every list of great books.Rand draws her characters clearly and with complexity. While she is a bit romantic, even her simpler characters, such as the lickspittle, Victor, are developed in such a way that the reader must ask difficult questions about who he is, why he is that way, and would we be different under the same constraints. Kira, the central figure, is sympathetic, tragic, heroic, and admirable - but also a conundrum. Given who she is, why does she do the things she does? Why the compromises? Are they compromises? What of the archetypal Party man, Andrei? Is he a tragic or romantic hero? Is he a naive tool? Is he redeemed, or is his naivete merely exposed? Rand crafts a story that raises questions that have no easy, vapid answers but that demand discussion.For those who think of Rand as the patron saint of Gordon Gecko, of greed and looking out for number one - which is the vague impression I've had of her - the characters who are most narcissistic, most self-aggrandizing, are also the most contemptible. And the hero lives a life of selfless love, with disciplined passion and a dreams deferred. This is not a book to avoid because of preconceived notions about Rand and her ideology.The book raises many ethical and political issues, but I didn't leave with the sense that the conclusions were foregone. She talks about the corruption of a well-intended revolution, and while it applies particularly to Soviet Communism in these pages, I take it that it could as easily apply to any ideology - political, economic, religious, whatever - that fails to serve the people it promises to serve. There is clearly a passion in favor of letting the gifted be gifted, but there are nasty aristocrats and noble peasants, both, here. There's no aristocrats good, peasants bad theme operating here. I see respect for the good, whether they be rich or poor, and derision for those without dreams or nobility. As a bumper sticker says, those who have smothered their own dreams will smother yours. It becomes their job.In 21st century America, where ideologies are ossified, partisans are blindly simplistic, and we have few, if any, bridge-builders, We the Living is a compelling call to remember that our dreams have a claim on us that we dismiss at the cost of lives worth living. What are our dreams, and what comforts or phantasms have we traded them for? I don't think Rand wants us to sleep easily after asking these questions."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I first read \\"We the living\\" as a young teenager in 1975.

I am now older and wiser and have two children and five grandchildren and have rediscovered Ayn Rand. What an amazing woman she was. I wish everyone would read her books. If she had stayed in Russia they would have destroyed her and we would have been denied the pleasure of reading her books. God bless America where she was allowed her freedom. A truely remarkable lady."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"In her self-proclaimed near-autobiography, Ayn Rand writes of the tumultuous time after Russia's fall to Soviet rule through the lives of a few individuals stuck in it. The descriptions of daily life, the frustrations of everything from heating to food to dealing with corrupt bureaucracy, give a realism to the time period and conditions that aren't so easily conveyed in history texts. While people tend towards caricatures, as can be typical in Rand's work, the core of humanity within them, both high and low points, clearly shine through.It's a love story gone all wrong as Kira, the young woman who wishes to design bridges but won't ever achieve that goal under the red boot of socialism, watches the man she loves succumb to the dehumanizing effects of the system which surrounds and controls them. Other characters, friends and relatives of the main characters give the story a great deal of depth.This book does not fall prey to the excess wordiness that Atlas Shrugged did. There are not redundant speeches which take up dozens of pages. I'd not re-read this book without a box of tissues handy. Whether or not you tend to agree with Rand, this is an excellent book which gives a deeper understanding to a particularly unique and dark period in history."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\"What's a citizen? Only a brick and of no use unless cemented to other bricks just like it\\"? As one character lectures another herein: \\"why do you think you are entitled to your own thoughts...against those of the majority of the Collective?\\" After all, as a Bolshevik explains, \\"...no external enemy...is as dangerous to us as the internal enemy of dissension within our own ranks. Hence we read this on the book's jacket: \\"We the Living demonstrates the supreme value of a human life and the evil of those who claim the right to sacrifice it.\\" There's your life. You begin it feeling that it's something so precious & rare, so beautiful that it's like a sacred treasure.\\" But \\"one man means nothing in the face of the mighty Proletarian Collective,\\" the Bolsheviks counter. In such an environment, Kira, the heroine of this 1936 novel (Ayn Rand's first) subsequently concludes: \\"Nothing matters. We mustn't think. We mustn't think at all.\\" To a Bolshevik she charges, \\"you came and forbade life [as in freedom of choice] to the living.\\" \\"You took their every hour, every minute, every nerve, every thought in the farthest corners of their souls---and you told them what it had to be;\\" \\"telling men \\"what they must live for.\\" This after we see how a number of characters lose their jobs, or get thrown out of university \\"for trying to think\\" for themselves. This is life in the Soviet Union as personally experienced by Ayn Rand (a nom de plume the Russian author invented to protect family members still living in Leningrad at the time). She saw firsthand how Bolshevism went about putting down new rules, fashioning a state that took \\"your honor, your life and your freedom.\\" And while this isn't Ms. Rand's life story, it is, as the author states in the introduction, a sort of autobiography, in the intellectual sense; having instilled Kira with the author's \\"ideas, her convictions, her values.\\" And while the \\"plot is invented,\\" the author admits, \\"the background is not.\\" And the \\"Sovietness\\" of said background is not the paramount issue herein either, but the notion that, notwithstanding any utopian rhetoric, \\"you cannot enslave man's mind. \\"You can only destroy it.\\" In a collectivist society, \\"what are your masses but millions of dull, shrivelled, stagnant souls that have no thoughts of their own, no dreams of their own, no will of their own.\\" Ms. Rand's work is, in short, a powerfully written expose of collectivist mentalities; a warning that \\"you cannot castigate life \\"in order to perpetuate it.\\" PS: There's an Italian-made film, very faithfull to this book---the only film ever made based on this novel---which is well worth viewing. It's available from Amazon (or perhaps through your local library).

Rand's writing is so powerful, I feel I must recover from this book as if it were me that lived the events she described.Read this book, not for likable characters or a feel-good ending - but for the way Rand will move you both emotionally and intellectually as you try to reconcile the events and characters of this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read this book when i was so very young (19), and after reading The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged and Anthem, which i loved. i was astounded by this book and moved beyond belief. I found the writing much different than her other books, and much more fictionalized. amazing considering that english was not her first language and this was one of her earliest works. the story is highly romanticized, yet even with that, i found my heart beating strongly and my anxiety level so high as i lived through that hideous life in communist russia. and the scene when Irina is sentenced to (as i recall) siberia, and leaves on a train while her husbands struggles to keep her in sight, to keep a piece of her clothing in his sight as long as he can --- how can anyone read that and not practically fall to their knees in grief and anguish for this young couple who are so cruelly separated? i will not do a spoiler here about the end, but there were times when i wanted to slap kira and wake her up to the truth of her two lovers. yet, it plays out as it must. and it is a beautiful novel. many reviewers here refer to it as bleak; i do not find it so. i found it romantic, terrifying, tragic, and beautiful. i loved fountainhead and atlas in a different way. this book was so steeped in romantic language and story that one could swoon from it. there is not a page that i found superfluous and to this day i can remember savoring every word of that book (and that was 50 years ago!). whether or not you are a fan of ayn rand, this is a story and a book worth your time. it broke my heart. (and i find it offensive that the book is listed by Ayn Rand AND Leonard Peikoff who had nothing whatsoever to do with this book and didn't even know her when it was written. shame on him for sticking his name on everything published by her, even if he is the trustee for her estate. he knows only too well, that it is only because he was the only one left in the group that she felt she could trust. had Nathanial or Barbara Brandon still been in her good graces when she died, it certainly would have been them to whom she left her estate. but aside from that, how can he sleep at night, having slapped his name on everything she has written! shame! shame! shame!)"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It may be heretical but I consider this first workRand's best. It has an innocence not found inthe later tomes. An instant read - and one that can't be put down - it's a non-didactic Rand whois writing a story - not a polemic. The love story is absolutely fantastic and the description of Russia deadly. The characters will remain for along time and the plot is suberb. Warning - not a happy ending"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First, I did not like the book. It was like a trashy romance novel. It offered little information on the actual Russian Revolution. The book is about a girl named Kira who sleeps around too much to survive. She claims that she is in love, but she doesn't even know the meaning of the word. I do, however, like the end. I believe that Communism does forbid life to the living. If any part of this story is read, read the end. Kira and Andrei's last speeches almost make reading the book worth while. People who want a spin on a serious topic should read this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This novel is written at a very different age of fictional writing... in a tumultuous timeframe. Remember the fear and intensity of the climate as you turn the pages. Star Wars, Cuba, Berlin...This is a freshman work on her themes that later evolve into a political party and almost cult. In her later works, she can be accused of belaboring points ad nausea... (John Gault's speech). This work seemed lighter to me. Yet, still thought provoking.But if you return to the story itself... there is symbolism weaving its way throughout. Reform, incentives, human nature, corruption, education...The fundamental flaws of communism and socialism are brought to life...MOVING, GRIPPING...Her later works touch on a free market economy and the joys of capitalism."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"For somebody who came from Russia this book is a vivid reminder of the horror, that people like Kira experienced after revolution. Is the book about love? Yes, of course. Is it about human spirit and ego? You bet. Does it show us that love may be blind? Unfortunately. But in addition to all that, it is a testimony against the kingdom of ignorance. They the living were turned into the mass of toilers. They still remember days when they were humans, and now one by one they surrender to the power of pigs. From the very first page you feel that it is not just fiction, but almost a documentary. May be that is why it is the best book by Rand. It was the story that she lived."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I first saw this book in bookstores when I was in junior college, not more than 16 years old. I looked at its last page (as was my habit) and decided I could not digest the book.But the book persisted. It was there in bookstores even when I became 30 years old and I said there must be something to it. I have to read it. And so I read.I read it after a tiring journey in which I had not slept for 36 hours and it was so interesting I forgot my tiredness and read it with the customary tears that I shed every time I read a touching Readers Digest story. It must be in my nature to cry.The plot is clearly absorbing and not an ideal one . As close to reality as mundane life, with its crushed expectations gets to be. But I do not know why Kira is the heroine in the story. It should have been Andrei - the only man who is a man in the entire story. The only man who never betrays his values, the only man with a heart and decency. What does Kira see in Leo? Is Rand trying to portray that women can have no sense of seeing things for what they are? Is Rand saying that women need to doll up and let men love their bodies and not their souls?True love may be rare, but it better be well deserved! Love may be a religion but it should have a sense of values which allow it to be given to the deserving person. The lover Kira and love itself become some slavish fetter which is loved as a drug addict may love his drug. If this is love and if imagination of love is greater than achieving it in reality as the last passages show then it is a monumental acceptance of the fact that humans are capable of fooling themselves. Kira may have been a good soldier but she did not see the direction she was headed in. That is not anytime the mark of a good soldier at all. Real love should be one which improves one's values and not one which destroys them. Kira did not know the preciousness of love - the immunity it gives to any true love - though Rand imagines and shows that Kira achieves just that! It is the only novel by her I read, so I cannot comment more on this."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read Anthem in High School, Atlas Shrugged recently and today I just finished We the Living. I consider myself an Ayn Rand fan tho I'm no cult follower. I love her views on individualism and capitalism tho we part ways when it comes to belief in God. As a Christian and a capitalist I appreciate the rights of the individual and I think most Christians can agree with her on that. She feels that sacrificing herself for a deity is foolish where I feel that you sacrificing for others can be an end in itself and further one's own life positively. I don't believe that I should sacrifice for another at the point of a gun, i.e. the government telling me that my money really belongs to someone else and I think Christians and objectivists can agree on that point.So for Christians out there, I think you can take away from this book ideas that are beneficial without endorsing her anti-God beliefs. Also I think the story is fantastic and easier to get through than say Atlas Shrugged. I highly recommend both books by the way.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I don't love this book because of the author, or because I agree with its conjectural premises, but because it gave me an incredibly insightful view into why Rand hated socialism. It contains everything you need to know if you have ever wondered how the hell altruism and compassion could possibly be construed as an evil endeavor.The Kindle transcript and page layout was great, which isn't always the case on the original Kindle."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book will leave an everlasting impression upon you. Amazingly, this was Ayn Rand's first book and is much overlooked, being dwarfed by her supposed masterpieces Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. Amazingly, she had a lot of trouble publishing this book in 1936 with the original title being Airtight indicating in post revolution Soviet Russia it was nearly impossible to survive. A librarian had warned her that there were a lot of people who sympathized with communist ideals in America as you will find explained in the Afterward by Leonard Peikoff, the founder of the Ayn Rand Institute, also described as the philosophical heir of Ayn Rand on the back cover. She wrote this as a warning to prevent a socialist America.The communist ideals are attractive. Everyone is supposedly upon the same level. People live, share, contribute to society. But in reality, having this unfeeling, godless, concrete being, representing the state, to answer to results in the emergence of another class of people that have to impose their ideals upon others to ensure the survival of this entity which is not classless at all.The protagonist Irina sleeps underneath a picture of a towering engineering wonder of a skyscraper and dreams of going to engineering school. She's fiercely independent and incredibly cerebral and not surprisingly butts head with the reigning authorities. If you don't belong to the communist party, good luck. You'll stand in long lines for flour and oil for which you'll have to live on months on end. You'll have to spout the party line to avoid the inevitable frequent purges to purify the party of unseemly elements. The black market quickly emerges in such an atmosphere as well as black mail. The title of this review comes from a conversation in the book from a disgruntled citizen asking the philosophical question what did we create and argues that we started trying to build a temple but didn't even end with an outhouse. Comrade citizens were merely little puny things that wiggle, mindless, spineless beings that had to sway in the hurricane force winds in order to survive.If this is not her finest work, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged must be beyond phenomenal."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This novel has by far been one of my favorites. I have read all of Ayn's fiction novels, I dont care so much for her philosophical books. But I truly love the way she is able to tell a story, detailed, and fully in depth depiction of soviet Russia and the hard times that the people went through. I could not put this book down until I had finished it, and now having long since lent my copy to a friend to never see it again, I am purchasing the kindle edition because I feel the need to re-read this wonderful piece of literature. And would like to share it with my family. I highly recommend this book to anyone that even remotely enjoyed \\"The Fountainhead\\" Or any of Ayns others works."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As reading enjoyment goes, We the Living is Ayn Rand at her best. This is semi-autobiographical fiction recounting the earliest days of the Soviet Union. This story is more heartfelt, less preachy (okay, a little bit preachy), and more personal than The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged. Those later works were really more like platforms for Rand to develop and espouse her philosophy of Objectivism, so the plot and characters were subservient to those aims. She has a tendency to turn her characters into flat icons representing various elements of society, but not so much in We the Living, where the characters feel more real- like they might be people Ayn knew who endured the rise of Bolshevism and all its attendant grotesque injustices."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Everyone is affected by political culture. Every level of regulation, from anarchy to fascist dictatorships, is comparatively some amount of government. Ayn Rand shows the dismal struggles surrounding Kira Argounov in her communist environment. Through maginificent language, _We the Living_ forces empathy for starving masses; in a way that no news article can. As the book progresses, an awareness is awakened that every aspect of each person's life is painful, yet each person fights to keep on living. Ayn Rand presents a dieing city, and develops human characters who force themselves to live through it. Although, what these characters go through on a daily basis is not quite the same as living. Their USSR regulates the distribution of food, clothing, and shelter; a corrupt hierarchy with ambiguous goals and morals regulates every physical human necessity. The suffering is deadly, but the struggles for life are sifting through the propaganda and government denials, staking out some form of existence.Ayn Rand analyzes a multitude of varied relationships, between deluges of personalities. Throughout the story, people grow and change as they try with all human strength to adapt to their new world. This novel is about character development in an environment created by Soviet mismanagement. It shows how people cope with the stresses of staying alive, when that in itself becomes the primary concern. Things taken for granted by the rest of the world are denied to a population of millions. A home, a job, and even one's own free time are all the concerns of an ever present government. Human nature is captured in the interactions of characters, and sometimes it can be a terrible thing. Power struggles created by the voids left by a revolution have to be settled, and some people will go to far to fill those voids. This is a fast read about politics and humanity that will leaves questions about all governments, and if this could ever happen again."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is a genuine portrayal of humanity and is beautifully written. I was worried at certain points that real humanity would be betrayed by the reaction of a character, but it never was.I have an idea in my imagination of what it might mean to the human character to live in times like these and the novel followed this --but, even when the story took an unexpected turn, it still made sense that a character could react in the way he/she did to the situation at hand.Although this review is quite vague, the basic idea is give this novel a whole-hearted chance - it is a fascinating backdrop of an historic, traditional Russia shattered by political idealism taken to the extreme and an amazingly realistic and addictive character study in reaction to it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was the first Ayn Rand book that I ever read. She is a brilliant author, writing beautiful poetic prose (clever similes) at times and always getting her message across with vigor.I subtract one star for a muddled plot. The middle of the book feels like a series of meaningless short stories with no bearing on what turns out to be the climax. The conflict does not rise steadily, which causes the reader's interest to sway. This is particularly surprising since Rand is a self-proclaim \\"Romanticist.\\" The Romantic school focuses heavily on classic plot formation (Introduction, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, Conclusion) and rejects the Post-modernist fragmentation of story. (Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a good example.)That being said, the book is otherwise outstanding. Rand had first-hand experience with the evils of communism growing up in Russia, and the medium of fiction serves as a brilliant means to explain what she saw. The incredibly enormous bueracracy (sp?) of the U.S.S.R. is fascinating to look at. The governmental intrusion into every tiny aspect of human life is horrifying.As I said above, the prose is very good. Perhaps what's so surprising about this is that this is Rand's first book! I am amazed at how mature the narrative style is and how well the political criticism is developed. Albeit, the full philosophy of Objectivism is absent, but it does not detract from the force of the message.I highly recommend this book, especially for those who are curious about what life was REALLY like under the Leninist autocracy. In our age, Lenin seems to be getting a reputation for being \\"the good one\\" and Stalin as \\"the bad one.\\" The truth is that they were both evil and they both killed enormous unknown amounts of innocent people, and tortured incredibly high numbers of others.I am sure I will go on to read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am a huge fan of Atlas Shrugged, and I also enjoyed Fountainhead. As I had heard We The Living was a quasi autobiography of Ayn Rand's life in the Soviet Union, my expectations were very high. However, although the depictions of life under communism and the Soviet Union were extremely important and revealing, the storyline and plot itself were very dull. Maybe that was the point--the banality and dullness of life under communism aside from all the brutality and meanness. Regardless, the story was not interesting and the characters were not interesting; it turned into a bizarre, trashy romance novel. In no way did this book come close to Atlas Shrugged or Fountainhead. Sadly, I gave it up at about half-way. Others may have gotten more out of this book, but I did not. If you want to read Ayn Rand, go with Atlas Shrugged--it is tremendous."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand wrote one good book, her first one, a novel titled We the Living. When it was published in the 1930's it was reviewed favorably as a novel of ideas. And rightly so. Her better known novels, Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, might usefully be described as novels of length, or not novels at all. Long-winded, outrageously polemical diatribes might be a better characterization. Fountainhead is the only novel I've read which romanticizes rape. (I guess it depends on who is doing the raping.) Atlas Shrugged contains an 80-plus page disquisition on the meaning and value of money. When does a novel stop being a novel and become a torturously non-sensical treatise on political economy? (Alan Greenspan's close association with Ayn Rand may account for his mumbling incoherence and the disastrous failure of his policies. Come to think of it, W's last Secretary of Commerce was an Objectivist, as well.)Insofar as th substance of We the Living is concerned, if you've read one of Ayn Rand's novels, you've read them all. This one just happens to be have more subtlety and style. Yes, the novels get longer and more overwhelmingly reactionary as time goes by, but the themes are the same: romantic heroes and heroines determined not to compmromise with a trashy, mediocritizing collectivist system. Unwanted pregnancies and subsequent back-alley abortions for collectivized women, but our heroines commitment to unbridled romantic love magically wards off the need for contraception. (One wonders how Objectivists procreate.) It's better to freeze to death (smililng with joy) in deep drifts of snow, experiencing an exhilirating sense of liberation, than to be reduced to the status of a collectivized robot. Collectivized mediocrity eventually reduces physical and intellectual promise to flabby, dispirited passivity. The monetary price of anything represents its true value. Pragmatism is a curse that eventually leads to unmitigated collectivization. And stylistically, artistic understatement is hypocrisy.Many readers, no doubt, think of Ayn Rand as a libertarian. Even libertatians, however, usually acknowledge that accidents of birth, circumstances of upbringing, and contingencies of the life course make a substantial contribution to how we see the world and what we do. For Ayn Rand, however, all this is just so much collectivist weakness. Her heroes are thoroughly willful and self-determining characters in Twentieth Century Robinsinades. They stand apart, and seemingly have done so since birth, uninfluenced by anything but forces from within. How did those forces get there? Rand doesn't even acknowledge the issue. Perhaps Rand's heroes start off as a super species of feral children.Maybe Ayn Rand sold out. Rather than develop her real gifts as a novelist, she sought a much larger following with ham-handed appeals to the young, the inexperienced, and the romantically reactionary. There's no subtlety or style in the work that followed We the Living and her second novel, Anthem, but Ayn Rand did gain a large following of proponents of her objectivist philosophy. Literary appeal for big-bucks bellicosity. Hardly seems a fair trade."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is my first Ayn Rand book; I can tell from the other reviews that I may like the others better. The edition I read provided some good notes on Ms. Rand, which helped me understand the book. I am glad that I read this book first, since it is apparently fairly autobiographical, and since it was her first book. I found the story interesting and assume that the portrayal of Russia at that period to be accurate. The only complaint I have is that I think that the story is interrupted too often with Ms. Rand's philosophizing."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand certainly brings to life the desperation and the hard living of Soviet Russia (unemployment, money problems, food problems, rationalization, etc.) but cannot keep an interesting storyline amidst 400+ pages of fluff and melodrama. Not recommended."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book might reward a long attention span but dull is really all I can say about it. The writing is typically cryptic, leaving it up to the reader to fill in the blanks, but generic banal detail fills up most of the space on the pages.The characters lifestyles are inactive, the environment never changes, and the relationships between the characters never get very complex although the relative lack of detail about the characters natures and motives always seems to want to keep you guessing. With every character in the book I was consistently thinking maybe there's more to them but there never was. Edited down to a quarter of it's length this book could have been a more engaging narrative and still maintained the value in it's depictions of everyday living in oppressive USSR society, but even then Kira's tragic romances, which were romantic for about ten seconds before they lost their lustre, would still seem pointless."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead. In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written. If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.I could not finish We the Living. I got sick of the stupid relationship. I guess I got about 1/4th the way through. Maybe my tastes are changing."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First things first. Totalitarian governments are very bad. Soviet Russia was among the worst. Anyone with any doubt of this proposition should take the time to peruse Harvest of Sorrow by Robert Conquest.That said, this book, while adding something to our understanding of the evils experienced by those suffering under Soviet Russia's domination, is quite bad and, in my opinion, not worth the time and excruciating effort to read.Kira Argounova and her family return to St. Petersburg following the Soviet Revolution. Conditions are, as one might expect, quite poor. Kira finds her ambitions checked. There is a symbolic love triangle. Simply stated, this book is a historical romance with pretensions to literary fiction. The underlying message of the story, however, is no deeper or more convincing than one would expect from a Nicholas Sparks novel.Laying aside, though, the merits of the \\"We the Living\\" philosophy, my biggest problem with this book is the, quite frankly, poor writing. My four most serious complaints follow.1. This book is overflowing with pointless verbosity - descriptions that, while wordy, convey no meaning. For example: \\"The girl looked straight at him, softly, defiantly. He answered with a glance that was an invitation, and a mocking insult, and almost a promise. Then he turned and walked to the counter, as she went out slowly.\\" The tone of the book is undermined by this absurd wordplay. I found myself, on many occasions, chuckling at Ms. Rand's pretentious languange. The subject matter of the novel is not given much to chuckling.2. Many words and phrases are repeated so often as to make this book seem like a parody. Are there really so many mocking, insolent, arrogant and defiant smiles in Soviet Russia.3. There are a number of scenes in the book that seem absurdly unrealistic. Most striking is the scene in which Kira and Leo meet. Not only do they fall in love seemingly instantaneously in a rather unusual circumstance, but they also engage in dialogue artificial enough to make Mickey Spillane blush.4. Finally, the coup de grace for me was chapter X of part 2, the preposterous meeting between Morozov and Timoshenko. The scene appears to have been lifted nearly intact from a below average episode of Three's Company. Indeed, Ms. Rand's contribution appears to be merely the lengthening of the scene from merely uncomfortably overlong to absolutely intolerable.On the positive side, the book I read featured a cool illustration by artist Nick Gaetano."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Please note that this comment is primarily about Mary Woods' unabridged reading of Ayn Rand's \\"We the Living\\" and not about any of the print editions. People mulling a 27 dollar disbursement on an audio book might be deceived about the quality of their overpriced purchase by the experience of someone who just read the book.Well - We the Randy must, must admit that the arduous amount of tedium Ayn Rand inflicts on her readership is part of her allure; any of her magna opera embark us on an intellectual endurance test of sorts and the flaws of her best and worst, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" (meaning its first two parts on the one and the third part on the other hand) are fairly balanced by the mere achievement of finishing 1084 pages of very small print without a single joke thrown in to keep you going. In fact, \\"The Fountainhead\\" might merely claim second spot in her body of work for the fact that it is less imperfect and less long than \\"Atlas\\" - this said, \\"We the Living\\" is consistent with her other novels in two major peculiarities of her writing: 1. too long for both the lack of character development and the scope of ground covered (after being introduced as a misfit simply by reason of her desiring to become an engineer, the heroine Kira disappears from her own story and spends the final 400 pages pining for an unsympathetic and undeserving lover and that's what it is); 2. a propensity to delve in speeches no matter on what on mostly the same again and again and even once more in roughly the same terms - and here, this being an early work, the speeches are but 1:1 copied from contemporary soviet propaganda, benumbing reader and protagonists alike, where craftsmanship would have condensed the message and should have provided a criticism rather than a sense of weariness that must mean Communism is bad.Luckily, for a reader trained in Ayn Rand, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn proffers approachable, but more in-depth and literarily accomplished further reading, and you might as well turn to Yevgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\" for an idea of what \\"We the Living\\" could have been in the hands of a more distinguished writer.However. Mary Woods' audio-rendition does add quite a taxing extra edge of difficulty to the usual challenges of getting through a book by Ayn Rand. Where Christopher Hurt managed to develop a marvelously even, crisp and always laconic matter-of-fact tone of voice perfectly suited to Ayn Rands all-pervading indignation, Mary Woods never seems to find into the story and struggles helplessly with the diction of Russian men - and there are endless discussions among Russian men in this - snarling, growling, huffing and croaking in voices many pitches below what the range of her voice has in stock, almost like children when they imitate the language of adults or tell a ghost story during a sleepover.This is a stupendously amateurish and ill-advised read that soon distracted even from the more enjoyable passages of the novel - in retrospect I think there was not a single moment of proper atmosphere in her almost 20 hours of performance.Maybe this is due to the source material - Mary Woods obviously has a long backlist of children's fables and -classics to her credit and surely the audience for \\"The Wind in The Willows\\" will be perfectly served by some of her vocal antics, but Toad running a black market racket should have been placed as a cameo in \\"the Muppets take Petrograd\\" where it might have had intended chuckles whereas here I just constantly dropped my earphones from shaking my head in disbelief..."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"this book as many have said is one of the worst books to ever be thought up as ayn rand was a terrible philosepher this book is a terrible read"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I'll keep this review short. Although one can be very sympathetic for anyone living under communist rule, it's hard feel anything beyond a very generalized kind of sympathy for Kira. Yes, she's living under an oppressive, totalitarian regime, and so I must acknowledge she has, as anyone would have, every right to be profoundly angry about that. However, Kira herself is in no way, shape, or form an admirable human being.Why do I say this? Because Kira is, quite simply put, selfish, and not much more.Ayn Rand says that she essentially used herself as a basis for Kira. This is not surprising, because Miss Rand herself was no great humanitarian. Yes, Miss Rand was quite correct in her assessment that communism was profoundly oppressive and could never work as a viable economic system. Having said that, perhaps Miss Rand would have done well to read the greatest book focusing on man's relationship with money ever written, this book being \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens. \\"Who is Jacob Marley?\\" seems to me a much more important question than \\"Who is John Galt?\\". \\"Mankind was my business!\\" said Mr. Marley, even as he was enduring the punishment his own selfishness had bestowed upon him. Perhaps Miss Rand would have done well to pay attention to Mr. Marley's very objective assessment of what his actions and attitudes in life should have been.Ah, but I digress; Kira just wants to get with Leo; and aside from her justifiably deep anger at the bolsheviks (please note that I deliberately decline to capitalize \\"bolsheviks\\"), there just isn't much more to her. That's why it's hard to be much more than very generally sympathetic with her. There just isn't much evidence that she really cared about anything other than what she was and what she wanted. It seems that Miss Rand never realized that glorifiying selfishness above all else does not a heroic character make.Being born under communist rule, Miss Rand does have some first-hand knowledge, so this book might be worth reading in that regard. However, this is no classic, and only those who worship money, and absolutely adore their own ego above all else, would ever think that it is."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I'm saddened to see the relevance of this book about communism, and the path our wonderful country is on today, being steered toward socialism. The collectivism, indoctrination, lies, corruption, and propaganda can easily be seen in our government today, as it was in Russia during the time of this book which was the 1920's. All who believe in our Constitution, and way of life, should read and heed before it is to late. Wake-up America."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First, above all else, do not read Leonard Peikoff's introduction. It spoils every major event in the plot before you've read the first chapter. I have never in my life read a forward that did this... the publisher on this book really needs to track down this Peikoff guy and slap him around. You just do NOT do that in a forward!As to the book itself, I was not impressed. I liked Ayn Rand's two major novels. In those, she's very good at keeping the plot going, and keeping it interesting, now matter how big things get. And of course, Rand is very philosophical, and is always making points that, whether you like them are not, are at least food for thought. Reading her two major novels is far from boring.I've said all that, because chances are anyone interested in this book has read Rand's major works already, and knows where I'm coming from. I found this book very disappointing. And I was prepared for some disappointment anyway; I knew this novel was going to be shorter, simpler, and not as polished. I didn't know it would be so plain. I just can't think of anything special, or interesting, in it at all. It's just another love story, with the misery of Soviet Russia as a backdrop."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Although the brevity of this work may make it appear attractive to someone looking for an introduction to Ayn Rand, I would save this book only for readers who can't get enough of Rand's fiction. I would recommend Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead or even Rand's nonfiction before this work; personally I think The Anti-Industrial Revolution would be the best introduction to her nonfiction.The book was not without its merits, however. This book was interesting in that it seemed to me to be the least preachy of Rand's fiction. It also had characters who were far more complex than usual for Rand. This work contained capitalists to be hated and communists to be admired, forcing Rand into relying on ideals of characters instead of personalities to get her views across. Rand claimed this book to be as close to an autobiography as she ever would write."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Even though we almost never hear about this book because it is dwarfed by the popularity of Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, I think this book is great reading in its own right. In fact, I might even suggest that readers who are curious about Ayn Rand start off with this book because it is not so long and daunting as FH and AS, yet it is still \\"totally Rand\\". She has a penchant for creating absolutist characters, many of them who go through some type of meaningful transformation for better or for worse, and she creates the perfection of characters that she wants man to be or become. Whether or not you agree with her politics (I actually don't), one can still enjoy and appreciate the points Rand is trying to make. She never just writes to tell a story - she writes to make a statement - yet she still manages to weave a great story .....and that is the beauty of Rand. Hope you read this book - and please don't neglect the afterward which I found fascinating."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"To those who say Rand's ideologies weren't developed when she wrote this book, and that you have to read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged to really understand Objectivism...well, you guys are really mistaken.\\"Kira had never been in love. The only hero she had known was a Viking whose story she had read as a child; a Viking whose eyes never looked farther than the point of his sword, but there was no boundary for the point of his sword; a Viking who walked through life, breaking barriers and reaping victories, who walked through ruins while the sun made a crown over his head, but he walked, light and straight, without noticing it's weight; a Viking who laughed at kings, who laughed at priests, who looked at heaven only when he bent for a drink over a mountain brook and there, over-shadowing the sky, he saw his own picture; a Viking who lived but for the joy and the wonder and the glory of the god that was himself.. through the years that followed, Kira remembered the end of the legend: when the Viking stood on a tower over a city he had conquered. The Viking smiled as men smile when they look up at heaven; but he was looking down. His right arm was one straight line with his lowered sword; his left arm, straight as the sword, raised a goblet of wine to the sky. The first rays of a coming sun, still unseen to the earth, struck the crystal goblet. It sparkled like a white torch. Its rays lighted the faces of those below. 'To life,' said the Viking, 'which is a reason unto itself.'\\"Many people get caught up in the politics of Rand's philosophy, but the message is clear: Every man should strive to become the best possible person he can be. Men shouldn't allow themselves to be forced to sacrifice their happiness, or to live empty lives. Rand's philosophy is clear: do what you love, and do it well. Make yourself better each day, enjoy yourself, and live your life to the fullest."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand is a controversial author, whose Objectivist philosophy has ardent followers and a significant number of haters. This book is not a push for Objectivism. It does not denounce religion. It does not glorify an industrialist or a banker. It simply shows that all that most of us want is to just live our lives, enjoy them, and not have the will of majorities, minorities, ideologies, religions, dogmas, individuals, established truths, scientific agreements or any other BS forced upon us.\\"I don't want to fight for the people, I don't want to fight against the people, I don't want to hear of the people. I want to be left alone--to live.\\" says Kira Argounova, the heroine of the book. Kira's character is based loosely on Ayn Rand herself. Ayn (Alisa Rosenbaum) came of age in Soviet Union during Bolshevik revolution. While the world proclaimed the greatness of Soviets and how all the people are free and equal, Ayn was forced to experience the freedom and equality of communism, and escaped to US as soon as possible. Millions were not so lucky. This book is a tribute to those millions, to people who braved cold Russian winters and armed guards to escape in snow storms, across mountain paths, through rivers out of the Worker's Paradise.Read this book if you want to know what life is under communism. Read it to learn about Russia of 1920's. Read it to see what human spirit is capable of.Some will draw parallels between today's political climate in US and Soviet Russia. We should not look for them even if they are easy to spot: whether it's public worker's unions in Wisconsin or crony capitalism of \\"stimulus\\\\bail-out\\". Much more relevant is to listen to ideologues of 1917 and of today.They sound the same. The method of communication may have changed (tweeter and facebook rather than speeches from atop of a tank), but the message is the same as it has been for ages: \\"Equality\\". Yet it is today same as it was always - Equality comes at a price.Andrei Taganov starts out as a villain in \\"We The Living\\". He ends his life as a villain who saw the error of his way, committing suicide to help the woman he loves and unable to deal with the hell he helped create.Andrei wanted to bring everyone up to his level, make everyone equal. He killed for that idea. And he found that you can't bring people up. You can only achieve equality down in the mud, by removing the best and brightest among us.We the Living is very different from Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead. It's a book that can hold it's own. I've read it many times and I still feel with the characters, experience their emotions. Read it so that ideologues shouting for Equality can never again create the hell that was worker's paradise."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is one of the most engaging books that I have ever read.Set in Soviet Russia, it is a story about those who want to live in a society that forbids living. We the Living is a story of romance, struggle, and most of all, of the sanctity of life.The main characters are admirable and heroic. We the Living is a beautifully developed story, with every word and dialogue advancing the plot and character development. Each character serves a very distinct purpose, and represents a very distinct idea.This story also serves as a cautionary tale. As the author has stated, it is not a story merely against the evils of Soviet Russia. More broadly, it warns against the evils of totalitarianism and exposes the ideas that make it possible.This novel can be enjoyed by itself; the writing is enjoyable, and the plot and characters are engaging and fascinating. However, if one wishes to think, there are philosophical implications in every character and every scene. This book is for anyone who understands the importance of human life."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The first Ayn Rand book I read was \\"We the Living\\", approximately 40 years ago. I then read many of her books, she remains my favorite author. I recently recommended my son read her book. He was confused by all the different last names, so I picked it up again. I was amazed at how I had actually forgotten about much of the plot of the book. I could not put it down. This was her first novel. Her husband and close friends advised her to write about her experience in Russia. This book was written in the early 1930's and finally published approximately 6 years later. There had been no first hand knowledge of the difficult life under the new United Socialists of Soviet Union. The living conditions for anyone other than the Party elites was very difficult. Reading about the living conditions, lack of food and corruption within the Red Party was most interesting. She actually wrote the book with her intent to awake Americans to the horrors and warnings of a Socialist America. What was most astounding was theloss of hope by citizens living under the communist rule. The Party members lived liked Kings, however, everyone else starved, many in the streets. If you appreciate \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\", read \\"We the Living\\". You will be alarmed by the parallels to the changes that have occurred within our Republic. I could not put the book down, the ending was gripping and eye opening as to the end result of the Collectivism. You will appreciate the forward looking vision of Ayn Rand and be alarmed by the conclusion!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is an important read because it provides a story that goes untold in our society becuase so many of the intelligentsia are sympathetic to communism.The tragedy of the the communist revolutions and the 100 million murdered in them is a story largely untold. The movie \\"The Killing Fields\\" does deal with the communist genocide in Cambodia, but generally the subject is unloved by western intellectuals. For that reason this book is a must for anyone who wants to get a glimpse of the most glossed over story in history...the tragedy of the communist revolutions."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand is an excellent writer. But I didn't need this book to prove it to me since The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged have already made that obvious. It did take this book, though, to open my eyes to what living in 1920s Communist Russia was really like...and let me tell you, it was not walk in the park. Ayn Rand is one of those writers who will have so much an effect on you after you have read just a chapter of her book that you will begin to think in the way that she writes. You'll see. She makes you so much a part of the story that you are a poor Russian girl trying to find something worth holding onto...worth living for...in a world where everything is fleeting and nothing seems to matter. I highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in Communist Russia and/or anyone who wants to read a good romance that isn't the stereotypical cookie-cutter type. This is an overlooked gem. It is just as good, if not better than the works Ayn Rand is best known for."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"There are a lot of people who dislike Ayn Rand. Whether for the rather didactic and lengthy sermons that populate most of the plots of her novels, or her own theories which tend to be underdeveloped and difficult to understand, she is not the most popular author or person in the philosophical realm. We the Living, however, is a book that one must read in order to change the perception of Rand doing what she does best: writing fiction.The novel is a harsh look at communism in the post-Red revolution of Russia, following three people: Kira, a young, idealistic, woman who bourgeois family was left poverty-stricken following the revolt; Leo, an indifferent young man haunted by the Communists due his late father's war glory; and Andrei, a Communist questioning his own beliefs in the system he has risen up in so quickly. Despite the fact that this novel is set in a far-away time and place to most of its readers, it is a book which I felt an extremely strong connection with. Everybody knows a Leo: flippant, handsome, could get any girl he wants -- but he has serious character flaws, and tends to be abusive of Kira's love for him. And Kira, the novel's protagonist, is very similar to any youth of today: she does not understand the ideals of the Communist party, but she does know what she believes and is wholeheartedly committed to fulfilling the promise she had at birth.The entire novel is beautifully written in moving prose that reflects both the harsh conditions for the people of Russia and the emotions felt between Kira, Andrei, Leo, and others as they attempt to make life better for themselves in a regime that denies them anything good without punishment. The climax of the novel is breathtaking -- by the time the final words have been read, the reader is totally attached to the characters.As with any other great novel of its time, We the Living not only characterizes the time period it is based in, but its characters live on as people of today's world, in today's capitalistic society. It questions the principles of freedom and what people will do for that freedom. This is Rand's greatest work: the philosophy is subtle, with more emphasis on the plot and the characters, but is there. Whatever you may think of Ayn Rand, you must read this novel -- it is a moving portrait of human life."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand said that \\"We the Living\\" was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Maybe that's why when I was reading WTL I got the impression that I was witnessing real scenes from Ayn's past life under the Soviet system. The uncompromising and highly principled behavior of the main character, Kira is inspiring and horrible to witness when you realize what she was up against(communist rule).Kira is not the superhero type Rand would create so well in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, but she was as close as you could expect to find in Soviet Russia. And unlike Rand's later fiction, WTL has a sad ending... an ending which really drives home the point of how collectivism's ultimate result is death -- death of the mind, death of the individual, and eventually death of everything good in society.It kept me up nights reading and many more nights pondering what it all meant. A great read!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\"We the living\\" is the lesser known of Ayn Rand's novels, yet my favorite.I'd say without doubt or hesitation that there is no novel which I have loved as much as this one(and I don't think I'll ever love any other as much as this one, too).Yes, \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" certainly are greater, but this novel had an emotional impact on me which the others did not - at least not of the same degree.Though Rand had not fully defined her unique, ground-breaking philosophy of Objectivism at the time she wrote this novel - it proffers her image of life and man which is fully consistent with her more refined novels.The theme of this novel,strictly speaking,is : \\"The evil of totalitarianism\\".Going deeper, the theme emerges to be : \\"The sanctity of human life.\\"Ultimately, this novel dramatizes how totalitarianism violates the sanctity of human life.But I'd say the fundamental abstraction is : \\"MAN'S LOVE FOR LIFE, FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS\\"And this is what reaches out to every person who reads this emotionally intense novel about a love-triangle involving a woman, an ex-aristocrat and a communist whose lives are destroyed by the system in which they live (in Communist Russia) - for I don't think there is any person in this world,except the most depraved,who doesn't value life,joy and liberty (at least his/her own).\\"We The Living\\" is about the human spirit struggling to preserve its dignity, honor and benevolence - in circumstances which break and pulverize, embitter and malign it.It is about both,the vulnerability,and the indestructibility of the human spirit.It is about man being driven by despair, hopelessness and pain to resort to incorrect means so as to achieve good ends.It is about man's struggle to preserve his values.It is about love - the kind of love which, unfortunately, I think, is found only in some novels.It is Kira's love for Leo and Andrei's love for Kira which makes WTL my best-loved novel...\\"YOU ARE MY HIGHEST REVERENCE\\"...no other writer and no other novel has given such a profound, beautiful expression to the phenomena of love.THIS is poetry, passion and man-worship - which makes love sacred, sex an act of worship and man an object worthy of the devotion which is directed at God.If you want to know what passionate love is, what does one mean by a value-oriented sense of life, what is hero-worship, read \\"We The Living\\".Though this novel lacks the explicit philosophic content of the Rand's other novels & one may think that Kira's actions, strictly speaking, are morally wrong - \\"We The Living\\" performs its objective with superb effectiveness : it makes you hate totalitarianism - whether Nazism, Fascism, Communism or the Medieval Church, the broader abstraction remains - that totalitarianism is anti-life - because it takes away man's freedom to think, to choose, to act, to pursue his/ her happiness - on his/her on terms."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was the first of Rand's novels to sell fairly well commercially. Initially it did well in Europe and less so in the USA. When the first printing was sold out in the USA, the plates were destroyed and it went out of print for close to 20 years before the combined success of THE FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED cried out for its re-publication in the United States.There is much truth in other reviewers comments here that this book seems to be written so differently than Rand's later novels. I will not disagree with anyone on that. Along with ANTHEM and a play titled THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 16th, Rand used WTL as a laboratory to express her anti-totalitarian ideas in English and in novel form. It should be remembered that Rand came here as a penniless Russian immigrant. She initially lived with relatives in Chicago and then made her way to Los Angeles where she earned her way (and began to write).Rand herself said that this book was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Obviously, Kira is an idealized fictional symbol of all that Rand held to be virtuous and worth aspiring to. She conflicts good and evil and in the process, we see that even though Kira idolizes freedom (both political and economic), she cannot accept contradictions in the man she has chosen to love.This novel portrays the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution on the lives of three people. Three people who meant very little to the totalitarian Soviet state and the Communist Party but as individual Russians, living through that dark midnight that almost extinguished hope in the hearts of the Russian people, Kira, Leo and Andrei are as alive as any of the classic characters found elsewhere in important literature.Kira comes to the story as part of an affluent Russian family that loses everything after the Bolsheviks seize power during &quot;kraznaya Oktobriana.&quot; After the Bolsheviks expropriate all of their property for the &quot;good of the proletariat,&quot; their lives change dramatically. Kira, who wanted to be a builder loses her chance for continued education and position because she will not conform to the new &quot;Soviet ideal.&quot;Eventually, she meets Leo Kovalensky, a Russian aristocrat who stands unbowed before the altar of Soviet justice. He refuses to recognize the hegemony of the new system over any aspect of his life. Kira, admiring this fierce individuality, falls for Leo and comes to stand by his side. She knows that she has met her &quot;Viking god.&quot;Andrei Taganov is the ultimate instrument of the Soviet state. He wears a leather jacket and carries all the authority of the new dictatorship. In ages past, he would have worn the helmet of a Roman Centurion or the armor of a crusading knight. But always, he would have been the symbol of some governmental oppression. He is a born secret policeman in a system that required men all too willing to torture and imprison their fellow men.As Rand writes about the early Soviet system, it is obvious that this novel could have been set in any system that denied individual freedom. Rand chose to write about Soviet Russia because it was what she knew. Similar stories could have come out of Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. Rand chose Russia.This is a story of what happens to people when all freedom is lost. It is a marvelous tale of people who struggle valiantly against insurmountable odds to maintain their individuality, dignity and freedom. It is a moral allegory of just what happens to the human spirit when the individual is subjugated to the mind-numbing and degrading indignities imposed from above by second-handers who created nothing but only denied everything.This is one of the finest novels of its type that you will ever read. It is worth reading, especially if the reader has already read THE FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED if for no other reason than to discover Rand's starting point. If you have not read any of Rand's other works then, this is a great place to start. WTL is where she began to formulate her ideas on the ultimate value of the individual and the worth of the reasoning human intellect.To be sure, this is an indictment on the danger to mankind everywhere on the depredations of any collective system. This is an unapologetic damnation of Communism as it was then and what it eventually became. Rand has no mercy and shows no compassion or willingness to understand why men and women would give up themselves to be part of a system that denies basic rights and degrades the individual.Read this book and you will come to understand why Communism was ultimately destined to fail. It failed because it collapsed under the weight of its own inherent internal contradictions. We are all the more fortunate that Rand saw all of this so clearly early on. We are even more fortunate that her predictions for the ultimate demise of Communist tyranny came true and that individual ploitical and economic freedom have taken root throughout countries that once denied even the slightest scintilla of personal liberty.Read WE THE LIVING and discover one of the most original minds in the 20th Century."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I was not surprised at all to find reviews that only attacked Ayn Rand's vivid account on Soviet Russia. As a 14 year old, I read The Fountainhead and taking into consideration the disgust of society on Gail Wynand makes me perfectly understand why I could only find bad reviews on We the Living. I similarly noticed that reviewers did not enjoy the novel because it was &quot;too depressing.&quot; Well I would believe that Soviet Russia in the early 20th century was not exactly roses and sunshine. We the Living was one of the most realistic novels I have ever read. This was actually my very first introduction to Ayn Rand and made me admire Ayn Rand as my favorite author. The vivid descriptions of how communism destroyed Russia were amazingly intense, and her portrayal of the protagonists and antagonists elevated this level of intensity and intrigue.Many people despise Andrei for being a communist, Kira for devoting her life to an empty man, and Leo for being that empty man. I am almost positively sure that Ayn Rand already had all this in mind for her readers. Such conclusions on these characters are superficial. Andrei is labeled as a communist, but the reader must grasp the value behind this label. He is an individualist at heart, and commits suicide because he realized the waste of his life as a supporter of communism. Kira is a bold young woman pillared by ambition. What makes her a heroic character is that she never sacrifices her morals or values for her surrounding etiquette that plagued man. Leo is the complexity of the novel because he leads readers to despise both Andrei and Kira, but in the name of individualism, Andrei and Kira must be recognized as individuals and not because of an empty man.I have never cried at any movie or any book before We the Living. The intellectual intensity collapsed at the end, and I could not help myself from sobbing because of my deep appreciation for Kira's character.I challenge every person who detests We the Living to read it once more and think deeper of the wider meaning of this powerful message to man."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I found this to be an interesting read and a good plot, however, I didn't think any of the main characters were admirable at all. Not that likable main characters are essential to a book/plot, but I am surprised by the other reviewers who really admire Kira and others who find that Andrei is the only &quot;real man&quot; in the book; a man who never betrays his values. First, on the Andrei front, while he does display the most virtue regarding his loyalty and stoicism, let's not forget that his loyalty led him to gun down peasants and farmers whom the communists felt were &quot;cheating&quot; them out of their share of crops. While the reader only sees Taganov when he's being an upstanding, passionate man who has strength of character and loves Kira honestly, Andrei's monologues allow us a glimpse into what he does on the job with the GPU. He seems comfortable with the killing and torture that made the USSR such a fun place to live under the communists.Regarding Kira, her determination to live as an individual is admirable, however, her devotion to the empty Leo seems out of character. It's as though she's really only attracted to him physically. That makes her interesting, but not someone to model your life after, as so many other readers seem to suggest.I thought the description of life in Soviet Russia was particulary well done. It's hard to believe that people (communists) actually talked like that, but Rand grew up in this period and has indicated that this aspect is accurate.This is an excellent story, but it's thoroughly depressing."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"That so many people find this their favorite of Ayn Rand's work is not surprising; of all of her novels, this is the most straightforward. The narrative carries the story forward, rather than the philosophy, and a great narrative it is. Rand manages to encompass almost all of the dreariness and paranoia of Stalinist Russia by following the lives of three young people involved in a love triangle of sorts. We the Living explains why Rand took such &quot;harsh&quot; stances in favor of capitalism - she lived the alternative, and found it repugnant in the extreme. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"One thing always there but often not noticed in Ayn Rand's other works is an amazing sense of the environment. One really feels like one is living in the worlds Rand creates. This is particularly noticeable in this book, and it gives the reader a great awareness of what it is like to live under communism. Not only are the results of communism evident, but so are clear links to the cause (the absence of human rights). On top of all this, We the Living has great characters whom we get to observe as they change (or not, in Kira's case) under the brutal regime."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I have read virtually all of Rand's works; studied them, in fact and written reviews on most of them (favorably, always). But this book, We The Living, by Ayn Rand, I suggest reading AFTER you have read one of her popular (very popular) fictional works such as Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead. My reason for this suggestion of time-ordering your selection of reading is this: Please read all of the reviews in this section and take them as fact (believe them, quite literally), then consider how different this work has been described as compared to Rand's popular fiction and also the fact that &quot;We the Living&quot; was rand's first attempt at making it big (in the sense of getting her message across, which she acomplished Quite well). You will see that she changed her format: We the living was described by Rand &quot;as being the closest she had come to an auto biography.&quot;This is the most powerful, moving book that you will experience (period). If you know of another which forms an exception to my statement, please email me. But,THIS, her early life, in Soviet Communist Russia, a hellish (to say the least) existence is what motivated Rand to speak out, to write about philosophy... When you read The Fountainhead, you will have fun, no doubt, and that is why it sold... but we the living is for Lover's of existence, un-coerced existence, which brings me to my final point on this book:NOBODY can disagree with this book; note that no no one has, in the reviews above. In itself, the omission of negative reviews is amazing. If you read this book and are passionately moved (motivated) by it, then then you owe it to yourself to OBJECTIVELY (with an &quot;open/active-mind,&quot; ) pick up and study another of Rand's non-fictional works such as &quot;the Virtue of Selfishness,&quot; or &quot;Capitalism the Unknown Ideal,&quot; or &quot;The New Left: the Return of the Primitive&quot;. Don't get me wrong: There are plenty of people who will disagree, on first reading her non-fiction (possibly her fiction too), but there are essentially NONE who disagree, upon reading &quot;We the Living,&quot;. My point is: They are ALL the same! Only presented in different formats.You won't find anyone, today, who will even attempt to tell you that communist or socialist systems are better than capitalism. 1989, in Russia, was a clear demonstration, and stands as a refutation to any such suggestion. Rand was and is correct. Read her work. This one will bring tears to your eyes, enlightenment to your soul AND will, once and for all... if you have the discipline to think about it long enough, concretize (to use Rand's terminology) exactly why tax-and-spend-big-government is a threat to the best within us: INDIVIDUALITY. A quote from Rand &quot;thinking is not a collective activity.&quot; Think about it, PLease."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Sometimes the living end up dead, killed by systems that refuse to allow independent thought or life. In a land inspired by the words \\"Give me Liberty or Give me Death\\" we might think Rand's story only pertains to the communist Soviet Union. Howevever, 'We the Living' is for anyone in any time or place who wants to transform their lives from existence to life or, as the Greek philosopher's would say, from bios to zoe.I hate the ending, not in the literary sense but because I revolt against the idea that a choice to live should bring anything other than its own rewards. Yet this was reality in the Soviet system. The concept of individual destiny was anathema to communist control. Proponents of independant thinking were treated as dangerous terrorists.We fail to grasp Rand's message if we believe the moral of the story is unnecessary after the fall of the Soviet Union or only applies in countries such as Rwanda, Somalia and North Korea. Rand deftly demonstates throughout the book that we who choose to live in the way she describes will face opposition; from our families or friends, from organized religions which teach that such personal freedom can only be found through the tenets of their faith, and from government systems which consistently push for more control of every thread weaving through our culture.Who are the real identity thieves of our time? Someone stealing our credit card and social security number which lowers our FICA score? Or is it just as dangerous if we are not allowed our own lives so that mass merchandising, global consumerism and partisan politics can prevail? I challenge you to read this book and join the living no matter what the cost."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Describing what life was really like in the early days of Soviet Russia, this little novel speaks with a powerful voice against the tyrrany of collectivism. Ayn Rand demonstrates in this work her remarkable gift for rational philosophy and skillful storytelling. Many lines in the novel have passed repeatedly through my mind since reading them, and many characters and scenes live in my memory. Everyone should read this compelling story of the struggle for human freedom."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":". . . it still shows the keen intellect behind her writing. The character development seen in Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead is there as well. Yet the book doesn't quite move as well as her later novels. Nevertheless, ten times better than the typical novel. Ayn Rand makes a searing indictment of communism, a system she grew up with and knew only too well."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"If you want to know what life was like in communist Russia in the 20's, this is a great read. If you're interested learning why communism failed and why America is headed in a terrifying direction today, read this.If you're interested in Rand's philosophy on capitalism and a better story line, try Atlas Shrugged instead. Personally, I would skip this for either Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\"We the Living\\" is an autobiographical historic novel of Ayn Rand's life in the Soviet Union during her youth from age 12 to 21, when she was able to escape to America.Every American should read this book in order to understand what the Soviet Union was all about and what totalitarian governments do to people. It is an extraordinarily cautionary tale, which is essentially a true story in essence.Of all Ayn Rand's writings, this is the one which appears to me to have the greatest literary value - and this is the one subject that Ayn Rand actually knew and lived first hand.This book gives readers great insight in why anti-communism swept the world, and why fascists, Mussolini, Hitler and Japan's Tojo was able to use anti-communism, the legitimate fear of communism, to grasp control in their own countries, and to almost rule the world.In fact for American to really understand anti-communism in America, and to understand WWII and the 20th century, they need to read \\"We The Living\\", a true horror story of idealistic communism in Russia.It should be used extensively in our public schools to teach civics, history, current events, and English literature.Sadly, this book is not nearly as widely read as it needs to be."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"In this book, Ayn Rand provides the reader with the expereince at looking at how important each individual human life is, how it is detstroyed under communism (or any dictatorship), and how man needs freedom in order to live. She should know. She was born and lived in Russia under communism, until she moved permanently to America at the age of 21. Thank you Ayn Rand for having the courage to leave the hellhole you grew up in, which only got worse later, and for coming to America and writing novels like this one, to warn people of the evils of totalitarianism. You will NEVER be forgotten."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read WE THE LIVING some time ago after reading several works by Ayn Rand. I tried to re-read it again, and just couldn't do it. Rand's characters are typically very strong and draw you into the story. Many times, Rand uses extreme settings which are typically unrealistic requiring the reader to image a world outside of anything they have seen. This book, however, is more autobiographical depicting Rand's personal experience fictionalized thru Kira's tale of a young woman's desire to escape her communist world.This book, I found to be a difficult read. Not only because of the tragedies, sad state of suffering under communism, or broken hearts, but simply because it just doesn't compare to Rand's other novels (ATLAS SHRUGGED is my favorite). Rand's other novels are easy reads (even though they are lengthier) with developing characters that pull you into the story. She incorporates different views of philosophy, society and more in each of the characters she establishes. Her characters typically either stay the same or change as a result of a realization of who they are. But that is not the case in this book.Andrei, is introduced as the seemingly heartless communist but then evolves into a character the reader sympathizes with through several events in the story. Kira and Leo begin as realistic characters and, contrary to Rand's other character developments, they become cold-hearted resulting in a loss of sympathy from the reader. Kira's behavior creates a mixture of emotions from the reader. Sometimes you want to help her, and sometimes you just want to close the book especially when she destroys the true hero of the novel - yet, the reader is expected to understand that all is simply in search of freedom. Although the ending is a bit disappointing, it is appropriate considering the story Rand is attempting to tell. Any other ending would have conflicted with other areas of the novel and what Kira represents.Personally, this book is nowhere near as strong as ATLAS SHRUGGED or THE FOUNTAINHEAD but some may find it to be a good read."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I picked up a musty old copy from the 1959 recently..being in a glow about Atlas. This book moved me beyond belief with the struggles and harsh realities presented. I probably am one of the few Rand readers that like her clumsy style but in this story, her words flowed well and the American reader did not get all mixed up with long names and places that we could not reference. To quote Ayn: &quot;..is not a novel about Soviet Russia. It is a novel about Man against the State. Its basic theme is the sanctity of human life...&quot; To those who associate Ayn with the defenders of big companies and nazism...remember her semi autobiographical outlet in Kira. People that were Ayn's protagonists were those with life premises, to live and exist for themselves. Be it Dagny or Andrei, Ayn Rand's message was true and bittersweet."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"You don't have to buy into the Objectivist philosophy to enjoy this novel. I certainly don't. But I marval at Rand the dramatist. The woman knew how to write good books. However, if you identify yourself as a socialist/collectivist/liberal democrat, you probably will find much here at which to take offense."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is a must read. Especially with the current political battles going on, the dangers of communism and socialism to the human spirit are explicitly laid out in this virtual autobiography. (The author uses real life experience to form the story.) Even her preface warns Americans not to slip into the \\"comforts\\" of a state-run police, government, etc... I think the 75th Anniversary is out too, either one a brilliant read, but the Preface AND Forward are enlightening in this version too. Also, even though it is a political thriller/ drama, there's plenty of romance and feeling to engage anyone with a soul really. The main character, Kira, is a character of such depth and quality... Wow."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The theme of this novel is the individual against the state or, more specifically, how the totalitarian government of Russia in the few years following the 1917 Communist revolution destroys a girl, Kira, the man she loves who also loves her, Leo, and a man who loves her who she does not love, Andrei. It is also the story of the conflict between quite a few people, especially these three. A significant event is when Kira agrees to sleep with Andrei and have a lasting relationship with him in order to save Leo's life. Andrei knows nothing about Leo's problems and is convinced that Kira loves him. Kira continues to live with Leo who also knows nothing about her relationship with Andrei.What mars this otherwise well-written and engrossing novel is Ayn Rand's attempt to portray her characters as the embodiment of her philosophy. Despite her attempt, the characters do not reflect Rand's idea of \\"rational self interest.\\" Kira is portrayed at the outset of the novel as self-assured and totally independent, interested only in becoming an engineer. However, as soon as she meets Leo, she falls head over heels in love with him and obeys his every command as a slave. True, the revolution destroys her. But, so, too, does love. Leo, the man she loves, also starts life with Kira self assured and interested in his goals, but he, unlike Kira, never loses these Ayn Rand attributes. However, although he clearly loves Kira, he treats her badly because of his self-interest. The word \\"ordered\\" is associated with him frequently. His \\"rational self interest\\" destroys the caring that love demands of one who loves. Only, Andrei, who Rand calls \\"the villain\\" in her The Art of Fiction, acts with reasonable \\"rational self interest.\\" He is also interested in his own development. However, he treats Kira with sensitivity."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Critics of Rand, when pointing to her more popular classics Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, often point out the exaggerated nature of the situations her characters are in. They suggest that Rand made her characters seem more heroic by creating unrealistic enemies and overblown conflicts.Yet, in We the Living, Rand can't be accused of hyperbole. Her most autobiographical novel, it tells the story of the young and ambitious Kyra Argounova, and her struggles to maintain her individualism in the tumultuous time of 1920's Soviet Russia. Readers will wisely note the similarities between Rand's own life and that of the character of Kyra.Although it may have been the novel that most successfully captured the struggle of life in Soviet Russia, the story is, as Rand points out, certainly not merely about the struggle of Kira to retain her freedom against the Communist Party, but rather, more generally, the struggle of the individual to retain their soul against the attempts of the state to strip it away.In response to Rand's critics, yes, this is her most realistic work of fiction. And that is exactly why it should not be overlooked. Ayn Rand experienced life under the thumb of the Communists first-hand, and this book captures it perfectly. There can be no claim of exagerated villains, because these villains were real.Simultaneously depressing, as we see freedom slowly being destoyed, and uplifting, as we see Kira struggle to live on, We the Living will challenge your ideas of politics, as all of Rand's novels do. Hopefully, after reading this book, you'll want to keep your politics to yourself, and understand why socialism will always be doomed to failure."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Although I couldn't honestly say that this book changed my life, I have never read anything that haunted me as much as _We, the Living_ does. A year after reading it I still find myself reliving scenes and going back to reread chapters that are so familiar I might have written them myself. Kira, like Howard Roark (_The Fountainhead_), does not grow during the novel, but she struggles to stay honest to herself and to her own ideals even though a hundred million people tell her that she can't. Rand's prose style is bitterly exact, even more astonishing because she didn't learn English until her twenties (similar to Joseph Conrad). Anyone who feels that communism was a good idea should read this book to see an alternate view, provided with clarity and honesty."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"While writing We the Living, Ayn Rand was still mastering the nuances of the English language after her emigration to America. It doesn't matter; she hits a literary homerunanyway. This is the essential Rand, antiticipating the brilliance of the Fountainhead and utilizing subtlety I wish she had exercised in Atlas Shrugged. You'll be carried away by Rand's protagonist, Kira, a hero in the classic sense of the word. At the same time, you'll be devastated by Rand's all too accurate description of the drudgery and misery of post-revolutionary Russia."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand is one of the greatest authors of all times. This book tells of life in Russia under the communist regime. I recommend it for all young people. A great warning about the necessity for freedom and individual liberty."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The Iron Curtain may have melted with Soviet Glasnost in the 80's, but it's important to remember what it was like. The longer time passes from the days of \\"Better Dead than Red\\" ... the more crucial it is to remember why democracy is a privilege. Many Americans do not realize the privilege of their citizenship - Freedom. A must read!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"If you're like me, you devoured Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead. I went into reading We The Living with the same expectations only to find the characters not nearly as intriguing and the plot plodding. The last fifty pages or so were fantastic but this reader is unsure whether it's worth the journey to get there."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is wonderful! You can't help but wonder what will happen to the main character of this book. Who will she fall in love with? Will she make it out of Russia? It made me want more...and introduced me to the world of Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I have read every one of Ayn Rand's fiction books and this is definitely the best written one. You don' get the sometimes annoying 1 page monologues from characters that you see in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.However, there are some serious problems with the plot. For instance, about 1/3 of the way through the book we find out that Kira, Leo, and her family all make it on the Purge list and will be kicked out of Petrograd. And then...absolutely nothing happens from it!!! It's never mentioned again. Another problem is the constant vascillation of Andrei. It seems he goes from bad to good and back again just to keep the plot moving. And what about Maurissa? Kira and Leo can't stand her as their neighbor and then all of the sudden their best friends.This is a pretty good book but points to the inevitable fact that Ayn Rand can not be considered a great wirter of fiction. Her books are merely allegorical attempts (successful ones, I may add) at encapsulating her Objectivist philosophy into an easily digestible form for the reader."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"For those of you who excroriate Rand for one-sided hatred of Communism, let me just point out that she was born under it, and she ought to know. The first hundred pages of this book are the best thing Rand ever wrote --complicated characters, and a vivid, chilling depiction of life under the Bolsheviks. Of course, then Rand the proselytizer elbows her way in, and it's downhill from there. One can forgive Rand for hating Communism, but to go a mile in the opposite direction and espouse such a brutal solipsism is perhaps a sign of some psychological problems on her part. What would the world be like if everyone were to declare himself a monomaniacal Dr. Doom surrounded by foolish mortals? Brilliant she may have been, but, unfortunately, also totally nuts."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We The Living is a masterfully crafted tragedy recounting the life of Kira Argounova. Kira, born at the revolutionary dawn of the Soviet Union, is continually alone. Likewise she is doomed to live and die in a dismally solitary existence made even more lonesome by the presence of two men. One is Leo a former aristocrat-turned-dishonest and the other is Andrei the Communist. The men could not be any more disparate in their inadequacies, feelings and ideology. And yet they share Kira, which is a common theme for Ayn Rand: the book's hero(ine) is simultaneously involved with more than one lover . Notwithstanding that, as the protagonists, Kira and Leo are graceful, agile and sharp.The setting is an abusive state which believes its contribution to its citizens and the world so great as to exceed any kind of justification.Well-written and eloquent, Kira is exaggerated and yet thankfully disruptive. Romantic and tragic twists and turns follow, but Kira's character is always as dismal and wretched as the book. In this context it is remarkable how Kira unselfishly serves Leo while Ayn Rand goes on to make a career as the advocate for the mantra of narcissism.Despite Rand's protestations, We The Living is about the Soviet Union - one tainted by her personal outlook. While her Objectivist philosophy has not been fully developed here, it exists at the underlying and subconscious level. Which explains why We The Living remains as Rand's most explicitly political novel. Of course, with passion and resolve running through her, she never paused to consider how the USSR is not what Marx had in mind. Which is just as well, because as noted We The Living lives off the author's unbridled commitment to her conviction. For Rand's world is ultimately made only of two shades, Soviet red and Capitalist eden.\\"Comrade burglars, please don't bother. There's nothing inside\\""},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I was drawn into the novel by the heroine's devotion to her ideals but was finally let down by a weak ending. I wonder, though, if this was Rand's goal? Maybe the story of a Russian girl who holds to her ideals in the communist Soviet Union doesn't have a grand finale? Maybe she is simply crushed by the weight of socialism that sees her only as part of a collective. Besides the ending, though, the plot is engaging and interesting. The writing isn't quite on par with Rand's later works (this being her first novel) but the presentation of her fledgling philosophy and her social commentary make the book worthwhile on every level."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"this book left me absolutly breathless. i have read all of her other novels and found this to be the most touching. Kira was unlike any other character i have ever gotten to know, she has a charming quality. i could not get enough of her. i cried for 45 minutes when i finished and later when i thought about it. i am 16 and i go to enloe high in raleigh nc. this book is incredible. raw and true to human nature. i enjoyed it most b/c it was not fancy with the happy endings and over done unrealistic love. read it. it is true to LIFE. and how people truly are. and appreciate what that means to you."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I must be the strangest 18-year old on earth. I love the philosophy behind Rand\`s works, and We the Living is one of my favorites. Her characters are dynamic and the plot is gripping. I am seriously considering sending a copy of this book to Washington so that they can see what they're turning this country in to."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the living by Ayn Rand is a stark reminder of society where the rights of the individual are forsaken for the masses, and the bleak existence that follows. thought provoking read!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book was put together very well and was easy to understand what was happening in Russia and the characters who were in the book. If you want to know what the Russian people went through when socialism took over this is a good book to read. Could happen in America if we are not careful."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"A wonderful story about incredible love (Kira's for Leo) that sadly occurred during the Bolshevik revolution in Soviet Russia. It clearly and explicitly depicts what a totalitarian government does to people and their spirits - and to the most basic instinct - love. I couldn't put it down, so much did I want things to work out for any of these people. What tragic lives all those Russians lived during those days and until, honestly, Ronald Reagan. Everyone should read this book NOW to find out where we are headed unless things change and we remember OUR revolution and what it stood for."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Red this book if you respect the right of the individual, of the right of all human beings to be free. Free to choose their way of living, of existing. This book will remind us all in a free society how precious this freedom is. You will feel for the main characters in this book and cry at the tragedies that befall them. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It seems as though everyone has their own view of Ayn Rand's work; some agree with every point she makes to the point of obsession, some think that she is a terrible writer and philosopher and should not be published. She is definately a controversial writer. However, this book is different from pretty much all of her other work in that it concentrates more on the story than anything else. It was written before Rand's philosophy was completely forulated, which is definately a good thing in my opinion. The reader doesn't have to worry about agreeing completely with parts of the book and being repulsed by other aspects; it isn't a philosophical novel.The fact that this is a love story and that I (who hates most &quot;love&quot; stories and wanted the butler to catch that stupid couple in Titanic) really enjoyed reading it speaks volumes. It takes an inquisitive look at the nature of love and how it works... and is usually extremely true when applied to real life (unlike some parts of her &quot;masterpieces&quot; The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged). The characters are extremely real and the setting is based on Rand's past experiences, which really adds to her work. Don't worry... although there are your typical speeches at the end by the antagonists and protagonists, they are not rants about how great capitalism is and how it is the best thing in the world to be selfish. The theme is totalitarianism and what it does to the human spirit, not &quot;Prime Movers and how they function.&quot;I would reccomend this book to anyone interested, not just the people obsessed with Objectivism. Of course, this is Rand's least-known book, so the general public will probably get their first taste of her through The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged, which is a shame. When she's at her best, Ayn Rand doesn't have to resort to rants that are in essence, a giant overreaction to things."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand created a beautiful expression here. Personally, I've never known her better, than at 2:00 AM last evening when I finshed this work. I've been a big fan of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, admittedly full of obvious characters and grueling tirades. Subtlety is not always the benchmark by which I judge a book. So for that difference, I've loved these books, where many experienced readers have felt a nauseating boredom. &quot;We the living&quot; is just a fantastic expression of a talented and driven young woman (Ayn Rand). I think the average reader will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12. I loved it then and didn't fully comprehend it. I love it now more. People seem to misunderstand the purpose of this book and Ayn Rand herself. She didn't misunderstand socialism and communism, she lived through it. We the Living was written about the time period and the events one who lived it saw and experienced. It was a dark and brooding work, but more realistic than anything else of what living under such a regime was like than anything else you can find."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Excellent read. Interesting and insightful. Helped me understand how Communist Russia was and what Socialism does. Makes me want to read more from Rand."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This classic story by Ayn Rand should be required reading in all secondary schools @ 7th grade level. It's a story of how the individual spirit in all of us strives to come out regardless of the forces mustered against individualism in favor of collectivism."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It does, however, need to be read. If you don't think it is realistic, your eyes are not open."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am 2/3 of the way through reading WTL and bought a copy of the WTL movie made in 1942 Italy. I would say the book is a million times better than the movie, but I really enjoyed the movie, and the great lengths they went through during the reign of Mussilini to hide one copy of the movie in a basement so it couldn't be destroyed. They also went to great lengths to make the movie as the 1942 Italian government was very fascist. If you read the book you should see the DVD movie. But if you haven't read the book, you will not enjoy the movie half as much, as the movie has to leave so much out. To me, this is a story about the reality of life in a communist country. People were starving, crawling around on the ground to eat the empty sunflower seed shells and cigarette butts. They have to cook on a little kerosene Primus stove and heat their ROOM, their homes are taken from them, in a metal box, they can't afford the logs to heat up a whole fireplace. Everyone lives in absolute poverty and fear of the ruling elite, who by the way take their homes and they are corrupt and have plenty to eat - while the masses starve. Anyone who has a love affair with communism should read this book and watch the 1942 movie WTL. Now I totally understand why people try to escape Cuban communism to come to American freedom. Let Freedom Ring! God Bless America!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As soon as I started reading this book I could not put it down. It's the best thing I've read in a long time! I can't give it 5 stars because to me the dialogue comes off as kind of stilted and unnatural-sounding--but the dialogue is by no means the most important aspect of the book. It has the kind of propulsive plot that makes you wish you could read faster so you could find out what happens next, and Ayn Rand's descriptive writing is peerless. It really blows my mind to think she only learned English when she was in her twenties. I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is fabulous! I now plan to read everything else Ayn Rand ever wrote."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Once I read On The beach by Nevil Shute and thought that was the most depressing novel I'd ever read then I came by this book and it beat them all by a mile. Even though despare practicly clings to this book and can feel it's strength through every page, the carecters in this book were amazing. The way rand built them up to such high standerds then tore each of the apart piece by piece fascinated me. Leo is a great example. ayn rand was a very talented writer and her styil of writing proved it. This book will stick in my heart for a long time and it true message also"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"If you enjoy Rand, I am delighted to direct you to another &quot;Randlike&quot; novel, THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. In THE LAST DAY, Kleier tackles the subject of authority in organized religion with startling &quot;Ayn Rand&quot; objectivism and outrageous wit and irreverence. LAST DAY is a classic, watershed novel in the manner of FOUNTAINHEAD and SHRUGGED. I found it a riveting read, and one that I greatly encourage all Rand fans to experience."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I thought &quot;We The Living&quot; was an incredibly moving book. The love and devotion between these two characters was incredible. Every word that Rand wrote made me feel like I was the one experiencing the hardships and triumphs that were experienced. I believe this is a very true experience of what it was like to grow up in communist Russia from 1920 to 1945. Since this was supposed to be the closest thing to an autobiography of Rand I think we can experience more clearly what most people did from that time period."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this novel is different from Ayn Rand's others: it actually qualifies as literature rather than propaganda.The characterization is a little off (e.g. Leo stops being an attractive character in fairly short order), and the alterations from the original version do show. (Rand apparently wanted to make it more &quot;capitalistic&quot; and less &quot;Nietzschean&quot; -- cf. Kira's desire to become an &quot;engineer,&quot; of which nothing whatsoever is made in the novel. And see the earlier versions of some of Kira's speeches, available in _The Journals of Ayn Rand_.) But it's actually a pretty good novel about the individual human being vs. the collectivist State.The rest of the Randian oeuvre is too didactic and too full of cardboard, self-serving moralizing to be classified as &quot;literature&quot;; it's more like the stuff the Soviet propaganda machine used to crank out, only in favor of Rand's version of &quot;capitalism&quot; rather than Soviet communism.But in this novel we see a hint of what Rand could have become if she'd tried. She wrote this one while her mind was still among the living."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is a haunting portrayal of the harsh reality of too much power. Ayn Rand was able to achieve her objective in opening eyes as to the impact of the Russian Revolution on the individual. It is the story of those who love life and that which threatens its existence."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Some people seem to come away a little disappointed from this novel. I would guess that this is because this is one of Rand's lesser known works. The people who read this seem to have already made an acquaintance of Rand through The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Expecting the same tenor of philosophical writing, they are disappointed that this book contains little more than the emotional core of individualism. There is hardly any concrete philosophy, beyond a depiction of collectivism as it really is, in this book.In truth, this book is Rand's best writing. We the Living is a true-to-life depiction of life under totalitarian rule. It's not philosophical. It's not journalistic writing - it applies to life under totalitarianism anywhere. We the Living shows the essential battle between the individual and the collective.We the Living has a certain raw, emotional quality (which may be due to the fact that much of it is drawn directly from the author's experience. The closing scene of this novel has a depth of feeling rarely found in any literature.I would recommend this as the first Rand novel one should read, followed by The Fountainhead. I would particularly recommend these two books to teenagers, as there is a great deal in both that resonates with the spirit of youth. Atlas Shrugged is a more philosophical novel, which is still important, even essential reading, but only after We the Living and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is another incredible book by Ayn Rand. Every character is well thought out and the setting follows well with the history of the times. I have read her book Anthem and was very impressed and thought I'd try this out as well and I'm glad I did. I hate to read but this is a book I could read over and over. Each character has some agaonizing trouble but Kira is a ray of hope for each of them. Read this book..."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ms. Rand states in the foreward of her debut novel, We the Living, that it's the closest thing to an autobiography she's ever written, and it also marked her beginning as a novelist in the Romantic Realist school using a new language(English), since she left the Soviet Union. Anyone who claims that Rand is not really a novelist should read this book. The character development is without a doubt the most professional and urbane of any of her works, and the imagery she uses to immerse the reader into the dark, cruel, and depressing soul of Petrograd in the early to mid 1920's is downright impressive. It's obvious that she used a tremendous of time and effort to translate her thoughts onto the page while still trying to master the English language. Perhaps this is why the book is so well crafted and never varies in its painstaking realism from start to finish. There are no long speeches or oratories in this wonderful work, it is a rather plodding, brooding, and sensual piece of continual development from start to finish. Only a self-made author as Ms. Rand calls herself, and I might add one who is very gifted and able, could have written such a great piece of historical literature, which is still a very relavant and vibrant read to this day. Yes, it provokes thought as any work of her's does, however, she does not hammer the reader over the head with her beliefs, but rather lets it meld into the storyline. I would love to hear somebody say that Ms. Rand cannot write well and isn't a real novelist after reading this marvelous and steady piece of prose, for I would say that it's far better than anything done by Pasternak or many of the other modern Russian novelists of &quot;acclaim,&quot; and of course it's of much more value. Only a fool would doubt that Rand's work does not reveal a person of pure genius and unadulterated greatness. After reading We the Living, only a very stupid fool, can honestly say that she's not a skilled novelist or very talented writer. Another triumph for this unique and precious literary visionary. We probably won't see one like her ever again, but I'm hoping that we don't quit trying to surpass her acheivements. I know she wouldn't want us to! Live and think brothers and sisters.

To an American reader the descriptions may seem unreal: &quot;did people really talk that way? behave that way?&quot; Yes, they did, even in the more prosperous post-Stalin times.

It stayed with me for 6 years until I read We The Living. This is the best book, and I live by it. If you like to think, if you aren't very religious and you are an individual then this book is for you. It is more than a love story, it is intellectual and thought provoking. Now 7 years from reading Anthem and 1 from reading We The Living, I am now reading Atlas Shrugged and I love it. So to all those out there who condemn Ayn Rand for her beliefs (and mine) all I have to say is you don't understand, you are the people she says are evil in her books and you prove it when you bad mouth her."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is my favorite of Ayn Rand's books. I began my love affair with &quot;We the Living&quot; back in the fifties and read it several times each year. My attitude toward Kira Argounova, however, has changed drastically as I've grown older. She represented a fascinating, fearless heroine who stood alone against a brutal world. But then I began to wonder why did she give up everything for the sadistic, beautiful Leo while delbirately destroying the only heroic character in the book: Andrei? Through the book, Kira arrogantly insists that nothing is greater than a person's ego. Yet, she becomes hot for the body of the Russian god, Leo, and goes crazy over him. Leo belongs with Rand's gallery of villians and I would definitely put Kira Argounova in there with them. She destroyed a noble, intense young Russian warrior in order to keep her sleazy hunk alive. There's nothing admirable or noble in what she does. She would fit in with the hookers on 42nd Street here in NYC."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand warns, in riveting fiction, of the fate that awaits those who succumb to the false promises of socialism. Unless you're asleep, it's hard to miss the similarity of language that steers the revolutionaries of early 20th century Russia and that of the current US administration. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Author Ayn Rand is best known for her objectivist novels \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" but those were not her first forays into fiction, nor were either her first novel. \\"We the Living\\" was Rand's first novel, published in 1936.In \\"We the Living,\\" Rand is still working on the ideals behind her philosophy of objectivism, a philosophy that focuses on the individual and the freedom of the individual and capitalism. The ideals are there in this book, and they're strong, but it's obvious she still doesn't have it all quite worked out yet. But that should not disappoint any of Rand's fans, because the novel is still entertaining and strong, though admittedly not as dogmatic as her later works.This novel covers three years, from 1922 to 1925, and the life of one young woman struggling to survive in the first days of the Soviet Union. Life is harsh for everyone, but especially so for an individual who wishes to be free from the restraints and influences of the collective. In an introduction to the novel Rand herself called the book semi-autobiographical, saying it related the world and experiences she knew during her last few years in the U.S.S.R. However, the events portrayed are not supposed to have been based upon real happenings.Surprisingly, one of the heroes to this novel is a Communist. This is so surprising considering Rand's vociferous attacks against Communism throughout her career. Perhaps the character was drawn from ideas of someone she knew, perhaps someone who agreed with her philosophically but was not strong enough to live in that vein? Only Rand knew."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is a fine book which goes on in Petrograd, in the early days of the communist state. It describes the hardship of former bourgeosie returning to live in Russia after the revolution. Ayn somewhat indirectly portays human characters greater than the common mold and describes the difficulty they find to succumb to communist ideology, which doesn't favor the existence of strong outstanding individuals.The weakness of the novel is the plot, more precisely the actions of the characters, some of their actions seems not rational to me. There is the communist Andrei who gets Kira's (the main character) boyfriend imprisoned, but then he changes his mind and get's him out of prison again and become a spokesman for Ayn's philosopy before he commits suicide. Petrograd is a moving city and Ayn has many nice descriptions of it, especially at winter time. It's also very interesting to witness an insider view of the early years of the communist state. Even during communism bribery apparently was rife."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Not quite as entertaining as Atlas Shrugged, but all of Ayn Rand's books should be required reading for all high school students."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Set in Communist Russia but as a commentary on all social movements that aim to degrade the individual man, We the Living is the story of Kira, a idealistic and independent young woman from a \\"bourgeoisie\\" family, and the two men in her life: Leo, an indifferent but also individualistic young man, and Andrei, a youth leader in the Communist party. Not long after the revolution, Communism rules Russia. Kira's family, once aristocratic and wealthy, flounders under \\"proletariat\\" rule. Throughout society, men scramble for jobs, women wait in line for scarce and low-quality food, and everyone is smothered by a society that promises new freedoms and equality but offers little. Kira refuses to succumb to the communist message or principles, instead opting to study architecture out of the pure, selfish desire to do what she loves. Initially, consumed in her study, things go well, but when she falls in love with Leo she is suddenly dragged into conflict with the state. Meanwhile, she forms a strong friendship with Andrei--although they stand on opposing sides of the revolution, they share the same soul. Bit by bit, Kira must sacrifice herself and her morals in order to stay afloat in a society she hates and support a man that she loves. Ultimately, We the Living is the story of the fragile, indomitable spirit of man: no matter what they face, Kira, Leo, and Andrei maintain individuality and spirit, yet Communism erodes their power and makes their goals impossible to achieve. This is her first book, and so Rand's writing style hasn't fully matured, but the characters are realistic, the plot sympathetic, and the story's purpose threatening, frightening, and uplifting all at the same time.Rand generally has the same group of characters, basic plot line, and concept within her texts, and We the Living is no exception. The independent, antisocial main character (both Kira and Leo), as well as the similar character on the opposing side of the social issue (Andrei) are present, as is the plot line of the characters (male character is unemotional and female character doesn't believe in love, yet the two fall in love despite themselves; intervening character is a source of conflict and character development for both characters) and, of course, the underlying principle of the novel: Rand's belief in the independent, selfish man and his abilities and rights. To a certain extent, the repetition in character, plot, and purpose means that Rand's books can become repetitive, and if you've read one, you've read them all. To the extent that this is true, I would recommend one of her later novels (Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead), which are similar but have a more mature writing style and a more complex analysis of Rand's world view. That said, there is something different and worthwhile to be found in each of Rand's texts. We the Living in particular is more of a novel--more succinct and readable, less didactic, and on some level incredibly intimate. It would probably serve as a good introduction to Rand's writing and philosophy, and it is an approachable, personal novel in its own right.We the Living does have its flaws. Between setting, focus on the novel, and Rand's immaturity as an author, Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is underdeveloped and the text itself is nearly hopeless--that is, while it illustrates the problems with social structures such as Communism, it never provides an alternative or, truly, any sense of hope. Without coming full circle and providing a road map for achievement as well as a warning against weakness, Rand's books do little more than fear-monger and depress, and have no useful impact on the reader. In that respect, her later novels are much more effective and meaningful, and I highly recommend them. Outside of the Objectivist message but rather as a novel, We the Living is fairly strong, but it lacks realistic characters and sympathetic plot events. Initially, Kira and Leo, are realistic characters with personality and faults, but both eventually contradict themselves and become emotionless to an extreme; Andrei, in comparison, begins as a limited, undeveloped character, and only gains depth late in the novel. Plot events throughout, no matter how realistic, remove a lot of audiences sympathy for the characters and so distance the reader from the storyline.Nonetheless, I do recommend this novel. While I enjoy and appreciate Rand's later novels more, We the Living is a good introduction to her style and her philosophy and writing style/novel construction. It is also a very intimate, frightening warning against not just Communism but any social structure that aims to degrade and take power from the individual man. These structures, Rand argues, will only be successful in compromising man's individually; they will never provide the freedom and equality that they promise. She fails to offer an alternative, but Rand definitely provides a strong commentary on this sort of social structure, and if nothing else it reminds the reader to enjoy, take advantage of, and preserve, the true freedoms that he may have."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand's We The Living is a novel set in Russia right after the revolution ended and explores the lifes and times of primarily three individuals: Kira, the female who wants to be an engineer and is passionately in love with Leo, the son of former Army General and the immistakable Andrei, who has risen from streets to become a formidable communist. To complete the cast is Victor, Kira's cousin, who does the needful to shed his bourgeois past and rise through the ranks, Pyerov and Sonia, who in their own way use communism to become richer and powerful, and other members of Kira's family. The novel dwells on how revolution alters not only their daily lifes, morals, ambitions but also reveals their base and basic human character. It is a tale of falsified hopes, broken dreams, corruption, love, and of the struggle of someone to survive a political system that is of utmost dislike to him/her.Perhaps as the first book to come out of communist Russia, We The Living has gained more respect than it merits on basis of just literary qualities. Like all her heroes and heroines, Rand's prime suspects here are three idealists who seek to justify their different means for their selfish ends. The love triangle between Andrei, Leo and Kira is stifling reminder of how some people try to lead a dual life, hoping they can let two people be happily in love with them. Kira, who Rand wishes to potray as the martyr in her superhuman effort to be true to her individualistic ideals, and whose character is the reason for calling this novel as primarily as war of an individual against the state, fails to impress me. While the novel is a great treatize on how and why communist Russia squandered the dreams of early revolutionaries, Kira fails to impress. Her convictions are full of contradictions, as are her means and methods of achieving them. If I really want someone to read about communist Russia, I'd ask them to pick Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak. If Ayn Rand's Objectivism or Invidualism is your ideal, stop after reading Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.Kira's love is flawed for it lacks the honesty and fidelity that one must show towards one she cherishes. Her ideals are made ridiculous by the manner in which she sheds them for survival. Andrei is the unlikely hero, who is victim of his own idealogy, victim of treachery by both the women and the country that he tried to love and save. Leo is a failed ideal, and his character, throughout the novel does not tell me why Kira loved him so. There are other people in the novel, and Rand seeks to potray their state as the consequence of communism. Agreed, the state that supressed personal freedom and right for personal profit, must have broken the spirit of one and many. As a grim reminder of how social catastropes can alter family life, We The Living stands strong. As a ideological entity, I find it uninspiring. Fountainhead rules any day."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Some people seem to come away a little disappointed from this novel. I would guess that this is because this is one of Rand's lesser known works. The people who read this seem to have already made an acquaintance of Rand through The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Expecting the same tenor of philosophical writing, they are disappointed that this book contains little more than the emotional core of individualism. There is hardly any concrete philosophy, beyond a depiction of collectivism as it really is, in this book.In truth, this book is Rand's best writing. We the Living is a true-to-life depiction of life under totalitarian rule. It's not philosophical. It's not journalistic writing - it applies to life under totalitarianism anywhere. We the Living shows the essential battle between the individual and the collective.We the Living has a certain raw, emotional quality (which may be due to the fact that much of it is drawn directly from the author's experience. The closing scene of this novel has a depth of feeling rarely found in any literature.I would recommend this as the first Rand novel one should read, followed by The Fountainhead. I would particularly recommend these two books to teenagers, as there is a great deal in both that resonates with the spirit of youth. Atlas Shrugged is a more philosophical novel, which is still important, even essential reading, but only after We the Living and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

As all of her fiction is quite tragic, this is a tragic love story, but these characters seem to take on a more human tone than characters in her other works of fiction. It would be difficult not to appreciate her writing even if in some ways her work is almost unpalatable. I'm not sure that I would want to recommend We The Living, but I did read it several times myself."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Rand uses her own experience of growing up during the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.

If our politicians don't stop amassing debt there will be no choice but to nationalize every aspect of American life. Imagine if you will that your pay is taxed 100% - that is the Democrat Party's end game.Read We the Living to see what America has in store for her if the Democrats have their way."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I'm glad to know I'm not the only person who felt that this novel fell way short of Rand's usual brilliance; brilliance that is apparently only achieved in her later works. As this is her first novel, it's understandable to see so many rough edges and undeveloped theories. Even so, I couldn't reconcile several elements of the plot since they were in such contrast to the concepts she upholds in later novels.Ayn Rand writes of characters set in Soviet Russia during the Communist revolution. Kira, the protagonist, stays neutral in her political beliefs so long as they don't interfere with her ambitions in life. While at first her goals were to move abroad and become an engineer, the only facet of her life of which the reader sees is her goal of being with the man she loves, Leo.Leo is a character with no notable ambitions-- the reader is introduced to him as a counter-revolutionist who is instantly drawn to Kira, but his efforts of fighting for his beilefs aren't mentioned after the first 50 pages. By the end of the story, he is nothing more than an arrogant alcoholic. Like others in the novel, he manipulates the good intentions of others to further his own worthless pursuits.Andrei, on the other hand, is Kira's other love interest. Andrei is inquisitive and loyal: as the Communist party to which he holds dearly falls into corruption and greed, he lives his life for Kira's love.After understanding some background on the characters, I was puzzled to see the way in which Rand developed the plot. One theory to which Rand upholds so strongly is the belief that man should not live for another. In \\"We the Living,\\" however, the characters do exactly that-- Andrei lives for Kira's love. Kira lives for the love of her playboy, Leo. As the book drew to a very depressing close, I wondered how on Earth Ayn Rand could revolve a story on the premise of that which she hates (the notion of living for another). Then I reflected on the outcome of the characters and realized that in a way, everyone got exactly what they deserved if one were to uphold Randian thinking.The novel progresses like a train wreck, ultimately not knowing how any characters are going to escape from the dire situations in which they place themselves. The hardest thing to note is that none of them do escape from their hellish reality. The single exception is one character who deserves absolution the least (Leo). As for the rest of them, they spend years on hopes that never solidify; dreams of school, French perfume, going abroad, and artistic achievements become buried in the cold winter of Russia.What alarmed me about both the characters and the way they're written is their level of compromise to achieve such dreams-- Kira becomes a sell-out to the Communist party for a job and a mistress to a man she doesn't love to save the man she does love. Instead of fighting as a counter-revolutionist, Leo becomes an illegal trader with the assistance of a top Communist government official. Those who do uphold unwaivering morality face the harshest outcomes (characters like Andrei and Kira's cousin Irena). The reason for my surprise is that Rand's most noble literary characters in her other stories, like Howard, Dangey, Francisco, John Galt, are rewarded for motives that are punished in \\"We the Living.\\"For readers who want to aquaint themselves with Ayn Rand's theories, I urge them not to read this book. The dislikeability of Kira and the other characters will distract the reader from themes that aren't conveyed in a convincing (or persuasive) manner. Themes of egoism, selfishness, and capitalism are cornerstones of Ayn Rand, but they just aren't set forth in a coherent manner within \\"We the Living.\\" If I hadn't read \\"The Fountainhead\\" or \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" I would've read this book and have had the same disdain towads Rand that I know so many people have towards her works."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We The Living was not the first Ayn Ran book I read, and it would be difficult to say which is the best, but We the Living is a window to the life and thinking of Ayn Rand. Her characters are real people, ones I would have liked to know. Kira is the embodiment of a lover of life, no matter what the odds were against her living it. Rand used her characters to show the brutality of any dictatorship and her words are, sadly, still true today. Rand's writing style is superb and I recommend this book to anyone who believes their life is worth something to themselves and is not to be lived for the sake of others."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Whether you agree with her philosophy or not, this novel differs from her other writings in its passionate sincerity. Rather than intoning ominous mantras against Marxist collectivism, she demonstrates by vivid examples how constrictive and unfortunate such a theory can be when translated into fact. The harsh details she provides could only have been written by one who had lived in similar circumstances. The characters are not like the black-and-white archetypes she employs in her later fiction; their opinions and motives are much more credible.After reading WE THE LIVING, you feel a certain sympathy and understanding for Ayn Rand's vehement rejection of all philosophical systems or ideas that might inhibit personal freedom and individual expression. But the irony of her philosophy is that her &quot;Objectivism&quot; evolved into a system, which, if strictly adhered to, would be just as repressive, dogmatic and severe as the communism she so passionately disparaged.I've read and enjoyed several of her books; but this one I found to be the most striking and honest."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand proved her genius in this first novel, written in l937. I read it several times a year because Rand brilliantly evokes a long-gone world of Soviet Russia. You won't forget any of the characters which brings me to her heroine, Kira Argonouva. Kira sacrifices her dignity and helps the Soviets kill the only true hero in the book: Andrei. She does this in the name of love for the sleazy, brutal Leo. I can't see anything admirable about this sadistic killer. Kira becomes like any teeny-bopper and can't keep her hands off this muscular hunk. so much for the high ideals of our heroine. Other than that, \\"We the Living\\" is a masterpiece. You owe to yourself to see the Italian made film of this book. It was made in l942, literally beneath the war-strewn streets of Italy and stars an all-Italian cast. It's amazing how faithful the movie is to the book. Mussolini hated the movie and tried to have all copies destroyed."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The background of We the Living is the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and the ensuing White-Red civil war. Set in the years 1922 to 1925, it describes the hardships of living in Petrograd under the Communists. The story is told through the lives of Kira Argounova, who is 17 at the beginning, and her two lovers, Leo Kovalensky, the son of an Admiral in the Czar's navy, and Andrei Taganov, a Party member who is an officer in the G.P.U. (forerunner to the KGB). Kira's father owned a textile factory before the revolution; Leo's family was considered aristocracy. This puts them on the wrong side of the revolution: they are not part of the workers' proletariat; they belong to the hated bourgeoisie class who \\"exploited the masses\\" before the revolution.Rand's cold, stark descriptions of life in Petrograd illustrate the desperate hopelessness of life in the Communist system. Not being proletarians caused even greater hardships for the bourgeoisie. They were locked out of trade unions, and party membership was very difficult to attain without a significant transcendence into revolutionary thinking. They were the last hired and the first fired in the many purges that took place. Kira falls in love with Leo and they live together in Leo's father's house. They originally have three large rooms but eventually have to give two of them to other comrades because of the housing shortage. Their diet consists of millet and stale bread, and there is barely enough of that to stay alive. Being former exploiters of workers, they are assessed 50 times as much as proletarians for repairs on the building that Leo's father owned. Leo's father, by the way, was executed for \\"counter-revolutionary activity.\\"Kira maintains a dominant spirit of independence throughout the story. She pays lip service to the Party dogma to keep a job and to get a ration card, but she never buys into it. Leo does not even go that far: being openly hostile to the revolution eventually causes him to lose his job and they have to live on Kira's meager salary and rations. Kira begins a dangerous double life: she becomes a lover to Leo and Andrei at the same time. Leo enters into an even more dangerous profiteering business with a bureaucrat and a Party member. Through his affair with Kira and listening to her desire to live an independent life, Andrei begins to question his own commitment to the ideals of Communism. These are the elements that drive the story to its poignant and tragic conclusion.Once I reached the halfway point of this book the rising action became so intense that I couldn't put it down. I developed strong feelings either for or against the major characters. Rand is not the least bit preachy in this book; the story is told through the characters, and it is a great illustration of life under a repressive regime. The characters are fictional but the background is true: Any Rand lived through it. Americans should read this book to see the dark side of so-called \\"social justice\\" once it is put into place by the ruling class. It could happen here."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"A first novel, Ayn Rand establishes herself as a free-thinking individual who understands the importance of capitalist thought and that government which governs least, governs best.

The story begins in 1922 with 18-year-old Kira Arguonova's arrival (after a four year hiatus) in Petrograd, along with her 28-year-old sister, Lydia, and her parents. The family has lost their store, their status and their home and set out to start a new life in a changed city. Kira a headstrong, opinionated, confident young woman, whose anti-communist beliefs mirror author Ayn Rand's own, decides to study engineering at the university, a logical choice for someone with a lifelong interest in things structural.One evening after fending off the unwanted attentions of an admirer, she encounters an attractive stranger named Leo Kovalensky, whose admiral father (we learn later) was executed as a counter-revolutionary. The two agree to meet a month later and do. A classmate involved with the secret police brings her in for questioning after seeing Kira with her newfound more-than-friend. Intrigued, twenty-eight-year-old Andrei Taganov, communist to the core, intervenes to extricate her from the situation. Leo and Anna decide to move in together, disappointing her parents. Like their fellow countrymen, the two are forced to wait in long lines for meager rations, but things get more difficult for the couple. Due to Leo's family's political leanings, he is unable to find work. When doctors recommend he be sent south to a sanatorium due to serious health concerns, Kira secretly takes up with the relatively wealthy Taganov to fund the trip. Leo returns eight months later a different man. He seems well, but gets involved in an illegal and dangerous business venture that ends badly. Through lies and deceit, Kira is able to keep both Leo and Andrei in the dark about her two-timing. True to typical Russian novels, tragedy triumphs. Save yourself some spoilers and save the Foreward for afterward.Although I couldn't wrap my head around Kira's ability to fool the other two vertices of her love triangle, the way Ms. Rand handled the story's setting (post Russian Revolution political situation in Soviet Russia) and her descriptiveness, especially of the weather and scenery: (p 6) \\"Like barnacles, they [men] clung to the steps, to the buffers, to the roofs,\\" (p 66) \\"Whipped into mud by horses' hoofs, the first snow looked like a pale coffee with thin, melting splinters of sugar,\\" and (p 83) \\"The face and the bulb stood as incongruous shadows against the frozen sunset outside, beyond the window, a sunset as sinister and cold as dead blood,\\" are spectacular. Beyond all that, there is a lot going on plot-wise between the primary characters and their family members, friends, and acquaintances: suffering, sadness, survival, and sometimes, being sent to Siberia. Also good, The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, 11 years in Soviet Prison Camps by Elinor Lipper, and Coming Out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life by Victor Herman."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Sometimes, after finishing a book, I feel deep within me that it is important that other people read it, too.I'm sure you feel the same way.We The Living is such a book. I can't say whether it is Rand's best fiction or not... certainly a better read than Atlas Shrugged or Anthem, but The Fountainhead looms large in my memory, and might still claim the throne. However, I wouldn't feel it as important to have others read The Fountainhead as I might this one -- We The Living is somehow more personal, and more affecting.Ayn Rand is a divisive author, especially for those who haven't really bothered to study her and are just going off of what they've heard from others. If even a detractor reads We The Living, however, I think they'll see a person passionately devoted to the best things about humanity, and about life. Who could witness the plight of Kira and not be moved? Not be profoundly angered at the society that would put her through such ordeal? Not be convicted to ensure that no such thing could take place again, anywhere on earth?We The Living is a labor of love, and its plain to see in the writing. It sparkles with honesty, and draws from its readers the true pain that only honest writing can. A person may or may not agree with the Objectivist stand on laissez-faire, or inductive reasoning, but a solid common ground can still be reached by looking into this slice of Soviet life and being properly and profoundly horrified. From the resultant senses of pain, sorrow, and anger, our common philosophical conversation can continue..."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Although I like and have been influenced by some of Rand's ideas, I have never been a big fan of her novels. I find her essays to be better written and more influential. Despite the claims of her die hard fans, both ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD are overly long, spending way too much time and effort beating the reader over the head with their ideas. I am of the opinion that the reason those two novels are so popular is not because of their literary merit, but because they better represent Rand's philosophy as it was developing and provide context to her ideas in a fictionalized format.Rand's first novel, WE THE LIVING, is a different matter. Rand's ideas were not as well developed at the time it was written but existed in a more nascent form. This makes WE THE LIVING an inferior source for exploring Rand's ideas, but it does make it, in my opinion, a better novel than Rand's subsequent works. The ideas behind the writing are solid enough to understand, yet do not overwhelm the story itself, giving the reader more sympathetic characters with whom to relate.Rand herself stated that WE THE LIVING was her most autobiographical work. A depressing look at the new Soviet Russia in the early 1920s, the book opens with Kira, a young woman with a strong and independent spirit, returning to Petrograd after a political exile. Kira finds her family resigned to the new Communist political regime, which robbed them of all their possessions and, even worse, robbed them of all hope. Determined to become an engineer, Kira soon falls hard for Leo, another free spirit whose political ideals and human aspirations match Kira's own. The two find, however, that free spirits are hard to sustain in a brutally oppressive environment and the relationship collapses under the weight.Although Leo is her love, Kira finds her soul mate in the party ideologue Andrei. They may differ in politics, but Kira can confide in Andrei in ways she cannot with Leo. Kira feigns love for Andrei in order to help Leo. Unsurprisingly, things go wrong. Kira soul is crushed that much more by her guilt over using Andrei, whom she holds dear, for ulterior purposes.Rand's portrayal of life in the new Soviet Russia is bleak and depressing. Long lines, poor food, cramped apartments and tired citizens are only the beginning. As Kira discovers in her relationships with Leo and Andrei, the real price to pay is in the brutal truth that, in a totalitarian state, even intimate relationships are subsumed to the cause. Perhaps such a lesson is not as ambitious as those Rand explored in later novels. Yet it is the simplicity of that idea combined with more realistic characters that makes WE THE LIVING worthwhile."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Anyone interested in reading Rand's fiction should start with this book. It's the first she wrote and, via the depiction of the horrible life it's protagonist leads (seemingly somewhat autobiographical) you can see where Rand's later philosophies and excesses stem from. A moving story of an idealistic, free-thinking young woman's doomed attempts to live her life under Soviet rule. No one who reads this book can come away unappreciative of life in a democracy where individuals have a much greater degree of self-determination."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It's hard not to look at this book as little more than a piece of propaganda. It is not that Rand sat down with the intention to write propaganda, but that instead her own opinions have become so overbearing and all-encompassing, that it is as if they constitute a religion for her. And she is so devout a believer of her own 'religion' that her opinions end up reading like propaganda. A good majority of the book is spent bad-mouthing Communism and Socialism. If this were a critical analysis of Communism, I would not mind, as I am open to alternate views. But for Rand, there is no subtlety, to cognition, no grace, but instead, hundreds of pages of &quot;Communism Sucks!&quot; Like most people, she seems to have NO knowledge of Marxist theory. Like the people on this board, she confuses Communism with Socialism, and in so doing, treats them as being the same. Communism is as 'close' to Socialism as Capitalism is close to Socialism. The book is simple unreadable to anyone who has any diversified education in political theory. From a literary standpoint, there are plot holes, strange attempts at characterization, 'insults' at Communism thrown in like commercials at various parts in the book. Skip it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I agree with Kyle. This book is boring, dull, and uninteresting. This book reads like a history textbook, only with less information. I can't believe that such a book would be allowed to be published. There are two elements of this book: slight hunger and sex. The sex is even dull and uninteresting."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As a writer, I must give tribute to Rand's colorful turn of phrase, several enrapturing descriptions, and well-drawn characters. However, as a person I must say I hate this book and don't recommend it to anyone.Don't get me wrong -- it's good as a piece of literature if one takes away the grime of a hard time for Russia, which she holds cruelly under a magnifying glass; if one forgets the fact that she is biased, horribly biased against both Tsarism and the Soviet regime; if one ignores what she wrote about Russia and the Russians in the foreword; if one discounts the fact that she hated the place she was writing her &quot;truth&quot; about.Of course, now that I am stating my view someone will say that I am wrong because I'm Russian and thus biased; perhaps you will even think me a communist. Do that if you like. But because I AM Russian, there's something glaringly wrong to me in the fact that escape is seen as the sign of a good and unbroken spirit in this book. In spite of all claims made to support the opposite, an escaping spirit IS broken if it can't face what its home has become.What is one if one has no home country? If one gives it up?Leaving home is like losing one's identity. I'm nothing if I am not Russian. And neither is anyone else, if they leave."},{"Title":"Russia 2010: and What It Means for the World","review":"Written in 1993, it is fascinating to re-read \\"Russia 2010\\" today, 11 years later -- but still 6 years before the ultimate forecast date of the title -- to see how Dan Yergin and Thane Gustafson's predictions are doing. Given the events of recent months, with the school massacre in southern Russia and other terrorist actions, the ongoing brutal war in Chechnya, the continued clampdown on freedom of the press and civil society in Russia, the prosecution/persecution of leading business moguls (specifically, Mikhail Khodorkovsky), and President Putin's dramatic moves to increase his power, Russia should definitely be getting a lot more attention than most people have been giving it. Which makes the analysis of \\"Russia 2010\\" more relevant than ever.Most importantely, what Yergin and Gustafson did in \\"Russia 2010\\" was NOT to make absolute forecasts or to simply (and mindlessly) extrapolate from the situation at the time, but instead to apply powerful \\"scenario planning\\" techniques to thinking through the most likely futures for Russia. Back in 1993, the authors laid out four main scenarios: 1) \\"muddling down;\\" 2) the \\"Two-Headed Eagle;\\" 3) \\"Time of Troubles;\\" and 4) \\"Chudo\\" (economic miracle). How did the authors do?Today, in 2004, we can confidently conclude that #4 was wrong -- there has been no Russian economic miracle, although oil prices have certainly helped Russia recover from the post-Soviet low point of the early- to mid-1990s. It also turns out that #1, \\"muddling down,\\" the scenario that came closest to simply extrapolating from the existing situation at the time (as most forecasters erroneously do) was somewhat off the mark in the long run, although its predictions of a \\"relatively free atmosphere\\" and \\"weak Russian central government\\" did hold true for a few years at least. Scenario #3 is interesting, as it accurately anticipates separatist tendencies (although not specifically mentioning Chechnya) and the reaction of the \\"Russian Bear\\" to reassert itself. To some extent, that's exactly what we see today.It is Scenario #4 (the \\"Two-Headed Eagle\\"), however, that appears to have hit the nail squarely - almost eerily so -- on the head. In \\"Russia 2010,\\" Yergin and Gustafson posit that an attempted assassination on the Russian President by a \\"petty hoodlum\\"/mafia type \\"from the north Caucasus\\" leads to: a) Russian military action in that unnamed north Caucasus republic; b) a popular call for a crackdown on \\"the mafia, on corruption, and the private economy, which are all rolled into one in many people's minds;\\" c) the central government taking advantage of this situation to consolidate its own power, rein in the provinces, strengthen the executive over the legislative branch, reassert its control over natural resource exports; and d) an \\"ambivalent\\" and half-hearted Western reaction to these moves. Sound familiar? It should, because Scenario #4 -- the \\"premature reconstitution of a strong state\\" -- is almost exactly what we're seeing right now in Russia.What Yergin and Gustafson have done, among other things, is to have demonstrated the tremendous value of \\"scenario planning\\" -- rigorously thinking through possible future paths as opposed to mindlessly extrapolating from the present. Although the latter course of action may be the easier (and lazier) way of trying to predict the future, it is also the least helpful and least accurate. Why would we think the future would be just like the present and recent past? The simple answer? Failure of imagination, and the lack of courage to go out on a limb and stand out from the herd. As Yergin and Gustafson point out, the normal \\"extrapolate from the current situation\\" forecasting methodology failed us miserably during the past few decades, missing most of the major turning points of those years. For instance, just about nobody managed to predict the Iranian Revolution, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise of Al Qaeda, 9/11, the course of oil prices from 1973 to now, or just about anything else during that period. Yergin and Gustafson, however, by spending some time and effort to actually think through possible scenarios, hit the nail on the head regarding the future of Russia in one of their four posited \\"scenarios\\" -- with two of the three others having large elements of truth as well. True, it's not 2010 yet, but as of September 2004, Yergin and Gustafson are looking pretty darned smart!"},{"Title":"Russia 2010: and What It Means for the World","review":"Yergin and Gustafson present a series of three conceivable roads of reform along which Russia may travel between 1994 and 2010. The first scenario, &quot;Muddling Down,&quot; which precedes all other roads in their model, is described as &quot;the scenario that extends the present&quot; (pg. 140). It is characterized by a weak central government and a lack of legal infrastructure. The three roads from this point are &quot;Two-Headed Eagle&quot; (the return of a strong state composed of both new and old elites), &quot;Time of Troubles&quot; (chaos and unprecedented decentralization inevitably leading to restrictive nationalism with overtones), and &quot;Chudo&quot; (the economic miracle, compared with both Germany during the 1950's and with Alice in Wonderland). Regardless of the path taken, the authors believe that the outcome will be the same: by 2010 &quot;a capitalist Russia seems almost certain&quot; (pg. 300).As I write this review, Russia is now six years further along its path than it was when the authors penned their book. Naturally, the material in this book is dated. The authors could have done a better job in making this book more accessible to a future audience -- especially that of a future in which none of these scenarios seem to be taking shape as expected. I would not rule out the possibility that some of the events discussed could still come to pass, but not within the timeframe proposed. For example, in one scenario, Yeltsin steps down in 1996 due to poor health. Looking back, he remained in power for another four years after that, despite heart surgery and repeated ailments. Could that particular scenario still be valid in the future? That depends on many other factors, of course.In their discussions on Russia's policy towards non-Russians (at home and in the Near Abroad), the authors overplayed the potential for problems with Ukrainians and underplayed the potential for problems with Chechens and other non-Russians to the south. The first Russo-Chechen conflict broke out at about the same time that this book was updated and revised. Yet even before that, one could have foreseen the potential for conflict in the Caucasus. The Summer 1993 issue of Foreign Affairs featured an article by Samuel Huntington entitled, &quot;The Clash of Civilizations?&quot; Huntington's influential article proposed that armed conflicts tend to occur along fault lines between civilizations. A prime example of such a fault line is Yugoslavia, where Islamic, Western, and Slavic civilizations come together at one point. By this rationale, the Caucasus and Central Asia are also fault lines. Ukraine, however, is not a fault line. Despite Ukrainians' dislike of decades of rule by Moscow, Ukrainians and Russians have too much in common for a serious rift to occur. After all, America overcame its antipathy towards its former ruler to become England's greatest ally.Overall, I would recommend this book with a cautionary note to the reader that the book is not as useful now as it might have been half a decade ago. That being said, the book does still hold water with respect to Russia's future and has certainly retained its value as an academic exercise in scenario-building."},{"Title":"Russia 2010: and What It Means for the World","review":"Written in 1993, this book is still worth of reading today. Actually, it is more interesting to read today because some of the uncertainties in Russia back then had worked themselves out. The book was well structured and followed clear themes. The scenarios were plausible. I especially enjoyed the chapter on Russian transition from a market economy to a market one."},{"Title":"Russia 2010: and What It Means for the World","review":"This book, written back in 1993 (updated 1995), noted the strong possibility that the Russian president to succeed Yeltsin would be someone from one of the \\"coercive services\\". And what actually happened in 2000? Vladimir Putin, former head of the Soviet-era KGB (Committee for State Security) (forerunner of today's FSK).Yergin and Gustafson begin their analysis with a historical summary of Russian events beginning with the rise of Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1985, through the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the beginning years of the post-Soviet era up to the first publication date of the book (1993). They also lay out how this history lays the groundwork for their analysis of Russian development in the years to follow this period. This historical summary alone is enough to make the book worthwhile reading, for those who did not follow Russian affairs in detail over this span of time.The book gives a penetrating analysis of the socio-economic factors playing into Russia's post-Soviet development. How the history, experiences, and attitudes of the Russian people will affect the course of the Russian government's policy direction are described with astute attention. This book could serve as an effective model for scenario planning for any country besides Russia.

This book is a true tribute to the legacy of Irish storytelling and bardic tradition.I give it 4 stars, though (4 1/2, if it'd let me), because the ending is a bit abrupt; but this may just be Llyewelyn's way of letting the reader know the story of Ierne is still continuing."},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"What can I say, but, wow.....although this book seems in a way similar to her other work &quot;Druids&quot;, this is only slightly so.

I read Llywelyn many years ago, before I had even begun reading Celtic history, and I was surprised by the wealth of authentic detail as found in this book. One item that particularly sticks out in my mind is the description of the burial of Mil. Llywelyn used such precise detail, even down to the couch he lay on, that I could remember seeing a pictures and drawings of just such a burial, all the way down to its intricate wheels.

I was an avid fan of Morgan Llywelyn in high school, and joyfully devoured her mythological and historical novels. I remember her as being relatively well-researched, balancing fancy and fact to craft enjoyable bits of literary escapism. I picked up Bard, the first of her novels I've read in years, and was sorely disappointed. I expected more of the decent scholarship, dynamic myth, and engaging plots I remembered from my earlier reads. Instead, Bard delivered a cast of weak and predictable characters, a dragging storyline that takes far too long to deliver, and a surprising distortion of familiar Celtic icons.Bard describes an Iberian origin of the Celts as one of many groups of invaders in Erin's long history. She depicts the Tuatha de Danan and the Fir Bolg as two other such cultures, mortal beings who eventually grew into the larger-than-life myths of today. While I liked this historical rooting of the tale, one of my biggest problems with this book was her depiction of the Tuatha de Danan, whom Llywelyn depicts as New Age-y, hippie-fied mystics. Rather than being a fresh and exotic interpretation of the traditional myth, this choice instead seemed discordantly modernized, unrealistic, and self-serving. The segments of the book devoted to their characters could have been eliminated entirely, and it would have made little impact (save to salvage somewhat the stunted flow of the story). References to the \\"Earth Mother\\" are historically innacurate and frustrating to any Celtophile, especially given the wealth of colorful deities known to have been worshiped by the Celtic peoples. I found myself rolling my eyes more than once at some of these passages.Amergin, the bard of the title, is an introspective and potentially fascinating character, but he simply isn't given enough life in these pages. This is due in part to the lack of depth given to the supporting characters. Llywelyn relies too strongly on telling us what characters think and feel, rather than letting the reader see actions and interpret their dialog. Characters often act in contradictory ways, which comes across more as the result of poor planning on the writer's part than any kind of personal conflict. My opinion is that the book really should have been started right about where it ended (with the tribe's arrival in Ireland), and indeed Bard has one of the most unsatisfying endings of any book I have every read; it seems as though Llewellyn floundered a bit and simply gave up.Readers interested in literary treatments of Irish Celtic mythology or history should turn to Llywelyn's other (excellent and very fun!) novels; Lion of Ireland, Finn McCool, Red Branch, or her more modern Irish historical fiction (e.g. 1972).~Jacquelyn Gill"},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"This is what a novel based on Celtic legends should look like. Llywelyn certainly knows how to write, but where she goes above and beyond the call of duty is her willingness to extensively research scholarly and oftentimes dry sources. Likely, she heard the legends of Ireland's past growing up, yet she nevertheless presents extensive bibliographies at the end of her novels. Bard is no exception. While artistic license is taken in order to draw the modern reader into the tale, it is clear that Llywelyn knows what she is doing, breathing new life into the people of Ireland's mythological tradition while remaining faithful to the source.However, I did find difficulty with references to \\"the Mother\\" regarding the earth, given that Llywelyn cited Robert Graves' silly The White Goddess as a source, but it is a mistake easily overlooked. Also, the end of the novel seemed slightly forced, as if Llywelyn was stretching to connect the De Danaan natives to the Milesian conquerors.Regardless of its slight flaws, Bard is an excellent read filled with compelling characters, comfortable prose, and an exciting retelling of the events of The Book of Invasions."},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"This was my first Morgan LLywelyn novel to read and I am now hooked!! wonderful description of celts and great characters..

The plot of the story, including the migration to Ireland, is well-paced and imaginative, and suits the cultural background well. I wish the author had been more explanatory about the magical people encountered in Ireland, but that's a minor dissatisfaction with an otherwise excellent treatment of the subject. Anyone wishing to learn more about Gaelic history while hearing a great story should read this book"},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"I don't particularly wish to take the wind out of peoples' sails, but this book is more a work of speculative fiction than historical, despite the author's scholarship or the extensive bibliography presented at the back of the book. Very little substantive is known of the Celts, even less than of the Vikings, and while some archeological evidence provides material hints, there is not enough material evidence to do much other than to reconstruct the form of their dwellings and, based upon the artifacts of tools and weapons, postulate upon the level of their material culture and the extent of their trade with other peoples. As with the Vikings, what little primary sources do exist were often written after the fact, as well as by authors that could be considered foes, thus questionable both as to the veracity and bias of the information presented. The bulk of what has come down to us regarding the Celtic peoples of Ireland are in the form of legends and myths originally based upon a bardic tradition and written down long after that oral tradition had fallen into disuse, most often by chroniclers who were neither Celtic nor necessarily sympathetic or familiar with either the culture or religious elements of the tales they transcribed. We are dealing here with legends, and while some broad conclusions can be drawn---as in Robert Grave's &quot;The White Goddess,&quot; referred to by the author in the first edition---from shared cultural and mythopoeic archetypes and material evidence, much that has been expostulated about the Celts, both fictionally and in texts attempting to reconstruct their culture and society, will not stand up to close historical scrutiny. This is far more a work of speculative than historical or literary fiction, and should be approached as such.Taken within the context of fantasy fiction, with what little historical basis as can be reconstructed or questionably projected from the scanty evidence, this book is in many ways successful, presenting a fictional culture whose approach to the world and their lives offers the reader an alternative moral and spiritual compass, one in which it is hard not to find sympathy, and compares favorably, as I am sure is the author's intention, with the values of contemporary, modern society. Well written (though the author's periodic multiple shifts of point of view within the same page is at times disorienting, and would be one of the first things a creative writing student would learn to avoid), the author creates a highly detailed if romanticized society and world which captivates the reader's interest, as well as a diverse cast of characters which, unlike some other earlier reviewers, I found complex and multifaceted, despite the fact that the main point of view is that of the bard, Amergin. Essentially a tale chronicling the legendary immigration of Celtic Gaels from the Galician coast of Spain to the shores of Ireland, spurred by the vision of the legendary and perhaps entirely mythic bard Amergin, at least half of the story takes place in Celtic Spain, detailing the familial, religious and social structure surrounding the book's characters, as well as the events precipitating their voyage to Ireland. Much of the first one hundred pages of the book attempt to provide a cultural and historical background for the Celtic population in Spain, accomplishing this through repeated flashbacks that are for the most part expository and only partially successful, drawing the reader's attention away from the characters and the narrative's contemporary setting, often seeming to attempt to recreate a past too vast to be successfully contained within the scope of a hundred pages. I found this attempt to provide extensive background to the book's setting enervating to the narrative's main plot line, over-reaching itself in its effort to anchor the book's events within a quasi-historical setting.Nor is the ending entirely satisfying, though my dissatisfaction is not based upon its fantastical elements, as some other readers have complained. As stated earlier, this work is, in essence, fantasy, and the introduction of the Tuatha De Danaan is appropriate, both in terms of the book's format as well as the mythic associations of this legendary people with the Celtic migration and &quot;conquest&quot; of Erin. Nor is this the first overt introduction into the story of speculative elements, unless the reader is to accept the magical properties of divination, voices heard upon the wind, or the druidic groves as historical skills and knowledge since lost to present day society. The dissatisfaction I had with the book's conclusion comes with its abrupt and unresolved ending, in which the conflicts that have dominated the latter pages continue, presuming---indeed inferring and creating---an expectation of resolution that never takes place. One is left wondering as to the future, expecting and wanting further development to the unresolved events surrounding the remaining characters. This is compounded by the tidy romantic rewards of the book's main character. Had this been another author's work, the obvious assumption would be that the book's conclusion was serving as a launch for a second book that would pick up where the first left off. However, this is not the case here: there are no successive books by Llewelyn continuing the saga begun here of the life of the Irish bard Amergin. Instead the last words spoken in the narrative are left begging for a future that never arrives.Overall, a well written book that is bound to appeal to fans of Celtic mythology or fantasy guised as history. However its rewards are muted somewhat by the author's attempt to apply too broad a brush at the beginning, and an inability to fully resolve the story's conclusion, which prevents this book from being ranked among the best fantasy currently has to offer."},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"I found The Bard a good read, not Morgan Llywelyn's best but very good. The deeper you get into the work the more you are pulled into it. I was sad to see it end...while she pulls you to do further reading. The Bard would surely cause me to seek out other Llywelyn works, of those that I haven't already consumed. You find yourself feeling for the characters, resenting some, while admiring others. Pity for a some and joy for a few. I found myself trying to think ahead, predicting the next turn... sometimes with success, other times with suprise. I would highly recommend this work to anyone with an interest in Gaelic roots &amp; interest."},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"As a previous reviewer mentioned, the ending is a problem. While the characters are symbolic more than fully developed, they are a serviceable means of telling the story of one possible way the Gaels settled in Ireland. The history seems plausible and the daily life of this tribe comes across as very true. But after creating an atmosphere that seems to be based strongly on available research, Llywelyn introduces the &quot;little people&quot; and things rapidly go downhill. With cryptic mentions of powerful weapons that were &quot;earthkillers&quot; and the disappearence of the Tuatha De Danann, the book enters the realm of fantasy. Not a problem if it started that way, but quite a shock to this reader after following a journey that seemed very true up until this point. If you can make the leap the author requires of the reader, this book is an interesting look at the history of the Irish."},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"I loved this book!

Once I picked this book up, I was unable to put it down!"},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"I've been fond of this author's work for many years now, despite the heavy reliance on archeology that is often, by now, rather outdated. To read Llewelyn's work is to be transported into the world she creates, and to be surrounded by some very real and interesting characters.The sons of Mil act very much like a real family would, loving eachother and yet competing much of the time. Everyone has flaws, and the most distatesful character (Colptha, the druid)still has some decent traits, or things that one might respect about him.I will warn that if you MUST have a perfect, or at least solidly resolved, ending that you should leave this book alone. I thought, however, that the hanging ending was highly appropriate, given that the main character Amergin spends much of his time attempting to resolve a saga which he could not finish, since it is the story of his people, who continued to live.There were a few problems with Bard. I am a serious student of Celtic mythology, and as such, I had a bit of a problem with the way the Tuatha are described in this book. They are, for lack of a better term, megalithic hippies. The fondest wish of the lightest of neopagans is realised within these pages. Since archeology can only give hints as to the character of a people who left no written clues, I will leave that at the wayside. The myths that we do have featuring the Tuatha, however, do not paint a picture of enlightened pacifists. The Morrigan, Diancecht, or anyone else with a violent nature or sad story are largely left out of it to paint this picture of unlikely love and harmony. I found this love-and-light group too jarring a counterpoint to the colorful and well realised Milesians, and it is this trait that ensured four stars were not forthcoming from me. (Although I'd give three and a half if it were possible.)If you like a good historical seeming fantasy with subtle magic and a decent plot, by all means, pick up this book. If Robert Graves is your enemy, and continuous talk about a nebulous mother earth goddess (that the Celts did NOT worship) will irritate you too much, then don't."},{"Title":"Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish (Celtic World of Morgan Llywelyn)","review":"This is the best work of historical fiction that I've ever read.

He performs a poetic miracle, his words emit light, they are music, they are energy. No matter what mood I am in, reading his words brings transformation. I am lifted out of darkness, comforted, I feel love. If I am serene, I add my energy to the energy his poems emanate and I dance and reach a state of pure ecstatic joy. This author reaches out and embraces the readers wrapping them up in love. Eric P. McCarty is a Divine voice, he captures secrets in the night, he creates atmospheres that reach beyond what is visible to the eye. With his poems he opens doors to upper realms, where he soars inviting us to open our own wings to soar along with him. The deep love and light he conveys in his writings doesn't touch exclusively spirit, it touches the senses. His poems show that he loves the night, he loves the silence. His muse ignites passion and it is a wonderful gift that he puts this passion into words. And these words make me feel as if lightning was flashing through my bones and through my veins. I am definitely a fan of Eric P. McCarty and I am quite certain that it is only a question of time ... he will conquer more and more hearts and guide them to the true joy of being.

The editors and their fourteen collaborators explain the mosque as an expression of Islam, analyse the characteristic styles of nine regions ranging from West Africa to China, and then report on the contemporary scene.The last topic may be the most original and important, for Westerners are far more familiar with the celebrated mosques of the pre-modern period than with those of the twentieth century. Oleg Grabar and Mohammed Arkoun provide typically brilliant insights while Khan surveys the architectural variances ranging from the pseudo-classicism of the Islamic Center Mosque in Washington, D.C. to the astonishing modernism of the Sherefuddin Mosque in Bosnia.Too often, in a specialized field such as Middle Eastern studies, a reviewer finds himself lamenting the excessive prices of books. How refreshing, then, to be able to compliment Thames and Hudson for including 378 illustrations, 170 of them in color, and yet charging very little more than the average scholarly book.

And one can be forgiven for being disappointed, after all Harold Bloom is the editor. When I was a University student in the seventies, Bloom was revered, in particular by students of the Romantic poets. Bloom had written what was (and still is) a vital text on Shelley (Shelley's Mythmaking\\") and had followed that up with a magnificent survey of the Romantics in, \\"The Visionary Company\\". When my interests turned to Blake, Bloom was there with Blake's Apocalypse\\".And so, when later in life I developed a keen interest in the Iliad, I was overjoyed to see that Bloom had pulled together a collection of essays to help me understand this complicated yet surprisingly readable poem.WRONG! Of all the thousands of commentaries on the Iliad, Bloom somehow managed, with a notable exception or two, to pull together some of the most arcane, obtuse writings I can imagine. Even the specialists will be challenged by some of the subject matter here. And the presentation? Well, for the most part the prose is turgid, representing the worst of academic stylism. The exception is the lucid and beautifully written excerpt from E.R. Dodds', \\"The Greeks and the Irrational.\\" But this is to be expected, as this is justly one of the most famous and important books ever written on the subject of ancient Geek culture. I found the rest of the essays to be overly technical and narrow in scope and compass. If you have read Victor Davis Hanson's \\"Who Killed Homer\\", you will find most of the sins he enumerates present in this collection.But the MOST disappointing part of this entire collection is the introduction itself. In which we see Bloom at his worst - preachy, tendentious, over weaning. He takes the opportunity to take a few pot shots at the authors represented in the collection and to advance his own, in my view eccentric, conception of the poem. You know you are in for a rough ride when from the very outset we are treated to a comparison of the Iliad with the Hebrew Bible - a comparison in which the Iliad does not come off on top. At the end of the introduction, we read that while Homer himself is the \\"best of the poets\\", unfortunately, he lacks a \\"quality of trust in the transcendent memory of a covenant fulfilled, a lack of the sublime hope that moves the Hebrew poet Deborah.\\" Geez, I'm sorry but, umm, who cares? This is a bit like complaining that apples don't have the citrus acidity of oranges.Clearly, Bloom had an axe to grind - and grind it he did. It is as though he was determined to make the case for the Bible's superiority to the Iliad. As an introduction to a collection of essays, Bloom's is, in a word, \\"lacking\\"!So where does that leave the interested reader. Well, it's not easy. I can think of no good general introduction that is separately published. That said, Bernard Knox wrote an introduction to Robert Fagles' translation of the Iliad that is almost transcendent. It puts to poem in context, describes the central action and delves into the poem's main cultural foundations. I would recommend that a first time reader of the Iliad equip him or herself first with this and second with Stanley's Lombardo's brilliant modern translation - oh, and stay away from this collection."},{"Title":"The Iliad (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Barron's book notes for the Iliad are, believe it or not, better than Cliff's.

An Adjunct Professor of Fiddle at the Belmont School of Music in Nashville, Tennessee, Duncan has interest in both classical and traditional styles of playing. His \\"American Fiddle Tunes for Solo and Ensemble\\" series for violins actually include two books. The first has the music notation for two violin parts in 16 common North American fiddle tunes like Cripple Creek, Old Joe Clark, Cottoneyed Joe, Flopeared Mule, Mississippi Sawyer, and Red Wing. Each has the theme and a variation. The second booklet includes both violin parts along with the piano accompaniment. With other books in the series, even more combinations are possible.The arrangements allow music readers to play these tunes in configurations from solo to full string chamber orchestra. Some Cajun offerings include Bayou Pon Pon and Jolie Blonde. Other orchestrated tunes include Bonaparte's Retreat, Eighth of January, Going to Boston/On the Road to Boston, Goodbye Liza Jane, Home With the Girls in the Morning, Rose Tree/Over the Waterfall. Another book in the series is available for viola, third violin, and piano. One for cello, bass, and piano is also available. When these tunes are played by classically trained musicians in ensembles, however, I caution them to occasionally look beyond the written page for inspiration and to discover the heart, soul and emotional consciousness of these traditional tunes. Written music for ensembles to play traditional tunes together often misses the mark on that count and is simply not able to fully convey the music's sentinence.

What's the matter with them, you mutter, why can't they just change so they aren't so annoying? Perhaps it is time to rethink things.Let's face it, they aren't ever going to change, so instead, why not change your reaction to their maddening behavior? Or maybe the problem isn't your nutty co-worker or boss. Did you ever stop tothink that you might just be your own worst enemy at work by dint of your irritating quirks?Whatever your work situation, this book has with not only the symptoms but also the cure for what ails you. The authors use questionnaires, anecdotes, and specific scenarios to come up with solutions to various work situations.Katherine Crowley, a Harvard-trained psychotherapist, and Kathi Elster, a small business expert, combined their expertise in this book.Each chapter describes the problem behavior, how you might beexacerbating the problem, and actions you can take to change yourreaction to the behavior and thereby create a different result. Theauthors believe that the one factor having the most impact on a satisfying work environment is being able to master your state of mind, and after reading this book, I agree.They describe emotional \\"hooks\\" and delineate steps you can take to \\"unhook\\" yourself, along with setting boundaries at work.They describe the \\"Fatal Attractions,\\" who suck you into their webs: the exploder, the empty pit, saboteur, pedestal smasher, and the chip-on-the-shoulder, all of whom make life miserable.But managers also have their own crosses to bear in the form of parenting their recalcitrant charges, the employees, a.k.a. the chronically delayed, MIA, cynics, passive-aggressives,attention-seekers, bad attitudes, slugs, addicts, and the thief.The authors' contention that...\\"If you can change your reaction,you'll change your life\\" resonated with me--not only in terms of my job, but also my life--and this book illuminated this for me.Armchair Interviews says: If you don't have someone at work who drives you a little batty, you must work alone.

Upon further thought though, the appeal of this book for me has less to do with wireless and more to do with the variety of different personalities I've encountered in my professional life - regardless of the industry.A lot of books offer advice on how to deal with difficult people - particularly in personal relationships. This book takes a turn at helping people learn to cope with the personalities they have to deal with at work. Katherine Crowley is a psychotherapist and Kathi Elster is a small business expert; together they describe themselves as \\"undercover business therapists.\\" While their focus on professional relationships is new, their message is familiar - \\"you can't change other people's behavior, but you can change your reaction to it.\\"Unhooking is the KeyThe authors explain that changing your reaction starts with finding ways to \\"unhook\\" yourself from the situation, and they give specific examples of ways to tell - both physically and emotionally - whether you are 'hooked\\". Symptoms include headaches and fatigue, anger, depression and forgetfulness. Their \\"Four Pronged Unhooking Technique\\" is simple and is good, practical advice for anyone dealing with difficult people at work.Not all TheoryWhile a lot of books give you theories on dealing with others, \\"Working With You is Killing Me\\" gives tips and examples on how to use the technique in real life business situations. And they don't assume it's only co-workers who drive you nuts: tips for obnoxious bosses are also presented.Managing Up, Down and SidewaysCrowley and Elster not only deal with how to work with a difficult boss (Managing Up), their term for managing a team of people, or \\"Managing Down\\" - \\"Business Parenting\\" hits the mark perfectly (take it from someone who has managed large teams of people -- I could completely relate to their analogy of \\"problem children\\" as I read this section).I also found the quiz that the authors present to help readers determine if their job is a good fit to be very helpful. Every company has its own culture and personality type that excels within that culture. This quiz is an effective tool to help you determine if the company or job you are in is the right one for you.Considering the amount of stress workplace disharmony causes - on everyone involved - this is an important book. I found it easy-to-read with simple, practical steps that can be easily implemented in real life.

Putting a form of scientific method to resolving work related problems - including the reader's assessment of their own role in the problem - is a big part of the text. It provides an organized and controllable process to attempt issue resolution.For me, the best part of the book, however, was the subject of \\"Managing Up,\\" in which the authors urge their readers to take more control over their disappointing managers by using that same scientific method to manage them to preferred solutions. Good advice.And, there are a number of self-help exercises to assess your fit with Corporate Culture, or to determine if you are hooked (emotionally distressed) by a \\"Fatal Attraction\\"-type manager etc. Again - good stuff and helpful to think about for many people, particularly the less experience workforce.Still, I was caught in a bit of a dilemma. The book is written from the point of view of what do you do when someone else is causing emotional discomfort to you - as if you are the center of the universe. OK - that's why you bought the book. But, survey results from reputable researchers show that the primary reason for people remaining with their jobs is that they like their co-workers. Even more than their commitment to the work they do, they begin with liking their co-workers. Therefore, a collegial environment is critical to employee retention, customer satisfaction and business performance. This clearly suggests that there is a corresponding responsibility for each worker to fit in with their colleagues - even if minor personality traits or managerial quirks exist, and they always do.The workplace isn't typically about achieving personalized justice, as much as it is about intelligent people grouping together to form an efficiently running and productive organization. Readers should not lose focus of this. Otherwise - \\"You\\" may be the person referenced as killing the climate (and your co-workers) in your quest to untrap yourself of the personal demons that ruin your day.Overall, a good book, and a solid reference to have handy."},{"Title":"Working With You is Killing Me: Freeing Yourself from Emotional Traps at Work","review":"This book has it all.

Authors, Kathi Elster and Katherine Crowley have nailed it!!!Thank you bothSherri RosenSherri Rosen Publicity LLC, NYC"},{"Title":"Working With You is Killing Me: Freeing Yourself from Emotional Traps at Work","review":"While this book is intended for those in the work force, as a teacher it is also applicable. A colleague and I are reading this in order to deal with those we work with and to try to learn new strategies for \\"staying alive\\" in our school. The strategies and definitions in this book are helping me to understand those individuals who are \\"killing\\" me. This comprehensive book is great for understanding my reaction to those who trip my trigger and how to modify my reaction so I might better cope with those whose work ethic is not the same as mine."},{"Title":"Working With You is Killing Me: Freeing Yourself from Emotional Traps at Work","review":"This book delivers.In my experience, 99% of the books on professional relationships out there fall into either of two categories:Most of them refuse to address - some even to accept - that a few people you encounter in the corporate world have pathological dysfunctions. These books dedicate all of their content to treat your inability to cope with differences between people's personalities and yours. \\"Change the way you react to other people and all your problems will vanish\\" is the axiom behind the pages, from cover to cover, in these texts.Books in the second category, on the other hand, are usually written by mental health professionals and do address the presence of people with personality disorders in the working environment. Their recommendation is simple: just leave the place, as fast as you can. They paint a scary picture of the sociopath or borderline personality next door, and advise a bee line to the door, specially if next is a manager's door.Problem is the landscape of the average corporation is a hodgepodge of dysfunctions and interpersonal mistakes - from the minor ones we all incur, to the full-fledged, unchecked, sociopathy. To further complicate things, it is becoming increasingly clear that, not only most personality disorders are actually co-dependency phenomena - i.e. \\"victim\\" and perpetrator are both entangled in a reinforcing relationship - but there is also a social component in the prevalence of dysfunctional leaders. Simply put, some cultures (be it a country or the firm you might work for) select and empower dysfunctional leaders.Navigating far away from these considerations, Crowley and Elster's book very definitely assume there are all kinds of people and situations in a typical firm - as well as among the READERS of their book! We, readers, can find ourselves sometimes incurring in the infamous \\"fundamental attribution error\\" (assuming the person we are dealing with is moved by ill intention), some other times we may just lack one or two emotional skills, to deal with a not-that-complicated conflict. But - and in that \\"but\\" resides the uniqueness of \\"Working With You is Killing Me\\" - there are also occasions in which we are entangled in a dysfunctional relationship with someone with a personality problem.Without explicitly labeling the \\"other part\\" as a dysfunctional person - what good would that do? - the authors do label the RELATIONSHIP as dysfunctional and address all the sides of the matter: the role the reader possibly has in it, the futility of expecting changes from the other person, and what can objectively be done to change the situation, without necessarily jumping out of the boat (just to run into another dysfunctional top dog, in the next job).Another great source of value in \\"Working With You is Killing Me\\" are the abundant textual examples of how to phrase the messages the authors recommend, as well as how to prepare to deliver them. As the authors of \\"Influencer\\" emphatically remark, it is essential to have vicarious experiences - seeing how others handle difficult tasks - for us to learn that skill. Crowley and Elster's textual examples of speeches provide just that.On the other hand, if something might be criticized in \\"Working With You is Killing Me\\", is the somewhat harsher-than-necessary tone of some of these examples. Though nobody could possibly be called aggressive, by spelling them, in my experience (and, I believe, in some authors' as well) their too impersonal undertone would probably create a barrier to a good leadership rapport. Che Guevara's words - \\"hay que endurecer-se pero sin perder la ternura\\" (one has to grow hard, but without losing the tenderness) - apply here.That said, \\"Working With You is Killing Me\\" is a unique, must-read book, for anyone interested in on-the-job relationships, which, I suspect, probably includes all of us."},{"Title":"Working With You is Killing Me: Freeing Yourself from Emotional Traps at Work","review":"This is a book that just keeps giving. I bought it quite a while ago and really did not read it right away --- but ultimately I read the whole thing -- and I must admit I found myself appearing again and again in the descriptions.But what really is great about this book is that if you just leave it on the coffee table or something like that, then you will find yourself picking it up and randomly looking at a chapter here and a chapter there -- and guess what -- it will all be relevant (if you are being honest with yourself). You will find yourself, your peers, coworkers, and your life.Worth having."},{"Title":"Working With You is Killing Me: Freeing Yourself from Emotional Traps at Work","review":"You know the type at work--the egocentric boss that likes to demean you with sarcastic comments (but he's only **joking**)and you do 9 out of 10 things right but it's that 1 that bothers him and he takes you to task for it. The co-worker who uses your space all the time leaving his trash on you desk (or in your car if you do outside sales). These are the types of people that cross the line and can make work a toxic experience.Your also in this book as well. You may be the hero, the rebel one of many different types that are branded by co-workers and bosses because of one or two things you've done. It's effected your career and inadvertantly your life.Authors Katherine Crowley and Kathi Elster (one is a business owner/consultant the other a therapist)discuss ways to \\"unhook\\" from these experiences to allow you to get through them. If the behavior continues (after you've taken corrective action--if it's a boss it's more difficult to do and you usually need to prepare your resume. They're upfront about when that time arrives, too.)they suggest ways to deal with it either through suggesting ways to change behavior or to leave the company.The suggestions are good if a bit simplistic for example it may take a lot more work than is hinted at in the book to try and change behavior (if you can and admittedly they are the first to suggest that you probably can't except for yourself)but they provide steps that would help you to do so if the person has any self awareness of how toxic they can be (and if not they make suggestions to help you make them aware of it politely). Overall this is a terrific book that will help you \\"detach\\" and live your life vs. live your work."},{"Title":"Working With You is Killing Me: Freeing Yourself from Emotional Traps at Work","review":"The CD was very easy listening.

Katherine's background as a psychotherapist can help you to see how people are pushing your buttons.There is some great advice in here on how to detach yourself a little bit from what can be debilitating frustration. It may appear pretty simple, for example, the admonition to take 3 long deep breaths, but try it, it works. Beyond this threshold of cooling yourself down, the self analysis and self management advice is very good. When someone is driving me nuts, I usually have some role in it; they're hitting my guilt or sense of inadequacy. And I am better off recognizing this, seeing that I have a role in the \\"s/he's killing me\\" feelings I may have. So, that's Katherine's contribution (they share their perspectives in the introduction to the book).Kathi gives the -two in the one-two punch, as she offers constructive ways to act. The fact is that when people are infuriating us or walking over us, we're not the only ones who have work to do. Kathi offers some great tools to push back. Sometimes the advice is (again seemingly simple) to speak to the person in terms of what you are observing and what you'd request they do, instead of speaking in accusatory tones that might be satisfying but will likely set you back. Kathi also assesses the way you can use tools in the workplace to leverage behavior, for example, company policies or meetings.There aren't a lot of things that can suck the energy out of you like a tough relationship at work.

And for the most part, the book lives up to its title. Crowley and Elster set out to help the reader \\"unhook\\" from emotional pitfalls in the office and show how to manage difficult personalities. They do both. to an extent.I really liked the introduction where we were invited to take a short quiz to discover our most challenging workplace situations. There were only 4 or 5 short questions and a suggestion as to which chapter we should go to depending on the answers. The downside to this approach is that if one was directed to say, chapter 3, then you would miss out on the principle unhooking strategies which underpin the whole book contained in chapter 1.The principle unhooking strategies are great - simple, to the point, easy to remember and practical. I will certainly use them when next faced with a difficult personality. Where the book falls down is in the practical examples of how these strategies might work. The words used in the examples, would in my opinion not solve the situation. They may in fact inflame it, leaving you with having to apply the unhooking principles again when facing this same difficult person next time. For example, when faced with a difficult employee, to demonstrate the last unhooking step, the supervisor says \\"This is what I've experienced in the last couple of weeks from you. It's unacceptable behaviour. I'm going to put this document in your HR file. It will be part of your permanent record unless you improve within the next week.\\" As an employee, I would certainly not respond very positively to that approach. I would almost certainly revert to my basic difficult personality style, leaving the supervisor with the need to \\"unhook\\" again next time we meet.I'm also not a great fan of categorizing people into various personality styles as the book does. Although it does have short questionnaires to help you identify these styles (there are quite a number of them with various titles such as \\"Hero\\", Martyr\\", \\"Invisible One\\" and so on). I'm not sure how easy these would be to use when faced with a real person.I did really like the chapter on \\"Managing Up - Taking Control\\" - probably worth the price of the book alone.In summary, if you buy this book, use the unhooking strategies, but keep in mind far more positive assertiveness tactics in their implementation than are described in the book.Bob Selden, authorWhat To Do When You Become The Boss: How new managers become successful managers"},{"Title":"Working With You is Killing Me: Freeing Yourself from Emotional Traps at Work","review":"My wife bought the book and I was sceptical when I first saw it.

This man CANNOT WRITE, and in fact, from the evidence of this book cannot even punctuate.Suspence? None.

There are some brilliant stock market books out there, but this is not one of them.

This book is a rerelease from the original published in the mid 1990's but the story is still good for the time.I think what I liked most about this book is that it wasn't a beat you over the head financial thriller.

All nurses make care plans. The description of the RN following doctors' orders, soothing, and caring is what the profession is trying to downplay now. Nurses work for nurses, not doctors, and are highly skilled team members. Prospects for Nursing School Instructors are excellent, not just good. There is not only a shortage of nurses but of faculty, and without faculty, fewer people can be accepted to school. All MDs and DOs do a residency if they want to treat patients, not just an \\"internship\\" with residency for specialization. All medical fields are specialties. The \\"internship\\" (old term) is just the first year of residency, PGY-1 (post-graduate year 1). For one description, you are encouraged to write for more information. Really? This book is in its third edition? What happened to the good ol' World Wide Web? A lot of information is missing in the school listing, too.

A bezel is the grooved interior of the setting on a ring which holds the precious stone in place: a feat of craftsmanship in the days of irregular jewels. Here it's a metaphor for the Prophets, each a unique receptacle for a unique precious stone: an aspect of Divine Wisdom revealed to one person, at one place and time.The Qur\`an has its own perspective on Prophets, different from Judaism or Christianity. Mankind perpetually strays from Divine Wisdom and God sends messengers to call us back. Thus a variety of Biblical figures are considered as Prophets: Adam, Enoch, Noah, Aaron, Jacob, Joseph, Job, John the Baptist and Jesus. There are also Arab Prophets not in the Bible: Slih, Hd, Shu\`aib.Formless Divine Wisdom is Infinite, so this list of Qur\`anic Prophets can only be a sample of Its limitless manifestations. But it's hard for us to realise how deeply traditional Muslims were imbued with the Qur\`an: those who could read learnt to read from it; it was recited constantly; it was not uncommon to know the whole text by heart. For Ibn \`Arab, the succession of Prophets was a symbolic history of the world, and so although only a sample of God's Self-Revelations, they form a symbolically complete picture, a mandala.From the beginning this text was singled out from Ibn \`Arab's enormous output: it was more widely studied, the subject of more commentaries, than any of his other works. It is one of his most difficult, yet accessible works. Difficult because... well, read a bit and see. Accessible because it comes closest to summing up his ideas. Westerners are often baffled when they first encounter a work like this. What exactly is it? Philosophy, poetry, theology, mysticism? Complex philosophical arguments in the Neo-Platonic tradition mingle harmoniously with Scriptural commentary, poetic and metaphorical language, and mystical paradoxes.We are told at the start of the first chapter (about Adam) that God Knows Himself directly, but it is different to know oneself through Another, so God created the Universe to be His mirror. At first it was amorphous and rough [mirrors were made of metal in those days] but gradually it was polished until it could reflect Him. With the creation of human beings, self-conscious like God Himself, the Universe reached completion. Adam was the first Prophet, the first to receive Formless Wisdom in a unique form. The task of every human being is to know God, so that He may know Himself in us.I have written at such length to try to give some idea of what this unique and wonderful book is, what you can expect to find in it. This is the most readable translation yet of a work that has for centuries been considered a marvel."},{"Title":"Ibn Al' Arabi: The Bezels of Wisdom (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This book is truly impressive. Arabi's deep knowledge of philosophy allowed him to describe many aspects of the experience of gnosis and prayer in a rare form that could be comprehended by the rational mind of only someone who has been there even to some small degree.

Arabi is completley experienced and educated in Philosophy, but is not what we would call a philosopher in the impractical, rhetorical, or sophist sense.

This book was orignially written several hunderd years ago and its translation decades ago long before Bin Ladins, at a time even before Afghans were seen as 'noble mujahadin fighting evil communism' and Khomeni was probably still sitting in Paris drinking coffee when this book came out.No, this is simply the traditional side of Islam practiced by the majority. Just because the media choses to focus on the cranks and madmen (who lets face it, sell newspapers) Does not mean that they are in any way a representation of Islam.There seems to be a modern trend to remain blissfully ignorant of Islam (in spite of daily so called 'qualified' media reports on the Muslim world) while at the same time sprout hatred against it (See the lunatics who have 'reviewed' the book 'politically incorrect guide to Islam' for proof of that) then finally come across an accurate representation of Islam and then think they are qualified to say. \\"Well you know I read this one book so some of them must be ok, we just need to sepparate the good ones from the bad ones.\\"Regarding the book itself; translated from Arabic to French by Titus Burckhard a first rate translator, author of Fez, city of Islam and several other works on art and spirituality and student of the Darqawi Sufi order and translated from French to English by Angela Culme-Seymore. The edition I have is from Beshara publications which was set up by a Turkish scholar by the name of Bulent Rauf who has also translated the comentary on the Fusus by Ismail Hakki Bursevi (out of print but realy needs to be republished, come on Beshara sort it out!)The translation is simple and easy to understand. The book itself covers the spiritual message that each prophet brought (for those who dont know and contary to popular belief Muslims believe in all of the Biblical Prophets) ending with the Prophet Muhammad. The book is not a full translation and from here it may be a good idea to go to the translation of Austin before going on to the Bulent Rauf translation. There is also a glossery of terms used in the text which also make this a lot easier to understand.I should point out, Ismail Hakki Bursevi was a Turkish Sheikh of the Jelveti order, a prolific writer (one of his works is a 10 volume commentary on the Quran) and founder of the Hakkiyye Jelveti Sufi order. This should give some idea of the importance of the Bulent Rauf translation. You should refer to the Kernel of the Kernel to farmiliarise youreslf with Bursevi before reading the Fusus.An exellent translation and an exellent introduction to ibn Arabi.

This is not only a problem for this book, but also for the all Islamic books translations including Quran. For instance, I do not understand why all authors insist on using God instead of the word Allah. Every muslim knows they have different meaning. (eg.There is only one God who is Allah). And all people in the world know the word Allah. Another example Lord istead of RAB. When people use the words generally we see in the Bible, it make Quran or other Islamic books sound very similar to Cristianity. Since we know that one of the miracles of Quran is it is the perfect book and its verses has really deep meanings when we translate all the words in the verses, we do not reflect the miracle of Quran very well."},{"Title":"Hudson Valley Harvest: A Food Lover's Guide to Farms, Restaurants, and Open-Air Markets","review":"This is THE book for anyone who lives, works, visits or is even thinking of a trip to the Hudson Valley, this bucolic but agriculturally threatened area, just an hour north of New York City. Jan Greenberg not only tells where to buy and eat these outstanding (and tasty) products but in a non-preachy way makes the reader understand why it is important to support these local farmers and producers. Her profiles and stories of the farmers who grow the fruits and vegetables and raise the livestock are truly heartfelt and gave me, and will do the same I think for anyone else who reads them, a new understanding of what is like to be a grower where everything, from weather to the economy, is out of your control. This is the high risk profession!! It makes Wall Street look safe.Above all, though, this is a book about enjoying food --buying it, serving it and tasting it. As Danny Meyer, owner of New York City's Union Square Cafe and other restaurants known for their support of local farms, writes - \\"This book deserves a place on the bookshelf (or in the glove compartment) of every itinerant aficionado of New York's bounty.\\" He's right."},{"Title":"Hudson Valley Harvest: A Food Lover's Guide to Farms, Restaurants, and Open-Air Markets","review":"We bought this book before a weekend trip to the Hudson Valley and can't imagine traveling to the area without it. It has everything you would want to know about the farmers and what they are growing and producing. It tells you where and what to eat and how to use what you buy at a farmstand or local farmers market. It also made us really think about the people who grow the food. Their stories are uniformly interesting, even moving. The author has a pleasingly gentle touch when she writes about issues so much in the news today like organics, the humane treatment of animals and keeping small farms viable. Even if you aren't visiting the Hudson Valley, this is definitely a worthwhile book to have and read."},{"Title":"Hudson Valley Harvest: A Food Lover's Guide to Farms, Restaurants, and Open-Air Markets","review":"Jan Greenberg's guide came in handy last weekend when I took my visiting family - kids, grandparents and everything in between - on a two day trip through the Hudson Valley.

The book is slightly lacking in exciting scenes of actual climbing, as many expedition books unfortunately tend to be, but has plenty of gripping material nevertheless."},{"Title":"Annapurna South Face","review":"Bonnington is a giant of mountaineering.

Things are changing. Thanks to the almost unbelievable juggling renaissance that has occurred in recent years, plus the tireless efforts of the International Jugglers Association, jugglers today are better informed than at any other time in history.The need for the truly definitive book, however, still remains; and while I'm not pretentious enough to believe that I can write such a book, I knew that embarking on a program of intense research and careful preparation of text and graphics was bound to have some success. But the \\"grand\\" volume I had envisioned grew to such proportions that for practical reasons it became necessary to handle it as two volumes.The volume you are holding represents a history of juggling, with comments and observations based on research, and also reflecting my personal experiences in the business. The second volume will contain extensive how-to explanations, but it is still waiting in the wings. In the meantime, enjoy the present volume and please see it as a necessary preparation for what is yet to come. I hope I have gathered and organized enough juggling information to satisfy most readers. But if you want additional historical data, fully illustrated with photographs, you will also want volumes 1 and 2 of Ziethen's 4,000 Years of Juggling.Today juggling is born anew. It has little to do with the circus of old, the Theatre Royal at Drury Lane in the 1720s, or even vaudeville. But to ignore history is a serious mistake. The colors that Cinquevalli and Rastelli lavished upon their juggling palettes still dazzle. And the present reader, however modern, is part of that history.It is not always clear how history can prepare you for the type of juggling you want to do. Yet history - in any field - has always provided the building blocks on which new ideas can be erected. You can learn from the juggling successes and failures of yesteryear, and history enables you to see the present in proper perspective. Moreover, it has always been nostalgically fascinating to look into the past, not to mention that you can develop good fellowship and joviality with jugglers past and present by knowing more about them.About the author: Francisco Alvarez has been juggling for over fifty years. As a young man, he studied art at the Arts and Crafts Club in New Orleans, where he discovered that it was as much fun to juggle the erasers as it was to draw pictures. During the height of the Great Depression, he struggled with a variety of unsteady jobs, working as busboy, commercial artist, and door-to-door photographer.But his juggling career finally prevailed. And despite his introverted belief that he was more comfortable behind a drawing board than in front of an audience, he had a successful juggling career in theaters and nightclubs that took him to seven foreign countries. He was a favorite novelty act at the Catskill resorts in upstate New York, where he repeatedly played Grossinger's, the Concord, and the Nevele Country Club.Among his television appearances are: the Steve Allen Show, the Robert Q. Lewis Show, the Chevy Show with Andy Williams and Ethel Merman, and three times on Sealtest's Big Top. In his retirement he moved from New York City to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he has taught juggling at the Mime Experiment and at the University of New Mexico. He is member of the Disabled American Veterans and the International Jugglers' Association."},{"Title":"Juggling: Its History and Greatest Performers","review":"99 dollars for a 129 pages? that's like a dollar a page!!! evil person, share information."},{"Title":"Common Sense Negotiation: The Art of Winning Gracefully","review":"This book is a clear example of where American and world business is going in its short term employment and flexible contracts. The business world likes clear linear lines to their contracts. Don Farber does as well but with a clear sense of the necessity for flexibility and an attitude that creates serious theatrical work rather than lost time in useless conflict. Hard feelings in the theater and film world simply cost money. Intrigue is not productive given the high levels of expertise and labor costs as well as the rental costs of shooting a movie. Humanity and a downplayed aggressiveness, leaving that for the product, is essential when the product is based upon human attitude. I have worked cross culturally on many occassions and have experienced the loss of a great deal of money based upon beliefs about the product not consonant with the market. Happily for myself and sadly for those who wouldn't listen to people like Don Farber, I wasn't the one losing the money."},{"Title":"Common Sense Negotiation: The Art of Winning Gracefully","review":"I am the Business Development Manager for a large electronics company, and always looking to improve my business skills. I found the book was written without a market in mind. It is some how written for a person with no experience, or education in business, who is dealing with mutli-million dollar contract in the play business. I think that rules out pretty much every person. It goes in to the basics of negotiations like &quot;you might need a contract&quot;, or &quot;some things might be important&quot;, and then addresses these issues in terms of a person who would need to be the best in their field to approach such situation. Badly written, no focus market, probably paid to get it published."},{"Title":"Common Sense Negotiation: The Art of Winning Gracefully","review":"This book is a clear example of where business both American and world wide is going in its short-term employment and flexible contracts. As a company director it is my experience that the regular business world likes clean, rather aggressive and litigious contracts in an inextricably linear logic. These negotiations and contracts often leave residues of anger, some fear and the overriding sense that the product wasn't invented that couldn't be abandoned by its producer, especially if it has a flaw.Responsibility, pride in product and a willingness to see a project through seems naive and out of date. Art both mirrors and projects the implications of societal forms and attitudes. Just as the movie &quot;All That Jazz&quot; exposed producers who considered the life blood of a great choreographer a simple product to be discarded when they could make more money from the company's insurance, so does the intelligent practice of Entertainment law promise a rescue from such a loss of values. Especially if the lawyer has, like Donald C. Farber, the long view.In the third most populous nation on the earth, with 75% of the population of European origin, America sits firmly astride an artistic economic depression that has lasted since the last &quot;great&quot; depression of the 1930s. Graduates of America's professional arts schools subsist on part time employment, poor family lives and a gross failure to make a living. It's clear that America's arts business more resembles the poorest third world country or Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota than it does even the local dry cleaning business.In the Arts the big winners are very big and the losers represent anywhere from 80 to 98% of the total college graduates in the field. Rather than lay this at the foot of education, we blame it on God (talent). Rather than blame the government for not economically stimulating a consciousness raising, educational, non-polluting, self-renewing, pleasurable, team developing profession, we blame it on consumer demand although the arts are regularly used to stimulate consumer demand through advertisement on television. Frankly this logic doesn't compute. Only the law and men like Donald C. Farber stand between this flawed format and total artistic cultural collapse.Donald C. Farber's &quot;Common Sense Negotiation, The Art of Winning Gracefully&quot; belies a &quot;Tiger&quot; of a book. Complexity expert John N. Warfield states that &quot;Nothing is complex to those who know how to solve the problem.&quot; Farber writes with a deft light touch walking amongst the mine fields and the failed careers of America's brightest talents with respect, humanity, compassion and toughness. I'm reminded of Deming's lectures or Senge's five disciplines. Farber has been dealing with and protecting free lance individual entrepreneurs since before the local corporations knew how to spell the word. Farber's sections on who the expert is, the importance of understanding the system, teamwork with your negotiator, clarity of intent, gracefulness under fire, the meaning of the deal and the mastery of it with an awareness of how to work right up until the final curtain, are well written and cleverly expressed. Unlike Senge who speaks more holistically than he writes, Farber writes as he speaks. That can be confusing to some who demand a more linear projection of reality. Such a view is not artistic and Farber has made his living from the beginning with artists. I would also recommend his &quot;From Option to Opening, a Guide to Producing Plays Off-Broadway&quot; as a practical companion to &quot;Common Sense Negotiation.&quot;He makes it clear from the beginning that even existing in the current climate is a success but his goals are higher than mere existence. He has a clear sense of the necessity for flexibility and an attitude that creates serious theatrical work rather than lost time in useless conflict. Like all lawyers Farber is no stranger to conflict but like the late Arthur Goldberg, he keeps things low key and points out that an agreement is only as good as the success of the product it produces. The goal is the project's success but all parties must survive to collaborate another day and that means that the project must be economically successful as well. The system of agreements is &quot;Common Sense&quot; or what anthropologist Clifford Geertz calls &quot;local knowledge&quot; i.e. cultural language that forms the basis for all agreements and is implied but not necessarily written. Farber explains these sub-texts in such a way that the actual document is clear across cultures."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"Defend IT book reviewI was not a major fan of the author's previous book \\"Hack I.T.', thus I was a bit skeptical about this one. However, this book delivers! It reminded me of \\"Hackers Challenge\\" 1 & 2 books (which I loved it), because the information in the book is structure around the realistic (or maybe even real) cases, illustrating various security aspects.The stories in the book cover a wide range of issues: from building a secure network from small business all the way to social engineering. Worm/virus infections, wireless security assessments, web applications, forensic investigation, security policy issues, DR and BCP, picking the right NIDS all find their place in the book. Especially, I loved the way they approached a usually boring subject of creating and implementing a security policy and DR planning. The policy case describes everything from 'why you need a policy' to security awareness and compliance verification. Executive fraud case was also lots of fun to read.Also, this is the first security book I've seen that explicitly mentions regulations and compliance issues. I liked their take on 'HIPAA in plain English.' Another great item were various response flowcharts for virus infection, attacks, etc.On the downside, the book does contain some technical errors. I would have discounted them as typos, but they look like the actual hands-on skills of the authors are getting rusty in some areas ('tcpdump', 'nmap', etc).In any case, the book's value lies more in the approach to explaining security, rather than in teaching all the 'nmap's command line options. The cases are detailed enough to engross the reader and I was sometimes wondering 'how it will end', like I would with a good fiction book. This book is both fun and enlightening.To conclude, while there is no substitute for actually experiencing the things covered in the book, reading about it will help aspiring and actual infosec pros.Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major security information management company.

I am currently a programmer, looking to get into the information security field.This book has successfully turned my interest in IT security into intrigue. Each chapter is a different real life case study, with techniques used and lessons learned. Coming from a technical background, I appreciated the technical depth that the authors delve into. From the get go in Chapter 1, the authors present a tutorial on the popular scanning tool called NMAP which is fascinating. The network diagrams throughout the book were very helpful in explaining to the reader the difficult concepts such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attack and Ingress and Egress filtering.\\"Defend I.T.: Security by Example\\" introduced me to many new concepts including IDS, INGRESS, EGRESS, DMZ, SSO, ZOMBIE,FIREWALL's, VPN's, PKI, and DOS attacks, just to name a few. Overall, this book is very informative and well-written.I highly recommend this book as a great addition to your IT Security library."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"The authors of Defend I.T.: Security By Example, teamed up previously to write Hack I.T.. The previous work was more along the lines of the hacking genre of books such as Hacking Exposed or Counter Hack, providing detailed explanations of various attacks to use in performing a penetration test of your network.Books like that are great for those with the knowledge and skills to make sense of them, but people who aren't as technical and don't necessarily work the front lines of network security such as managers and executives can still benefit from having an understanding of how such attacks can impact their company and a high-level understanding of how to defend against them.This book is not written for someone with zero technical knowledge. It does assume a certain level of understanding, but the case studies help to illustrate how the various attack techniques in the other type of books can be used and how you can protect your network.This book is similar to the Hacker's Challenge books in that it provides real-world scenarios, except that rather than solving the puzzle on your own the solution is included in the story like a short mystery.Managers of I.T. departments or security personnel and those who control the security budget would benefit from reading a book like this to understand what their people are up against. Those who actually work the front lines would still benefit from being able to associate information with real-world examples and applications.(...)"},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"Defend I.T. is a collection of case studies from the authors experiences in the field. The case studies are representative of the vast array of security consulting engagements they see in the computer security, forensics, and data privacy arena.It consists entirely of case studies, and that is different. It covers topics ranging from war dialing, wireless security, computer viruses, computer forensics, HIPAA assessment and social engineering. People tend to relate better and comprehend more when issues are presented as real life examples.Information Security is a challenging area. Organizations face security issues every day, but due to the need for confidentiality around these issues they are reluctant to share lessons learned with their peers and other organizations. This book fills a need. The authors provide the lessons learned in an anonymous fashion so readers can benefit from their experience as well as the experience of other organizations.The book attempts to illustrate the breadth and scope of knowledge a security consultant should have - covering both the technical and soft skills necessary to be successful in the field.As stated earlier the book provides perspective and advice on real life security issues many organizations are struggling with. Whether the OS is Linux or Windows-based, the issues are similar.

It starts out with almost no introduction at all into mapping target networks with nmap and never stops for a breath. There is a reasonable amount of explanation, but the heart of the book is in demonstrating hacking techniques at the system and command line level. Graphics are used well to smooth over some of the more difficult topics, which is why I gave the book four stars.The majority of the book, the first four parts, is dedicated to a command level explanation of various types of exploits, largely in the Unix environment. The last part of the book covers the social and legal aspects of hacking and the security response to hacking.This is reasonably short (~300 pages) book that gets to the point quickly and doesn't spend a lot of time on exposition. I would recommend it for Unix systems administrators and security professionals looking to round out their understanding of both the threat and strategies to cope with those threats."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"The problem with a lot of security books is that they are either really generic or highly specific. They teach the principles of security as well as the software and hardware that are necessary to help to secure a company, but they are either too generalized or are written with the assumption that every company will always and forever have certain hardware (coughCiscocough) in their organization.Some books take the opposite view and assume that all companies are equal and therefore can successfully utilize a \\"one size fits all\\" methodology. Many of these books also include hypothetical situations of hacks and responses to the attack, but many do not go into a lot of detail or solid explanations of what happened.But the reality is that every company is different; every network is different; every security vulnerability is different; and attacks are real, not hypothetical.\\"Defend I.T.: Security By Example\\" takes a different approach to corporate security. Rather than state a number of hypothetical and theoretical scenarios for computer attacks, this book instead takes numerous case studies of how real companies were hacked, the methods by which the hackers broke in, and the steps that were taken by each company to remediate the situations. This is not hypothetical information - this is the real deal.Some of the threats (and the way that they were detected and fought) include VPN hacking, worms, virii, WiFi, war dialing (yes, some people still do that), and even complete computer room failure.Additionally, the book covers incidents like cyber extortion, executive fraud, and industrial espionage. After all, not all attacks against intellectual property are committed from the outside world.Each chapter reads the same way for the most part. Each scenario is described in generic terms, followed by the way that the attack was successful, including methods that were used to hide the attack, how the attack was discovered, how the remedies were implemented, and a final section of what lessons were learned from the experience.One thing about this book that irritated me is that fact that the company names were replaced in order to \\"protect the innocent\\". The truth is that there are no innocents in security. We have the hacker, of course, who is obviously not innocent. But when we are dealing with a company (in whom a great deal of trust is placed) that did not take adequate steps to protect their network, that company is not totally innocent either.These companies might have been companies that you or I deal with regularly. If our private information and money is or was at risk, then we have the right to know about that, not only to determine if we want to do business with that company but also to investigate any follow-up work that was done after the incident.And as expected the author did not dare to touch the very factual notion that replacing Internet Explorer and Outlook could reduce virus and trojan infection by an order of magnitude at the current time. One thing that I have learned over the years is that security writers are terrified of treading on the toes of the Mighty Bill, and this book unfortunately is no exception.Regardless, this is a good book to have in every I.T. bookshelf."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"A nice management level discussion of securing an IT network against attackers. The authors have pitched their overall presentation towards a concerned manager, who may not necessarily have a technical background. Some sections do indeed require a bit of the latter. For example, the usages of network programs like nmap and tcpdump given in the first chapter may not mean too much to you. But most of the book shies away from instances of actual code. Generally, it suffices for you to know that certain programs and certain types of programs can be used against your network.The authors assume reasonably that for specific countermeasures being implemented, there are technical people in your organisation (perhaps reporting to you) that can implement these.Essentially, the book has a good level of abstraction. It could, however, do with more discussion of email and browsers. Like mentioning them in the index, for starters. These are still the first and second killer applications of the Internet. It is how most of your users will interact with the net. Granted, the book cites examples involving these. But perhaps a more prominent discussion, of how these usages might permit attacks or unwanted entries into your network, would be handy."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"This aptly titled book uses plentiful real-world examples to bring the reader into the world of information security. Sixteen chapters present a panoply of actual computer security attacks, each followed by lessons learned.Case studies come in five areas, from basic hacking to forensics. The book ably mixes introductory and technical material so that it succeeds at being useful without being inscrutable to nonexperts. The authors do, however, assume a basic level of network and security understanding. The case studies show what system and network administrators can do to protect their networks from the most common attacks.Even at 320 pages, the book is easy to read. It is a well-written work that balances the competing extremes of generality and minutiae. Any network administrator looking for a boot-camp approach to network threats is advised to read this book of example problems. The point is to learn by example so as not to become one."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"I. T. professionals learn best by doing and second best by learning what others have done. The two primary authors, who are also acting as editors, have taken their work and the contributions of seven other contributing authors to create a series of sixteen case studies of actual problems that have arisen in computer security. Of course, when necessary, the names of individuals and organizations have been changed, but if you follow the instances of security problems reported in the trade journals, some reasonable guesses can be made. Therefore, in this case, you are learning the principles of computer security by finding out how the pros handled the problems.The sixteen case studies are:*) Getting to know the enemy: Nmap the target network - how to learn the significant characteristics of a network you may want to penetrate.*) Home architecture - the topology of the network and how it can lead to security weaknesses.*) No service for you! - how to recognize and fend off a denial-of-service attack.*) Look, Ma, no wires! - how to construct and test a secure wireless network.*) Virus outbreak I - how to recognize and remove a virus on a large network.*) Virus outbreak II: the worm - how to recognize and remove a polymorphic worm.*) Changing face - how to harden a web site so that it is not defaced.*) Protecting borders: perimeter defense with an IDS - choosing, installing and configuring an intrusion detection system.*) Disaster all around - how to plan for and deal with a disaster that destroys your primary physical location.*) Security is the best policy - how to write and implement a security policy.*) HIPAA: security by regulation - how to deal with the security requirements posed by a governmentally mandated compliance.*) A war-dialing attack - how to stop the hacker who tries to penetrates a system via an insecure modem.*) A low-tech path into the high-tech world - how to prevent attacks based on social engineering.*) Industrial espionage - how to keep spies for competitors from learning your secrets.*) Executive fraud - how to gather electronic evidence to prosecute corporate fraud.*) Cyber extortion - how to deal with an attempt to hold your computers or data hostage.Each of the cases begins with some background concerning the situation and any preconditions to the problem. The next step is a description of the situation and the circumstances that caused a security problem to be identified. It then concludes with information about how the problem was handled and any weaknesses in the system that allowed the problem to occur.This is a very good book for learning some of the basic security problems that are encountered by I. T. security professionals on a daily basis and how they are solved. It is not a how-to book, in the sense that you are given a numerical sequence of steps to perform. I recommend it to all persons who work as or aspire to be a computer security professional."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"'Defend IT' is a novel follow-on to 'Hack IT,' a book I reviewed over two years ago.

The vast majority of the new book contains 16 case studies, some of which I found very helpful.My favorite chapter is 'Disaster All Around' (ch 9), where an Internet-centric insurance company suffers complete destruction of their primary data center. A fire caused by electrical problems exposes the company's lack of a disaster recovery plan and process for resuming business operations. Thanks to hard-working staff, the company was online in 72 hours -- but the CEO was fired! I was pleased to see a disaster recovery chapter in a general security book, as acts of God can be as devastating as the uber hacker who thinks he is God.I commend ch 2 ('Home Architecture') for insights I find lacking in most books on intrusion detection or incident response. The authors astutely state on p. 26 and 33: 'this incident was not discovered by flashing lights and alerts set off by an IDS... In fact, there was no early indication of a network compromise.' This explains the authors' next recommendation: 'It is a good idea to keep access logs that are as detailed as possible -- at least with respect to inbound and outbound connections... Though you may not use these logs on a regular basis, for those instances when you need them, especially including investigations of network compromise, they are invaluable.&quot; Exactly!'Defend IT' suffered a few problems. Ch 3 features listing 3.1, which supposedly shows 'TCP SYN' packets part of a denial of service attack. Listing 3.1 doesn't show a single SYN packet, although many PSH ACK, UDP, and ICMP packets appear. Listing 3.2 claims to show SYN ACK packets from the DoS target, but only RST ACK packets from the victim and null TCP packets (with no flags set) from the attackers. Ch 3 also says 'DSL features fast download speeds... but slow upload speeds... ADSL features both fast upload and download speeds.' This is backwards; the 'A' in ADSL stands for 'asymmetric,' meaning faster downloads than uploads. I also found unnecessary redundancies in the forensics section, where two chapters (14 & 16) by the same author repeated material. I didn't think the conclusion matched the tone or content of the rest of the book, as it featured a hodge-podge of security technologies while the other 300 pages discussed case studies.Overall, I enjoyed reading 'Defend IT.' I thought the chapters which featured network diagrams were enlightening, as information on real-world architectures can sometimes be difficult to find. I would caution the authors to ensure a second edition has slightly more current case studies. Ch 4, for example, suffers the myth that 'too few packets' on a wireless LAN is protection against cracking WEP; see the recent 'Wi-Foo' book for the real deal. Also, be careful when sanitizing data about clients. GPS coordinates and street names in screen shots might give away the farm, especially when readers have access to online business directories."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"There's a virtual war happening between IT professionals and those who use the Internet for destructive purposes ranging from computer crimes and hacking to virus and worm creations, but until now no title has tackled the stories of these events and what was done right or wrong in actual computer security attacks.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"It's been a long time since I read a technical book cover-to-cover as I did with this book. The case studies are almost like detective stories. The reader wants to know how they end and what the authors learned. Too many technical books these days are both too dense and too full of errors. Perhaps those are related. The books are so dense that neither the author nor the editors find the mistakes. This book was easy to read cover-to-cover because it's concise, clear, accurate, entertaining, and informative. The choice of topics for the case studies is good: reconnaissance missions, wireless networks, virus infections, denial of service attacks, HIPAA, computer forensics, etc. I learned a lot from the book and enjoyed myself while learning. The book will also serve as a good reference. I imagine I will refer to it quite often as I solve problems that are similar to the ones covered in the book. Definitely a five-star book in my opinion."},{"Title":"Defend I.T.: Security by Example","review":"first off I would like to note that my friend's dad is the co-author of this, and Hack I.T,.

This is a series of real-life case studies of security issues faced by actual companies.The chapter breakdown: Getting to Know the Enemy: Nmap the Target Network; Home Architecture; No Service For You!; Look, Ma, No Wires!; Virus Outbreak 1; Virus Outbreak 2: The Worm; Changing Face; Protecting Borders: Perimeter Defense with an IDS; Disaster All Around; Security Is the Best Policy; HIPAA: Security by Regulation; A War-Dialing Attack; A Low-Tech Path into the High-Tech World; Industrial Espionage; Executive Fraud; Cyber Extortion; Conclusion; Recommended Reading; IndexAs you can tell from the chapter breakout, it's not all about hackers and crackers. Security is often the mundane task of writing policies and enforcing regulations. Gupta and Laliberte draw upon experience from their past consulting engagements to look at these various issues with a sense of realism that is often missing in these types of security books. Most companies that suffer some sort of security breach don't want any news whatsoever of the incident leaking out. While the authors don't use real company names, the actual incidents did happen. You can learn from them before you find yourself in the same position.There is a reasonable balance between detail and concept in the various chapters. Management will be able to follow along and understand what type of issues are at stake. The techies will be able to glean enough technical detail to help prevent the same type of issues from occurring to their company.

To a certain extent I was disappointed that, despite much academic rigour, Dominic did not reveal his own voice, particularly in the position that modern popular culture currently occupies in our modern social society.However, for somebody - A' level or undergraduate - who is looking for a well written and accessible account of Hollywood, the importance of genre, or the significance of 'reception theory' in current media and film studies debate, then this is certainly an excellent first point of contact.Thoroughly well recommended and wholeheartedly endorsed."},{"Title":"Margaret Ogilvy","review":"JM Barrie wrote this curious memoir of his mother after her death. I don't know much about Barrie's personal life, I found it psychologically qute strange. He seemed obsessed with the idea of being her son and being close to her, yearning for her to mother him and to remain forever a little boy. (Yes - this was the writer of Peter Pan all right). He gives a vivid pictures of a provocative, strong minded, intelligent Scotswoman who wanted things very much HER way and was extremely mysterious and hard to pin down. Yet Barrie clearly got a great deal out of his relationship with her and genuinely loved her. This touching book made me feel there was a great deal more to find out about Barrie and now I want to read more about him. I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Buchholz(B)has written an above average book on the history of economic thought.His treatment of Adam Smith,Thomas Malthus and John Maynard Keynes is,unfortunately,below average.First,Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments is simply left hanging in the air.B doesn't connect the two books.Smith spent over 50 pages of the The Wealth of Nations arguing for universal education and religious instruction.The private sector economic decision makers in Smith's model are not atheistic libertarians who believe in the Invisible Hand.They are a mixture of highly moral judeo-christian-deist citizens for whom the ten commandments is a guiding light.Second,the conflict between the inductive empiricism of Thomas Malthus and the a priori,deductive rationalism of David Ricardo is not sufficiently highlighted.Malthus was a thinker seeking to operate in the real world while Ricardo was most at ease in his theoretical ivory tower.Finally,B had a chance to write about some of the most powerful ideas developed by J M Keynes in the A Treatise on Probability(1921)and the General Theory(1936;GT) that have been submerged for up to eighty years.B could have written about Keynes's interval estimate approach to probability,Keynes's specification of an index to measure ambiguity(uncertainty or weight of the evidence)some 40-50 years before Ellsberg,Keynes's decision rule c(conventional coefficient of weight and risk)that incorporated certainty,reflection,translation and preference reversal effects some fifty years before Slovic and Lichtenstein or Kahneman and Tversky published their work or gone to pp.55-56,ft.2 or pp.283-285 of the GT and integrated Keynes's derivatives(take the anti derivative)to derive in clearcut fashion Keynes's aggregate supply function Z(Z would turn out to be equal to P+wN,where P equals expected profit,w the money wage and N equals aggregate employment)that no economist has successfully derived in the last 65-70 years.Unfortunately,B does not list a single new idea from a dead economist that is also correct.The title is thus somewhat misleading.B should have titled his book\\"New Applications of Some Old Ideas of Dead Economists\\"."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"I love this author.

It is better on the Economists then the Schools because it remains focused and adds interest with autobiographical details. Never the less, the book is overall dull and the \\"humor\\" heavy handed. I can see it working OK as a lecture course but in book format it is all rather turgid. A pity as Economics can be interesting and fun!. If you want to learn a bit about how economists think on modern issues I think \\"Named Economics\\" by Charles Wheelan will serve you much better.

Capitalism is the best system we have to date. And this book gives us an introduction of the great economist of the past and present. And it help to relate the problems of the past to the problems of the present. Unfortunately, we are still making some of the same disastrous policies of the past today.This books starts of with Adam Smith, the father of modern economics. It covers Thomas Malthus, Ricardo, Karl Marx, Keynes, and many more, eventually ending with Milton Friedman.The Author Buchholz seems to pay great tribute to Adam Smith, and rightfully so in my opinion. And he speaks of the angry Karl Marx and his doomed policies. Karl Marx speaks of a utopia world that will never exist, simply due to human nature. Adam Smith understood the human nature, the selfish man. Adam Smith was a behaviorist before his publication of The Wealth of Nations. And so fittingly, he found a system that will compliment our human nature and idealism, not destroy it as Marx would.Great historical intro to economics!"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Feldstein has done an excellent job in giving a lively account of economic history.

Funny, insightful, terrific. Buchholz's prose is lyric and fun to read"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought this sounds really interesting. It is, if you like to read trivia about economists, most of whom are dead. There are loose connections made to miscellaneous events in modern times, but the bulk of the book combines jokes that have been around for decades (as dead as the economists) with mini-biographies more suited to a fan magazine, focusing on John Stuart Mill's dysfunctional childhood, John Maynard Keynes' marriage to a ballerina, John Kenneth Galbraith's height, Thorstein Veblen's odd mode of dress and his lecture on cannibalism, and similar delicacies.My impression is that the author found no use for this information when he was studying economics, but hated to throw out his boxes of notes. So he came up with a great, if dishonest, title and packaged the miscellany for sale. If you have no real interest in economics, but love gossip columns and want to sound like you know something about famous economists, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"I was forced to read much of this for an economics class and found it shallow, often infuriatingly so. The author swallows whole the complacent platitudes of modern economics and never, ever seriously examines his assumptions. Perhaps most irritatingly, it sometimes seems as though Buchholz has never read some of these economists first hand; he totally mangles Adam Smith, and presents a distorted view of a man whose thought was much richer than anything here."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"I enjoyed this book. Todd Buchholz gives his readers a good, well-written introduction to most of the major schools of economics. His portraits of the \\"dead economists\\" who launched and powered these various schools are excellent, as are his summaries of each of these schools. (Fortunately, not all of Buchholz's \\"dead economists\\" are dead: Ronald Coase, Milton Friedman, James Buchanan, and Robert Lucas, among others, are thankfully still alive.)I will recommend this book to non-economists who ask me for an accessible introduction to economic analysis.Only a few nits are worth picking. One is that, from time to time, Buchholz mentions an interesting fact without providing a reference. For example, in his chapter on Public Choice economic, he illustrates the reality and size of pork-barrel politics by reporting the finding of an (unnamed) researcher who \\"calculated that for the price of the $200 billion highway bill [enacted by Congress in 1998], the U.S. could literally pave the streets with gold (gold-plating, that is).\\" I wanted to check out this study, but could find no citation to it.Another nit is that, again in his chapter on Public Choice economics, he should have introduced his readers to the term, and concept, of rent-seeking.A third (and really small) nit is that he mistakenly reports that Thomas Sargent shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in economics with Robert Lucas. Not so. Sargent is not, at least yet, a Nobel laureate.Especially nice are (1) Buchholz's exploration of Keynes's attitude toward government, (2) his explanation of the deepest problems with Marxian economics, and (3) his very able treatment of rational-expectations economics. But please don't read this paragraph as suggesting that Buchholz performs well only in these areas. Again, from beginning to end, this is a very sound and very useful effort."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Note first of all that there are two editions of this book floating around: the one from 1989 and the one from 1999. Both of them have the same covers, the same author, the same everything: but there is a world of difference between the two.In short, go with the latter, called (inconspicuously) the \\"Revised Edition.\\" (Many websites are selling both indiscriminately; Amazon is not -- the one on this page is safe to buy.) The one from 1989 is ridiculously outdated: it still makes many references to the Soviet Union; the dollar is still strong; the Euro has yet to come into existence; the Asian Tigers have yet to rise, etc. It's like watching a TV show from the 70s!Now, to the book itself: it is amusing and informative, but it is seriously misnamed. A more accurate -- but not as catchy -- title would have been: \\"A Precis of Modern Economic Thought via the Ideas of the Great Economists.\\" For that is, ultimately, what you're getting. The ideas are certainly not \\"new,\\" except perhaps from the point of view of someone who was previously ignorant of them.The book proceeds -- in narrative fashion and without graphs -- to give a chronological history of economics by means of the ideas of the great economists. One strong point in the author's approach is that even when you feel he's ardently at variance with an idea whose discussion is required, he is still very fair to it.Specialized knowledge of economics, math, or history is not required, and the author does much to keep the book readable.Alas! the book gets bogged down in the later stages, when discussing the debate between the Keynesians and the monetarists. It just goes on forever: I don't feel that Buchholz did a particularly noteworthy job of reducing the complexities of this issue for lay readers -- or even making it interesting for them.Despite these problems, you will learn something from reading this, unless you are already familiar with the economists and the ideas he discusses. But if that's the case, what you're doing with the book in the first place is beyond me."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Those of us who were cranked through government-run schools probably all had similar high school economics classes. I seem to remember spending more time studying the machinations of the Fed and doing words and terms than taking economics seriously as a branch of philosophy.This book was a welcome surprise. Desperate for some much-needed education on economics, I took a recommendation and read this book. What a treasure! Buchholz entertains with wonderful biographical sketches of the more prominent economists; it is interesting to see how their lives influenced their thinking (John Stuart Mill's remarkable life-change is something I found striking). The analogies used to demonstrate certain principles, including such modern icons as the cast of Gilligan's Island, clarified the author's point while providing a chuckle. Buchholz seems to favor &quot;laissez-faire&quot; government and clearly prefers certain theories over others, but he gives fair treatment to all mentioned: Adam Smith gets significantly more ink than Thorstein Veblen, but Keynes and Marx, although the author is neither Keynesian nor Marxist, are written about in great detail and each have their own chapter.Obviously, this book is not geared towards folks who already know about economics. But, unlike other introductory texts, this one is not only thorough but effective. After reading it, I felt very confident in my ability to comprehend today's financial headlines; I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"If you're after a rough outline of how economics got where it is today, and who the people behind the subject's founding ideas really were, then the Dead Economists is a great place to start. Buchholz kicks things off with the invisible hands of Smith/Hayek, and then breezes through the lives and ideas of Malthus, Ricardo, Mill, Marx, Marshall, Veblen, Galbraith, Keynes and Friedman. The final two chapters get broader and cover Public Choice and Rational Expectations.Strange as it may seem, there's nothing really on Schumpeter, Frank Ramsey, Robert Solow, Joan Robinson, Irving Fisher or Robert Mundell to name but a few - although, I suppose, these individuals didn't really lead economics off in truly new directions. But Nobel Prize winner Mundell was largely responsible for starting international economics as we know it. It's odd that he's not even mentioned.Still for non-specialists, there isn't that much theory and what there is comes in easy to understand sketches of where the big ideas came from and what these mean for the world we live in today.Overall I liked the Dead Economists, although I can understand why some people might think it a bit light. The author likes a joke. Some readers don't. It reads like pulp history. Some don't like that. My view is that if you already know your dismal science, then this is a nice, easy read and it gives lovely insights into the lives of economics' greatest thinkers. Alternatively, if you're a novice and you like a bit of history, then NIDE should suit your needs just fine."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"I found the book to be a good and clear review of the concepts and ideas of a number of economists since the 'science' was founded by Adam Smith. The authors did a good job of convincing me that no economists or economic system has a monopoly on truth. But then they go and spoil it all by slipping in snide remarks about economists or economic ideas that they don't like. Galbraith and Marx really get in the neck and they don't seem to be able to decide what they think about Keynes. Friedman is elevated to sainthood and yet monetarism had distastrous consequences for the World economy in the 80's and from which economies - particularly the US and the UK - are only just recovering. I would recommend reading it but take it with a few spoons of Galbraith for leavening. Galbraiths jokes are also better by the way!"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Buchholz gives the reader a lucid book on introductory economics. I call it introductory because this isnt a book written for advanced economic analysis. Its not for people who already did many courses in economics. Its definately not for economic teachers. This is a must have book for all those people who are interested in understanding or at least knowing about this complex subject. Its will more than enrich you, in case you started reading the book with no knowledge of economics.Buchholtz starts with the father of modern economics, Adam Smith and follows with giving (almost biographical) details of Malthus, Ricardo, Marshal, Keynes. The chapter on Monetarist and their attack on Keynes follows and its worth reading twice. Then he gives a brief description of all other important economists of last century. This is followed by chapters on new methods such as Public Choice and Rational Expectations. All chapters are written in a very informal, witty style and this helps the reader keep interest. Economics, being a rather dry subject is taught well here, with good illustrations and in a very non-technical way.The downside of the book is not being able to cover more economists. The author talks about Rational Expectations without mentioning anything about John Muth or much of Robert Lucas. This was missing, but I assume he did that because anyone reading or learning about economics for the first time (the intended audience of this book) might not have to know about these economists. Like wise, Veblen, Galbraith, Samuelson and new economists such as Paul Krugman, Joseph E. Stiglitz are not covered. But again, its not possible to cover so many and I guess also due to the fact that teh author wanted to cover schools of economic thought more than individual economists themselves.All in all, this book is very interesting to read as it is very well written. If you have read this review and have no idea of economics but want to have one, here we go, just buy the book!"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"This books generally delivers what it promises, a review of major thoughts from economists evaluated (somewhat) in a modern context. If that's what you are looking for, it's probably worth reading. However I had three problems with the book. First, he says some incredibly, bizarrely wrong things (quantum mechanics is not a hard science, the internet was invented by private industry, California may float away into the ocean). Even though they are topics outside of economics, they made me generally suspicious of his knowledge. Second, from some of his comments it is clear his writing has a political/philosophical bias but he never comes out and states what it is. Since I'm not an economist (after all, that's why I'm reading this book), it seems impossible to figure out what his bias is and how to correct for it. Third, perhaps a minor point, but he keeps drifting slightly off-topic in order to include a cute saying or clever remark. I mostly found this annoying, but other readers might find it helps keep the book light and fun."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"The first time I read this distinguished work by Buchholz, I began the book having half forgotten the economics which I took at college level, and ended the book self-congratulating myself for picking up most of what I had forgotten. When I re-read the book, this time the economic theories that I was taught in a post-graduate course still fresh in my mind, I was in awe with the brilliance and clarity with which Buchholz explains the insights of economic theories without compromising the insight and depth of difficult concepts. As economics comes increasingly under the grips of ever more esoteric mathematics, Buchholz shows the path toward a refreshing style of describing economic behaviors, sans mathematica, without compromising the dazzling insights elucidated by gurus from Adam Smith through Alfred Marshall, John Maynard Keynes to present day giants in the field (e.g. Coase, Friedman, Buchanan). While Buchholz clearly intended the book for the layman, it is actually an introductory economics text par excellence."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"This is a very good book, but I was somewhat disappointed with it. The problem is the title, which is misleading. It should have been called &quot;A Modern Interpretations of Some Great Economists&quot;. There are no new ideas, nor really any new interpretations of old ideas. Another possibility, to apply these ideas to contemporary situations, is done very superficially and with none of the wit and imagination the author uses in their exposition. As a professional economist, I did not find the book very useful. What the book is, is a very good introduction to the history of economic thought. If some day I give an economics course, in particular to non-economists, this book will provide its basis. The witty and light way in which some of the greatest ideas in economics are presented is very appealing. With a book such as this, the countless students who hate the subject of economics will see that it is a living and human endeavor. My congratulations to the author although I suggest he change the title."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"This book would make an excellent pre-100 level textbook for students interested in economics. Buchholz covers all major economic theories and their proponents from Adam Smith's Invisible Hand to the most currently vocal Rational Expectations theory. The detail never gets so deep as to actually present charts and diagrams, but is solid enough that the reader comes away with a general understanding of each theory.The book suffers a little in the beginning as Buchholz seems uncomfortable simply presenting the dry facts and ends up regaling the reader with anecdotes and economist in-jokes that may play in the classroom but fall flat in textual form.Buchholz really hits his stride when he starts talking about Keynes, though. Perhaps it is the benefit of having multiple economic theories at odds with each other by the early 20th century that make writing about it so easy. Whatever the case, his coverage from Keynes to the modern day is exceptionally well done. Focusing less on the character of the men and more on the value of their theories, Buchholz clearly describes Keynesian, Monetary, and Rational economic theories. He proceeds to play them off each other to the delight of the reader. Where the first part of the book failed to be dynamic, the latter half is exceedingly entertaining and informative.The problem is that I'm not interested to know that Smith was a klutz or that Malthus was well-polished. Those things are only used by Buchholz to bring life to these dead economists. He could have brought them more to life with more focus on what keeps them alive than the things buried with them.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in getting an overview of economic thought. It will introduce you to just about all the important economic theories that have made an impact as well as the latest 'cutting edge' theories that present alternatives to the existing body of work. I hope to find a book that can replicate Buchholz's success with the modern era theories for those economists that I feel he short-shrifted in this one."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Todd Buchholz brings together a wonderful and well written overview of many different schools of economic thought. This book neatly discusses, summarizes, and brings up criticisms and problems in economics from the days of Adam Smith, to our most recent 'Rational Expectations' school. Each section is divided up into 20 to 30 odd-some pages so that the reader will not be too engrossed in one partiular school of thought, and will be able to easily transition from one school to the next and for the most part, he works in a chronological order. You will learn about the most famous economists Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes, Karl Marx, Alfred Marshall, as well as Milton Friedman and some of the lesser known economists, whose theories are the foundation of both micro and macroeconomics. Well written and worth the read!"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Other texts are more technical and exhaustive, but this book is written for the layperson and is *almost* a primer for economics itself, seen through the passage of history. It begins with Smith, devotes chapters to Malthus, Ricardo, Marx, Veblen, Marshall, Mill, Keynes, Friedman, Public Choice, Rational Expectations, etc. The descriptions of how prices coordinate activity and of comparative and absolute advantage is about as good as any, and clear enough for anybody to understand.This is a great book to use as a jumping off point for studying more of the economists, schools of thoughts, and concepts mentioned. A great companion book to Naked Economics, Basic Economics (Sowell), or Economics in One Lesson.For a far more accurate (and far more in-depth and less beginner-friendly) treatment of Marx, see Sowell's book on Marxism, the chapter here repeats a few well-worn misconceptions about Marxian economics."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"I am constantly amazed how little economists know about the history of their profession. They have heard (at best) of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, J.M Keynes. This survey will add to the reader's store of knowledge of an additional ten seminal thinkers."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"1. There was a bit too much detail about the subjects' private lives-- however this information was somewhat useful in getting an idea of the context from which the ideas came. So.....Keynes (the aesthete) seemed to be some sort of reaction against the Victorian background from which he had come.2. The Public Choice policy discussion was, by far, the best part of the book. The thoughts that were expressed in this chapter are ideas that I have encountered in many other contexts-- but these were a wonderful, concise exposition to the ideas and their founding fathers (Mancur Olson). There was also wonderful discussion of what they did explain and what they did not.3. Monetary and Fiscal policy were also great. A lot of people know those words, but don't know the profound differences in the ideas that anchor these concepts (\\"fiscal stimulus\\"/\\"Monetary stimulus\\"). I counted in these people before reading this elucidating book but can at least talk conversationally about it.4. Because this book deals with the basic schools of thought in different parts of Economics, it can give you specific places to start looking in the search for deeper information. It can also clarify the most fundamental differences between differing schools of thought.5. On the down side, the book is not all that light to read. Most books this length I could take in about 2 afternoons of reading. But this one is of such a depth that I could read (and absorb) no more than one chapter per day.6. There were also a few problems with the author's attempts at drollery. He could have left them out and the book would not have been diminished in any way.Other than that, this is a great book and well worth the (new) purchase price. I have a feeling that it is something to which I'll return time and time again."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"This book is a genuinely lucid, if brief, journey through the major schools of economic thought for a layman. Its advantage over other introductions to economics is that it is mainly centred on particular theories and figures rather than economic concepts (of course, there's also a place for the latter). It presents these theories entertainingly and sets up their differences well. Rather than dealing with pure fact, there is a good deal of normative opinion covered. Bucholz relates everything he says to modern life and gives background entertainingly. He writes humorously and interestingly, though some of the jokes are a bit worn.The book doesn't attempt to be a comprehensive academic history of economics and inevitably focuses in on some areas. It also looks at figures like Marx and Mill who, while economic thinkers, wouldn't necessarily be called economists in the modern sense, which is interesting. Despite its populism, the book is genuinely informative, and this combined with its relaxed, anecdotal style, make it an excellent choice. If you want an overview of major economic schools of thought (rather than basic economic concepts) at a readable but informative level, this is your book."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"One of the best books I have ever read! The author uses everyday examples to explain economic principles. He also provides the readers with background information of the great economists. The book is very interesting also. It should be a must read for every beginner of economics!"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"I bought this book because I like to consider myself a well-informed person, and enjoy finance/economics/business, but never knew what people were talking about when they referred to \\"Keynesian economics\\" or \\"Adam Smith's invisible hand\\". This book is exactly what it claims to be- a solid introduction to modern economic thought. It covers all the great economists, a brief summary of their life, and an explanation of what they added to economic theory. The author is clearly biased, but how could you not be clearly biased against Marx? His writing makes a somewhat tedious topic entertaining- I literally laughed out loud a number of times. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with the same goal as me- a quick catch-up on what's been going on in economics in the past few hundred years, to understand the topic a little better and have intelligent conversations about it. There are definitely no detailed descriptions of theories or in-depth personal analyses of the men themselves- it is a beginners book that makes the topic entertaining and gives you just enough information to understand what people are talking about when economics comes up, and maybe even contribute your own opinions."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Economics textbooks are notoriously boring-riddled with oversimplified examples of Robinson Crusoe building huts and Friday gathering coconuts. Buchholz finally published something that anyone will find amusing, even if you are only marginally interested in the study of economics. His sharp and satiric writing is unparalleled in anything I have read that so accurately describes modern economic thought. Milton Friedman, the father of the Monetarists and who has a chapter dedicated to him as one of the best economists of all time, said \\"this wide-ranging survey of economic thought combines a witty and clear exposition with a high degree of accuracy.\\" If Friedman agrees with what Buchholz writes about him and others, it has some credibility.The bottom line is that it is easy to become passionate about the contents of this book. It explains the evolution of economics from Adam Smith's specialization in Scotland to Maynard Keynes' treatise on government deficits. There is more political policy and social science here that affects all of our long-term lives than in most other books. Every responsible citizen should understand why the presidents try to increase the deficit when the stock market is down. That way uninformed people don't cry for a balanced budget because is sounds nice-that kind of thought is much of what got us into the Great Depression. If Herbert Hoover would have read this book, understood and implemented its contents, he could have avoided the Great Depression altogether, turning it into an average, cyclical recession.It continually amazes me how many college-educated Americans repeatedly criticize capitalism and prophesy its doom. Every day that people claim capitalism will fail is one day farther than it being true. Schumpeter spearheaded the movement in the 60s, claiming that capitalism would eat out its own infrastructure, and collapse. Guess what Schumpeter, it was communism that behaved precisely as you predicted capitalism would! I guess back to my point-it is fine to criticize capitalism if the criticisms are understood and founded; there are obviously both benefits and detriments to any sociopolitical policy and organizations. But please, do so after you have studied economics and understand at least partially the motivations behind the call to capitalism.If I ever end up teaching high-school economics, I will certainly ask my students to read this book. And I know that they will enjoy it-it was required reading in my Econ 110 class, and even those students who despised the Economics class tell me that they appreciated and admired New Ideas from Dead Economists."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"This books was just what i was looking for, and introduction to the mainstream ideas of economics, where they come from and what they say.

I'm not interested in the their lives, their childhood, their education, their friends, their abilities, etc.For example, \\"Marshall also realized that facts teach nothing by themselves\\".

This is so much more than an economic text; combining elements of sociology, philosophy, and politics, I recommend this to anyone who wishes to grasp a more complete view of American society through an economic standpoint."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"I've read both Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner and New Ideas From Dead Economists, by Todd Buchholz. I wanted to get a good rounded layperson introduction to great economists in the past.First let me examine Heilbroner's book first since that's more widely known, has sold more, and more Economics 101 classes use it as a supplemental text. I'll then compare Heilbroner's book to Bucholz's and explain why I think Bucholz's book is far superior in every way.I found Heilbroner's book to be neither useful to the layperson nor to people who have a good background in Economics. Let me explain.Heilbroner spends a LOT of time in awe of these economists and spends a great deal of time explaining how great they were, how revolutionary, how brilliant, how much of a genius, how wonderful these men were, ad nauseum. Ok, I get the point. Unfortunately, all this fawning and fan worship clouds what should've been the more interesting and more important part of the book, which are the central economic ideas put forward by these thinkers. In fact, there's a lot of emphasis on putting their economic ideas in perspective to the prevailing moral philosophical thought at the time.It's almost as if this books is written for people who have already taken Economics 101, and know all the basic economic principles and can nod, &quot;yes, uh huh, I didn't know those personality quirks or their moral philosophical outlook about these economists - good to know. By the way, it's great that he didn't go over his economic ideas since I already know them.&quot;For example, the entire chapter devoted to David Ricardo fails to mention the theory of Comparative Advantage anywhere in the chapter. Isn't that a MAJOR omission? That's just one example. Omissions such as this are everywhere.So the layperson is stuck getting a vague feeling that these people were wonderful people, but that a little less fuzzy on their ecnomic ideas. It also leaves a person with economics background feeling like this is less a book about economics and more a book about Heilbroner's fan worship.Neither audience is served. I can't recommend the Heilbroner book.Right after I read this book, I read Todd Buchholz's New Ideas From Dead Economists.Where Heilbroner failed, Buccholz succeeds in so many ways. He puts the central ideas of these economists as the main focus of each chapter. When talking about David Rircardo, the theory of Comparative Advantage is front-and-center. When talking about Marx, Heilbroner meanders and throws a lot of Marx's ideas around and you don't get a sense of how they all fit together in Marx's mind or why modern economists find fundamental flaws in his reasoning. In Buccholz's book, the central point is Marx's ideas, how they fit together and it's very clear why most economists (and the reader) will find Marx's basic premise wrong in light of emperical evidence. This goes on and on.I initially thought Heilbroner would be a good read, since it was recommended by econ majors when I was in college and they'd never heard of Buccholz's book. I'm glad I read both.Do yourself a favor - read the better book."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"The title of 'New Ideas from Dead Economists' is the most clever part of this book. The early sections on Smith, Ricardo, and Malthus lacked depth. Buchholz brought in too many contemporary topics in his discussion of Smith, and as is common, did not pay proper attention to Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments. His discussions of Malthus and Ricardo are better, but he tries to hard to be entertaining rather than informative.Bucholz fails badly with Keynes, Marx and Veblen. What he discusses of Keynes is not wrong, but there is far more to discuss. His chapter on Marx suffers from similar problems. He hits on the better known aspects of Marx's life and Marxian theory. Most readers would benefit from greater detail. His section on Veblen is about the worst part of this book. His interpretation of 'The Engineers and the Price System' is just plain wrong. The author cites some simple statistics on the education of businessmen and engineers in an effort to refute Veblen. This proves only that he misinterprets this material.The author's discussion of new institutionalists is on target, but brief. His discussion of Rational Expectations is hardly worth reading. He seems to want to mock RE, but with enemies like Buchholz, Bob Lucas has little need of friends. The section on Public Choice is so incomplete, that readers are better off ignoring this too.He has a good discussion of Marshall. But Marshall is not a particularly interesting economist. Bucholz mentions Hayek from time to time, but should have had a separate chapter for him, along with Mises.The key problem with this book is that the author was more interested in keeping his readers entertained than in informing them. Readers that need a book to be 'cute' are never really going to get into economics. Readers that will really get interested in these ideas are better off getting more of just that, and in a fittingly serious tone."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"This book will complement any collegiate economics course inbasic economics or economic theory. The authors discuss importanteconomists of the past. For instance, Adam Smith's theories aregiven quite a bit of space in this book. Smith taught thatthe division of tasks into component parts will increase outputdue to the shear specialization and learning curve effects.He explained that free trade benefited England because goodscould be bought cheaper than they could be produced in the mothercountry. As a result, English labor could specialize in areasof comparative advantage. Malthus warned that the populationboom would result in greater poverty down the line. Economistscan argue this even today. Malthus argued for delayed marriageto enhance the standard of living for married couples.Ricardo argued that consumers could consume a greater varietyof goods with free trade regardless of the stage in theadvancement of trading partners. Marshall and Jevonsargued that marginal utility diminished with each portion.That is, more of a good thing would lead to less pleasureincrementally. If people consumed all of their income,Says Law found that &quot;Full Employment&quot; could remain. This isoverly optimistic because consumers don't always have the samelevel of demand for goods and services-particularly duringweak economic cycles. This book is a good supplement tothe existing library of Economics volumes."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"There are a couple of points that are good to know before you pick up this short economics history. First, the title is misleading, it is not \\"new ideas\\", but just \\"ideas\\" form dead economists. Second, it is not only theories (ideas), but also biography (at least sometimes). The latter is where the book fails the most. I'll come back to this later.This is a history of ideas book, but it is also a saga of how modern economy (the dismal science) came to life. This epics starts, naturally, with the Physiocrats and Adam Smith. Modern free-marketeers and Republicans have taken for themselves Smith's theories. They place them in the ideological camp against Big Government. But \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" starts with a critique to Mercantilism and its focus on money. Wealth, in Smith's view, is productive, not monetary. Of course the Spanish Empire learned this the hard way after bringing gold and silver from America. This new theoretical framework for wealth is the real revolution. One wonders what Smith would have thought of modern finance, with its obsession with paper money and fancy instruments that are several levels of abstraction removed from real wealth. In this sense, Adam Smith is more of an Economics Theory Foundation figure, and not so much a piece to place on one side or the other of the ideological camp.Buchholz traces how economics develops from this early foundation, explaining Malthus, Ricardo, Alfred Marshal invention of the economic supply and demand curves, and then moving forward to modern economics from Keynes to Behaviorists. The book is very successful in presenting all these theories in a coherent framework and a small package.There are, however, two big problems with \\"New Ideas from Dead Economists\\". The first is how biography is misused. The book presents mainly ideas, and in most cases biography is used to move the prose forward. But when the author doesn't agree with a theory, he spends more time on the economists' flaws. Marx is portrayed as a drunken, money waster youth, negligent provider for his family. I don't see how this is relevant at all in understanding his theories--it is a fun story, but that's a different type of book. Buchholz critique of Marxism is tinted with this (irrelevant) biographical information. In my opinion, this is not a very honest way of debating economics.The other problem is his uses of examples. Marshall is praised with many illustrations that \\"prove\\" him right. Malthus, the opposite. With almost every economic theory on can find examples to prove or disprove it. So one wonders how these examples were chosen, and if this is just confirmation bias on the part of the author."},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"This is a very readable book for anyone interested in economics and domestic policy in the United States. I read it to prepare for my econ class in high school next year, and it will definitely give me a leg up on the economic way of thought. Make sure you get the most recent edition though!"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","review":"Luckily, economics got that \\"dismal science\\" label a long time ago, because this book is quite the opposite. Written in both lively style and learned content, the reader will want to go through each chapter wondering \\"who's next on the chopping block?\\" And who would have expected to find this gem in a normally dry-sounding field (economics), or a self-serving field (biography). Lest anyone be turned off by the relatively un-recent publication date (1989), the author has updates covering fairly recent events.This book adds a nice thought just by itself: humor and economists. Marx and laughter. Adam Smith and mirth, etcetera. The story covers the really big names in the field in chronological order, and you just know that each personality coming up will get the same fair treatment: a description of the old economists' philosophies and systems, the good parts, the bad parts, the dumb parts, and what they said about each other. At the end, just as we figure out what the author REALLY thinks is the best economic structure, we find the answer is more along the line, \\"it depends.\\" How can you not like a work like this!Dead economists. Some books are not that good, but have a great title (e.g., \\"Blink\\" or \\"Feel the Fear but Do It Anyway\\").

This is not to say that Dead Economists is a college text, though it could be. This is an educated reader's brief introduction to the history of modern economic thought. Buchholz brings to life old ideas, as advertised. Even though somewhat dated from the 1999 revision, it rings with currency. I most enjoyed the author's essay on John Stuart Mill.

In addition to be humorous and very informative, it is a great learning aid because the author writes in a way that makes it easy to remember the material.

This book takes ideas from dead economists (and some living ones, as the author himself states apologetically to them) and analyzes them now, in simple situations that will make the simpleton understand it.I hate reading didactic books.

Each of their wisest theories has a practical point or analogy today. This book seeks their wisdom by looking at mainstream economics and asking, Who first had these insights and built these durable models? We can learn from the masters.\\"Todd then embarks his readers on a journey through the contributions of the greatest economists of our time. Clearly explaining how they analysed the existing models and theories of their time, and their own contributions to advance the filed of economics. He does so, in a very simple style that is accessible to any audience regardless of their background in that field.What truly sets this book apart is the breadth of content, spanning a period of several centuries. Sufficient depth is included so that one gains an appreciation and broad understanding. The included references make it easy for one to dive deeper into more details. A must read for anyone seeking an introduction and/or a broad understanding of the field of economics!Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- \\"Russia's 1998 debacle teaches us that a market economy must rest on a dependable legal system. A free market does not mean utter chaos; it requires ground rules.\\"2- \\"Economics if the study of choice. It does not tell us what to choose. It only helps us understand the consequences of our choices.\\"3- \\"...as an economist isolates causes and estimates their influence, the degree of influence changes...Economics may not be a \\"hard\\" science. But that does not mean it is an easy science. Because it is so fluid, it is hard to hold in place and to study.\\"4- \\"Smith clearly defined the proper role for government: first, providing for national defense; second, administering justice through a court system; third, maintaining public institutions and resources such as roads, canals, bridges, educational systems, and the dignity of the sovereign.\\"5- \\"The point of Ricardo's analysis: free trade makes it possible for households to consume more goods regardless of whether trading partners are more or less economically advanced.\\"6- \\"By investing, the capitalist gives up the immediate gratification of buying goods. His return on investment pays him for waiting, for delaying his pleasure. If everyone consumes everything now, society will produce nothing new. Thus, profits play a crucial role.\\"7- \\"...four very important areas in which economists have dramatically transformed traditional legal analysis: negligence law; property law; criminal law; and corporate finance.\\"8- \\"There is clearly more to economics than prices, profits, rents, and costs. Laws, morals, fashions, and philosophies all contribute to an economy. They may support it, or they may tear it down.\\"9- \\"What does it mean to be Keynesian? Two basis propositions will suffice here: (1) the private economy may not reach full employment; (2) government spending can spur the economy into filling the gap.\\"10- \\"Keynes cleverly speculates that the way to make money in the stock market is not to be the best corporate analyst, but to be the best at guessing what others think is good.\\"11- \\"This movement, called monetarism, admits that the economy does have an accelerator and a brake, but insists that the accelerator should be marked \\"higher money supply\\" and the brake \\"lower money supply...the monetarists portray the Federal Reserve Board...as the driver.\\"12- \\"With perhaps uncustomary humility, Friedman claims that economists do not know enough about monetary policy to manipulate it wisely.\\"13- \\"We are all Keynesians now, thanks to Keynes.

Ultimately, the individual consumers are hurt badly as a national efficiency and income fall.\\"15- \\"Rational Expectations theory predicts that government stimulus does not spur the economy and that government contraction does not hurt...Why do most economists tend to agree with Rational Expectations theorists when they talk about the stock market, yet explode in disagreement when speaking of the macroeconomy? The fact is, the stock market is a more efficient...it is quite liquid...In contrast, real markets for goods and services show more complexity and rigidity.\\"16- \\"...each of the economists we have studied, despite their many differences, warned us that governments always face political pressures to take measures that can ruin good economies...Because even good economic policies often produce victims, economists have a very tough time persuading democratic governments to take good advice.

The chapters on Marx , Mill and Marshall were interesting and extremely well written while some of the other economists are given short shrift. This is probably a casualty of limiting yourself to just a 300 page book. But the value of the book is the accurate and balanced description of each economist's contribution to the field and development of economic thought since Adam Smith.

This book becomes tiresome, or at least off-topic, largely because there is a dearth of primary-source material on the computers of Star Trek, meaning that there is unfortunately little for the authors (who are computer scientists) to analyze scientifically. Specifically, the authors' primary sources consist of a scant smattering of material from the television shows and movies and the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation--Technical Manual.&quot; To quote the book, &quot;The technical manual devotes only five pages to the Enterprise computer. Based on its vague and sketchy description, we've inferred [a] general design.&quot; In other words, the book is based largely on assumptions and inferences, some of which are rather nonsensical. For example, in reference to the Star Trek memory storage unit known as a &quot;kiloquad,&quot; the book says, &quot;it's easy enough to deduce...that a kiloquad equals 1,000 quadrillion bytes.&quot; The only &quot;evidence&quot; given to support this conclusion is that &quot;kilo-&quot; means 1,000 and that &quot;Checking a dictionary reveals that the only numerical term involving quad is quadrillion.&quot; This kind of speculation would be mildly interesting if only a paragraph were devoted to it, but instead, the authors assume throughout the remainder of the book that this is the definition of a kiloquad, and analyze the plausibility of data storage space on this extremely tenuous basis. This is after quoting the following wise excerpt from the &quot;Star Trek Encyclopedia:&quot; &quot;The reason the term was invented was specifically to avoid describing the data capacity of Star Trek's computers in 20th century terms.&quot; This is one of countless examples. Much of the book seems to consist of the authors making unconvincing inferences, repeating themselves when they run out of source material, and making occasional (and unsuccessful) forays into philosophy and physics. The book is interesting when it makes a real point, but has too much filler material. There simply isn't enough source material for a 200-page book of this sort to be successful."},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"I picked up this book because I'm a computer major in college and have been a Star Trek fan for years. I wasn't disappointed as the authors have put together a very funny and very entertaining book about how computers are portrayed on all the different shows. They compare the computers on the different versions of the Enterprise (and Deep Space Nine and Voyager) to the computers we use today. They examine Data and the holodeck and the Borg also. Reading the book makes it clear that we are much further towards developing computers like those shown in Star Trek than anyone involved with the show could imagine. Computers they use three hundred years from now will be available in twenty-thirty years. The book is filled with interesting examples taken from the different shows and the authors know how to keep the reader entertained. I found this book not only fascinating but very funny as well.

Unfortunately, they erred on the side of too many overlong explanations of computer science, which the reader must wade through to get to those too-sparse nuggets of insight about Star Trek. For example, the Borg get only six pages, and the Holodeck gets eight pages (including several pages of programming code!).The writers are at their best when explaining how each Star Trek series is a commentary on the era in which it was written. For instance, there are several episodes where Kirk rants that computers can never replace people - a very 1960s sentiment - whereas in the more recent series, the Borg represent our fears that technology will lead to loss of individuality. More analysis along these lines would have improved the book, rather making it a primer on programming.Perhaps it's impossible to ever make sense of computers in Star Trek, since so much of it is technological nonsense (e.g., food replicators). Nevertheless, there was a missed opportunity here to speculate more deeply on the role of information technology in the world of Star Trek as compared to its role in current society."},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"If you know anything about computer engineering, kindling is a good use for this book. This book covers the possibilties of the uses for the computers, not the explanitions of how they work (get the TNG Technical Manual for that). The authors know a great amount about computer science, but each and every time they venture beyond this they look like idiots. They neglectcomputer engineering concerns of space, power, and other practical matters.They also neglect civil liberties issues. They suggest that putting chips in the heads of the crew would be a great way to communicate with the computer. Although this may be faster, it also allow the computer to track you.Their analysis of the Enterprise-D computer as a 1960's model mainframe is fairly correct, but they start to use this as a basic assumption in every analysis afterward even when it isn't warranted. They also neglect the possibly of a more complicated client-server archetecture. If you go to the holodeck, just because you can access your personal programs, doesn't meanthat they are stored on the main computer."},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"This is just another book wherein the author takes apart a science fiction proposition by analyzing the crap out of it and desiring very much to show their own superiority. I honestly had to stop reading it altogether because of this mindset of the authors.They could have worked at integrating the science fiction of Star Trek into what we already know about science. Instead there is nothing but criticism at every turn.It's a great book if you enjoy looking for that which is bad or even a little wrong in the Star Trek universe. I guess that some kind of weirdo enjoys that pursuit. However, as an intelligent report, it fails.I am so peeved at this book that I will send it for free, no charge, no shipping, no nothing to anyone that wants it. I would shred it but that would be wasteful; it's a great example of a bad example."},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"\\"The Computers of Star Trek\\" is an attempt at an analysis of \\"Star Trek\\" technology as opposed to what we'll *really* see in that day and age. Though at times interesting and accurate in many cases, this book's dry and and uninteresting style leaves the reader wanting. At times, it explains concepts that are likely to be over the average readers' head without much background info, and even supplies large blocks of complex computer code unlikely to be of interest to anyone except an advanced programmer.I had hoped for something a bit more analytical and thoughtful, but this book is largely pedantic and plodding. This book gives a large amount of coverage to Data, but largely nitpicks over his technical aspects, without really delving into the more complex aspects of his psyche. To further disappoint, this book was obviously written well into the run of \\"Star Trek: Voyager.\\" Yet almost no mention of him is made, except \\"the heuristic IF-THEN method of applying intelligence, very much like the Emergency Medical Holographic Doctor on Voyager.\\" This is ridiculous --- at the point this book was published, the Doctor already had his mobile emitter and had been on some pretty complex and character-building adventures. And *this* is the best they can say about him?The book goes on to mention the Borg, pointing out their motto \\"Resistance is futile.\\" It notes that there's \\"no compromise with the Borg.\\" Apparently, once again, they didn't watch \\"Voyager,\\" or even \\"Next Gen\\" too well. Compromise *is* possible with the Borg. Fans may not always like it, and it may not always make sense, but this book pretty much completely glosses over the development of the Borg. One thing I did agree with is the book's comments about the medical technology on \\"Star Trek.\\" Completely unreasonably --- not at all what you'd expect for that age.I wish I read a review of this myself before wasting my time with it. It wasn't a total washout, but it wasn't a great read either."},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"What one might call the field of 'Star Trek non-fiction' has boomed since the 1995 publication of Dr. Lawrence Krauss's &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot;. Now, we have books exploring many of the real-world issues presented in the Star Trek franchise, from issues of hard-science like biology, to social-science issues such as the depiction of race and gender.And then there is this book.Judging from the number of glowing reviews already present on Amazon, there are plenty of people who truly admired and appreciated this book. But if you come to this book after reading Dr. Krauss's two outstanding works, as I did, you may find yourself oddly disappointed.First off, the tone seems wrong. While &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Beyond Star Trek&quot; covered some pretty serious terrain in physics, Dr. Krauss's tone was one of an amiable expert communicating with an interested, non-technical audience. The tone presented by these authors occasionally borders on that of computer support people you talk to on the telephone--convinced that they already have the answers and that only your ignorance of the issues prevents you from agreeing with them (such as their frequent early repetition of their pet theory of 'body networks', where at some point in the future everyone will have nano-sized computers distrubuted throughout their bodies which will be able to communicate seamlessly with the computers contained in any other body). Most of the pictures in the book are simple structural diagrams unfamiliar to those who haven't studied computer science. There is even the equivalent of two published pages of VRML code in the chapter on the Holodeck (and if you don't know that VRML stands for Virtual Reality Markup Language, the code will mean nothing to you at all). Rather than a general-interest book, &quot;Computers of Star Trek&quot; seems like a book written by insiders for insiders, no hoi palloi invited.Also, while the authors are doubtless knowledgeable in their chosen fields, they (or their editors) occasionally show a surprising disdain for basic research. The Amazon review by ST:Voyager's own Rick Sternbach shows one such instance. Another comes from the above-mentioned 'body network' idea--unless the authors intend for us to be continually plugged in to a network jack, the computers of our 'body network' will have to emit electromagnetic radiation to communicate with one another; radiation that would kill us, either quickly (by killing our cells directly) or slowly (by mutating our cells into cancerous melanoma). This book would have been significantly improved had the authors read other &quot;__ of Star Trek&quot; books in advance.The authors do have some interesting things to say, and if you're the sort who's going to buy all of these 'ST non-fiction' books anyway, then this review shouldn't deter you. But if you're new to the genre and looking for someplace to start, this would not be the book I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"This is a nice overview of computing technology, where we began, where we are now, and where we may be down the road. The comparisons to Star Trek technology was interesting to me as an old Star Trek fan. The authors point out very clearly that the computers of Star Trek have evolved through the decades, and various series, as our knowledge and capabilities in the real world have grown over the years, and we are about to catch up to the talking and reasoning computers portrayed in the original series, perhaps in a handful more years. Later Star Trek series used more advanced computers, even holodecks, these systems will take longer to realize in the real world (physical laws allowing), however, as Gresh and Weinberg explain, most of it won't take until the 24th century to take place. In this book you can learn a lot about computers and computing without becoming bored, and no, you will not be an expert in the field or anything like that, but you will find out that things are advancing rapidly right now. Some of the computer technology shown in the four Star Trek series is already out of date, especially in the original series where those computers resemble large mainframe 1st or second generation computers using vacuum tubes or discrete transistors, and this is a reflection of when the various series were made, from the 1960's to the present. The authors also note that Star Trek is poor at using nanotechnology in the episodes, and how, Gresh and Weinberg explain, microscopic helpers will actually pervade our bodies and keep us healthy and heal wounds and allow us to communicate with others much faster. I did find the chapter on the android Data interesting, the authors believe that something like Data should be possible in the distant future, but the authors explain that much of the computing technology of Star Trek simply won't happen as envisioned in the various series, and that Star Trek is mostly about a projection of our culture three hundred years into the future. But as Spock might say, &quot;fascinating reading&quot;. Indeed!"},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"The Bermuda Family of Arizona: ======================== The Computers of Star Trek is an awesome book.

I was looking forward to a book discussing some of the wonderfully curious and fantastic concepts and ideas offered by Star Trek's computer and computing systems (and how sentient entities interact with them).It's clear both authors enjoy Star Trek as television. They seem fairly familiar with The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager (Enterprise is not covered in this book, it was aired after this book was written). The authors seem to appreciate they are discussing the prognostications of technologies and sciences that don't currently exist (the Trek multiverse is \\"fiction/fantasy\\"), and Star Trek is fundamentally a television show designed to entertain and amuse (and possibly provoke thought).I found the book marred by an over-arching critical tone of how the computers and computing devices presented in various incarnations of \\"Trek\\" fall short of the author's expectations. The authors think computer science and artificial intelligence will be far advanced of what's presented by Trek in the 23rd-24th centuries--and they never let you forget it.Purists will find plenty to complain about (for example, the \\"Gorm\\" are mentioned several times, and even have an index entry ... but the authors are discussing the \\"Gorn\\").Folks expecting what I was (a book discussing in detail how Trek's computers \\"worked\\" or concepts and ideas associated with Trek's computers in the larger sense of modern computing environments) will be displeased as well.This book tended to aggravate me rather than provide an enjoyable read or enhance my understand of Trek's computers. I found the book more a series of overly-broad discussion about computing or computing systems, followed by detailed complaints about how Trek \\"doesn't get it right\\" ... versus an analysis or discussion of what Trek presented in terms of computing, or how those computers might actually function.If you are a neophyte to computing / computer science and/or artificial / mechanical intelligence, this book might be a good introduction to those areas. If you are a trekkie / trekker and have to have every book ever published with \\"Star Trek\\" in the title, here one is.Otherwise, there are much better books available on both Trek and computing available here on amazon."},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","review":"I found this book fascinating - I am a big star trek fan, and this book finally addressed some of my unanswered questions - not addressed by any other star trek books.

And sorry, it's not about being nitpicky - I wholeheartedly join the editorial criticism of another poster - painful misspellings abound (&quot;Shelly&quot; wrote Frankenstein? The &quot;Gorm&quot; attacked Cestus III? Come on!), no bibliography exists, and no cohesion holds the work together. Don't get me wrong, this subject matter deserves to be seriously addressed, and it's a shame the authors squandered their enviable chance with such a sloppy, half-baked effort.

Though his place in the twentieth-century canon of literature now seems secure, it is still often pointed out that thanks to the Holocaust, Singer's fame was granted to him at the cost of obscurity for other Yiddish writers. His personality also was known to be difficult. There are many who will tell you that Singer was a bastard, including Elie Wiesel (not normally a gossip) in &quot;All Rivers Run to the Sea.&quot; Singer probably was one at least fifty percent of the time. Too many stories of his caprice, vanity, and greed for sex and money have been told to be discounted. As to the nature behind both the faults and the gifts, what one saw of it depended on who one was; any competitors for the limelight, real or imagined, got the worst of it. Women got both the best and the worst of Singer, the charm and naivete combined with the mistrust and the manipulation. It is thus fitting that a possibly definitive memoir of Singer should have been written by a woman. Dvorah Telushkin was the writer's secretary and occasional translator. She comes across as a most lovable person, without any of Singer's guile. But they still had a lot in common: they were both fearful and susceptible to flattery. Ms. Telushkin was estranged from her father, Singer from his only child. Dvorah's innocence fit Singer's feminine ideal, exemplified by the child-woman in &quot;Shosha.&quot; For years, theirs was a relationship in perfect order. But after winning the Nobel Prize, Singer's ego ran away with him while his health deteriorated rapidly. He became more and more paranoid, finally rejecting Dvorah as he had rejected most others. Ms. Telushkin manages the difficult feat of recording Singer's decline honestly and without sentimentality, while leaving us in no doubt as to her lasting love for him and little as to its essential justice. It is to be hoped that she continues as a writer, one with large ambitions. She has been influenced by Singer; her achievement is to make his eerie tone blend so well with her sense of her own life as a bad dream that the influence comes to seem more like an inheritance. She rescues Singer from the context of Yiddish nostalgia and places him within his own heritage of Jewish fear, uncertainty, and faith, as little G-rated as Celine. This is a deeply touching, near-perfect book. It is required reading for Singer fans, but it is also recommended to anyone struggling to understand a difficult and much-loved parent."},{"Title":"Master of Dreams : A Memoir of Isaac Bashevis Singer","review":"Here Dvorah Telushkin provides a complex and layered portrait of Isaac Singer and her interactions with him. There is the added attraction that Telushkin has a well crafted writing style, elevated while smooth, homey while erudite. To its credit, this memoir is not crafted in any chronological fashion. Each chapter is a slice of her life with Singer, their work together and conversations. She weaves us in and out of Singer and his world, leisurely but with a purpose, even reproducing, to great effect, the Yiddish cadences and accent of his spoken English. Possibly the strongest element in this memoir is Telushkin's fierce honesty with her own complex set of emotions about Singer. Here is a man who she is fashioning as a father figure, and (as a notorious Don Juan and egocentric) he is a poor pick. Telushkin shows the darker side of Singer's personality, and her own odd attraction to it; so in the end, this book is more about Teluskhin's journey of self-discovery and maturity than it is about Isaac Singer. But this does not detract from the quality of this work: driven, honest and beautiful, it is a haunting book of genuine emotional integrity."},{"Title":"Master of Dreams : A Memoir of Isaac Bashevis Singer","review":"This work gives an inside view of the daily life and work habits of one of the greatest masters of the short story the world has known.

The German Army was built for mass and a force that was never more than 20% motorized could ill afford the luxury of expensive special units. Only a few units were undeniably elite - Grossdeutschland, the Brandenbergers, and Panzer Lehr. Gordon Williamson's latest Men-at-Arms volume, German Army Elite Units 1939-1945, seems to stretch the definition of \\"elite\\" to extreme proportions in order to justify covering a variety of units. Overall, this volume seems to be more of an introduction to units with fancy or unique sleeve and collar patches, rather than a real survey of elite units.Williamson begins with the Grossdeutschland unit, which grew from regiment to division in the first years of the war. The author spends about four pages detailing the history and organization of Grossdeutschland, and three pages on uniform items like cuff bands and shoulder straps. The two interesting satellite units, the FG and FB brigades, are barely mentioned. Two pages are spent on the Brandenbergers, who grew from small commando units to division size by 1944. Panzer Lehr, formed from high-quality training cadres, also receives two pages of coverage. Thus, the author provides only 11 pages out of 42 for the truly elite units, and uses the bulk of the volume on a heterogeneous collection of other units.The inclusion of the Feldherrnhalle Division is justified by its links to the SA, but there was nothing in actual battlefield performance that distinguished it from other divisions. Some readers might be tempted to equate Feldherrnhalle with a Waffen SS-type unit, but this was not the case. The justification for elite status becomes even murkier when the author moves on to the 44th \\"Hoch und Deutschmeister\\" Infantry Division. Aside from the fact that this unit was organized, trained and equipped as an ordinary German infantry division, the only distinguishing characteristic was a cuff band that was authorized two months before the end of the war but never issued. So a cuff band that was never issued makes a unit elite? Even more unremarkable are the 5th Cavalry Regiment \\"von Mackensen\\" and the 9th and 119th Infantry Regiments which shared the honorific title \\"List.\\" The inclusion of these units with fancy names and insignia but no elite characteristics is a serious distraction from the real elite units.The other oddity about this volume is the inclusion of several panzer and mountain units; the author includes the 21st, 24th and 116th Panzer Divisions and the 3rd and 5th Mountain Divisions. Other than participation in some sideshow campaigns like Narvik, Crete and North Africa which allowed some veterans to wear rare service badges, these units were really no different than many other similar divisions. Why include the 3rd Mountain as elite, but exclude the 1st or 2nd Divisions? There is no dispute that all these divisions were effective combat formations but the author makes no case to distinguish them as elite from other similar units in the German Army. The author concludes this volume with a brief survey of the ten non-divisional \\"Tiger\\" tank battalions. Again, these units were certainly formidable but were they truly elite? Some battalions, like the 510th, were organized late in the war and quickly swamped by the advancing Red Army. Apparently, the author feels that the \\"legendary\\" reputation of the Tiger tank renders all units equipped with it elite. Yet if lethal reputation is the prerequisite for elite status, why not include some of the longer-serving assault gun battalions that destroyed far more Soviet tanks than some of the later Tiger units?Ultimately, the whole issue of elite units is obscured by this study's arbitrary inclusion of units without applying any objective criterion for admission. Apparently, in this author's mind, elite status can derive from the adoption of fancy uniform accessories and honorific titles just as much as special training or recruiting. Indeed, the issues of recruiting, selection and training are noticeably absent in this volume. This is a bungled attempt at a survey of elite German Army units that founders due to lack of an objective methodology. Instead of using the limited space in an Osprey Men-at-Arms title to focus on the genuine elite units, space is gratuitously wasted on \\"eye-wash\\" and celebrity units in order to bolster the market appeal of this volume. Other elite or specialist units, such as the German long-range reconnaissance units in North Africa or assault pioneer units in Russia, would have been better candidates for inclusion in this volume than units like the \\"List\\" Regiment."},{"Title":"German Army Elite Units 1939-45 (Men-at-Arms)","review":"The lengthy review below sums up best the selection criterion for inclusion in this book and I will not belabour that point.I do want to point out the very excellent artwork by Bujeiro - there seems to be a resurgent interest in Spain in the Third Reich, extending to re-enacting. One of the premier artists for Battlefront games is a Spanish gentleman who does photo realistic artwork for the Combat Mission games.Bejeiro has done excellent work; colours seem a bit off but that may be a post-production process that makes the field grey shades a bit too blue.Text is good; as noted in another review, subject matter is a bit scattered. Another review also states there are better GD sources. There are; the colour plate of the GD policeman shows the use of the Polizei helmet decal, which seems to be unsupported in other sources though I may be wrong.Another interesting error is the deletion of Panzergrenadier Lehr Regiment 902 - a bit of a shock as I personally interviewed a member of that regiment, and it is certainly on the order of battle in other sources! Probably a minor editing error.Overall, the plates are great and some good photos of rare insignia.

And though I had never heard of Fifty Years on the Old Frontier or its author until a recent visit to the Nebraska State Park which occupies the site of James Cook's old Agate Springs Ranch, after reading I came to the conclusion that Cook's book is one of those that are essential reading for anyone who wants a fairly unbiased close-up view of frontier life.Though Cook came to the Plains and to the West as a relatively uneducated greenhorn, by the end of his life he had developed into a man of much empirical knowledge and understanding. His writing style is not at all dry and the reader will find Cook to be a very engaging writer whose observations are leavened with a wry humor that makes him want to finish the book in one sitting.Maybe I like it so much because I've been to all the places of which he writes and I can visualize the countryside as I read along. Cook was a real polymath as far as practical living went, and his abilities served him well in an environment which demanded so much of every person. I enjoy most his stories of the cattle drives as he learned the hard way how to be a cowboy, and those of his time as a ranch manager in Southwestern New Mexico, a country I know well. But I also enjoy reading of his interactions with the leaders of the Plains Indians, many of whom saw in Cook a kindred spirit.Cook's life in the west spanned the period from when the Central Plains and the Southwest were first being settled and everything was wide open, to the time where everything was settled, fenced-in, and criscrossed with railways and highways. He saw the buffalo, the antelope, and the grizzly nearly eliminated and he saw the Indians go from being masters of the Plains to being reduced to living on puny reservations and reliant on the whim of the white man for basic necessities. He writes of this with wisdom gained through hard experience, balance, and a tinge of sadness for the passing of the old days and the old ways.If you love the West and would like an authentic, unvarnished look at the way it once was, then this book is for you. Judging by the sales ranking on amazon, it appears to have been almost forgotten. Many thanks to the University of Oklahoma Press for keeping it alive."},{"Title":"Fifty years on the old frontier,: As cowboy, hunter, guide, scout, and ranchman,","review":"James Cook's \\"Fifty Years on the Old Frontier\\" is an autobiographical narrative of his life experiences in the American West. Cook's endeavors during the latter part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century encompassed a whole host of occupations: cattle drover, tour guide, hunter, rancher, and military scout. Cook eventually married into money and retired to a ranch near Agate, Nebraska where he consorted with Red Cloud and other old Sioux warriors. He also collaborated with several university professors on fossil digs located around his ranch, eventually becoming an amateur scientist in his own right. Cook's accounts of his adventures in the Old West provide a compelling insight about the realities and myths of America's movement across the North American continent. James Cook died in 1942.The beginning chapters of the book outline the author's work as a cattle popper and drover along the old cattle trails through Texas and Kansas. The dangers that threatened the well being of these tough as nails trail hands constitutes the bulk of Cook's narrative. What quickly becomes apparent is that these guys were not the dapper dandies we see in films and fiction; they worked hard everyday to get those longhorns up to Kansas and to the railroad. Cook recounts the disagreements amongst drovers, an experience with hail and a tornado, stampedes, the threat of wild animals, and the dangers posed by Indians. A separate chapter discusses the fate of the wild mustangs, yet another sad chapter in the annals of the conquest of the West. Once the businessmen moved in and discovered a market for horses, they rounded up the mustangs by the thousands through crude trapping techniques and by depriving Indians of their stocks. Horses injured in the process were ruthlessly shot by the trappers. The picture that emerges from the author's narrative about trail life is one of greedy exploitation leading to environmental damage.Relations with Indians are a central theme of the book. The movie image of tremendous battles between natives and American military forces does not find expression in this story. Instead, Cook portrays Indians as just another obstacle to the settlement of the West. Cattle drivers had to pay attention to Indian raiders who sought to steal horses and cattle, but it was more important to worry about weather and stampedes. In the last section of the book, Indians play a bigger role in the story. The author outlines in detail his relationship with the Sioux after they had been confined to the reservation. Another chapter deals with the Geronimo uprising in New Mexico, an incident Cook experienced first hand during his tenure as a ranch manager in the area. He takes the opportunity of the uprising to tell the truth about the Indians and the military forces during the campaign. According to the author, Geronimo and his Apache warriors did not fight the military head on, but relied on hit and run tactics with strategic retreats to Mexico to stay one step ahead of the law. The military relied heavily on scouts, often mixed blood Indians, in order to track down the rogue Indians. Geronimo eventually surrendered when an army officer talked him into giving himself up.Cook's interest in the West is not a broad picture of western history, but rather groupings of anecdotes about his individual experiences in the area. The reader often has to read between the lines of these engaging stories in order to ascertain the reality of the situation on the frontier. For example, Cook discusses in depth the time the Sioux on the reservation asked him to be their government appointed agent. The author provides several letters of endorsement written on his behalf by politicians and bankers in Nebraska and Wyoming. The letters praise Cook as a man of the West on excellent terms with the local Indian population. A cynic can see the larger dynamic tensions between East and West in these letters. The locals want one of their own in the job because up to this point the position was always held by someone from back east. Moreover, a western agent could deliver lucrative supply contracts to western businesses and perform favors for western politicians. Why else would bankers take the time to write a recommendation letter to the government? It certainly had little to do with goodwill towards the Sioux Indians, especially since this wheedling went on at roughly the same time as the Ghost Dance fiasco.I am astonished that no one else has reviewed this book. This is a great text for the Old West history buff or those interested in Indian/White relations during the late 19th century. James Cook's \\"Fifty Years on the Old Frontier\\" is an entertaining, yet at some times sad, account of the realities of our frontier days."},{"Title":"Fifty years on the old frontier,: As cowboy, hunter, guide, scout, and ranchman,","review":"This is a very great book. I am actually reading it again; it's that good. I wish that James H Cook and his son Harold were still alive to meet. If only there were more books this good. James Cook's second book Longhorn Cowboy goes into even greater detail about his experiences with the cattle. His son Harold's book Tales Of The 04 Ranch makes another suppliment to go past this one. This family had an amazing life. There is another supplimental book called Bones Of Agate by Ron Cockrell which can be read on line. I have not been able to find the actual book. If you like this book you will also like Trails Of Yesterday by John Bratt."},{"Title":"Fifty years on the old frontier,: As cowboy, hunter, guide, scout, and ranchman,","review":"Two months ago I visited the Agate Fossil Beds National Monument in western Nebraska. (It's a long way from almost anywhere, but it is well worth a visit if you find yourself within 150 miles or so.) Besides the fossil beds, another attraction is the Cook Collection of Indian Artifacts. It is named after James H. Cook, who owned the Agate Springs Ranch for over fifty years. It was Cook who first invited scientists from the East (such as O. A. Peterson of the Carnegie Museum and O. C. March of Yale) to explore and excavate the spectacular fossil quarries on the ranch. While at the Visitor Center, I learned that for decades Cook maintained a close relationship with many Sioux Indians from the Pine Ridge Agency (later Reservation), many of whom traveled the 350 mile round-trip distance to visit him and the Agate Springs Ranch annually. It was this close friendship with the Sioux that was the source for many of the exceptional artifacts that were on display in the Cook Collection. It seemed to me that Cook was an interesting enough fellow for me to purchase his book, FIFTY YEARS ON THE OLD FRONTIER, originally published in 1923.James H. Cook turns out to have had a very full life, with a wealth of Wild West experiences, before he ever arrived at Agate Springs Ranch. He was born in 1857 in southern Michigan, but, having been orphaned young, at age sixteen he headed west. He worked as a cowboy in Texas, chasing and herding wild cattle. He participated in cattle drives to Kansas along the Chisholm Trail, enduring multiple stampedes and Comanche attacks. For a brief period of time, he worked as a brakeman and fireman on the MK&T; Railroad. He spent several years as a hunter and then a guide in the mountains of Wyoming and Colorado. During that time, he met and became friendly with the famous Sioux chief Red Cloud. From 1882 to 1887, he was the general manager of a ranch north of Silver City, New Mexico, which placed him squarely in the middle of fighting between settlers and Geronimo and his Apache band. In 1886 he was married and the next year he \\"settled down\\" to running the Agate Springs Ranch. His Sioux friends, including Red Cloud, soon were appealing to him to intervene on their behalf with the Office of Indian Affairs, and in the wake of the fiasco (or massacre) at Wounded Knee in December 1890, Red Cloud and other Indians as well as Nebraska political leaders lobbied the Department of the Interior that Cook be appointed Indian Agent at the Pine Ridge agency. He probably would have been a much better Agent than whoever was actually appointed.Cook tells about all this in FIFTY YEARS ON THE OLD FRONTIER. It was an extraordinary life and it makes for an extraordinary story. To top things off, it is well told - much better than the usual memoirs of a frontiersman. Cook occasionally lapses into clich&eacute; or the rather florid, verbose style that too often marked American writing of the period, but not so frequently nor so egregiously to turn me off. Best of all, his account rings with authenticity.It is interesting to see Cook's mindset concerning the slaughter of the buffalo and other wild game and as regards the \\"taming\\" of the Indians. He sympathized with the Indians, especially the Sioux, and at one point he remarked that \\"had I been born an Indian, I might have made a bad one--from the white man's point of view.\\" But the only course was for the Indians to adjust to, and adopt, white ways. While he admitted that the Indians had been mistreated many times in many ways, he harbored a curious optimism that that was all in the past. \\"I feel sure that from this time on all our dealings with the people whom we at first forced, and are now leading, into our place of life will be just and honorable * * *.\\"Incidentally, for those interested in the history of Ghost Dancing and of Wounded Knee, FIFTY YEARS ON THE OLD FRONTIER contains about thirty pages of valuable and insightful material. The book also contains several dozen photographs."},{"Title":"Fifty years on the old frontier,: As cowboy, hunter, guide, scout, and ranchman,","review":"This book by Jim Cook told his entire life story from when he left home at age 16 to make his way to Texas to become a cowboy in 1873. While still a young man he became a hide hunter and then a hunting guide in Wyoming and Montana. His wealthy hunting clients became the key to his later success as a ranch manager and rancher.

These products come in such a bewildering variety of grades and sizes that the do-it-yourselfer is often stumped when shopping - especially in today's selfservice lumberyards.Beginning with a brief history of lumbering and milling, the author then traces the evolution of veneered and composition boards. He examines the various types of lumber and explains how to select the best grade for your needs, how to calculate quantites and prices for any job, how to work with finish lumber. This format is followed in covering all the other materials. The result is a comprehensive, detailed study of our basic wood products that unscrambles the terminology, simplifies the date, and provides a convenient reference for purchasing and working the materials. Armed with this information, anyone can enter a lumberyard and be sure of getting his money's worth."},{"Title":"The Opera According to Bartalini: A Book of Doggerel Libretti and Comic Illustrati","review":"For any opera fan this book is full of laughs. The clever doggerel is very imaginative and the summaries follow the stories of the operas quite well. It could be used to refresh an opera in your mind and get a lot of laughs at the same time.

Having recently been diagnosed with Graves' disease I found the book very informative and helpful. Giving a list of the symptoms as well as the different types of treatment for Graves' and actual stories of those with the disease. Specifically, the author. Especially since my doctor didn't provide me with any information. It explained muscle weakness as well as other symptoms/side effects of Graves' disease."},{"Title":"Healing Options: A Report on Graves' Disease Treatments","review":"I am pleased to have this opportunity to dialogue about my book and respond to reader comments. Specifically, I would like to address the misconception that my book offers a &quot;cure&quot; for Graves' disease. I am a 50 year-old woman who after years of misdiagnosis was finally diagnosed in 1991 with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's (chronic hypothyroidism and an autoimmune disease). I received standard U.S. treatment, radioactive iodine. To my dismay, this did not make me &quot;better&quot;. I grew to understand that healing takes time and calls for a look at causes and not just the alleviation of symptoms. I stopped looking for a quick fix-there is no quick fix for chronic illness. Dr. Christiane Northrup says, &quot;There is a difference between healing and curing. Healing is a natural process and is within the power of everyone. Curing, which is what doctors are called upon to do, usually consists of an external treatment and medication or surgery is used to mask or eliminate symptoms. This external treatment doesn't necessarily address the factors that contribute to the symptoms in the first place. Healing goes deeper than curing and must always come from within.&quot; I wrote this book as a part of my healing journey. It is a book I wish had existed when I was first diagnosed, feeling so vulnerable, overwhelmed, confused and alone. In my book, I explain Graves', offer practical tips on locating physicians and managing one's health care as well as address the many complementary therapies and offer help in finding practitioners. My hope is that my book will help others in their quest for wellness, their healing journey."},{"Title":"Healing Options: A Report on Graves' Disease Treatments","review":"Kate Flax's informative book covers all aspects of Graves' Disease,from its onset, through treatment choices, to living the rest of your life as fully as possible. The main thrust of the book, for me, was that the responsibility for successful healing lies mainly in the control of the patient. It is up to the patient to find out about all the possibilites for healing and to then make as informed a choice as possible. This book not only helps sort out all of the medical mumbo jumbo, but it also is extremely helpful in dealing with the emotional ramifications of this diagnosis. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Healing Options: A Report on Graves' Disease Treatments","review":"I bought this book in an attempt to learn more about new options in Grave's treatments. I assumed by the title of the book, that Ms. Flax found a way of conquering Graves. Unfortunately &quot;Healing Options&quot; tells the story of her continual struggle with Graves. While it is a true representation of a chronic illness, it is neither an uplifting or comforting story. Ms. Flax covers the current Western methods of treatment. She does this by offering examples that illustrate the downside of each treatment. It is difficult to accept the alternative treatment methods she promotes (i.e.: massage, herbs, meditation). She was not originally treated with any of these methods and it is uncertain whether her outcome would have been better or worse. For me, the valuable information Ms. Flax provides is over-shadowed by her depressing and sad biographical narrative."},{"Title":"Healing Options: A Report on Graves' Disease Treatments","review":"Kate Flax has pushed the edges of Graves disease, knowing that the healing is a whole-person effort. Her maturity, compassion, and clear writing brings hope for all those who have been struggling with Graves Disease.

She finally got help, and her life took on meaning again.I wish this book had existed for my cousin. It would have saved her years of grief and confusion.

BUT the reader must understand Graves is DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE and this book doesn't mean that alternative is the way to go or not to go... it's just a perspective in Graves Treatment from a patient's point of view. It does provide info based on experience and for many Graves patients it provides relief from the \\"I AM THE ONLY ONE\\" syndrome.

It is a personal favorite among a shelf-full of folklore volumes. I no longer remember whether it was an impulse purchase, or I needed it for one or another undergraduate or graduate class, and if so whether it was in Scandinavian Literature, or Germanic Mythology, or Folklore Studies.And that should give you a clue that Amazon has used guesswork in rating it as suitable for 4 to 8 year olds. (Yes, I've reported / complained about it; maybe, against precedent, this will change soon.)Not that there aren't stories in here quite suitable for reading to young children; there are some. But the book is heavily weighted with historical and theoretical introductions, and elaborate notes to the stories, many of which are either aimed at adults, or chosen to illustrate traditional beliefs as much as to entertain. The volume was an early entry in the University of Chicago Press \\"Folktales of the World\\" series, well-produced volumes which featured forewords by the distinguished American folklorist Richard Dorson, and were generally edited by specialists from the nations covered. (It was officially number 5; but number 1, Kurt Ranke's \\"Folktales of Germany,\\" did not actually appear until 1966!) Unfortunately, most other volumes in the series seem to be out of print; \\"Folktales of Ireland\\" (Sean O'Sullivan) may be the only other exception.The editor of this volume, Reidar Christiansen, an important Norwegian folklorist, drew on both earlier published collections and archival sources to illustrate a wide variety of genres of oral narrative in Norwegian tradition. He includes: Historical Legends (#1-#11, with sub-divisions); Legends About Magic and Witchcraft (#12-#20); Legends About Ghosts, the Human Soul, and Shapeshifting (#21-#23, again with sub-divisions); Legends About Spirits of the Sea, Lakes, and Rivers (#24-#30); Legends About Sprits of the Air (#31-#32); Legends About Spirits of Forest and Mountain (#33-#60); Legends About Household Spirits (#61-#66); and, finally, Fictional Folktales (#67-#82). The translation, by Pat Shaw Iversen, is, with some minor exceptions, extremely readable.Some pieces are anecdotes about supernatural beings, illuminating, but uninspiring if read in bulk for amusement. Some of the legends are extremely well told, and nicely localized in terms of Norwegian landscapes. The concluding portion is made up of first-rate wonder tales, mainly Norwegian variants of international fairy tales, told with unusual complexity and skill, which are closest to what the Amazon age rating would suggest.It is a rewarding book for adults, and probably for teenagers, and perhaps late pre-teens; anyone buying it for small children will not be so happy with it, with the exception of those comfortable with retelling the tales, or with drawing inspiration from them for your own. (Which is great, if you happen to be a small-scale Tolkien...!)Some Norwegian folktales, although rarely identified as such, are surprisingly well known. According to my own completely unscientific survey, those which are remembered and recognized by their origin tend to be a couple of anecdotes about Trolls, bridges, and Billy-Goats, which is a shame, given the actual variety and sophistication of the tradition. (Of course, some of the best may tend to be lumped in with their fairly close counterparts elsewhere.) Those who enjoy the present work may wish to turn elsewhere for more stories; the seriously curious will look for more examples of beliefs and legends.Unhappily, what one will generally find are either retellings or shorter selections, more or less obviously chosen for children, and often directly or indirectly based on existing translations; I will mention one partial exception below. The most nearly comparable collection with which I am familiar is an old George W. Dasent translation, drawn directly from a great nineteenth-century collection by P.C. Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe, \\"Norske Folke Eventyr.\\" (First edition 1843-44, expanded edition 1852; also given as *Folke-eventyr* and *Folkeeventyr.* My apologies for anglicizing the spelling of Norwegian names at this point, and most other places; I'm not going to trust that everyone else will read this in Unicode!)The Norwegian original is a long-established classic in its native country. Dasent's translation (1858; expanded 1859; third edition 1888) was known to, and cited by, Tolkien, under its original title of \\"Popular Tales from the Norse.\\" It was available for decades in an illustrated version from Dover Publications, under the title \\"East o' the Sun & West o' the Moon: Fifty-nine Norwegian Folk Tales from the Collection of Peter Christen Asbjrnsen and Jrgen Moe, With 77 illustrations by Erik Werenskiold, Theodor Kittelsen and Others\\" (1970). The illustrations in the Dover edition -- taken from a 1936 three-volume edition of \\"Samlede Eventyr\\" [Collected Fairy Tales] -- varied from almost ethnographic (compare photographs in Janice S. Stewart's \\"The Folk Arts of Norway\\" [1953, 1972; third edition, 1999]), to whimsical, to weird, many displaying some combination of these traits.The strengths and weaknesses, and distinct character, of the Christiansen/Iversen volume can be illustrated by a brief comparison.The Victorian translation, stripped by Dover of some of its original (racist, and otherwise quite obsolete) introductory material, has many pieces not found in \\"Folktales of Norway,\\" but there is overlap -- over a dozen instances. In some particulars, Dasent's translation is better than Iversen's renderings of the same passages. For example, in one story (#53a), Iversen has a white animal referred to in the title and in a critical moment as a \\"tabby,\\" which, of course, implies a patterned coat, and in context makes no sense. In this case, Dasent had a more general colloquial term in the text, and a properly incorrect word in his story title. (Sorry to be opaque, but why spoil the tale -- which includes a species identification error beyond even Pepe LePew! -- for those who haven't read it?)Some differences may be in part due to variations in the underlying Norwegian texts (subjected to varying treatment since they were taken down in regional dialects), others to Iversen's attempts to provide completely new renderings. On the whole, Iversen's judgment seems sound. \\"The Red Knight\\" is much more intelligible a designation than Dasent's \\"Ritter Red,\\" which, by incorporating an un-translated title (that looks like a loan-word from German), makes it sound like a personal name.The nineteenth-century collection is obviously weighted very heavily toward the (Norwegian) title category of \\"eventyr\\" -- essentially the familiar \\"fairy tales\\" of princesses and unlikely heroes, talking animals and magical helpers, known throughout the Old World. They are rendered in a style closer to Icelandic sagas than, say, to Perrault, or even the Grimms, and, although not treated in a strictly \\"scientific\\" manner by their collectors/editors, are utterly distinct from Hans Christian Andersen's contemporary inventions.Some of the stories translated by Dasent incidentally include distinctly Norwegian material, but this is comparatively scarce -- ironic, given Dasent's interest in England's supposed shared Nordic heritage and the genius of the \\"Germanic race.\\" The contents are mainly variants of widely distributed tale-types. It is in part for the localized legends and specifically Norwegian versions of the supernatural (which Asbjornsen, among others, had published separately) that \\"\\"Folktales of Norway\\" is so valuable.Iversen's more modern English *might* make stories in the final section easier for some readers. On the whole, Dasent's translation, although a bit old-fashioned, does lend itself to reading to children -- if the adult is familiar with the story first, and exercises a little judgment. (Dasent warned against some items, especially two he moved to the end when re-ordering the collection; he also seems to have omitted at least one tale. My list of possible problems would be completely different.) More advanced young readers, with appetites sharpened by, for example, Tolkien, Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, or Rowling, might want to tackle it for themselves -- which I would consider less likely, although hardly impossible, with \\"Folktales of Norway.\\"Unhappily, the 400-plus page Dover edition, with its wonderful Norwegian illustrations, has been supplanted by a less expensive, but much less satisfactory, short selection (\\"Thrift Edition\\"), under the same main title, in the Dover catalogue. The full version can still be found on Amazon, at this writing, with a little searching; it is, and should continue to be, available used. But the hardcover edition to which Amazon currently has it linked is one of the more dramatically abridged modern editions (a new illustrated version of what looks like one story!). If it were not for the possibility of confusion among these different books, I might have urged ordering both Dasent and Christiansen -- but then, I'm used to thinking of the 1970s prices of the copies in front of me! -- or suggesting them both to your local library.As it is, the next best alternative to the Dasent translation currently (and unambiguously) in print is the much shorter (192 pages) \\"Norwegian Folktales\\" in The Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library (1982), thirty-five tales selected from the work of Asbjornsen and Moe, edited by Iversen (again) and Carl Norman. This also includes illustrations by Werenskiold and Kittelsen: the introduction is on \\"The Norwegian Folk Tales and Their Illustrators.\\" As previously suggested, it is at least packaged as suitable for children; for what it is worth, Amazon rates it for ages 9-12. I am perhaps too severe a judge of its merits; my choice of stories for re-translation would have been rather different, and I have sometimes wondered if some tales were selected over others because of more attractive illustrations available for them.(Speaking of illustrations again, I have long tried to ignore the pseudo-Viking stereotypes on the cover of \\"Folktales of Norway\\" -- accepting the art was an unusually bad decision by the University of Chicago Press.)Those with an informed interest in traditional oral literatures will certainly want to know \\"Folktales of Norway,\\" and at least for now it seems to be quite readily available."},{"Title":"Folktales of Norway","review":"Seems like the definitive readily available book for serious treatment of Norway's folktales. None of the dumb-it-down treacle that is so often pitched at kids, even includes notes re where the tale was collected, how common such tales are, etc. Not necessarily tales that will amuse your 4-year old, but an interesting window into what interested folk in earlier times. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Folktales of Norway","review":"Skip Ibsen. The high point of Norwegian litterature is Asbjrnsen and Moe's folk tales. Just like American litterature started with Mark Twant, truly Norwegian litterature started with Asbjrnsen and Moe, and it is thanks to them we have what other peoples lack, a popular manner of speech that does not lack dignity.

You follow Drysdale's career from a boy to becoming one of the most successful and aggressive pitchers of all time.The 1960 era Dodgers were a very special team. They won by every player giving over 100 percent. Drysdale was no exception, throwing hard and doing everything to win. The Koufax / Drysdale pitching combo was death to batting averages.Drysdale shares many of his experiences with Dodger management and players. I often found myself laughing as he related humorous events. It was a grand time in baseball. It was a time when players roomed together and socialized together. They lived baseball in way that is foreign to the players of today. It was also nice to find out the inside on many events that I had been curious about.I with a book like this you hope to read about many of the Dodger players. However, Drysdale's stories involve only his closest friends on the club and management. Even with that limitation, it was wonderful to read the stories about Gill Hodges, Duke Snider and others.He did waste a chapter on Howard Cosell at the end of the book. He and Howard were friends and I think he wanted to present the other side of Cosell. Although Howard may have been a cool guy, he was never a good sports announcer.If you liked Don Drysdale you should enjoy this book. After reading it, I wish I could have met him. This was a perfect title. Once a Bum (Brooklyn Dodger) Always a Dodger - and that he was for his whole career."},{"Title":"Once a Bum, Always a Dodger: My Life in Baseball from Brooklyn to Los Angeles","review":"Back in my teenage years, and mainly from 1962-67, I was a huge Los Angeles Dodgers fan, listening to every game that I could on my transistor radio. My chief heroes were hurlers Sandy Koufax and Don \\"The Big D\\" Drysdale, in that order. The most highly anticipated game day was one featuring a double-header in which both pitchers started. The ultimate delight was hearing both record a victory. Drysdale died in 1993 at age 56. His book, ONCE A BUM, ALWAYS A DODGER had been published 3 years before. For me, reading it only now, it represents The Big D's last walk to the mound.This volume is Don's memoir of his time as a (Brooklyn) Dodger beginning in 1956 to his retirement from the (Los Angeles) Dodgers in 1969 and his subsequent career as a sportscaster.Though California born and raised, Drysdale's biggest thrill in life was putting on the Brooklyn uniform, and that New York borough remained his sentimental professional home for the rest of his career. He remembers with fondness the Brooklyn greats with whom he first played, some of whom made the move to Los Angeles: Pee Wee Reese, Gil Hodges, Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Sal Maglie, Carl Furillo, Don Newcombe, and Duke Snider. Oddly, he has relatively little or nothing to say about the next generation of players whom I followed over the airwaves in Chavez Ravine: Maury Wills, Tommy and Willie Davis, Ron Fairly, Jim Brewer, Ron Perranoski, Claude Osteen, Johnny Roseboro, Jeff Torborg, Jim Lefebvre, Wes Parker, Dick Tracewski, and Lou Johnson. Sandy Koufax, of course, gets big mention inasmuch as it was Sandy and Don that joined forces for the infamous Great Holdout before the 1966 season. But, even then, I didn't sense that The Big D and Dandy Sandy were that close, not because either was overtly unfriendly, but because Koufax was (and is) a supremely private person. At one point Drysdale writes:\\"I don't know if Sandy enjoyed watching me pitch, but I sure as hell enjoyed watching him do his thing. He was something.\\"The most useful personal insights, such as they are, are pretty much limited to Manager Walter Alston, General Manager Buzzie Bavasi, and Dodger owner Walter O'Malley during Drysdale's playing era, and to Vin Scully and Howard Cosell during his broadcasting years. But, even here, there's not much meat.The book includes a 16-page section of photographs, but it lacks even a rudimentary section on Don's throwing statistics covering his 13-year major league career, though there is an entire chapter - \\"The Scoreless Streak\\" - dedicated to his most memorable achievement, the 58 2/3 innings of scoreless ball pitched in 1968.The reader might be left with the impression that The Big D's life was without bumps. Therefore, I found refreshing his last chapter admission to and brief discussion about the failure of his 24-year marriage to his first wife Ginger. Indeed, it was only at this late point that I discovered the man to be human and his story retrospectively engaging. Nevertheless, Drysdale remains a larger-than-life figure in the endless summer of my adolescence."},{"Title":"Once a Bum, Always a Dodger: My Life in Baseball from Brooklyn to Los Angeles","review":"DON DRYSDALE DOES A NICE JOB OF TELLING HIS LIFE AND CAREER.

Although Drysdale was both a fireballer and something of a fireball in personality (at least on the field), he comes across here pretty much as a generic athlete. Unlike Jim Bouton's &quot;Ball Four,&quot; this book doesn't project a distinctive, personal voice. The memoir rambles along entertainingly enough, but there's not much that's particularly memorable about it.An interesting aspect of the work is Drysdale's description of his close relationship with Sal Maglie, who came to the Dodgers in 1956. Drysdale, who seems to have been a very naive kid when he joined the Dodgers that same year (he was only 19), reports that he learned &quot;a lot about pitching, a lot about baseball, a lot about life&quot; from the &quot;great and grizzled veteran&quot; Maglie (who was all of 39 at that point!) His hero worship of Maglie when the latter was in the twilight of his career was touching, all the more so as it seems that Maglie didn't make many friends during his brief tenure with Brooklyn.In the last chapter Drysdale sums up some relatively recent events in his personal life, including a nasty divorce, followed by a late remarriage to a much younger woman and the birth of two children when he was in his early 50s. He goes on about how happy he is, how great his health is, despite a &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; diet and a fair amount of drinking, and how he expects to live a good, long life, etc., but readers today know that this didn't happen. In 1990, when the book was published, Drysdale wasn't in the middle of his life--he was near the end of it. He died of a heart attack in 1993 at the age of 56.For died-in-the-wool Dodger fans, the book is worth a trip to the library, but not to the used book store."},{"Title":"Once a Bum, Always a Dodger: My Life in Baseball from Brooklyn to Los Angeles","review":"When I was growing up, the pitcher that we all idolized was Sandy Koufax, which often relegated Don Drysdale to the role of a sidekick. Yet, he was a great pitcher in his own right and when he retired in 1969, he was the last Dodger player that had played in Ebbets field in Brooklyn. The list of his teammates is a significant segment of the all-time greats. Players such as Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Duke Snider, Sandy Koufax, John Roseboro, Pee Wee Reese, Don Newcombe and Gil Hodges all took the field beside him.However, his consorting with greatness was not limited to his teammates on the baseball diamond, Drysdale was also teamed with broadcast greats such as Keith Jackson, Vin Scully, Howard Cosell and Dick Enberg. Finally, Drysdale also observed the changes in the players, where teams went from a group that hung out and traveled together to a group of men that got together to play baseball and then went their separate ways. He was also present when the reserve clause was finally overthrown. Ironically, it was his joint holdout with Sandy Koufax that was the first real crack in that armor of defense around the owners.Drysdale is honest in the descriptions of his actions on the field, including his occasional throwing of a spitball and at batters when he felt it necessary. His harshest criticism is for the modern players and umpires that refuse to consider a close pitch to be a part of the game. Somewhat surprising is his comments about broadcaster Howard Cosell, which are very complimentary, a rare thing when Cosell is the topic.Drysdale's candid expression of his opinions presents a unique view of baseball and how it changed over the years. Despite the fact that he retired before the big money contracts arrived, Drysdale expresses no frustration or bitterness over that fact. Like most old-timers, he laments what baseball has lost rather than what he missed."},{"Title":"Once a Bum, Always a Dodger: My Life in Baseball from Brooklyn to Los Angeles","review":"Despite its awkward title, Don Drysdale's autobiography is an enjoyable read, but even the first-person narrative doesn't save this memoir from blandness.

But perhaps we need more detail here.... This is a truly superb integration of a mass of data, much of it unpublished palynological material from oil company files and other sources. On the basis of these data, Morley manages to overturn every standard cliche about rain forest history. The rainforests are not as old as often claimed; they took final form in the early Tertiary, or at the oldest in the very late Cretaceous. The Southeast Asian/Malesian forest is not the origin point for rainforests or for angiosperms; its richness in ancient forms is due to its serving as refugium during many climatic and geotectonic vicissitudes. Plate tectonics is critical to understanding the history of the forests. (I recall how plant geographers, in my student days, tied themselves in knots trying to explain rain forest plant distributions without invoking the hated and feared theory of continental drift.) The whole story, as told by Morley, is amazingly gripping--a sort of mega-detective-story. If you are literate in tropical plant taxonomy, you will be on the edge of your chair, whether you are a botanist, a cultural ecologist (like me), or just a plant lover. Be warned, though--if you haven't been there (to at least a couple of tropical rain forest areas) and gotten to know the major families, this book will be hard going. The book closes with the inevitable and all too appropriate gloom. My grandchildren will probably never see a tropical rain forest. By the time they will be old enough to travel, there will be no tropical rain forests left, except perhaps in inaccessible reserves--unless we can turn around a process that seems out of control. Morley blames &quot;short-term human greed&quot; on his ultimate page (286), but the truth is more complex; see William Ascher's book, WHY GOVERNMENTS WASTE NATURAL RESOURCES, for the whole story. Anyway--this is one book that should be on the &quot;must read&quot; list of everyone interested in tropical forests or in paleobotany."},{"Title":"Origin and Evolution of Tropical Rain Forests","review":"A truly triffic piece of academia, Dad!"},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"What a pleasure it is to comment on Professor Rouzer's book. When I studied classical Chinese forty years ago under the guidance of the late Professor Edward H. Schafer at the University of California at Berkeley, we did not have such a well-written introductory textbook as this one. In point of fact, we did not have one; instead we dealt with the actual textual material itself, along with the lecture commentary. What a difference it would have made and what a difference it makes today for the interested student wanting to pursue this subject matter. I cannot recommend this book too highly--it is a must buy!"},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"So I purchased this book based on the 100% 5-stars ratings from the past 8 customers. I feel a little tricked. Nothing is perfect and I should of known. There are definitely more cons than pros, but overall a good buy. It may not be a good book for someone learning on their own. Definitely a good classroom discussion based product.Pro: 1) I liked how the primer has great choices on ancient texts. The variety of texts in which the author picked was well suited for beginners learning literacy chinese. 2) Glad it has the plus 1400 vocab that a beginner can learn. The back of the book is a great reference tool with the radicals/strokes/dictionary.Cons: 1) All these little numbers in parenthesis after the vocabs can get confusing after awhile. Also, references back to certain pages or chapters can be confusing. what does this mean? See 2.7 for more information. what is 2.7 again? 2) Practice Exercises are great, but where are the solutions. I would like to know the answers to see if what I wrote was correct or not. 3) What are the original meanings of the ancient text/proverbs/stories? I find myself guessing what the sentence/paragraph means. 4) Maybe should of included an analects or text from Confucius. Kinda bummed there wasn't one. 5) Didn't like flipping back and forth to check on the ancient text and vocabulary, especially if the new vocab is towards the end of the lesson. Just seems tedious to do so. Example: first chapter. 3 proverbs could have been separated on its own pages with the new vocab underneath it with modern translations. Then lessons and explanations can follow. 5) Needs more visuals - like more bolded headlines or a better way to section off lessons. It just looks very dry to read."},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"Finally! A very good text for introducing classical Chinese! I have looked at most of them and as a teaching/learning tool this is head and shoulders above the rest. Really in a class by itself.I first studied Classical Chinese back in the days--yes it is true--when there were no textbooks available at all. That it has taken this long for somebody to produce a single volume that does what language text books are supposed to do (including exercises of various sorts, useful glossary and varied indexes, translations--just about anything you could need in addition to Korean and Japanese pronunciations)is surprising. But at last we now have such a book. It is written for normal language students, not ph.d's in linguistics. And if, like me, you are studying on your own, this one works! I am enormously grateful to the author. He has opened the door.I would give the book more than 5 stars were it to include just one reading from Buddhist literature (the Sinological tradition in this country seems to feel that Daoism and Confucianism are legitimately Chinese but that Buddhism is a foreign intrusion. Silly, that.) Too, putting in the simplified characters would probably help some students, as would calligraphic versions of characters since the printed versions can sometimes be misleading. But these quibbles aside, Prof. Rouzer has done us a great, great service."},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"This book will enable you to learn classical written Chinese on your own. Not that it will be easy -- it's still a daunting task, but the pace of this book, the way the material is presented, and the promise it holds for those who persevere (finish the book and you'll be able to read interesting texts, not just the simple stuff) make studying this great language a real pleasure.As another reviewer noted, no Buddhist text fragments are presented, unfortunately, but that, so far, is the only downside to this excellent textbook."},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"I've been studying modern Chinese for last few years, and have always been interested in the origins of this fascinating language. My first book in classical/literary chinese was Michael a Fuller'sAn Introduction to Literary Chinese: Revised Edition (Harvard East Asian Monographs). It's thorough and linguistically exact but can be difficult for beginner. Another good choice is Yuan, Tang & Geiss'sClassical Chinese: A Basic Reader in Three Volumes.Paul Rouzer's Practical Primer of Literary Chinese is definitely the most user-friendly, down-to-earth approach to classical Chinese. Starting with simple proverbs Rouzer explains vocabulary, grammar and sentence structures clearly and concisely. I can recommend this book as first purchase to everybody interested in literary Chinese."},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"I just purchased this book in Boston two weeks ago and have hardly put it down since this is the book I've been wanting to get my hands on for a long time. I'm already halfway through and have learned a great deal about the culture, language and temperament of Chinese people of earlier times. The linguistic explanations are lucid and compelling, the choices of stories are riveting, and the commentaries on the texts are scholarly, yet down to earth. As the previous reviewer noted, an inclusion of modern simplified Chinese characters alongside the classical ones would be a big plus. Also, I would much prefer to see Hangeul and Japanese script instead of the transliterations in the book since I am interested in nearly all the Asian languages. \\"Thank you!\\" for including the very smooth translations of all the Chinese texts in the back of the book. I am also editing the book as I study it, and I am happy to provide the author with my comments (benoit.eugene@epa.gov). Overall, this is a great book for those who wish to delve deeper on one's own into the historical and linguistic underpinnings of modern Chinese culture and language. Another good book to own is the ABC Dictionary of Chinese Proverbs since many of the grammatical structures which are discussed in the Primer are also seen over and over in the proverbs dictionary."},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"Having worked through several texts on classical Chinese, I found this one among the best. The vocabularies are comprehensive,grammar notes are good, although a bit scanty in later lessons, and the variety of texts gives exposure to different styles. This is really a text geared to classroom instruction, although a well-motivated person with a bit of a background in Modern or classical Chinese could use it with great profit. If there is to be a revised edition, I'd suggest including translations of all the texts, not just the first ten (although Rouzer gives references for translations of the later texts, some of these books would be hard to obtain without access to a university library). Also, this is a textbook for English-reading students, so the inclusion of Japanese and Korean readings of characters does not add anything for the vast majority of students; likewise for the kanbun readings, in romaaji, which take up a lot of space--anyone who could read kanbun would probably not be using this text. Such minor points take nothing away from the great utility of this book, which I'd highly recommend to those who want to read classical Chinese texts in the original."},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"There are currently several good classical Chinese primers available, but this book stands out among them, and is really excellent. I very much enjoyed studying it a few years ago, and I enjoyed reading through half of it, just for fun, once more yesterday.The book starts with a section of proverbs and short anecdotes from the Garden of Stories (first century BCE). Every lesson consists of Chinese text (fantizi, big font), Vocabulary (with pronunciations, including Japanese and Korean pronunciations, notes about word usage), and Commentary. The vocabulary is built up gently, and the grammatical notes point out common and basic patterns first, and only gradually introduce more complex and idiomatic patterns. The grammar explanations are very clear, and are always illustrated with sample sentences. A nice thing about the lessons in the first unit is also that the translation exercises not only ask you to translate from Chinese to English, but also from English into literary Chinese -- you may not appreciate how much this helps, until you have done a few exercises for yourself. Answer keys and translations of the exercises can be found in the back of the book.The next units follow the same pattern, but up the ante. Still, every lesson by itself is very manageable - about half a page (300-500 characters) of Chinese text, and 25-50 new characters per lesson. So step by step you will be able to work through this. Since the selection of source materials is also just marvelous, it's difficult to lose interest. In all there six units of a lessons. There is a very interesting unit with \\"Biographies of the Assassin-Retainers\\", from the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian, first century BCE), a section with two passages from \\"Biographies of Noted Women\\" (Liennu zhuan, first century BCE), ten lessons are devoted to Mengzi, there are two lessons about \\"Warrior Women\\" (including the Mulan ballad), and the final five lessons introduce the \\"Autumn Floods\\" (Qiu Shui) chapter from the Zhuangzi. -- One of my personal goals in studying classical Chinese was to be able to read both the Shiji and Zhuangzi in Chinese, so it was very rewarding for me to study this. The writer apologizes that he was not able to include the famous Shiji passages about Jing Ke, who tried to assassinate the First Emperor, but after working through this textbook I was able to read those for myself.To sum up the reasons why I like this book:- Gradual, gentle built up of lexicon and grammar (you are not overwhelmed with huge lists of rare Chinese characters)- Crystal-clear explanations of grammar and idiom- Brief notes about cultural and historical background- Excellent cross-references of characters (it's easy to find back in which lesson a character was first used)- Marvelous selection of literary source material"},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"This book fills the lacuna of resources for the would-be self-taught student of Classical Chinese. The book requires no knowledge of Mandarin to be fully utilized, offers detailed explanations of the major constructions and function words, and culminates in a guided reading of the Autumn Waters chapter of the Zhuangzi (in my estimation, one of the literary high points of Chinese philosophy). The 'review of common and significant words' is, in effect, a small reference grammar for all the most frequently encountered function words. Since the review can be quickly searched either by word or by types of clauses and parts of speech, it is extremely useful in determining how a given word encountered in the course of reading is being used in its context (as opposed to Pulleyblank, which, although it is thorough, in a way assumes because of its design that one knows how a word is being used before one can look it up to confirm a guess). The book has no rival of which I am aware in terms of usefulness to the novice, and even more experienced readers may find the explanations and indices valuable. The commentary and vocabulary of the Zhuangzi chapter alone is worth the price for anyone interested in reading that marvelous piece of writing."},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"This is a good textbook with interesting readings, which would serve well as either the main text for a course or as a supplement.

A couple reviewers say they are uncomfortable with the repeated references in regard to those interactions, but I can honestly say as an adolescent boy growing up, the author captured the state of mind pretty well, and for me, it was pretty hilarious. In any case, we do see at the end, the protagonist growing out of this state of mind, and he approached that state of maturity and enlightenment before any of his friends do, which can be seen in how his parents treated him at the end, as well as how he reacts to his friends' thoughts about losing \\"the bet.\\" In some sense, the reviewers are right, as younger kids definitely will not recognize the nuance in this book of how a single even can force you to grow up and alter your perceptions, but I definitely think that kids 9 and up can definitely appreciate this story.

Even if the only thing that one is able to take away from the novel is to feel like your life is not as bad as Lee's then the book is a success. Heather Lewis writes in a way that no other author writes. The book is almost completely devoid of descriptions of color and scenery. Everything is seen through the eyes of a drug addicted fifteen year-old, it is a terrifying experience. I am an avid reader and I don't think I have ever been in the head of a character quite like I was in Lee's head. You know what she is thinking before she thinks it, you know what she will do before she does it.If you ever wanted to see the dark side of humanity this is it. I have not been so horrified since John Updike's Rabbit Run or Train Spotting. I would read it again, but I am still too traumatized. If you want a taste of the wild side of life without risking arrest, this is the one.Heather Lewis also wrote one other novel, The Second Suspect. I have heard rumors that the author is no longer with us, so it looks like these are the only works we will have.Simply amazing."},{"Title":"House Rules","review":"This is possibly the best first book I have ever read from any author.

I had no problems with the graphic nature of the book. However, the characters had no life to them - their actions and histories have mysterious motivations that are alluded to but never explained; they do nothing but ride horses, get drunk and have abusive sex. The story goes on and on and on, and there is no plot, no climax, no resolution. We know Lee can't handle intimacy after the first sexual scene - nothing in the next 300 pages dds any clarification, meaning or resolution to this storyline."},{"Title":"House Rules","review":"The book was written assuming everyone was familiar with horse riding lingo and drug lingo. I've ridden a horse once in my life, and I was never a heroin user. I was lost through alot of the book.. Honestly halfway through I wanted to put it down but I can't do that.. I finished the book and normally I feel something when I'm done. I just turned the last page and said.. \\"Hmm, thats it?\\" There wasnt much of a plot or point to the book. It is very graphic in the sex scenes. I do not belive I would recommend this book to anyone.

This small volume is the outgrowth of a lecture series given before the First World War. Murray traces the growth and development of Greek religion from it's beginnings in prehistorical animism to the full flowering of the major schools of philosophy, and thence to their extinction. Murray explores the irrational, Dionysic strand that emerged independantly of the Olympian mythos, and shows how both predate Homer. He considers the minor deities, such as the boundary statues (koures) mentioned by Thucydides in connection with Alcibiades' impiety. The eloquent chapters on the rise of philosophy-cum-religion are the most memorable in a memorable book. Murray's vingettes on the lives and actions of the founders of the famous schools - linked as they are in lineal descent from Socrates, Epicurus excepted, are excellent biographical sketches in their own right. His examination of the faults in each philosophical system, Aristotle's Pertpetetic School excepted, shows how, after banishing Olympian myth, essential to keeping hold of thinking minds, they let them back in, pantheistically, or as manifestations of the universal creator, etc. (Epicurus preached a materialism that did not fully recognize divinity, and so he may be partly excused, as well.) This book this lays out how the hellenistic world was prepared for the advent of Christanity, as the rise of philosophy asked the right questions to move thinkers beyond myth, and philosophy's subsequent fall into Neoplatonism and other pantheistic movements left the Greco-Roman world looking elsewhere for answers. An outstanding addition to any classical library. -Lloyd A. Conway"},{"Title":"The Selected Poems of Rosario Castellanos (Palbra Sur Book)","review":"&quot;The Selected Poems of Rosario Castellanos&quot; is a bilingual collection of the work of this important woman poet of Mexico. This is a bilingual edition, with Castellanos' Spanish originals and the English versions on facing pages. The poems have been translated by Magda Bogin, who co-edited the volume with Cecilia Vicuna.Castellanos' work has a somber, introspective quality. Many of her poems are about death, pain, or sadness. Many of her lines demonstrate a rather dark world view. Example: &quot;We give life only to what we hate&quot; (from &quot;Destiny&quot;). Her language is at times romantic and sensuous, at times cynical: &quot;Don't trust a man in love: he's hungry, / all he wants is to devour&quot; (from &quot;Celestina's Advice&quot;). She sometimes uses memorable imagery: &quot;On the lips of the wind I shall be called / a tree of many birds&quot; (&quot;Two Poems&quot;).I found Castellanos' poetry to have a psychological quality that reminded me of the work of two other Latin American women poets: Julia de Burgos (Puerto Rico) and Alfonsina Storni (Argentina).

This was one of those times! The book is a lovely, well illustrated, practical guide to geology for the beginner. Much of what the authors dedicate a single paragraph or page to I have had whole courses in already, so needless to say, I was not quite as enthused over the material as a new comer to the field might be. Certainly for the beginner, especially the Junior High natural science enthusiast, this would be a wonderful gift. It might even make a good text for a high school natual science course, as it covers considerable information on the earth sciences. I plan on giving my copy to a close friend with children interested in these subjects."},{"Title":"The Practical Geologist: The Introductory Guide to the Basics of Geology and to Collecting and Identifying Rocks","review":"This book provides a fair introduction to geology with fairly clear diagrams and introduction to basics such as geological time scale and plate tectonics. The book tries to emphasize the practical side of geology: what can be seen and picked up. The introduction to common minerals was perhaps not as practical as I'd hoped, for some of the minerals without picture and just a description of chemical structure, hardness, and gravity I could not identify them. The information level was uneven: \\"a backpack full of rocks can be heavy\\" to arcane (The chemical reaction with feldspar to produce clay minerals). The section on different rock types was well done, but the section of mapping didn't seem practical (I couldn't really map a bed of coal). I think this book might be best if used with a very local or state geology guide."},{"Title":"The Practical Geologist: The Introductory Guide to the Basics of Geology and to Collecting and Identifying Rocks","review":"Among my many interests, geology has always been lurking in the background, one that I never really pursued but nonetheless seemed worth knowing about. For this reason, I finally got around to getting a book on the topic, and picked out The Practical Geologist by Dougal Dixon. Although it isn't a bad book, it was also not the wisest choice for me.As the title indicates, this is a book for the practical geologist, one that goes out to sites to assess the landscape: the types of rocks, the shape of the hills, et cetera. There are plenty of illustrations and photographs to assist the reader, along with information about how to write up notes and set up displays.All this is wonderful in its own way, but for the true geological layman like myself, it is a bit more than what I wanted. That is to say, as an introduction to geology, this book is not wholly successful: while never getting overly technical, it also doesn't offer enough in the way of explanation. Instead, it just presents the facts and moves onto the next topic. It reads a bit more like a reference book than a regular science book.The back of the book describes The Practical Geologist as the \\"perfect introduction to the world of earth science\\". This is not really the case. Nonetheless, I am giving this book four stars: I think that what this book does, it does well. If you're looking for a first book on geology, however, I would search elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Practical Geologist: The Introductory Guide to the Basics of Geology and to Collecting and Identifying Rocks","review":"I checked this book out of the library and after halfway through decided it was a keeper and ordered my own copy. Mr. Dixon's writing style is straight forward and easy to follow. Plenty of illustrations to help visualize various concepts and landforms. I found the bit about tools and equipment really informative. It deals with what you really need and not just what neat tools you can get (and probably never have a use for.)All of this makes for a good 'First Book on the Subject' read. I say that because if you have read any other introductory texts most of this book will be a review. Great for someone who is wanting to learn a little geology but hasn't done any study before. Both adults and children.I recommend this book to anyone, like myself, who hasn't had a formal education in geology and just wanted to find out a little more. If you're wanting text on more involved subjects or specific reference I would suggest the NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY books.

There is a major lack of organization and I found it disjointed in a way that makes it hard to follow the content in an understandable way. As this book is 160 pages and much of it is photographs, there is relatively little information. Some parts are very elementary and others very advanced. Some parts are just confusing: A new section is titled \\"The Evidence for the Theories\\" but go back several pages and there's no indication exactly what theories are being referred to; a new section on sedimentary rock states that \\"The rubble and dust...will all eventually be consolidated and turned into rock. That is the genesis of...sedimentary rock.\\" So that's it. Perhaps more detailed information is somewhere else in the book, but it should be in this section; the authors start off providing information on the major layers of the earth with numbers from closest to the surface to deepest down but when they get to the upper mantle, they reverse the numbers form deepest down towards the surface. There are some good photos and information on individual rocks is useful.If you're looking for an introduction to geology, this book is absolutely NOT going to be helpful as so little is covered.

I had the honor of using the book as a text book this past semester at Penn State University, Harrisburg, PA. The course explored the literature of nurses as well as traditional literature. The goal of this exploration was to redefine caring, to create new ways to teach preventive health care and nurturance, and to sensitively encourage caregivers to own their responsibility to intellectualize and write from their unique vantage point as observers of pain. Numerous and various clinical scenarios were available through the creative writing in BETWEEN THE HEARTBEATS and provided an opportunity to look at clinical situations with a refreshing perspective. My co-editor, Cortney Davis, and I have conducted many workshops but this was my first opportunity to use the book as a text for a three credit course. As might be guessed, I was personnally pleased that the book served so well as a text. Best wishes to any of you who may want to try it in your classroom.Judy Schaefer, RNC, MA"},{"Title":"Between the Heartbeats: Poetry and Prose by Nurses","review":"This collection of poetry, essays, and short stories by registered nurses has moved, inspired, and encouraged nurses here in the US and Canada and overseas. Many nurses, after reading this collection, have contacted me to say how these poems and stories reflect what they think and feel as they themselves are working with patients: the joys and moments of transcendance as well as the fears and frustrations. Nurses from all walks of healhcare--among them ICU nurses, homecare nurses, Hospice Nurses, OB/GYN nurses, Nursing Home nurses, office nurses--find words here that mirror what they feel during those amazing moments, the ones between the heartbeats, when they are standing by a patient's side. Death and dying are part of a nurse's day, just as surely as birth, healing, and grace are. These works speak of all aspects of caregiving, from the nurse's unique vantage point. Now in it's fourth printing, Between the Heartbeats is being translated into Japanese and a second, all-new volume is currently being assembled, a companion piece to the original volume offered here. As Frances Biley said in her review of Heartbeats in Nursing Times (3/20/96) &quot;This book is essential. I dare you to read 'NICU' by Dana Schuster and not be moved.

The only daughter of a gambling mad duke, Cynthia's father agrees to marry off his young daughter in return for money in order to pay off his gambling debts. A shy and scholarly girl, Lady Cynthia approaches her marriage with the notion that she's marrying some kind of romantic hero. Except that Samuel is no romantic hero: he's cold and forbidding and when he tries to consummate his marriage, his young wife breaks down into hysterical tears. Disgusted, Samuel leaves his wife and departs in order to make a trip around the world.Four years pass, and Cynthia has grown into a lovely and intelligent young woman, used to leading a life without a husband. Desiring her independence, Cynthia hits on the notion of asking for a legal separation from Samuel. And when Samuel gets wind of this, he rushes home to confront his errant wife. A legal separation would not help him in his plan to throw his social success in Kenyons faces. But instead of finding a meek and biddable wife, he finds an independent and determined young lady -- a young lady that he would very much like to bed. And so Samuel comes up with a plan: if Cynthia will live with him for a while, and help him establish himself with the ton, he will sign her separation. Of course Samuel has every intention of seducing his wife into seeing things his way. But he has a lot to contend with: a wife who (apparently) has close ties to his despised Kenyon relatives and who is determined not to share a life with him; someone who is trying to kill him; and a horde of suitors who seem to be in love with his wife! Can Samuel pull off his scheme?Unfortunately, there is really nothing new (plot-wise) or fresh about &quot;The Wedding Night&quot; -- yet another older man who marries a teenager, and who takes off for 4 years because she's unable to contemplate being bedded by him, but who returns when she demands a legal separation from him -- even the characters are the same stock characters we see in most romance novels: a remote and much misunderstood hero who hides a heart of gold, a heroine who is clever and beautiful and who is still in love with her undeserving spouse, etc. So that whether or not you will glean any satisfaction from reading this novel will depend on whether or not you are a fan of the series. Even there, however, you might be a little disappointed: in earlier novels, the eldest Kenyon brother (Michael) has always expressed reservations about Samuel's character, yet here, every Kenyon is eager to embrace Samuel, thus making his reluctance to have anything to do with them (while understandable) seem churlish. Whatever reservations the Kenyon brothers may have had about Samuel seems to have evaporated somewhere along the way! Even the stalking/attempted murder subplots failed to lift the book from it's average read status.I found &quot;The Wedding Night&quot; to be a well written novel that rehashed several overused plot devices, and as such was a middling ok-ish read -- but there really was no compelling reason to urge anyone to rush out and buy/borrow this book."},{"Title":"The Wedding Night","review":"What happens when a marriage has been arranged to pay off a debt? Filled with naive romantic notions, fifteen-year-old Lady Cassandra Grey thinks that her wedding night will only be a kiss good night. Samuel Firth was obliged to tell his virgin bride otherwise. After witnessing the fear from this mere child, Samuel decides the only thing left to do is leave. He departs for a trip around the world, leaving his bride still a virgin.THE WEDDING NIGHT is set in 1820 in London, England, some four years since Cassandra last saw her husband. She's all grown up, very beautiful and intelligent, an author on the verge of releasing her first book and ready to gain her independence. She knows Samuel provided for her generously during the last four years while he lived a very colorful life moving from one city to another. She still harbors deep resentments about her wedding night and the humiliation she faced. Her only thought is to gain her freedom and maintain an air of respectability, but she must first have permission from Samuel for a separation. He, on the other hand, has other intentions and a separation was not a part of it. His original plan was to wait until she grew up before consummating the marriage and then take his rightful place in society. After a chance meeting between them in the theatre, a separation is out of the question. In fact, he comes up with a scheme to appear agreeable to her proposal while at the same time deviously plotting to seduce her.As Samuel puts his plan in motion, he discovers that much has gone astray in his absence. Someone has been stealing from him, there are those that have designs on his wife, and the family that he felt deserted him has been meddling in his affairs. To complicate things further, Samuel finds himself completely entranced with Cassandra and very protective of her. Will Cassandra gain her independence? Has Samuel bitten off more than he can chew?In her fifth book of the Rosebuds series, Barbara Dawson Smith has written an action-packed historical romantic tale that continues the story of the three matchmaking grandmothers. She weaves in a lesson on the strength of family love and respect around a believable love story and a couple of whodunit subplots to keep readers on the edge of their seats. I felt the character development was awesome in this near flawless stand-alone compilation. Ms. Dawson Smith is indeed a great storyteller, and I, for one, will be looking to read more from this author.Reviewed by Brenda M.

The Wedding Night answered that need. It is an enjoyable Regency romance. Predictable, but also compelling reading. Young Cassandra marries the much older Samuel when she is just fifteen. Nothing happens on their wedding night, young Cassandra is too frightened and confused. Samuel leaves the country, returning four years later to a woman he hardly knows, but very much desires. Intrigue, romance, suspicion and betrayal follow. A perfect, fun, quick read."},{"Title":"The Wedding Night","review":"In 1816 Samuel Firth, illegitimate son of Marquess George Kenyon who spawned him and his mother, buys fifteen year old Lady Cassandra to be a bride. He chose Cassandra because she is the perfect blue blood to help him engineer his vengeance against his sire, but he also selected her because he was hooked when he saw her making angels in the snow. Samuel pays off the enormous debts that Cassandra's father accumulated.On their wedding night, Samuel expected a somewhat reticent wife, but he found a frightened child with no idea what to expect waiting in bed with him. Instead of forcing himself on her, Samuel leaves. He travels the globe for the next four years looking at his business interests while waiting for his spouse to grow up.Samuel returns but Cassandra is now an intelligent beautiful woman who has a circle of men paying their respects to her though she is not a flirt. Samuel informs her he will take his dividend soon, but instead they fall in love. However, a secret admirer plans to do anything to gain her hand including murder and abduction.THE WEDDING NIGHT is a fine Regency romance that showcases the skills of Barbara Dawson Smith to use multiple settings for her tales. The story line is fun to follow as Samuel and Cassandra battle for \\"supremacy\\" in their relationship, a skirmish that neither can win solo, but both can triumph if they choose to win-win together. Though the villainous subplot adds suspense and provides a final impetus to bring the heroes in concert, it takes away from a powerful love story between two obstinate charmers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Wedding Night","review":"Once again another winner from Barabara Dawson Smith. I love the way she writes - fast and fun. All her characters are great. her women are sassy and independent. An easy summer read. if your looking for something intellectual - go read a text book. if you want a fun summer love story pick up one by this author."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens ostensibly follows the exploits of a &quot;scientific club&quot; headed by Mr. Pickwick, a retired businessman of financial means. But as Dickens notes in his preface, the club is a mere point- of- departure for a rollicking story, and is soon left behind. This is a wonderful book, notwithstanding a few tedious spots, and some &quot;sidebar&quot; tales that could have been left out. Dickens' true genius lies in his portraits of the two Wellers- Sam and his father- who gradually assume main character status. Rembrandt himself could not have depicted them with more insight. His sketches of these two are so lively, and so full of good- natured humor, that they will live in your memory for years to come."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"If you don't believe a great book can have a happy ending this book will change your mind.

I never thought any editiion would leave out generally included notes and illustrations. Lesson learned: buy from local bookstore after handling to your satisfaction.

I recommend it highly!The leather bound edition is lovely, and has stood up to many readings. :)"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"PP is a joy; in that it was written when CJHD was 24, it is also a wonder. I don't have much to add that has not been said. One sees the author grow as a writer as the book develops; by the end he is in top form. The plotting is thin, and the chapters episodic, while the details are vivid, and the language rich. By the end, the reader feels at home in early Victorian England. I enjoyed the spectrum of characters. The bad ones are able to be polished a little, and develop redeeming quality. The good ones sparkle, but have their shortcomings. There are also plenty in the scrum who are just ordinary, albeit singular, human beings. Recommended."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I just couldn't get into the information.

Such a great idea, Amazon!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This book is one of the rare ventures of Dickens into the field of the light-hearted novel. Whilesimultaneously working in considerable criticism of the social mores of his time, he has createda menage of fascinating characters, led by the venerable Pickwick himself, who bumble theirway through a number of tangled situations. Dickens really needs no introduction to the seriousreader, but If one has been limited to &#34;Oliver Twist&#34; and &#34;A Tale of Two Cities&#34;, one should reallytry &#34;The Pickwick Papers&#34;.

He so brings it to life, that no one has to find it dense or difficult. It is funny, wise, touching and in one instance sad. Many times the listener will exclaim \\"Right! Exactly!\\" As situations from the early 19th Century strike one as humerously apt in today's world. The characters are all instantly recognizable and their voices are perfect for the personalities. I am most grateful that the extremely talented Mr. Prebble gave us an audio to which I will listen repeatedly and which I have already recommended to others. A true classic and a truly classic performance."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This is one of Charles Dickens greatest novels and the best expression of his comedy/satirical treatment of several 19th Century English institutions. Mr. Pickwick is the English equivalent of Cervantes' Don Quiote and Sam Weller is the worldy sidekick who looks after his Masters best interest with excellent loyalty. The 24 year old Dickens draws on his many earliest experiences working in Parliament and as a reporter in London. He was the forth person asked to write this serial and you get the sense that he is flying by the seat of his pants, writing and thinking the story out as he goes, as opposed to his later practice of the planning or story mapping of some of his greatest works. It isn't until the tenth chapter and the introduction of Sam Weller, as Mr. Jingle's foil, that Dickens realizes the moment when the novel finds its focus and thrust. Weller transforms the novel in a fascining and hilarous manner. I highly recommend reading this book. It's too much fun to pass up."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I think many people miss the whole point of this story. What they're wanting is a movie, when they're watching a television series, if you catch the meaning. This is not a \\"novel,\\" in the strict sense of a definitive plotline. It holds the title loosely, and is more of a collection of short, interconnected stories. It is meant to be, quite literally, a Victorian re-imagining of Don Quixote, which is set up in much the same style. (By the bye, if you enjoy The Pickwick Papers, I highly recommend reading the aforementioned literary masterpiece.)One thing I've heard complained about--even in the good reviews--is that the characters are not \\"real\\" or \\"fully developed.\\" \\"Real\\" seems to imply that the characters will grow and change. I disagree. Take the two most popular characters in the book as prime examples, Samuel Pickwick and Samuel Weller. We see the former in his later years--his development is all but passed him. He does grow as a person somewhat throughout his experiences, but just like most men his age, he is not the mindset for change. In fact, his obstinacy is shown quite vividly throughout. The latter, being Samuel Weller, is in that unflinching stage of youth, when he feels the world is his for the commanding. And just like his master, we see his obstinacy quite often--usually in the same places. These are characters Dickens did not want to change. Indeed, G. K. Chesterton goes so far as to call them eternal. They're better this way. Who didn't feel a pang of remorse when Don Quixote renounced his gallivanting ways?As to the other characters, they are all subsidiary to Pickwick and Weller, just as the entire cast of Don Quixote is to Sancho and the Knight of the Rueful Figure.As to the wandering storyline, that is part and parcel to Charles Dickens. He never could stay in one place. The plot was secondary to his whims, and a definite plot would usually just weigh him down. Dickens created people, not characters or caricatures. Whether they be static or no, they are always interesting and entertaining and full of all the eccentricities of the individual. The stories were just places for the people to live, and the people he created for this story certainly do live."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"A series of sporting prints was about to be published. The artist Robert Seymour had been hired. Now it was needed that an author be hired to add his prose to the series of prints. Charles Dickens became that author and literature has never been the same! The artist Seymour committed suicide; the 20 monthly numbers by Dickens shot him to instant popularity and a career as Victorian England's most successful novelist!Dickens grew up reading \\"Tom Jones\\" by Henry Fielding and other picaresque novels especially \\"Don Quixote\\" by Cervantes. Their influence on him was profound as evinced in Pickwick's many pages.The story tells of the fat, rubicund and funny old gentleman Mr. Pickwick who sets out to explore England. He takes with him three younger men Snodgrass, Tubman and Winkle. Along the way Pickwick hires young Samuel Weller to be his factotum. Weller steals the book with his cockney wit and wisdom. His father Tony also appears commenting on everything from women to jurisprudence. These characters are among the funniest ever created by Dickens.This book is very early Dickens lacking the seriousness, plot development and social realism of later works such as \\"Bleak House\\";\\"Little Dorritt\\" \\" Hard Times\\" and \\"Our Mutual Friend\\". It is instead filled with memorable characters getting themselves involved in one complicated incident after another! Mrs.Bardell the amorous landlady who sues Pickwich for Breach of Promise. Mr. Pickwich's attempts at ice skating; the Wardle Christmas Ball; the variious short stories told by characters interspersed in the text; the wild rides in stagecoaches across the landscape described with insight by the young genius; the trip to Newgate Prison where Pickwick is briefly incarcerated; the greedy lawyers; the hypocrites; the scoundrels and scamps of living. All are there in the Dickens universe.The Pickwick Papers was Dickens most popular novel. It has never been surpassed in the English language for its light and lively look at British Life in the 1820s. If you have time to spend with a good book liking to laugh and be entertained pick up a copy of this classic novel!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Charles Dickens's first novel, Pickwick Papers follows the adventures of the Pickwick Club as they involve themselves in comic mishaps and misunderstandings. His travels as a newspaper reporter acquainted Dickens with the coaches, coaching houses, and inns of England which he uses as settings in Pickwick Papers. Gradually he abandons the use of the club format and attempts to create a plot.Dickens's fame and popularity were forever established with the introduction of his greatest comic character, Sam Weller. In addition Pickwick Papers contains some of the author's best characters: Mr Pickwick, Dickens's most interesting title character; the strolling actor Jingle and his friend Job Trotter; Sam's father Tony Weller who battles with the red-nosed Rev Stiggins; and the Fat Boy.Memorable scenes include Christmas in the country, a Parliamentary election, and the famous court trial, which Dickens frequently recited on his reading tours."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"It's not often that I laugh out loud when reading, but Pickwick has many such moments. (See, for example, Mr. Winkle's equestrian adventure.) While Pickwick foreshadows some of Dickens' later work on social concerns, such as debtor's prisons and interminable estate litigation, mostly it is just a fun and funny book, with an endearingly aimless plotline and lovable characters. If you thought Dickens was all about darkness and tragedy, try this one. It's a real gem!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The classic novel the Pickwick Papers, by Charles Dickens, is a very enchanting and witty novel. It is full of quirky and fun characters such as Mr. Pickwick himself, the constant gentleman and \\"hero\\" of the novel, and his jovial manservant Sam Weller, an amusing definition of a devoted friend. Dickens does an excellent job of keeping the reader entertained with these eccentric characters through their many adventures and escapades.This book is great for anyone who loves Charles Dickens' literature because it shows a more comical side to his writing yet still keeps his classic style. This book is not for those looking for a quick read. Dickens is very verbose and elaborate in his detailing of every single aspect of the book, from the characters to the scenery. This aspect slows the pace a little, so the reader must be at full attention at all times. When that attention is given however, the reader becomes enthralled with clever witticisms to make anyone laugh out loud as well as intricate detailing in both setting and character that can make them feel like an intimate friend of Mr. Pickwick as they are sitting in a perfectly portrayed setting. Dickens' sense of humor shines through Pickwick Papers through many of these situations with his mischievous use of satire. Dickens' takes a playful aim at many subjects such as the antics of politics, the absurdity of law, and the general folly of the human race. These features make the book an interesting and amusing read because Dickens uses his comedy to poke fun and completely entertains the reader simultaneously. Overall, Pickwick Papers is a brilliantly written book that is sure to entertain any who take the time and effort to read it."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I've often wondered that if I had to attend a party or a ball that was made up of every character of a particular author's body of work, whose creations would I wish to meet? You couldn't do much better than Charles Dickens, and surely the host of such a gathering would be Mr. Pickwick of the Pickwick Club. The club, discovered in a collection of \\"posthumous papers,\\" is something of a toast masters society that journeys from London to the English countryside and back again in search of various forms of stimulation. Instead of finding that philosophical, poetic, and scientific wisdom that they are in search of, more often they stumble into situations not of their own making. Nearly always, hilarity ensues. They spirit of the novel is both jolly and tender; never has a book so often made me want to join the action. And while I haven't read every Dickens novel, I doubt that you will find a more wonderful pair of friends that Samuel Weller and Mr. Pickwick. The two are genuine and devoted friends, despite their differences in interests, mannerisms, and stations in life.Regarding the very long novels of the 19th century (this may sound obvious), they take some getting used to, especially to readers of much shorter contemporary novels. One inevitably will forget a character or a detail that appears on p. 35 as they read p. 700. Yet, one should remember that the novel came out in 19 monthly installments, and thus does not call for a quick reading. One can set the book aside for a few days and not worry about losing the plot; there isn't really a plot. Like a television series today, the adventures involve the same principle characters, with many of the supporting characters reappearing throughout the narrative. But the work itself is less a story than a canvas, and there is no central conflict or tension.My first crack at one of Dickens' long novels was David Copperfield, which was also my first review on this site. I gave it 2 stars, despite the fact that I enjoyed so many pieces of it. Trying to race through a Dickens novel will end in frustration and exhaustion. Don't be afraid to read other books simultaneously.Lastly, do yourself a favor and read the Introductions written by GK Chesterton. These essays both elevate one's own reading of the novel, and provide pleasure and insight in their own right. They bypass both the jargon and ostentatious learning that can make contemporary criticism a battle to read."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I was curious about getting something delivered serially, but this has been fun. Just like the old days when Charles Dickens published his work this way. The language is thick, which means you're not reading a slam-bam action novel, but you just lean into it and enjoy the words that captivated readers and listeners in the 19th century. I have always loved Dickens for his wonderful characters. This novel has a bevy."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This is definitely one of my all-time favorite Dickens novels. By the time I finished the book, it felt like I was personally acquainted with so many of the characters. Dickens ability to create characters and his humor shine through in this one."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Charles Dickens wrote The Pickwick Papers in his early 20s, but the writing is first rate and as witty as any seasoned author could have done in his place! Like many of Dickens's works, Pickwick was published in monthly installments, or \\"numbers\\" as they were called then. Although Dickens originally intended to end the story at the twentieth number, the popularity of the series (and the resultant income) convinced Dickens to double the length to forty numbers. The end result is a large offering that'll take you a while to get through (~750 pages in the excellent Penguin edition, which I read).Despite its length, Pickwick never tries your patience. It's delightfully humorous from beginning to end. Samuel Pickwick is the bumbling, middle-aged, wealthy namesake of this novel. He's the leader of a small group of single men that gets into all sorts of mischief, both physical and social. Booze is rampant. Apparently liquor back then was much more a part of daily life than today; everywhere these guys go they party and get drunk. They get into trouble with the law, women, unsavory characters, and more.Characterization is superb. This is one of the few novels I've read for which I can actually say that I got to know the characters. In most books I've read, the characters remain two-dimensional and the plot is what carries the story. In Pickwick, the *characters* are the essence of the story and the novel wouldn't be memorable at all if a lesser author were attempting to breathe life into these people.The Penguin edition includes a decent collection of endnotes to help explain unfamiliar portions of the text. Nevertheless, there were still quite a few words and concepts peculiar to early 19th century England that I didn't grasp. This edition also has maps of southern England and a key to the specific locations that the Pickwickians visit. In addition, two appendices reprint some of the announcements and prefaces that Dickens wrote in relation to the work.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoy classic literature! Dickens's later works overshadow this gem due to their maturity, but Pickwick beats them all in enthusiasm, humor, and wit."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This edition (ASIN B002RKSXJQ) is poorly formatted. There is a wide left margin throughout, and the amusingly long chapter titles get progressively smaller every few lines.I was willing to put up with it until I came to the scene in the parlor at Manor Farm, which appears to be missing some text. Either that, or Dickens is more post-modern than I thought, trailing off (with no punctuation) in the middle of a sentence.Amazon needs to do some quality control on this edition, and remove it from the store. There are plenty of others, why waste our time by listing inferior product?"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can duplicate this feat today.\\"The Pickwick Papers\\" is one of Dickens's earliest works, written when the author was a mere twenty-four years old. You wouldn't know his age by reading the story, though. \\"Pickwick\\" is a work that delivers healthy doses of sophisticated humor, keen observations on pressing social issues, romance, and a mature knowledge of human behavior. It's of course fiction, although Dickens presents the story as a true series of events documented by the \\"Pickwick Club,\\" a social organization founded by retired businessman and all around merry fellow Samuel Pickwick. In the 1820s, Pickwick and several friends embark on a series of journeys through Southern England, a journey that lasts for roughly two years. Ostensibly, the businessman and his fellows take the trips to learn more about their country. Instead, their travels turn into a series of often hilarious events mixed with a few serious scrapes. Pickwick must constantly save individuals from the machinations of one Alfred Jingle, an itinerant scalawag with a penchant for wooing women for their money. In between these adventures, our hero must contend with a lawsuit filed by a former female employee who thought he wanted to marry her, save his friends from numerous imbroglios involving members of the opposite sex, survive a stay in a debtor's prison, and live through a couple hundred other adventures both major and minor.If I had to list one overarching theme I enjoyed most about \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" it's got to be the humor. This book is one of the funniest things I've read in ages. We're talking laugh out loud and laughing later when remembering scenes from the book funny. Much of the humor centers on Pickwick's manservant Sam Weller, a guy prone to uttering some of the most hilarious sayings you'll likely see in any book. Weller's father is even more amusing, and when father and son sit down to write a letter to a lovely young woman who's caught Sam's eye, well, prepare to hold your sides. Also worth a belly laugh or two is the chapter where Pickwick and his friends visit the town of Eatanswill in time to witness the results of a contentious local election. Dickens's observations about party politics and media manipulation are not only highly amusing, but also relevant to our own age. And who can forget the courtroom scenes where the lawyer makes Pickwick, this kindly old gentleman who wouldn't hurt a fly, look like an absolute monster? I could go on and on. If you read this book without cracking up, check your pulse because you're probably dead.Another element of the book I enjoyed concerns Dickens's ability to write scenes that simply overflow with the joy of living. A lengthy chapter describing Pickwick's stay with some country friends over Christmas serves as an excellent example. The sheer bliss of this part of the book is infectious, as Dickens makes us marvel at the simple delight of spending a few days in the company of good friends, good food, and good entertainment. On the other hand, the author isn't above indulging in an activity he's become famous for, namely showing the reader the depths of human suffering. There is far less misery in \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" than there is in \\"Oliver Twist,\\" to cite one example, but it's still here. The debtor's prison in which Pickwick stays for a time provides the author with a perfect forum for attacking England's tradition of imprisoning those unfortunate souls who cannot pay their creditors. I marvel at how Dickens can balance these two extremes in the space of a single novel. In this way, \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" manages to encompass life in both its good and bad aspects.I read the Penguin Classics edition of \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" and I'm glad I did. The supplementary material is copious and helpful more often than not. I didn't care much for the introduction from Robert L. Patten, however, which I thought tried to read too much into the story. I did appreciate the footnotes that help explain the English geography, slang, and popular culture references found throughout the story. Further material provides information on the three illustrators who worked on the story, biographical details of Dickens's life, and even maps tracing Pickwick's myriad travels through the English countryside. Reading \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" makes me realize that I've neglected this author's works for far too long. I can't praise this book enough; it's that entertaining and that good. Give it a go as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"It's free - that's the major plus of this edition. As noted earlier, there are some irritating formatting issues, such as the lack of consistency in chapter headings. However, far worse is that this edition omits anything that isn't pure text, such as a key illustration and lines of song/poetry. It's still a funny book and worth a read, but keep in mind you'll be missing some jokes just because they were left out by the editor."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I don't think I've ever read a novel half as entertaining as The Pickwick Papers. I agree with the reviewer who said that it was as if Dickens had a million jokes that he wanted to get off of his chest. And such wonderful characters! The last part of the book though is more about Mr. Pickwick himself than about the club. He also becomes less of a doofus and more of a lovealbe and sympathetic character as the novel progresses. If you are ever down and feeling depressed then this is the book to read.Sam Weller is one of Dickens greatest characters, the book really comes into its own when he becomes Mr.Pickwicks servent."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Note: this novel is available for download from several sites because it is out of copyright. The Feedbooks site (a dot com) and the Project Gutenberg site (a dot org) come to mind.The Pickwick Papers is Charles Dickens' first novel (originally serialized like his subsequent works) and one I heartily recommend to those who have never read him before. It is very funny at intervals but as the work progresses, it becomes less disjoint and the last twenty percent of it is magnificent.The premise is that Mr. Pickwick, a slightly buffoonish man of science, sheltered by his wealth from many of the real ways of the world, convinces his eponymous Pickwickian Society to inculcate a new branch, to aid with the Society's endeavour of enriching scientific knowledge and other matters of grave importance (yet what the Society deems of grave importance, the reader probably would see as misguided self-importance and humorous bluster). This branch is to be comprised of Pickwick and his three devoted companions, the lady's man Tupman, the poetic Snodgrass, and the sporting Winkle. Together with Pickwick, they are to travel across England and report back to the Society any matters of scientific or social import via letters; whence the title The Pickwick Papers: a simple premise that sets up the novel for fun and misadventure from chapter two onwards.In reality, the stout companions Pickwick, Tupman, Winkle, and Snodgrass, are rather less the lions of society and enlightenment than they believe, and their prowess in their respective \\"specialities\\" often lands them in the most awkward and humorous situations.Initially, the novel seems disjointed. Each chapter is entertaining enough, but there are ever new characters, and literary devices to introduce mini-stories within the chapter, as when the hale fellows meet some odd stranger who has a creepy story to tell about the ghost of a gravedigger. The story is told from the perspective of the Pickwickians (society members) who receive letters from the companions of their adventures in the country. Part of the humour of the novel is the gullibility of Pickwick and friends: they report the wondrous stories of the crafty locals and conmen to the Society as if they were true, not noticing that often the tellers of tales are getting fat on free dinners and drunk on conviviality, all at the expense of Pickwick himself, of course.Entertaining as the numerous humorous diversions in each chapter are, the story comes to a very solid conclusion after the half-way mark. Characters you thought might never be heard of again, are reintroduced with genius, and the whole lot eventually are entwined under remarkably astute circumstances: how Dickens managed this in a serialized novel is, no doubt, part of his genius.I noticed that the bluster and tomfoolery of Pickwick especially, and friends, resolves by the end of the novel into a more serious tone: the characters have grown up considerably after having rubbed shoulders with the common man, so to speak, and having travelled along with them as the reader, one feels almost proud to have shared their eventual fortunes, wisdoms, and insights from the very beginning, when they were so obviously naive, and sheltered from the harsh realities of their society.Dickens excels in his description of the privations and injustices suffered in debtors prisons in England, and the conditional blindness of Lady Justice in the legal system. At this late stage of the novel I was entirely captivated. This high gear kicks in during the final quarter, and is a somewhat unexpected turn of events from the preceding humorous and light-hearted, almost anecdotal, course of the serialized novel.Dickens paints a fascinating picture of travelling by horse-drawn coaches in England, and the descriptions of the famous pubs (public houses) that served as bed-and-board for weary travellers of what can only be a very early public transport system, are historically accurate and entirely fascinating.Chapter ten is rather important because that is when the singular character of Sam Weller is introduced. Sam becomes a companion man-servant and general odds-body to Pickwick and his companions, partly, one feels, out of pity, because the street-wise Sam realizes what easy targets Pickwick et al are for local conmen and free-loaders.The growing companionship of Pickwick and the ever-loyal Sam is a memorable moment in literature and provides the backbone to the rest of the novel, and a very fine ending to everything. I was very much reminded of Frodo and Sam in Lord Of The Rings, in fact.I cannot recommend this book enough. I only gave it four stars instead of five in the certain hope that Dickens wrote even better novels, which I will have to rate higher. If reading classical literature seems daunting to you, I have this advice: if you can make it past chapter one, then you only have to stick to it until chapter ten, when you will meet Sam Weller. From then on, the next milestone is the debtors prison part, where things get rather more serious, and the seemingly disparate novel draws powerfully and emotionally together. Dickens is a satirical genius, and he takes the mickey out of Victorian society and class bluster with skill that beggars description.This is one for sentimental intellectuals, and lovers of language. An entirely brilliant d&eacute;but novel. I find the fact that it was originally serialized great fun, because each chapter is a far more meaty and satisfying read than most modern novels, where chapters are not that episodic. Reading Dickens is more like watching a television series, than a movie."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Pickwick Papers is a wonderful book, and no doubt much has been written about it in academic and literary circles. But from a layman's perspective, it is simply a fun read. One would almost think it the work of a great master approaching the end of a career, consciously deciding to lay down the heartache of Great Expectations or the martyrdom of A Tale of Two Cities to take a jovial and whimsical jaunt through the English language and the realm of imagination. Yet the bumbling and somehow delightful misadventures of the Pickwickians fall at the beginning of Dickens' career. Comic relief is offered well before Hard Times sets in.Take an independently wealthy, magnanimous old fellow and surround him with a group of close friends. Send them together on a journey of desire to explore the world about them, meet new people, and experience the fullness of life, and you essentially have the plot of Pickwick Papers. The plethora of characters Dickens introduces along the way add considerable color to the narrative, not only because they come from such a vast array of backgrounds, but because they themselves are colorful in their own right:The first and most obvious example might be that of Mr. Alfred Jingle, the loquacious vagabond rapscallion who rescues the Pickwickians from an altercation with a feisty coach driver. One of Mr. Pickwicks cohorts, Mr. Snodgrass, receives a blow to the eye during the incident, after which Mr. Jingle is pleased to suggest the most efficacious remedies: \\"Glasses round-brandy and water, hot and strong, and sweet, and plenty-eye damaged, sir? Waiter! Raw beef-steak for the gentleman's eye-nothing like raw beef-steak for a bruise, sir; cold lamp-post very good, but lamp-post inconvenient-damned odd, standing in the open street half an hour with your eye against a lamp-post-eh-very good-ha! ha!\\" While Pickwick reads the legend of Prince Bladud by candlelight, we find this description of King Hudibras: \\"A great many centuries since, there flourished, in great state, the famous and renowned Lud Hudibras, king of Britain. He was a mighty monarch. The earth shook when he walked-he was so very stout. His people basked in the light of his countenance-it was so red and glowing. He was, indeed, every inch a king. And there were a good many inches of him too, for although he was not very tall, he was a remarkable size round, and the inches that he wanted in height he made up in circumference.\\" The young surgeon, Benjamin Allen, is described as \\"a coarse, stout, thick-set young man, with black hair cut rather short and a white face cut rather long [...] He presented altogether, rather a mildewy appearance, and emitted a fragrant odour of full-flavoured Cubas.\\" Dickens notes that the casual visitor to the Insolvent Court \\"might suppose this place to be a temple dedicated to the Genius of Seediness\\" and whose vapors are \\"like those of a fungus pit.\\" Seated in this luxuriant ambience, we find an attorney, Mr. Solomon Pell, who \\"was a fat, flabby pale man, in a surtout which looked green one minute and brown the next, with a velvet collar of the same chameleon tints. His forehead was narrow, his face wide, his head large, and his nose all on one side, as if Nature, indignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth, had given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered.\\" A final sample from a list of worthy characters too long to mention might be Mr. Smangle, the boisterous whiskered man whom Pickwick encounters in debtors prison: \\"This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places; they may be met with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about the stable-yards and public-houses; but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot-beds, which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them [...] There was a rakish vagabond smartness and a kind of boastful rascality about the whole man that was worth a mine of gold.\\"The book itself is a goldmine full of textures, personas, venues, and idiosyncrasies of a bygone age. These are delight to behold, as the reader is thus invited to enjoy experience and descriptive beauty for their own sakes. Plot largely takes a backseat to the development of relationships, which can be seen as a myriad of subplots contributing to a never-ending story. Numerous vignettes which are incidental to the narrative add another level of richness, and it seems clear that Dickens offers them for an enjoyment all their own. There is something of \\"l'art pour l'art\\" throughout the whole work which expresses a love of language and a love of human nature. As Dickens might have summed it up, \\"All this was very snug and pleasant.\\""},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Having never read any Dickens before - and unaware this was his maiden effort - I was hooked from the first few pages. The benevolent Mr. Pickwick, with his faithful sidekicks, experiences Victorian England as a well-to-do citizen. While the bulk of this novel deals with the &quot;softer&quot; side of society, the hard-edged aspects of the era are nonetheless acknowledged. With memorable characters, marvelous misadventures, subtle comedic touches, and an occasional suprise around the corner, this novel holds it's own as a &quot;classic.&quot; My only &quot;Pickwick&quot; regret was waiting this long (24 yrs. old) to read it. This book will undoubtedly serve as a springboard for ALL of Charles Dickens' works."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Joyousness saturates this book. In a spare moment, you can grab it, read a page or two, and your whole day feels brighter. Slapstick comedy and wordplay and satire abound -- it's as if Dickens's chest must have been bursting with a thousand jokes, and this book gave him the opportunity. You come away feeling as if you'd spent a week in the country among friends, laughing."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Pickwick and his entourage fumble their way through 18th century England.. it's a long book that sometimes seems longer because of the density of Dickens' prose. But it's also surprisingly fun and funny; you get to know the characters through their actions and the incidents they put in play."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Good read so far. Can't wait to read next one as soon as it comes next week. So far I only have 2 parts of serial. What a great Idea to republish it the way it was intented tobe."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This is, of course, a classic work, one of Dickens earlier works. It's about a group of five friends led by Samuel Pickwick, who go on a series of adventures to various cities and towns around London. The book is very funny (sometimes laugh out loud funny) but at the same time Dickens uses the traveler's stories and misadventures to show our common faults (vanities, fear of embarrassment, pride, anger) in a, sometimes caustic, but generally gentle, ad always very humorous way."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This book is totally different from any other \\"Dickens\\" that I have read, extremely hilarious in places. I wish that I'd read it years ago!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens has produced a humorous story about some very interesting characters. He has cleverly revealed the disgusting conditions of the prison system for debtors and a corrupt and lax legal system without interfering with the continuity of the story. His characters are well defined, with Mr. Pickwick showing a complete ignorance of the lives of the ordinary folk, while still showing a compassion for the less privileged. An excellent story about social conditions in England, told in an interesting and light-hearted manner. Amazon has produced an a very readable copy of this classic."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"You can't go wrong with Charles Dickens and this free Kindle version makes it even easier to read. Really funny story with characters who still inhabit our world today."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens is hilarious! This is a comical look at high and low society in England in the 1850's. You might recognize some of these characters - they could be your relatives, friends, neighbors - people are still the same. Reading the book on Kindle made it easy to check meanings of words like hosteler, portmanteau, trundle, and vicarage. Follow the wacky adventures of the Pickwickians as they travel through England, managing to live well without doing a lick of work."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens is simply one of the world's greatest minds of all time, and certainly one of the most brilliant writers and storytellers. And the Pickwick Papers was his first novel, a genius burst of sheer joyous imagination and exploration, written when he was just 24, What more is there to say?Actually, I want to keep talking about it, so ignore that rhetorical question. :) The Pickwick Papers is unlike any book I've ever read before - so irreverently happy, wandering and digressing as it pleases, but always maintaining a delightful, heartwarming sense of goodwill and hilarity. Dickens is SO funny. People think he's boring and heady and stuffy, but he's downright hysterical.I've seen a lot of other reviews that provide better summaries than I could write, so I won't go into that. I'll be content with finishing up by saying how much I absolutely adore Sam Weller. If he were a real person, I'd make him be my friend forever and always. We would go on adventures and it would be amazing. Why aren't there any guys like him in high school??"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The Pickwick Papers is an old classic that I read 65 years ago and enjoyed it at the time. however I have forgotten most of the story and wanted to reread it.

Being appreciative, I have looked for other items at Amazon."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I read this novel in the complete Dickens, but am reviewing the novel alone.It's the first novel by Charles Dickens. It's not as mature, accomplished and serious as the later novels which we were assigned to read in some English class.It tells stories about a retired businessman named Pickwick who has a club devoted to him, though we're never told why or what it does, and Dickens abandons the club very early on. Instead, several members, young friends of Pickwick's, go on various travels and adventures with him.He tells the story as the Author as God, making a lot of observations on the foibles, arrogance and hypocrisies of people, which Dickens had a good eye for.The story itself is not strongly plotted. Things just happen one after the other.There's also a lot of satire, especially directed at lawyers. Don't think hating lawyers is anything new! Dickens obviously didn't like them either.Approach this with a light heart, enjoying the look back at people and their problems in the period without expecting great literature."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"For some reason, all the songs in the book are missing from this free Kindle book.

It is at once funny and blue, cartoonish and a crisp satire of government processes, universal and an in depth look at real humans in a real 19th century world."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This is a light-hearted collage of poems and stories collected as well as a narrative of the adventures and travels of the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club. It is a look at the Edwardian world through the eyes of a group of traveling gentlemen. These men consistently apply the standards and protocols of their own culture to individuals of other cultures, with entertaining results. A fun look back."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I didn't finish it.

The Pickwick Papers is classic Dickens at its' very best, and now it's available at my fingertips."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I loved reading the Pickwick Papers alternately between my Kindle and Smart Phone. I really liked how Kindle can find the last page read on either device!! It was beautifully transcribed; the illustrations were great. Another reason to use the Kindle is that when reading a long book with lots of characters, if I happen to forget who did what with whom and when, I can \\"search\\" for the character in the book and read all the references to him/her and refresh my memory in a hurry. Good for someone who reads a lot and sometimes forgets not to SPEED read. Dickens is too delicious to speed read, anyway."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"All of Dickens' books display elements of humour but often intermixed with drama and tragedy. Pickwick stands alone (I think) as a wholly comic masterpiece. As Mr Pickwick and his friends travel round England to make reports back to The Pickwick Club, Dickens introduces us to a huge cast of characters from the cryptic Mr Jingle to that great philosopher of the people Sam Weller.As we journey along, Dickens satirises almost every aspect of society - class, marriage, politics, the law - all themes which he plays out again in more serious terms in his later works. There are laugh out loud moments aplenty but as always Dickens' observations are insightful and thought provoking too. I particularly enjoy the election campaign - much of the absurdity of it still resonates today.The Nonesuch editions are a joy to possess. Such great writing deserves a quality production and the look and feel of these books is lovely. The large pages mean that the original illustrations can be seen in all their detailed glory, and Nonesuch also include all the introductions written for the various editions. And of course a built-in ribbon bookmark - already I'm halfway back to a more leisurely and cultured time.I've always hankered after a complete set of leather-bound Dickens and when I win the lottery will no doubt acquire one. But in the meantime, Nonesuch are providing a quality experience at an affordable price and, much though I love my Kindle, sometimes reading a well-produced hardback is the only way to go. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"What can one say about a classic like The pickwick papers by Charles Dickens? Read it and his other books. The man could write about a range of topics from sad to happy to just fun!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The book seems great, but the whole reason I ordered it was to refer to the maps and notes - plenty of notes are there, and there is an enormous legend for the map, but no actual map in the Kindle anywhere. So half of your reference material just isn't there if that's what you got it for, as, 150 years after being published, that's most of what distinguishes a new edition like this.

One of Charles Dickens best works. It should be read in public and private class rooms."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Charles Dickens' book The Pickwick Papers is a delightful read. It follows the main character Pickwick along with his trusty servant Sam Weller as they encounter one problem after another. Pickwick looks for trouble and gets a lot of it. He is a bachelor although he flirts with women quite a bit. Pickwick is an example of how person can be happy by refusing to let his problems get him down.The novel has an accurate depiction of how intellectual debates are waged. Pickwick is unemployed and he spends his time finding out things such as the source of a stream. The part where he finds an inscription is very exciting.The villains of the story are the lawyers Dodson and Fogg and they show that people can profit by the misery of others.The Pickwick Papers kept my interest. There are both happy and sad parts of the book and the sad parts aren't all that sad. It provides an interesting depiction of life in 19th century England."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens achieves in THE PICKWICK PAPERS a creation that defines the very heights of genius. It's not only Pickwick and Sam Weller who will remain with you as hearty companions long after you put this book down, but a host of other characters. As an example, the following excerpt from G. K. Chesterton's review of THE PICKWICK PAPERS will do more than I can ever say to whet your appetite ---From G. K. Chesterton's review of THE PICKWICK PAPERS:&lt;&lt;The sincerity of this study of Sam Weller has produced one particular effect in the book which I wonder that critics of Dickens have never noticed or discussed. Because it has no Dickens \\"pathos,\\" certain parts of it are truly pathetic. Dickens, realising rightly that the whole tone of the book was fun, felt that he ought to keep out of it any great experiments in sadness and keep within limits those that he put in. He used this restraint in order not to spoil the humour; but (if he had known himself better) he might well have used it in order not to spoil the pathos. This is the one book in which Dickens was, as it were, forced to trample down his tender feelings; and for that very reason it is the one book where all the tenderness there is is quite unquestionably true. An admirable example of what I mean may be found in the scene in which Sam Weller goes down to see his bereaved father after the death of his step-mother. The most loyal admirer of Dickens can hardly prevent himself from giving a slight shudder when he thinks of what Dickens might have made of that scene in some of his more expansive and maudlin moments. For all I know old Mrs. Weller might have asked what the wild waves were saying; and for all I know old Mr. Weller might have told her. As it is, Dickens, being forced to keep the tale taut and humorous, gives a picture of humble respect and decency which is manly, dignified, and really sad. There is no attempt made by these simple and honest men, the father and son, to pretend that the dead woman was anything greatly other than she was; their respect is for death, and for the human weakness and mystery which it must finally cover. Old Tony Weller does not tell his shrewish wife that she is already a white-winged angel; he speaks to her with an admirable good nature and good sense:\\"'Susan,' I says, 'you've been a wery good vife to me altogether: keep a good heart, my dear, and you '11 live to see me punch that 'ere Stiggins's 'ead yet.' She smiled at this, Samivel . . . but she died arter all.\\"That is perhaps the first and the last time that Dickens ever touched the extreme dignity of pathos. He is restraining his compassion, and afterwards he let it go. Now laughter is a thing that can be let go; laughter has in it a quality of liberty. But sorrow has in it by its very nature a quality of confinement; pathos by its very nature fights with itself. Humour is expansive; it bursts outwards; the fact is attested by the common expression, \\"holding one's sides.\\" But sorrow is not expansive; and it was afterwards the mistake of Dickens that he tried to make it expansive. It is the one great weakness of Dickens as a great writer, that he did try to make that sudden sadness, that abrupt pity, which we call pathos, a thing quite obvious, infectious, public, as if it were journalism or the measles. It is pleasant to think that in this supreme masterpiece, done in the dawn of his career, there is not even this faint fleck upon the sun of his just splendour. Pickwick will always be remembered as the great example of everything that made Dickens great; of the solemn conviviality of great friendships, of the erratic adventures of old English roads, of the hospitality of old English inns, of the great fundamental kindliness and honour of old English manners. First of all, however, it will always be remembered for its laughter, or, if you will, for its folly. A good joke is the one ultimate and sacred thing which cannot be criticised. Our relations with a good joke are direct and even divine relations. We speak of \\"seeing\\" a joke just as we speak of \\"seeing\\" a ghost or a vision. If we have seen it, it is futile to argue with us; and we have seen the vision of Pickwick. Pickwick may be the top of Dickens's humour; I think upon the whole it is. But the broad humour of Pickwick he broadened over many wonderful kingdoms; the narrow pathos of Pickwick he never found again.>>"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This is Dickens first work , and one of his most comical. His depiction of what for him is a typically eccentric gathering of English characters is satirically brilliant and warmly comic at once. This is the stage where Dickens seems to have warmth for a good share of his characters, and even the ridicule does not seem as bitter as it will later on become. I could not really follow the plot if there is one but recommend reading this in whatever pages the reader happens to find himself enjoying."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Having known Scofield chiefly for his terrifying performance as King Lear in the Peter Brook film, it was a pleasant surprise to hear his mastery of comedy in this utterly delightful recording of excerpts from &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. (Although the broad outline of the plot is here from beginning to end, far too much material has been omitted to call it a simple abridgement.) Employing a full spectrum of tones and accents, he brings Dickens' colorful gallery of characters to vivid life. An outstanding audio presentation!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Although at first I found it difficult to get into this book, mainly due to the old English, once I got past the first few pages, I was captured. This is a very delightful read. Wonderful story telling! Anxiously await receipt of each new episode."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I LOVE Dickens's novels. And this is no exception, BUT it is too verbose. It took me a few months to get through the entire book. Sometimes, I would think I'd just quit reading it, but I wanted resolution. So, I plowed through to the end. I really like Dickens' characters, his writing, his humor. So, while I recommend this book, I do so with cautions. It's long; it tends to bog down. It could have done with about 20 fewer chapters.I try to figure out what it is about Dickens that I like so much. Truthfully, I haven't found a modern author to compare to him. He's so good with words, descriptions, humor and creating memorable characters that just jump off the page.Sam Weller and his father are just delightful in this book. Pickwick, also, is very memorable.So, if you enjoy Dickens and you have a month with nothing else to do, pick Pickwick and the Pickwickians."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I have read all of Dickens' novels and found them all to be wonderful. But if I have to recommend a starter Dickens novel to anyone I would definitely choose The Pickwick Papers. There is nothing more enjoyable and it is no wonder that this, his first novel, was an immediate hit. The diverse characters and stories, the humor, the keen observations of humanity, and how everything comes together towards the end are all incomparable characteristics of a Dickens novel. But don't read Dickens like you would read a spy novel. Take time to savor the brilliant prose and the beauty of the English language."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"I just finished my second reading of it.I really cannot add much to the great reviews already written. I've always loved Dickens' way with words, and this book is a treasure in that department. The English, the Era, the characters, the countryside.... it got to the point where I couldn't wait for the evening to come so I could continue reading.This also seems to me to be an important \\"cornerstone book\\" for other great English literature. The theme (though just a seed) for Scrooge in A Christmas Carol begins here, in a story called The Goblin Who Stole a Sexton, a story related during one of Pickwick's Christmastime visits to a friend in the country. When reading The Wind in the Willows or Tolkien's works, I cannot escape the feeling that they were also influenced by the charm, the sense of humor (okay, humour), duty to friends, and the simple but most important things in life which Dickens so impressively describes.The only negative thing is that I discovered that it had an effect on me which made me wish that I was free from the drudgery of daily work, was retired (with ample monetary means, of course, like Pickwick himself), and could devote the remainder of my life to similar ramblings, adventures, and pursuits.An excellent book."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens' first novel, THE PICKWICK PAPERS, is as long and meandering as the Amazon River. But as with a trip up the Amazon, THE PICKWICK PAPERS will most likely leave you simultaneously weary to the bone, unprecedentedly enthused, and certain in some indefinable way that you'll always be richer for the experience.The non-plot involves a strung together series of misadventures and humanistic serio-comic sketches of Mr. Pickwick, an aging but still vital retiree, and the young men who form the Pickwick Club, a sort of informal gentleman's club that wonders around England, getting its members in one improbable fix after another. Everyone should be so lucky as to have a Mr. Pickwick in their lives: an uncomplicatedly giving, decent, larger than life father figure who radiates bands of human warmth like a sun in evening clothes. It's an obvious pleasure for the Pickwickians to orbit around their benefactor and follow him wherever his undiminished sense of adventure leads.THE PICKWICK PAPERS is an extremely satisfying read--in many way despite itself. It doesn't really go anywhere, and it doesn't presume to critique the human condition in a profound manner, but the sheer looseness and easy-goingness of it all proves itself in many places unexpectedly transcendent. Probably the best parts of the PICKWICK PAPERS are those that detail the friendship between the aging Mr. Pickwick and the his protege, Sam Weller, a young world-weary up-start who spits out pithy, telling one-liners like a roomful of Woody Allen imposters trying to prove who's the real deal.Sometimes the most satisfying art is the kind that takes you by the hand and walks you down this way a little ways and over that way some, and doesn't lead on that you're going anywhere or doing much of anything important, and leaves you sort of surprised by the depth of the experience you've just had."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Pickwick papers must rate as one of the greatest literary works in English. The sheer numbers of characters woven into the storyline and how well they mesh together is incredible. Pickwick and Sam Weller must rank among the top literary characters in English literature."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Great fun. Dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper).

I am very disappointed by the quality of the binding. The Pickwick Papers (one of my favorites of Dickens' works) is a heavy tome, but the previous Nonesuch editions had superior binding. Not so the case with this edition - on the outside, the binding looks and feels the same as the previous editions, but when I examined the bindings on the inside, I discovered to my horror that the paper had been glued in a careless manner and the top of the binding was clearly separated from the spine! This is simply unacceptable! The price for this book does not match the inferior quality of the binding. I read another review with the same complaint so I am not sure it is going to do me any good if I choose to return it.I discovered (surprise, surprise) that the 2008 Nonesuch Dickens' were printed and bound in Thailand, but this 2011 edition is printed and bound in China! Perhaps this might explain the difference in quality? The paper quality of the 2008 editions is also superior, the paper feeling smooth and thicker. This 2011 edition has pages that feel like cheaper quality paper, and much thinner. The illustrations are also not as clearly defined and appear lighter than the 2008 editions.Overall, I am very disappointed in this 2011 Nonesuch Dickens' edition and am only keeping it so as to complete my collection."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"In the chronology of novels \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" is Dickens' first, a debut effort that won him such acclaim and success he was able to devote the rest of his life to writing and literature. Readers of Dickens most likely began their experience with novels like \\"Great Expectations\\" or \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" as did I; the majority, I'm sure, never read his novels in sequence. If this is the case, then \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" is sure to surprise the reader, for the novel is quite unlike any of his others.The novel tells the story of Samuel Pickwick, \\"General Chairman\\" of the Pickwick Society and the associate adventures of three selected Pickwickians as they adventure afield in the interests of \\"science.\\" Mr. Pickwick, a portly, middle-aged epicurean and retired gentleman of independent means (\\"...I have more money than I can ever need; far more than a man at my age can ever live to spend...\\"), has been designated by the Vice President of the Pickwick Association to apply his acute powers of observation to the broader scope of English society. Apparently Pickwick's reputation precedes him as the reader is in the dark as to why the head Pickwickian is assigned superlatives like \\"good, great, noble.\\" Only through the Great Pickwick's interactions with his fellow countrymen, regardless of class or situation, as well as the devotion shown him by his fellow Pickwickians, does the reader come to understand how these adjectives apply.Thus is formed the \\"Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club.\\" Pickwick and his two young wards, Mr. Augustus Snodgrass and Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, and devotee Mr. Tracy Tupman embark on their assignment the day after their adjunct society is established. What follows is a series of picaresque adventures, none of which are of particular interest, some just plain silly; all intended to reveal certain foibles of English society or society in general. In addition to a variety of merry mix-ups, the Pickwickians are swept into the good graces of the Wardle family and their country estate Manor Farm at Dingley Dell where they are periodically feted and entertained. Pickwick's magananimous nature leads him to befriend the swindler Alfred Jingle who preys on women of means. Jingle absconds with Rachel Wardle, the spinster sister of Old Wardle, and Pickwick is swept along with his host to intercept the two before they tie the knot.The Pickwickians' travels take them to Eatansville to report on village politics, their divisive nature, and the two rival newspapers that each champion its favorite son; they take the waters at Bath where they observe the \\"swells\\" taking the cure; on to Ipswich where the unimpeachable Pickwick, lost in an inn's labyrinth of rooms, mistakes his own for one already housed by a \\"middle-aged woman in yellow curl-papers\\"; then in and out of Fleet debtor's prison; and finally playing a role in the romantic entanglement of Mr. Winkle and one Arabella Allen.As if all this gadding about isn't dizzying enough, each escapade is likely to be interrupted by some character's launching into an exptemporaneous (and extraneous) tale; many of which are dull; many which involve dreams and supernatural intervention. The most noteworthy of these is \\"The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton\\" to which Dickens devotes an entire chapter. Chapter 29 relates the tale of a misanthropic, curmudgeonly sexton who spurns the gaiety of Christmas Eve and goes to the churchyard to dig a grave instead. Any reader of Dickens will immediately note the gleam in the author's eye that will later become \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"Pickwick is ensnared by his landlady Mrs. Bardell (who seeks the security of a \\"man of means\\"), sued for \\"breach of promise,\\" faced with a judgment of 750 pounds, and rather than pay a single pence to the designing woman and her rapacious lawyers Dodson and Fogg, the principled gentleman decides on debtors' prison instead. Dickens uses Pickwick as his vehicle for the debtors' prison culture of Fleet Prison, setting the stage for his later novel \\"Little Dorrit,\\" the story of Willaim Dorrit and daughter Amy imprisoned in the Marshalsea debtors' prison.The novel's erratic storyline improves with the appearance of the character Samuel Weller. Weller (\\"that's 'Veller with a 'We\\"), a cockney lad whose job it is to keep track of and clean travelers' boots, makes a favorable impression on Pickwick. A good judge of character (except for the weasling Jingle), Mr. Pickwick notes the young man's potential and makes Sam his personal servant. Young Weller is a clever fellow with a glib--although cockney--tongue and a penchant for speaking in quaint analogies. (\\"It's a great deal more in your way than mine as the gen'lm'n on the right side of the garden vall said to the man on the wrong 'un, ven the mad bull wos comin' up the lane.\\") Weller apparently acquired this trait from Mr. Tony Weller, his father, whose appearance in the story and reunion with son \\"Sammy\\" lend additional humor to the Pickwickian saga. Weller Sr. has a weakness for widows, marries one who joins an evangelical movement. Step-mother tries to sweep her husband into the fold, making Tony's life miserable in the attempt, causing his great aversion to matrimoney in general and widows in particular. Young Weller proves to be a loyal, invaluable servant to Pickwick who because of his master's philanthropy the young man believes to be \\"...a reg'lar thorobred-angel.\\" Sam's devotion is so deep he persuades Weller Sr. to make him a loan on which he purposely defaults so he will be sent to Fleet Prison where he can continue to serve his \\"Angel.\\" Both Wellers add life and color to the story, and their delightful characters do much to enhance a storyline that is at times pedestrian.Dickens' fans will note in this first novel the author's concerns with the foibles and shortcomings of the society and culture of his time which in his later works provide the novelist with ample material for satire and social criticism. The novel concludes when Pickwick dissolves the adjunct society. The author adds an epilogue; all the principals are given their due--all except Rachel Wardle, the hoodwinked and spurned spinster sister of the Honorable Wardle, lord of Manor Farm. She never surfaces again, but when an author juggles 104 characters in the space of 875 pages, a character or two is bound to fall through the cracks. (The Bantam Classic 2006 reissue of \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" includes prefatory material by the author and a most helpful cast of characters in alphabetical order. Unfortunately this edition lacks the wonderful artwork of \\"Phiz.\\")"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club or the The Pickwick Papers - Dickens' first novel - was published in 1837 when the author was just 25 years old and set the pattern for this great author's later work. The novel was initially serialized, published over 20 months, between April 1836 and November 1837 - readers buying each of the 19 monthly installments - Dickens missed a deadline - before it was released in \\"book form\\" - all 800+ pages of it. And right from the start Dickens' work was immensely popular.The book is a loosely connected set of adventures starring Samuel Pickwick - a genial, somewhat bumbling, rotund, middle-aged man and President of his social \\"club\\" - and his three traveling companions - Nathaniel Winkle, Augustus Snodgrass and Tracy Tupman - just the names are pure Dickens and a foreshadow of the characters to come from his imagination. Our four heroes leave the environs of London for the countryside, chronicling their travels to be shared with the club in the hopes of \\"educating\\" its members on life outside the city.Along the way our travelers find friends, enemies, trouble and happiness. They meet a farmer, Mr. Wardle, a gracious host who rescues the four city dwellers on several occasions when they find themselves in over their urban heads. Mr. Pickwick picks up and hires a valet, Sam Weller, who is \\"street-wise\\" and keeps an eye out for his master and his companions. In the not so distant background lurks the nefarious Alfred Jingle, a con-man extraordinaire, who haunts the Pickwickians from one locale to another, as they make their trip. Pickwick also becomes the target of a law-suit - Dickens portraying the legal professionals involved in a typically not so flattering light. And to keep their spirits up our traveling fab four nomads consume a copious amount of cocktails along the way.The Pickwick Papers is a somewhat neglected or forgotten work with folks reading the later and better known Dickens classics - which is unfortunate. For a debut novel it is highly polished and very entertaining - although describing it as \\"mad-cap\\" fun might be pushing it - and the novel features all the character development, story-telling and humor one expects from Charles Dickens. This is a \\"big\\" novel - not something read over a weekend - and I understand that Dickens isn't everyone's cup of literary tea, but if you're looking for a change of pace and little reading excursion - the adventures of the Pickwickian crew is highly entertaining."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens is one of my absolute favorite reads. His quirk and humor, interesting characters, and engaging writing are all wonderful.This copy of his story is a cute, solid little book, with gold gilded paper edges (Which makes us all feel quite happy and kinda important, doesn't it?). It also has some of those woodcut illistrations that give any book a kind of old, classic feeling (in a good way). It is, however, about 2/3rds the hight of what I'd call the average book, with a font size to match. It doesn't bother me, but it others might wish it larger.

Although the characters are not as well developed as other works it does fit the book. It suits because it is not as serious of a work as other books. This, to me, shows where Dickens was in his own life. He was young and jovial where as when he gets older he gets darker because his view on life does.

All the characters are completely two-dimensional, if not one-dimenional: they lack development and in no way resemble real people with real emotions, desires, fears, etc - they are mere caricatures. Worse, the plotline wanders aimlessly. Certain passages do evoke chuckles, but the great majority of the writing is lifeless and indeed boring.This is the work of a very young Dickens, and it shows. At this point in his life, his writing skills had simply not yet evolved very far. The 700+ page novel is simply undistunguised and totally forgettable. I would HIGHLY recommend any of Dickens' more famous works (most notably Great Expectations), but this one is a waste of time. Do not let others lead you astray."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Celebrate the day that Naxos decided to delve into audiobooks. Anton Lesser's reading of Charles Dickens' uproarious PICKWICK PAPERS is a triumph. One wonders how so many voices can come out of one man's pipes short of possession by the spirits of Snodgrass, Tuchman, and Pickwick themselves.For those new to this bit of Dickens' scribblings, Pickwick and his Pickwick Club are delicious characters that allow the author to take the mickey (affectionately) out of every aspect of Victorian English pomp. The stories of their adventures are Quijotesque without half the drama. One grows to love them, even to cheer for them, as they totter on their way from one near miss to another accidental triumph to, alas, happiness and retirement in the end.PICKWICK is a great place to start, for readers who want to know Dickens for the first time. It is arguably his lightest and most accessible work.Anton Lesser is something close to immortal. Naxos is to be thanked.Yet Dickens stands at the beginning and end of it all, one of the English language's truly great writers."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"It is interesting that both William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens began their writing careers with a comedy. Charles Dickens is best known for his harsh portrayals of Victorian England (especially in \\"A Christmas Carol\\"). But this 1st book shows that he can draw hilarious comedy as well. We meet the Pickwick Club. (Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Tupman, and Mr. Winkle.) They are a bumbling group, but they are benevolent. Undoubtedly, Mr. Pickwick was based on Charles Dickens's father. The great Charles Dickens's father was a warm hearted and caring man, but he was also unlucky. He did in fact spend time in the debtors's prison. Well, moving on, the Pickwick club meets the comical villain Mr. Jingle. Mr. Jingle gets the Pickwick club into various sorts of trouble. He stops a would be wedding between Mr. Tupman and Rachael Wardle. (Jingle himself wants Rachael's fortune.) Well, Jingle shows himself to be good at double talk and alienates the 2. While his plot fails, he tricks Pickwick into appearing in a girls' school after hours. You'll probably notice that this book (like \\"Moby Dick\\") is full of digressions. We hear unrelated tales from different characters. (To some, this is a welcome technique while others find it annoying. Though the tale of Gabriel Grub does foreshadow the phenomenal \\"Christmas Carol.\\") Moving on, in a well worded passage Mr. Pickwick leads his landlady Widow Bardell into thinking he wants to marry her, when in fact he was just considering hiring a man servant. And of course Mr. Pickwick goes on trial for not keeping a promise of marriage. (Charles Dickens himself actually did many live readings of this chapter.) While we know Mr. Pickwick is not guilty, he ends up being charged 750 pounds which he refuses to pay. And of course, he (like Charles Dickens's father goes to prison). While he can afford the money, he refuses to pay because he is innocent. The scenes of the prison break the comedy. Even Widow Bardell is thrown in prison by Dodson and Fogg. But all is not lost. Pickwick's servant Weller comes to his aid. And Mr. Pickwick realizes that he must leave prison to help Mr. Winkle. (Mr. Winkle has married Arabella, and her brother is not so happy about it.) Mr. Pickwick pays what he must to exit the prison and he of course comes to the aid of his friend Mr. Winkle. The story ends in utter happiness. Mr. Pickwick even forgives Mr. Jingle. Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is that it is NOT ONLY hilarious comedy, but it shows how true friends stick by one another, and it even takes it to the next level by showing the wonders of fogiveness. This book drove England Pickwick mad when it came out. (There were Pickwick coats, hats, cigars, candy, and canes.) Need we ask why?"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"If your only experience of Charles Dickens involves never-ending readings of Great Expectations or Oliver Twist in high school literature class, then you may be surprised to find that Dickens was a master of wit as well as woe. In The Pickwick Papers all aspects of the amazing talent of Charles Dickens are on display. Through the adventures and ramblings of Samuel Pickwick, Esq. and his companions Messrs. Tupman, Winkle, and Snodgrass, we are given an intimate look at 19th Century England, from her small country towns to the dark heart of London's debtor's prison. The characters and places are vibrant, the story alive with humor and pathos. Continual feasting, fun, and holiday parties with friends share the pages of this story with tales of poverty, abuse, and neglect; all set down by the hand of a master story teller and observer of human nature."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Immense in size, this early Dickens novel is just as large in providing pleasurable reading; I didn't want it to end. Dickens published it in 1837 when he was 25 years old; impressive. His range of characters, episodic plot, lively dialogue, humorous situations, never lags. Although not as weighty as that other great laughing satire, Don Quixote, Pickwick is in the same genre and should be read as a thematic companion to that great Spanish novel.Dickens loves the tale, I mean, telling the tale; it is all in the storytelling. Although it never dips into philosophy, science, morality, politics, or other pithy topics, Dicken's vast canvas ranges over the quixotic turns that happen in life. Pickwick, the title character, is completely lovable in his formality, politeness, and cordiality, making him a perrenially memorable character.Read this novel, friends, and give it to your friends who love to read. Or to anyone who loves the rich tapestry of mature storytelling, Dickens-style. This was the first novel to put him into popularity, and I see why."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This hilarious book tells the outrageous adventures of a cast of characters to remember forever. It's a joyous, humane, and faithful portrait of the British society. It is full of acuteness, irony, tenderness and sarcasm about the human condition. As in all of his books, Dickens reflects his experiences (prison for debts, etc.) in this book which tells the love affairs, countless drunken nights and fights in which the Pickwickians get. Apparently a book whose only purpose is to entertain, it is, like all intelligent humor, a bitter but optimist critique of the human being. The cast of characters is wonderful, and you will be just delighted you picked up this volume.&quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; was the first fictional book by Dickens, and it shows how capable of good humor he was. The title's character is a restless good-spirited man, a Don Quixote with a British touch, whose adventures are less noble and a lot more messy that those of the Don. The story of his friendship with the rest of the crew is hilarious and moving at the same time. Come read the story of this excentric lot, as they drink their way in and out of trouble."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The Oxford edition (edited by Kinsely) of Pickwick only reprints a few of the illustrations (Kinsley is turning in his grave!). The illustrations to this novel are half the point of it. Buy the Penguin or another, fully illustrated edition instead."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The characters in the novel which is Dickens' first are truly unforgettable. Taking into consideration the fact that he was just 24 when he started working on this book, it is clear that in his later works he shows a maturity but not the sense of humour that he put into this book. Mr. Samuel Pickwick and his man-servant Samuel Weller and the other members of the Pickwick Club make this a compelling read. You are simply struck by Mr. Weller's remarks and I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"In college, I took a Dickens class. We read about a book a week. Needless to say I didn't get around to Bleak House. But I read Pickwick Papers, mainly because I was amazed at how funny it was. Dickens rivals Twain in his biting sarcasm and humor aimed late 19th Century society: The usual cast of slimebags appear; the criminal system, petty thieves, and lawyers, just to name a few.This book is a delight, and not all that laborious. It takes on all the political issues of other books, and leaves you with characters that are very real yet utterly fictitious; and since it was written in serial format originally; one can't wait to find out what happens next to these sheltered, naive, silly aristocratic characters who surely must have influenced Monty Python's Twit of the Year competition. Except Mr. Pickwick; the dignified President of the Pickwick Society. He's a twit, but one with moxy."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"... to wit, I must confess, how yesterday evening I joined that eager portion of the public, whose appetite for Picwickian reminiscence can only be justly satisfied, by the reading of this fine, and glowing volume. So first and foremost, and with this in mind, I can recommend to any person, worldwide, who wishing to discover an older England, an England furbished with a tongue long dead, and characters most alive speaking this tongue, that they depart henceforth, into the reading of these fine, posthumous, papers, now available in fine print, with original illustrations! Onwards my fine fellows, onwards!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This book proves that you don't need organization, theme, or even a plot to write one of the great books of English literature when you're one of the greatest novelists the world has ever known. There are many excellent reasons to read this book, chief among them the fact that even if you only read a few chapters you'll get more pleasure, humor, and great writing than if you read hundreds of pages from other authors.The Pickwick Papers starts out as if the story comes from records taken down from the club itself. This allows Dickens as author to comment as a reader of someone else's chronicles, and accounts for much hilarity in the early goings. Since the book was written in monthly installments, originally intended as comic vignettes to accompany humorous sketches, there is little to connect the early chapters in terms of theme or even coherence.This turns out to be irrelevant, because strung together each chapter becomes a crazy quilt of eccentric activities with implausibly funny situations that bring forth the basic 19th Century English difficulty of being respectable while still trying to have fun. Pickwick's problems, and those of his club members, revolve principally around courting women, getting into scrapes, and drinking...constant, incessant, over-the-top drinking. If The Pickwick Papers bears any resemblance at all to the real life of English gentlemen, they were simply never sober.As the story evolves, Dickens chucks the device of relating these stories from the records of the club and gets down to earnest storytelling in a true narrative. One of the great characters of all time, Sam Weller, makes his appearance and literally carries the rest of the book on his humor, loyalty, philosophy, and pugilistics. If anyone is funnier than Sam, it's his father, Tony Weller.The Pickwick Papers is also rife with the best names, names that match exactly the personality of the person. Dodson & Fogg the lawyers, Winkle the wimpy lover, Jingle the con man, Job Trotter his accomplice, Nathaniel Pipkin the parish clerk, Miss Nupkins the spoiled young lady, the Porkenhams, nemeses of the Nupkins, and of course Lady Tollimglower from the previous century. The names alone are a reader's feast.The story takes Mr. Pickwick through a lawsuit for breach of promise to marry, time spent in debtor's prison, time spent helping his young friends get married, and more or less continuous bouts of drinking. By the end Dickens has revealed his warmth, optimism, and love of happy endings. The ending is as heartwarming as the corpus of the book is rollicking and funny."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens is in a slightly more humorous mood in this book than in many of his later writings. He follows the adventures of the \\"remarkable\\" (read: likeable, well-intentioned, generous, rich, naive, and fawned-upon) Mr. Pickwick and several of his companions who go out to observe and write about places and events in other parts of England (for the enlightenment of the rest of the Pickwick club). Their adventures and the stories they collect in the process range from the humorously bumbling to the tragic to the genuinely touching.As usual, Dickens is satirizing away, giving social commentary on useless fops, hypocritical pastors, scummy lawyers, debtors' prisons, etc. The book also has Dickens' trademark rambling style, unlikely coincidences, and silly names, but as always, the characters are so entertaining that it is a pleasure to read. The slightly pompous Pickwick and his bordering-on-sycophantic friends are somehow endearing rather than annoying, the ridiculous side-characters remind you of people you have known, and the downfall of one of the \\"bad guys\\" is pitiable and moving rather than a cause for rejoicing. Classic Dickens...good stuff!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"You can certainly read this Dickens classic without the additional notes, maps and appendices, but your understanding and enjoyment will be somewhat diminished. Penquin Classics does an excellent job of helping the reader appreciate the language and the context of the era. The maps are particularly helpful when attempting to visualize the travels of this extraordinary touring group in their many adventures throughout the English countryside. An excellent edition of a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"How could Dickens have written this book--so wise, balanced, informed, witty, tender, loving, and intelligent--at such a young age? I'm glad to have finally gotten around to reading it."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"A friend of mine said that she loved the Harry Potter books because they returned her, as an adult, to the mesmerized delight in reading that she felt as a child.That's what The Pickwick Papers did for me. Think of it as a sort of prose nineteenth century Decameron or Canterbury Tales. A group of friends, which make up the Pickwick Society, go traveling the English countryside. Along the way, they experience many adventures, and these adventures are punctuated by the telling of tales, sometimes fabulous, by various characters. And of course, seasoning it all is Dickens' unparalleled eye for the idiosyncratic and ear for dialect.This is a charming and magical book. The fact that it was conjured by a man still in his early twenties makes it all the more astonishing."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This actually happens to be my very favourite Dickens, and that's saying a lot since I love all his work so much. The book is a series of sketches that were published in serial form like so much of Dickens work when he first started publishing. These sketches were written by Dickens as an accompaniment to various caricatures done by a popular artist. The main character in the book is Mr. Pickwick and he is a nave, generous, lovable old gentleman who is the self-appointed head of the Pickwick Club. Dickens characters are truly wonderful in this book and that is why I love it so much. The book is funny and charming. These sketches cover the whole gamut of human emotions, and we see the inevitable Dickens' theories behind them, but that doesn't take away from their charm. I can say with no hesitation that this was the book that I read that really turned me onto Dickens, and after reading this, I had to read the rest of his work. Definitely a \\"desert island\\" book for me."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Allright. Maybe it's not a masterpiece. But it sure is close. Dickens' first novel demonstartes that he was capable of creating hilarious comedy as well as tragic drama. If we do not expose ourselves to Dickens' comical side, we are depriving ourselves of a major aspect of Dickens. Characters such as Winkle, Weller, and Pickwick are very memorable. To this day, I have not forgotten the scene where Mr. Pickwick refuses to pay what the court fined him! The touching friendship between Weller and Pickwick is a memorable landmark in Dickens' writing. This novel demonstrates that Dickens was full of magnificent talent even as he wrote his first novel."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"Charles Dickens is by far among my most favorite writers. The Pickwick Papers was such wonderful light humor and a rollicking adventure, that I never wanted to put it down. Every page, every chapter, brought these wonderful characters into a whole new unique set of adventures! I highly recommend anyone who enjoys Dickens to not miss this one, as although it is an early work, it shows the wonderful humorous side of the author that you will not quite see in some of his later works. These characters became like good friends by the time I was done with the book. A true joy to read."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"The Pickwick Papers, (or rather The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club) although not Dickens' best work, is still a wondeful novel. The writing isn't as consistently good as it is in his later novels, but none of the writing is bad, and there are several flashes of brilliance which seem to herald what Dickens' would become when his genius had time to ripen (one of these can be found at the end of chapter 44, a beautifully written account of the death of a prisoner in a debtor's prison). In the beginning, despite being very funny, the novel, and indeed Mr. Pickwick, may seem rather inane. Keep reading. The story of Mr. Pickwick's trial and eventual imprisonment is one of the most brilliant pieces of comic literature, and Mr. Pickwick grows into a truly monumental character by the end. And Sam Weller, Mr. Pickwick's cockney servant, is one of the best characters in all of Dickens. Clever, witty, and cynical, he seems to light up every page. The book has a very happy ending, in which all loose ends are tied together and every character gets what he or she deserves. It is truly uplifting. I strongly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens Pickwick Papers","review":"This book is thicker than it is wide with tiny type.

This is a great book to use a starter guide to learning MYSQL or for people who have learned some MYSQL on their own and want a guide and/or resource for learning more intermediate topics.The first thing the author goes into how to get/install/configure MYSQL whether it be on a Windows or UNIX environment. There are some differences between the two setups on the different OS so it's an important first chapter. The next chapter covers how to create a relational database while explaining good design with normalization, relationships (one to many, many to many, etc), understanding what a data model is, and showing some good database examples. Jumping into creating your tables before you understand design theory can be disastrous down the road when you realize you need to re-design your tables which can lead to hours of extra work.Then of the meat of the book (Chapters 5 - 10) goes into explaining the SQL (Structured Query Language) in how to create a table, retrieve data, update, append and delete data. The author spends a good amount of time on the basics of SQL and shows some good examples. After the basics it shoes the MYSQL specific syntax more complex queries and uses working examples for each of them. The author does a great job of going through the syntax first then shows some examples and then goes through using the new syntax in a database project as well.The rest of the book (Chapter 11 - 16) goes into administration tasks such as exporting and copying databases, managing transactions, setting up security and optimizing and performance issues. The final 3 chapters goes into using different web technologies (PHP, ASP.NET and Java) to interact with MYSQL databases and show data on a web page. A very nice change of pace that can prove helpful if you want to get into web development as well.Overall this a great book on MYSQL that really explains the important topics with some great examples."},{"Title":"Beginning MySQL (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"Overall, I love this book, because the authors build your knowledge of databases from the ground up.Before I got my hands on this book, I knew only a limited amount about databases.

This makes MySql easy to learn since you can reference the definitions as a cheat sheet when you're implementing a database design.One thing that I noticed is that they need more proofreading. Every now and then, you'll encounter a typo or wrong information but this is expected since the authors warned of this in the introduction.Example, page 299: \\"However, bitwise operations support calculations up to 64 buts\\".The best part of the book, is appendix C. It briefly covers MySql 5 but they introduce you to Triggers, Views and Procedures while updating you on MySql new standards. For exmaple, MySql 5 supports foreign keys for all the table engines, not just for INNODB.If you're the type that has a hard time reading documentation online, then I would strongly recommend this book. Otherwise you might be able to learn MySql using Youtube and the MySql homepage.Note: Since this book only covers MySql 4.1, then you'll need to checkout the on-line documentation for changes in the current MySQL."},{"Title":"Beginning MySQL (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I found this book to be very informative, and the authors quite knowledgeable.

I found the book thought provoking and enthralling. Ursu took me on the same head trip that her characters experienced. It was only after finishing that I realized I had felt disjointed and slightly uncomfortable in the places where the characters felt the same and experienced the relief and catharsis that the characters felt at the end. I really felt as if I understood what was happening in their heads, and what happened was well worth experiencing and understanding. Ursu set the stage and played it all out in a manner that was (I hate to use the cliche) but witty and charming. She did not take herself too seriously, she was very matter of fact, not remotely preachy but did put out a lot of food for thought.I am sold. I will buy and read the next book she publishes :)"},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book because I was intrigued by the premise: a chemical leak causes the denizens of small-town Clarence to remember everything: the terrible memories of unbearable loss and the wonderful memories of abiding love, and asks the question: is this a blessing or a curse? Filled with rich characters and writing as clear and magical as a star-filled summer night, SPILLING CLARENCE is one of those rare books you just pass on to your friends, urging them to pass the book onto their friends, too. WOW."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"This book will echo in your mind and soul long after you read it's last page. A beautifully realized idea that says, yes our memories are important, but it is what we do with those memories that is most important. Our memories and even the loss of them change us, meld us, into the human beings we become. Each character in Anne Ursu's novel recalls a part of their past that they would rather forget, but in the end the memories that they fear the most are the ones that make their lives not just &quot;better&quot; but fuller and richer.I read this book over a month ago and have read three or four books since, yet everyday my mind wanders back to Spilling Clarence. I recomend this book to all...especially to anyone in therapy, it will change the way you look at your past and cause you to embrace it. Thank you Anne Ursu."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"One reason to read this novel is the strong intertextual dialogue between it and DeLillo's White Noise, the story of a toxic event in a college town filled with pop culture references, psychological metaphor, and brilliant insight. If DeLillo was funny, maybe White Noise would be as much of a joy to read as Spilling Clarence. White Noise is funny, in its own dry, satirical and academic way. But it's much darker and colder than Spilling Clarence, which is also smart, but warm and with a much lighter approach. (The lightness does not diminish its power or importance.) It is also, I notice, like DeLillo, a one-book tagline factory. Examples? \\"The wind carries the smell of the place Chinese food goes to die.\\" \\"The first three principles of love: location, location, location.\\" \\"What could be better than psychopharmaceuticals leaking into the air?\\" Anne Ursu's sentences snap, crackle, and pop. Every single one. One begins to wonder if she drank a lot of coffee when writing this novel.Perhaps the author hasn't even read White Noise, which does not negate any of my observations. If she has, my admiration is only greater. It would mean she has written a unique, wonderful narrative that also happens to synthesize and deal with one of our most famous and most pivotal post-war American novels. Taking on a book that is de rigeur for Am Lit 101 is no small feat. I am, needless to say, mighty impressed.If you like your books intellectually inspiring while you're being entertained, you'll love the take on memory here. I love the way Anne includes half-finished cliches throughout, like mnemonics. (\\"Behind every man.\\" \\"Better safe.\\") It's a very tight novel that way, thematically, everything tying in with her themes somehow. I remain pleasantly suprised at how insightful and profound this book is. I just did not expect that from the cover or the title. 'Course, even the text itself is deceptive. Bouncy and light do not typically translate into important, which is an achievement in itself.There's also a delightful literary thread running through it in the person of writer working out of a retirement home being wooed by a loveable war veteran.A love story. That's how I'll ulimately remember it.Brava, Ms. Ursu."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Spilling Clarence is a wonderful debut novel, worthy of the FIVE STAR rating from nearly every reader who took the time to write a review on these pages. I am disheartened by the Publishers Weekly poor (poorly reviewed, in my opinion) and disparaging remarks. Had I let his/her comments influence me, I may have overlooked this gem of a book. Anne Ursa's characters are real and insightful. The premise clever and original. I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Pay no attention to that dumb Publisher's Weekly review, the person obviously didn't read the book with any attention.

It reads like lightning. Very smart, but very quick prose. Anne Ursu does not try to jam emotion down your throat or tell you what you should be feeling. In this way it was like a piece of theater. You are presented with these highly identifiable human beings and the understanding is left up to you. This makes the book highly engaging and explains why I got so involved that the novel was finished nearly before I looked up.The book is only now becoming available, but early buzz about Spilling Clarence in our area is very good, and as an early reader I can say it's well deserved."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"I absolutely adored this book. Loved the effortless way the author moved through time and how each flashback illuminated a moment in time (and in a book about memory, how important that the past be as vivid and moving as the future!) Loved the characters who have stayed in my mind. Ursu is a brilliant writer deserving of all the praise newspapers are heaping on her--and when I went into the bookstore, two other people were buying her book (we joked we were going to get together to compare notes!)"},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Anne Ursu's first novel is simply MAGICAL! Her writing is alive full of charm and charisma that pulls you in and keeps you reaching for more with her amazing characters who make the town of Clarence come alive as they begin their journeys of remembering!!! Her characters will touch your heart...you will simply fall in love with them all and think about them as if you actually know them and when you are done you won't be able to forget them! This is a book you just can not put down, will definitely want to recommend to everyone you know, and if you are like me will read at least one more time to make sure you did not miss anything!!!

This may sound sci-fi, but it is far from it. This warm and witty novel blends tales from the past with their present circumstances. The chemical deletrium has caused people to be overcome with nostalgia and unable to wake up from their past lives. The story centers around a widowed professor named Bennie, his amazing little girl Sophie; a young woman named Susannah struggling to find her place in the world while dealing with an insane mother and distant boyfriend; an aging writer named Madeline who is finding herself falling in love in her twilight years. Although the first few chapters were slow moving, I was glad that I stuck with the book. Once it got moving, I could not put it down. It is a novel that will stick with you long after the last sentence is read. You will find yourself wanting to visit the library at Sunny Shadows and lose yourself in the aisles of the Davis and Dean bookstore. A highly recommended read with a creative plot."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"I liked this book more at the beginning than I did at the end. The premise is very interesting and it led to several discussions amoung friends and family. Somehow,however, I seemed to lose track of the characters, except for Sophie who was a child and easy to spot. I think I was looking for more discussion from Todd of just how memory works.This book speaks to the power of love, especially when Bennie's mother was talking to him about the first time she saw him with Elizabeth,&quot;The two of you were magic to each other. You both swelled over with life. You were radiant together. I will never forget it. I have tried to write about it and cannot find the words. Your love was ancient, literary. It was the way it was supposed to work. You never believe such a thing is possible until you see it in real life.And I see it, that love, every time I look at Sophie. She is a remarkable child. And she would have to be, coming from such a blessed union.&quot;The book also however, spoke to the loneliness of people and the barriers that make connecting so hard. Most of the characters were able to knock down those barriers but somehow there was still a sadness about them.I had mixed feelings about this book but still would recommend it for an interesting read."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"The premise of this novel is original and unique, however, I don't really understand the comments about wanting to hug the book when done. It was a fine debut novel, well crafted and unfortunately forgettable. Maybe deletrium will spill in my town and bring points of the book back reminding me of why I would want to read it again, but for now I will say it was just nice."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Don't get me wrong, I don't think this was a bad book, but on the other hand, I don't think that there was anything particularly great about it either.The author comes up with an interesting scenerio, that of what would happen if people, through some fluke of happenstance, were able to remember much more than normal, and how it would affect their lives.The result, however, was disappointing, as the book seemed to get just as muddled in the middle as the characters who got bogged down in the flood of memories. There's a reason that writers are warned against using too many flashbacks in writing, and having a whole book of such tends to prove the point."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"I generally don't write book reviews, but when I read the Publisher's Weekly review/summary/defamation, I felt I needed to put in my two cents. The reviewer obviously read this book on a bad day. This is a magical, powerful book which has had profound affects on me....and apparantly nearly everyone else who has read the book. Don't let the reviewer's weak comparisons to another author keep you from reading this book. (Unless you, too, are scared to face your own &quot;memories&quot; and just want a shallow read.)

This book establishes Ms. Ursu as a unique voice, with a distinct world view peppered by humorous observations, rich characters, and smart insights into the dynamics of life in America.

I am not forced to read achingly hyper-realistic descriptions of setting just so the author can show off. I get people! I get deeply drawn characters communicating.The memory-inducing drug serves to screw up time and space, the same way a play can. For Calvin, for example, the drug takes him back to World War II.

This book is a bit of light in some very hard times. I read through this book very quickly and will be recommending it to all my friends."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"This book is incredible. I was intrigued first by the title and then even further by the synopsis on the jacket. What would happen if all your memories came back to you as if you were living them all over again? If everything you saw or or smelled or did in the present reminded you of all moments small and large in your past. And is what you remember exactly as it really happened? Are our memories trustworthy, or are we rewriting them for better or worse even as they happen? It's amazing the way the author addresses these questions through the characters, and makes you question your own memories. Right from the start, you are there with these people holding your breath during the &quot;spill&quot; which isn't really a spill, but a release of a chemical into the atmosphere as one of the characters points out. She draws you in and you can't help but get lost in your own memories just as the characters do in the book. As you follow these people as they fight to find their way back to the present, and then struggle to move on after reliving their lives through their memories, you see how their memories have shaped and controlled their lives all along. And how do we break free of the binds that are our memories? Read the book and you may discover the answer for yourself. When I was finished I was so disappointed to find out it was her first book because I couldn't wait to read anything else she had written. Well now there's &quot;Disapparation of James&quot; also a very intriguing book, and I highly recommend that one as well."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"It's been awhile since I've read a book that has a theme to it ~~ and makes you stop and think about certain points the author is making through her characters. Don't get me wrong, this is not a heavy tome ~~ not at all. It's a very personal book. It's an intimate book ~~ one that draws the reader into the minds of the characters as they relive certain events in their lives. And it makes you think and ponder about your life.A chemical leak from a local psychopharmaceutical factory in Clarence spews out over the town. As a result, people starts to remember everything in their lives. This book, however, focuses on just a few characters, Madeline, a writer and mother who lives in a retirement home. Bennie, her son, is a professor at the local college ~~ ironically in the psychology studies ~~ is also a single dad to Sophie, his 9-year-old daughter. There is Susannah who moved to Clarence to join her finace, Todd, who is working on his studies at the local college too. The book revolves around these central characters and their lives and their memories. They all did serious soul-searching through remembering their past and present.It is an interesting theory ~~ do you want to remember every single thing that has ever happened to you? Or do you prefer to forget some things? Are your memories 100% yours? Or was it fabricated throughout the years? The questions are endless and it does make you stop and wonder.I really enjoyed this book in spite of its unusual writing style ~~ it did take me a few chapters to get into but once I got into the swing of the book, I was able to kick back and read it. However, it is not a fluffy book nor is it a happy book ~~ this book is somber and it does make you remember your past. You will find yourself relating to certain events in these characters' lives. Ursu has a way of drawing the reader into her world ~~ she brings back a lot of nostaglia and pride ~~ and if you're a Midwesterner like me, a lot of these memories are the same as yours as a kid. Each of the characters somehow manage to get connected to one another indirectly ~~ and leaves an impact on others' lives.This is one of the most interesting reads I've read this year. It is a book I'd definitely pass onto others ~~ and Ursu is an author I'd be interested in reading more of.4-2-03"},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"This novel is both emotionally and intellectually significant-a rare find! At the heart of the book is a chemical, deletrium, that escapes into the town of Clarence. People find themselves remembering things they've forgotten, and many of those memories are painful. The questions raised here are fascinating and central to a culture where Prozac in the water supply wouldn't be all that unbelievable. (Just a bit. Just until we can start shopping again.) I was especially impressed with the authority of Anne Ursu's prose-truly astonishing for a first novelist. She can guide us past the memory wars of the last twenty years, and make it look easy (!), without once losing sight of her characters. I've already given this book to two grad school friends. I wish I could rate this ten stars; it's that good."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"The main reason that prompted my buying of this book was the interesting premise. I thought the idea behind this book was something very original and unique, and I was definitely excited about reading it. And while Spilling Clarence did provide me with something out of the ordinary, I believe the novel was more depressing that I anticipated.Spilling Clarence tells the story about a small town, Clarence, and the chemical leak that changed everything. An explosion at the town's psychopharmaceutical plant has sent mind-altering vapors into the air. At first, authorities weren't actually sure what to make of the incident, but soon they got their answers. These vapors, a chemical called Deletrium, unlocks the brain's hidden and repressed memories, encouraging patients (or in this case, town residents) to remember things they had forgotten. At first it doesn't sound so bad -- who doesn't like a trip down memory lane every once in a while? But soon, most of the town starts to unravel -- not everyone's memories bring smiles and joy.While the story talks about many of Clarence's citizens, most of the detail is reserved for three main characters: Bennie, a college psychology professor, whose memories bring his deceased wife, Lizzie, back to life; Madeline, Bennie's mother, who resides at the Sunny Shadows retirement home, remembers the life she led as a wife and as a widow; and Susannah, an aide at the retirement home, who has her own troubled past, mostly in the form of a mentally ill mother. All of these characters are portrayed in rich detail, and author Anne Ursu leaves no rock overturned.Spilling Clarence is an insightful, moving story about memories and the mind's natural process of storing them away. The writing is exquisite and thoughtful, yet simple and easy to understand when the author flits back and forth between past and present. The tone is more depressing than I expected -- there is a lot of &quot;falling down into a crumpled, shaking heap&quot; in this book! -- but then again, that is life and a lot memories we repress mostly relate to an unhappy time. Spilling Clarence is an honest piece of work, and I applaud Anne Ursu for writing it."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"...so, I come to Amazon to write a review of a charming and funny first novel - a novel that I gobbled up in a single day - and find a sloppy, peevish diatribe from Publishers Weekly, so spiteful it made me wonder if author stole the reviewer's boyfriend back in junior high. Is there a prozac shortage I'm unaware of?Obviously, I greatly enjoyed this novel. As readable as it is intelligent, SPILLING CLARENCE begins with an intriguing premise and builds into a thought-provoking examination of the nature and power of our memories. Anne Ursu's prose style and concerns are more akin to Don Delillo's WHITE NOISE than Alice Hoffman's work, and she has a sharp wit reminiscent of Lorrie Moore. But it is Ursu's richly drawn characters that delight and surprise (especially Sophie, whom I just adored.) They stayed with me long after I finished reading the book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Just when you think you're the genius who discovered a great new talent, you log onto Amazon and find eight people have already given your discovery rave reviews. Well, I'm proud to join this bandwagon.Though I finished reading this book last week, I find myself still thinking about the characters. I picture them drinking coffee, thumbing through books and telling jokes that I'd find very funny.The characters are very compelling, but what I found most unique in Spilling Clarence was the narration. It's funny, hip, and a tiny bit unusual. I felt as though it sat in my lap a few times, in a way that was surprisingly comfortable.This is one of those books you'll go racing back to each night, anxious to pick up where you left off. I love it when a book I adore is a first novel.

Little do they know, thoughts of Lizzie - Bennie's wife and Sophie's mother - will soon start to haunt them. The love, the accident, the pain. The memories will invade and take over their lives.Susannah Korbet sits in Davis and Dean blending into the crowd.

Ursu's novel is an excellent journey into self-exploration with a motley cast of well-crafted characters."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"SPILLING CLARENCE, the debut novel of Anne Ursu, is one of those novels (one of those RARE novels) that you want to re-read the moment you've finished it. You'll want to go back and see if the wisdom that you've found is really there (it is) if the sly wit was really that funny (it is) and the voice itself is really that insightful into the human condition. (Trust me on this -- it IS!)Beautifully written, filled with people that you will know (that you might BE) this is a book that speaks about ordinary people in an extraordinary time that was not of their own making, but how they live will be of their own choosing. What better book for the world we find ourselves in?Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Spilling Clarence, what an interesting yet ambiguous book title. Only when I picked it up and riffled it did I realize the premise of the book was way more interesting than the title might have suggested.Clarence was the name of the town where Anne Ursu's story unravels. The town is home of a pharmaceutical company which prides itself with the memory retrieval pill Deletrium. An explosion of the company's manufacturing plant not only disturbed the hush of the town but sent an immeasurable waft of memory-provoking gas throughout town. While the plant assured the chemical spill of Deletrium was not toxic; the medical substance did trigger brain receptors and unleash memories that were repressed in the brain. The inevitable outcome was a retrieval of memories, pleasant and painful, caught up with townspeople who had been exposed to the vapor.Bennie, a psychology professor, was among those who in the least appreciated the chemical as it brought back painful memories of his deceased wife Lizzie. Bennie is a single-father who raised 9-years-old Sophie. Bennie's mother, Madeline, who lived in a retirement home, recounted her stricken years as a mother and widow. Susannah, an aide at the retirement home and took care of Madeline, also got her share of grieving reminiscence about her mother who suffered from mental illness. Her fiance Todd was a student at a local college working toward his degree. While the book mainly focused on the three aforementioned characters, Ursu's rich but not sating narrative touched on many other townspeople and their pasts. Even the paltry characters were etched.The book deals with grievances of the pasts and how diligently people tried to put behind the painful loss. As intriguing as it may be, the book also brought to surface the nature of loneliness. It seemed to me that the troubled past, the bitterness, the sadness had imposed such formidable hurdle in the characters that they couldn't break away from their loneliness.I want to remind fellow readers that this book is quite promising as Anne Ursu's debut novel. While Ursu doesn't play around with winding skeins of words that unspool and render elegantly like some of the most acclaimed prose stylists of our time; her writing is taut, crisp, and clear. She bears the tour de force to take her readers back and forth in time to make reference to reminiscence and to weave together various incidences in the lives of her characters. This is done somehow seamlessly and not obscurely.Spilling Clarence is a relatively short book. It would be a perfect choice for a summer read though parts of it (the reminiscence) can be very depressing. I read it out of the curiosity for its unique and tantalizing premise and slipped it in between my arduous reading projects for a breath of fresh air. 3.8 stars."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"What a find! A laugh-out-loud, cry-out-loud story, this rollicking, highly intelligent novel spins a tale of remembrance and love in the aftermath of a chemical spill. In the town of Clarence, characters you'd like for friends share heartbreak and hope as a mysterious vapor releases full recall of their triumphs and tragedies. With shimmering sentences, Anne Ursu creates an engaging, entrancing, and evocative world and explores the poignant nature of human relationships.One cautionary note: Unless you want to become acquainted with the person seated next to you -- do not read this book on public transportation."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"How exciting to find an innovative piece of fiction that is so appealing. This novel has such an original voice, has such a quirky sense of humor, and such a magnificent narrative pace and style.Sometimes attempts at literary innovation mean the author is trying to belong to some &quot;high art&quot; literary club, means the author forgets the poor reader along the way.

Unfortunately, it features a disappointing and somewhat cliched plot development with an overly cutsie writing style.I could not develop a connection to or emapthy for any of the characters, could not figure out where the story was going as it dragged on for 200 plus pages, and found the ending to be a dis-jointed segment unto itself. The book reads like a screen play for a sappy made-for-TV movie. I read it for my book club, and found myself surrounded by a room full of \\"amazing\\", \\"5 stars\\", \\"deep, creative\\". All I could think was....\\"I guess that's whay they call it chick lit\\".

Book discussion groups will eat it up."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"This is a good first novel. Ms. Ursu has a talent for spinning a phrase, and the prose is easy on the ear. The dialogue and character development are nothing special, though not bad. The plot is fairly interesting and is developed well enough, though the author clearly owes a great deal to Robert Silverberg's \\"How It Was When The Past Went Away\\", as the entire premise and development of this story is essentially a rehash of Silverberg's, stood on its head: here the drug enhances memory rather than erasing it. Though the manner in which Ursu unfolds her story is nearly identical to the approach taken by Silverberg, the earlier story was tighter and more deftly woven, being kept to novella length, and at times I felt Ursu was extending the story beyond the material she really had to work with.Still, the writing is competent overall, and at times the prose reaches a fine level of grace that shows true potential. For a first novel, it's a worthwhile effort, and worth the reader's time."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"I was a little disappointed that the story didn't seem to go anywhere. I found it easy to read b/c I thought for sure there was going to be some great moment. I never saw it. It seemed to get a bit \\"soap opera-y\\" at times too. It's a light read. If you don't go into it expecting much, it would be a fine read."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Spilling Clarence by Anne Ursu is one of the best debut novels you will ever read.

An unfolding joy."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"The cover jacket summary sounds intriguing, but the book never delivers any real substance. What a creative and potentially powerful topic the author has conjured! Our memory supression and memory loss can serve as protective mechanisms, and the disruption of these processes is potentially dangerous to our mental and emotional health. The reader dives in expecting to be immersed in a world gone amok. A drug, that in therapeutic administrations, is beneficial, becomes threatening and disruptive to the people in a small town where the drug accidentally has been released into the atmosphere. However, there is little depth to this book; it is disappointingly shallow. The potential for insight into the human condition as a result of undesireable memory gain never comes to life. How disappointing! The phrases frequently flow disjointedly and what is meant for humor is seldom more than sophomoric sarcasm. With so many other books to choose from, read the dust jacket, put this back on the shelf, and select something else."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"I bought this book with hopeful thoughts. The premise seemed promising. Are memories a drug, since they can be both painful and pleasurable? What would be like if our memory bank suddenly lost its filter? Unfortunately, this well written book doesn't answer the questions. Anne Ursu is a wonderful writer, her phrasing is absolutely beautiful and her use of metaphors is superb. She writes \\"Your mind is a lot like your closet. Your try to hang up your clothes well and line up your shoes like little soldiers and keep your toys from tipping over, but sometimes you just can't keep it all organized\\". Sadly though, the story is lacking desperately in plot. I am on page 205 of this 277 page book and I keep waiting for the story to begin. Normally I would just toss this type of a book in the garbage but the writing is so good, I'm going to finish."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"I have enjoyed this story of a chemical spill that haphazardly opens up memory \\"doors\\" in the brains of the residents of the small town of Clarence, but I find it a little unbelievable. The possibility of such an accident seems very unlikely and the effects on the people seem to occur too slowly and the chemical is more effective to some characters than to others. Not that the book moves slowly; it's a good weekend read that goes pretty fast and smooth.The characters are interesting and likable, but I'm not compelled to care about them as much as I'd like to. I enjoy getting more wrapped up in the characters than I am here. Here we don't learn enough about each of them to care too deeply.All in all, it's a good book, but I won't be reading it again. I'm interested to see what Anne Ursu comes out with next, though, because this story line was very inventive even if I didn't find it totally believable. I recommend this book for a light, easy weekend read."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"The idea is intriguing, but the result disappointing. The writing style is simplistic and repetitive; in sharp contrast, for example, to Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections, where the style is overly complex and arrogant. Moreover, the characters are never really developed beyond cliches, and crucial plot lines are dropped. (What if memories really are simply creations rather than a replay of facts?) And for readers who have even a bit of education in the neuropsychology of memory, the inaccuracies of the science will be too distracting to allow enjoyment of the story. I, for one, will pass on Ursu's next attempt."},{"Title":"Spilling Clarence: A Novel","review":"Spilling Clarence is one of those books I bought first for myself, adored, and bought again and again to give to people I love.

They suggest, as E.O. Wilson has done, that something way back in human evolution drove people to evolve an inclination toward spirituality, a sense of &quot;specialness&quot; (the &quot;proud illusion&quot; in the title), and many of the traits of cooperativity that people hold dear. In the book Morrison himself expresses admiration for human achievement, while noting that an aspect of human evolutionary heritage of which people are generally unconscious, has driven the tendency toward pollution and overpopulation which is damaging to human and environment alike. It's a compelling idea, and is also useful in that it can help society to look more pragmatically at tacit assumptions and address the root causes of many problems, to craft better policy. If the authors had only stopped with this sensible, though novel, idea and developed it further, they would have written a 5-star masterpiece.But the authors disastrously overstretch themselves and indulge in the ultimate hubristic fantasy: They pretend that they can &quot;step outside&quot; of their own human selves and perceptions, take a so-called &quot;objective&quot; viewpoint (though, needless to say, they do not hesitate in piling on assumption after assumption), and essentially give an absolute description of human nature and society based solely on genetic determinism. They trip over their own logic so many times that they bruise themselves, and come up with an utterly downbeat conclusion that, ironically, actually argues against doing anything constructive for the environment, since in their view the genetic tendencies basically lead humans toward destruction of their own civilization and the environment alike. It's an utterly preposterous, amoral, irresponsible, laughable conclusion that is essentially a self-parody. Most problematically, the book takes total genetic determinism as a given. Undoubtedly the genes say an awful lot about human behavior, but while they do introduce a set of tendencies, the interaction of the genes with environment and with the many facets of human society, foster quite a few unpredictabilities-- most of all in the capacity to observe and learn, and to adjust behavior correspondingly. This is in fact already happening; in developing countries as well as the developed world, birthrates are rapidly dropping, and especially in Europe, Japan, and developing countries alike, there is an intense drive underway to implement renewable energy sources in place of fossil fuels. There is quite a bit of human behavior that is extraordinarily adaptive, far more than can be glimpsed from a reductionistic assumption derived from genetic determinism, and Morrison fails to consider the power of this &quot;higher-brain&quot; thinking in adjusting behavior to protect both society and the environment. The next time these or any other authors talk about attacking the &quot;human cancer,&quot; they should start with the people staring at them in the mirror. If you read this book, ignore its eventual argument; instead, continue in its theme of examining underlying assumptions that might be destructive to the environment, since this can provide insight-- and a more sensible environmental policy."},{"Title":"The Spirit in the Gene: Humanity's Proud Illusion and the Laws of Nature (Comstock Book)","review":"Not just pessimism -- utter hopelessness.Reg Morrison's view is that you and I are plague animals, an infestation on the earth. If you have any hope for humanity, any at all, then clearly you don't &quot;get it.&quot; You must be disabused of hope -- to see hope only as a genetic mechanism that will serve to delay recognition of ecological disaster until our self-made mousetrap is inevitably sprung. Thomas Malthus was a prophet, and modern agriculture's green revolution only an insignificant pause on the road to our destiny of overpopulation and catastrophic megadeath. We have maybe 50 years.You'll find a photograph of New York City's skyline with this caption: &quot;New York, New York. This prodigious accumulation of biological deposits on the banks of the Hudson River appears to echo the monolithic uniformity of the Shark Bay stromatolites, yet it incorporates an unprecedented variety of waste materials.&quot; If you agree with Morrison's logic, this will be your only reasonable perspective of NYC, or of your own home.What you won't find is a discussion of counter evidence -- of the aging population in the world's developed countries -- aging because births are well below replacement level.Nor will you find a discussion of actions that might be taken to make a better world. Any such actions, you see, would suggest that there is hope -- and there can be no hope, not if you &quot;get it.&quot;Provocative.

Morrison's breadth of knowledge is impressive, but I doubt his qualifications to integrate the bits he casts out. I stopped reading at Ch. 6 where he describes (p. 132) research by an East German scientist in the 1970s that linked environmental stress (in the research that was conducted the stress was WW II) to increasing rates of homosexuality, and goes on to suggest that similar effects will result from the stress of climate change: &quot;We will see a gradual increase in the incidence of biological and social dysfunction, as well as rising levels of unproductive sexual behavior, such as homosexuality, lesbianism, and pedophilia, and an increasing heterosexual tendency to postpone or avoid parenthood.&quot; (p. 134). I'm not a scientist, but the evidence cited is incredibly thin , and sounds like personal biases getting involved in a scientific discussion. I'll wait for a more qualified author."},{"Title":"The Spirit in the Gene: Humanity's Proud Illusion and the Laws of Nature (Comstock Book)","review":"The crux of the authors' argument is based upon a subtle assumption (in the preface, no less!). Once you accept that, then their &quot;we're all doomed and nothing we can do about it&quot; thesis acquires some weight and becomes truly depressing.My thought is: if we're preprogrammed to be the way we are, and the way we are makes us destined to destroy the earth and ourselves, then why write the book?This was really a dark, unrelenting journey of hopelessness. What I don't get is the other reviews: what is there to &quot;get&quot;? I'm being told I can't do anything to change this person's horribly bleak vision of destruction.

Morrison lays it out step by step. He explains why the population, in the last century has grown at such an exponential rate, and why that growth will soon come to an end....and head dramatically in the other direction. But one of the most important things covered in this book is why we refuse to believe the obvious, why we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the Easter Islanders and refuse to believe that our actions must inevitably lead to a dramatic population collapse.Morrison tells it like it is, we are by nature anthropocentric and have ultimate faith in the ability of Homo sapiens to overcome any difficulty. Faith, Morrison tells us, is the magic ingredient that enables to make that wondrous leap from grim reality into the totally bloody ridiculous. So those who have given this book one star are the true believers. They have criticized it because they say it smacks of genetic determinism, a term invented by the critics of sociobiology, and not subscribed to by sociobiologists themselves. Or they have criticized the book because it does not offer a rosy picture where we are all saved by the wonders of science. Morrison paints science as one of the culprits in the rape of the world and not our ultimate savior. That is a message that raises the ire of many a true believer.Yet all Morrison is trying to tell us is that what has happened many times in the past on a much smaller scale, is happening again on a worldwide scale. And it will happen because our population has already reached plague proportions and is now way beyond any sustainable level.This is the very best book I have read in years, and I read an awful lot of books."},{"Title":"The Spirit in the Gene: Humanity's Proud Illusion and the Laws of Nature (Comstock Book)","review":"Reg Morrison summarizes in succinct and personal polemic style what problems the human race really faces, and does a good job of unmasking the nature of our mystically constructed delusions. It is a short book for covering such a broad sweep of our evolutionary and cultural heritage. Possibly some minor details are amiss, but the message is clear. For such an ultimately pessimistic view of what we prize most about ourselves, its punches are well delivered.According to Morrison, globalism is heading for global ecological collapse under the weight of the human plague, and will be followed by massive decline in human numbers, if not outright extinction. As the situation gets more dire, the search for mental escape in our mystical beliefs in culture-land, nationalism, media will increase, not decrease. We will be all mentally \\"off the planet\\" by the time we are kicked off it.Taking his presentation of facts and conclusions seriously means that the present course of human affairs is still heading for disaster. I present some conclusions of the book. Reg debunks some of our cherished mystical beliefs, and counterpoises his grim facts, and I present here his main conclusions.Belief 1. Humans have spiritual autonomy and are therefore accountible for their actions.Fact 1. We are genetically driven just like any other animal. We have no mind other than the body, and we lack behavioural choice.Belief 2. The environment is inherently stable and will rebound if given half a chance.Fact 2. The environment is a chaotic system and is therefore inherently unstable and always has been. If it were not so, evolution could not have occurred. Rebound is a not characteristic of the system.Belief 3. With enough moral courage, political will and technical know how, time and money, the environment could be repaired.Fact 3. Most environmental damage is inevitable product of overpopulation. The more technological the attempted solutions, the greater the environmental debt. All human activity adds to environmental debt.We fall for the false beliefs most of the time, because humans have a split brain, with \\"two spheres of awareness available to us, with two entirely separate behaviour control systems, one rational and one entirely non-rational.... \\". Unfortunately for the human species \\" ... the rational brain should be viewed, not as the principal generator of behaviour and the pivot on which the species turns, but as an optional extra designed to be switched off the moment any serious evolutionary matters, such as genetic survival or propagation, arise.\\"The best course for human species survival would be a global, concious coordinated reduction in human environmental impact, and a strong reduction in birth rate. Instead we are probably going to get conflict, continued exploitation to death and extinction, with war and upheavals on the scale of the Biblical Revelations. As Reg says, \\"All species must fail eventually, especially the very successful ones, or the whole system will grind to a halt\\". Reg hopes we will wipe ourselves out quickly as plagues tend to do, so the system can carry on without us."},{"Title":"The Spirit in the Gene: Humanity's Proud Illusion and the Laws of Nature (Comstock Book)","review":"Reg Morrison has been able to take a few basic scientific proofs, put them together and achieve a conclusion that no scientist can argue with. Yet humanity is so amazingly, head-buttingly programmed to believe itself mystically created and guided that most readers will be unable to drop those &quot;self-importance&quot; blinders even as they read this simple truth. He realizes that fact, and realizes also that it doesn't matter.We are what we are, and we're going where we're going. Changing our &quot;progress&quot; to give the human branch (of our real species) a longer stretch on earth would be quite undesirable as far as nature is concerned. There is no choice in the matter - we do what comes naturally. In our case, that would be self-extinction on the double-quick.

They bespoke of a complete disconnect from the real issues which confront human kind.Having only been around a brief 80 years myself, who am I to judge the future? Or for that matter who alive can do so. We have many pundits of all stripes doing so, so my continuous note of pessimism can't make any impression.That fact will not matter, because the coming apocalypse due to excess humans on our small planet will be the factor that will govern us and everyone on the planet.Many have predicted this happening and observable facts from around the planet support the thesis that it has already well begun to occur.Thus, when I came across a book by Reg Morrison entitled \\"The Spirit in the Gene: Humanity's Proud Illusion and the Laws of Nature\\" written in 1999, published 11 years ago which so eloquently put the case for restraint, I found a kindred spirit who has been saying many of the things I have written about and thought about and talked about for years.The book got only 16 reviews, mostly favorable, eleven of them Five Stars (highest rating).

Now fast forward to today, when the world's human numbers are slightly over 7 billion, a billion increase in 11 or 12 years.One can argue that logical humans will make the changes necessary to avoid the disaster Morrison project, and certainly much has been written about efforts to quell growth, ut much more has been done to damage the planet than preserve it.And as the stock of less educated, more desperately poor and oppressed human numbers are added (over 1% per year), the case for reason and restorative measures gets less and less sturdy.A quote from Morrison's 2000 book gains even more credibility today:Chapter 7: Page 153-4 The Case against UsLet us for a moment indulge our anthropocentric imagination and visualize ourselves facing a jury of cosmic peers. The prosecution is having a field day. \\"Here was a planet of moderate mass and gravity, perfectly placed in relation to the sun; a blue, rain-washed sphere, superbly managed by the diverse organic products of four billion years of painstaking biological evolution. Here, truly, was the Camelot of the cosmos. And look at it now! Its air and water are polluted, half of its forests felled and burned, its wetlands drained, much of its topsoil blown into the sea, and the rich fabric of life that once adorned the biosphere torn to shreds. How could this galactic pearl have fallen so easily into such crude, unsuited hands? And what of the accused, these hairless, underdeveloped, quarrelsome apes, equipped with little more than glib tongues, sharp wits, and nimble fingers; how could they have wrought such havoc so swiftly?

It made me want to be just like Jesse - I wish I could have her magical powers. And Iggywig made me laugh - what a funny little creature. I liked the scary witch bits and the transforming was cool. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantastic adventures."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Golden Glow (Alpha to Omega Series)","review":"A word first about the book, as an object, itself. On the plus side, the paper is quite good quality; but you don't get to the paper without going through that legendary front cover. Please believe me when I say it looks worse in real life than it does in the illustration above. The cover itself looks as though it was produced on a colour photocopier - that slightly secondhand tone - and as though it was designed on a PC. The way the cover is glued to the pages, combined with the quality of the card cover, has left it rippled at the spine, and less than 24 hours after receiving it, the cover of my copy is curling upwards towards the light, so that the whole effect is of a book that was dropped in the bath and left to dry in a car.And so to the book itself. At 145 pages, Jesse Jameson and the Golden Glow took me just under two hours to read. It's not the worst piece of fiction ever published - but only if you compare it with its closest relative: fan fiction on the internet composed by sweating mutes on prescription drug benders. No wonder it's self published.I haven't read the Harry Potter books but I understand that each one begins with Harry at home with his dismal adoptive family - and so too does Jesse Jameson. In fact there is nothing particularly wrong with the opening scenes of the book, where Jesse is suffering a hundred torments at the hands of her wicked stepmother and ugly sisters - except, as you will have seen from the last few words, that no fairytale clich&eacute; is left unturned. Ironic? Playing with the form? I doubt it. Quickly, however, Jesse finds herself wandering into a fairy ring and mysteriously transported to another world, where the adventure proper begins. And it is here that we learn everything about Jesse and, more interestingly, everything that the author appears to be incapable of.1. He can't spell. Now all books suffer the occasional typo and everyone has little spelling blindspots, but for a children's author it's appalling to see (to offer some examples) \\"vocal chords\\", \\"manuvoured\\", \\"rollacoaster\\", \\"gapping\\" and \\"frog's spawn\\" (repeatedly), together with less frequent but equally howling errors of grammar such as getting tenses wrong (\\"Brimbalin knows where your mother is being keep\\") and using \\"her\\" instead of \\"she\\".2. He can't do tension. There are very very many scenes in the book where Jesse and her companions are in mortal danger - but it never lasts longer than two paragraphs. I lost count of the number of times they were faced with witches or warlocks or octopi or killing machines, when suddenly all was well, through the sudden appearance of one of the other characters. There are four such feeble scrapes in pages 124 to 135 alone. There are never any prolonged struggles or tense chapters or even whole pages. As a result, the whole thing has the feel of a hyper-attention-deficit Saturday morning kid's superhero cartoon on fast forward.3. He can't do settings. At no point does the reader feel immersed in the landscape - it's a kid's book, you might say, lighten up, but think of the arctic wastes in The Golden Compass (though for this book to be mentioned in the same sentence as His Dark Materials is of course ridiculous) - and even the scenes of magic and transformation seem somehow flat and underworked. \\"She was here, and suddenly and without warning she was there\\" is the kind of thing we get.4. The book is riddled with inconsistencies and illogicalities, from the section where they have to break a code to find Jesse's mother (and do so impossibly), to quick about-faces to cover previously unforeseen loopholes (\\"Why don't we use the Bell of Truth?\\" \\"Ah, but sometimes it doesn't work\\" or \\"'There!' shouted a goblin, pointing to the Dragon Hunter, who was perfectly camouflaged but could now be detected by the crystal ball somehow\\"). It reads as though it was written on the hoof, and the author thought \\"I can go back later and tidy this up and make it fit in\\" but then forgot to, or got called away for his dinner.Needless to say, there is no fine writing in the book, no memorable metaphors or similes - \\"Night came down like a curtain\\" seems about the limit of his abilities. And yes, this is a children's book - although the JJ books are now being 'reissued' in adult covers, so they clearly seek to satisfy that audience too. Nonetheless it is quite possible that an undiscriminating child would like this book - but even if they do, will they really want to read the threatened 26th volume when it comes out in 13 years' time (at his current rate of two per year)? And why stop at 26? Why not 84? Or 3,012?As an adult reader, I thought Jesse Jameson and the Golden Glow was a load of witless rubbish from start to finish."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Golden Glow (Alpha to Omega Series)","review":"I thought that Golden Glow was a wonderful first time book for kids. I read it to my twins and they loved it. Judy and Trudy are not exactly the easiest pair to pacify or entertain, but Golden Glow did it for them. Especially as two of the main characters in the book have the same name as my girls. That really helped a lot. Yeah, they loved that.I would recommended this book to anyone with a sense of childish humour. Great fun."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Golden Glow (Alpha to Omega Series)","review":"This book - the Golden Glow - has a wonderfully vibrant energy. It whips along, which is a must in a children's book. The characterisation is strong, and the plot is first class, although a little too much 'back story' in the first chapter. Still it really does entertain.If you like Tolkien, Rowling and Pratchett then this book has a similar feel in tone and content. It's the classic Cinders story with a modern twist. Very strong imaginatitive writing that leaves enough loose ends for the follow up books. I liked it. A fine read for the middle school crowd.

When I got Sabriel, though, I knew right away that it was one of those few sci-fi's that can actually keep me interested the whole way. The plot is very intriguing, and the characters can be both serious and hillarious at the same time.

Jesse Jameson is a girl-hero who can transform into any creature she can think of, which proves to be a magical talent useful for rescuing her kidnapped mum from the evil witch-sisters, Dendrith and Gwendrith. With laughs, action, magic, and weird charaters and settings, this book has the feeling of a classic. Remember CS Lewis's 'Narnia', or Rowling's 'Hogwarts,' and yes, not on a scale so grand, but still highly original: Tolkein's fantastic fantasy landscapes?

However, most self-respecting kids - I hope - would rather turn their back on such tiresome piffle and read something more entertaining and considerably better written. The back of a cornflakes box, for instance.Vanity publishing (and this is what you're getting here, parents) is clearly a time-consuming enterprise. Mr Wright is so busy foisting this rubbish on an unsuspecting and unwilling public, that he didn't even have time to proof read this frankly inept draft 1 manuscript. There are endless typos, errant apostrophes, grammatical abominations and some plain old bizarre nonsensical chunks of text that make the mind boggle. I can only assume that the 'Book Description' blurb above comes from Sean's pen too, including as it does (go, go, take a look) \\"journey's inyo\\" and \\"unforgetable\\". Unforgetable, indeed.One of the craziest examples of just how poorly constructed this book is, is when two early descriptive passages (one about entering a clearing by a river and the other describing how ugly the witch sisters are) are repeated word for word a few dozen pages later. Very lazy.Avoid."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Golden Glow (Alpha to Omega Series)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading a new author; I love children's books.

Descriptions are simplistic and, again, unimaginative. Yuck. I stopped after 32 pages.If you're looking for good kids' books, try Philip Pullman, Eleanor Farjeon (somewhat oldfashioned and terrific), E. Nesbit, and, of course, J.K.

I am a keen collector of children's modern fiction, and to see Sean Wright placed alongside JK Rowling, Pullman, GP Taylor, Snicket, Colfer, Nix, Reeve, Augarde, Hussey, Paolini and Funke as one of the most collectable children's authors in the world was really rather remarkable.I was intrigued, and read the Golden Glow with an enormous amount of pleasure. This book has all the right ingredience for a super children's story: action, magic, and unforgetable characters. There is a great sense of fun in this book, and all the plaudits that have been heaped upon it are well-deserved. Does it match up to the great names in modern children's writing? Yes, indeed.

All but a handful of the paintings that appear in &quot;Songs of Creation&quot; are also found in &quot;Wildlife,&quot; where they are printed, for the most part, in a larger size. In &quot;Songs of Creation&quot; the prints are smaller, and some cross the centerfold of the book, making it difficult to see the entire work. Nevertheless, it is still a beautiful book, and may be a decent substitute if you hesitate to purchase the more expensive &quot;Wildlife.&quot;Carl Brenders is an extremely talented artist, and produces some of the most gorgeous realistic animal paintings around. His work is easy to mistake for a photograph at first glance if you haven't seen one of his paintings before. This particular collection contains 36 of Brenders' paintings, depicting a variety of animals: bears, eagles, deer, wolves, foxes, big cats, and more. The layout is fairly nice, with pleasing background colors, though I still prefer the look of &quot;Wildlife.&quot; The only major drawback is, as I mentioned before, the fact that several paintings cross the centerfold.As the title might suggest, each work is accompanied by a verse of poetry or an excerpt from the Bible. The text is all very Christian, but non-Christians could easily ignore it in favor of the artwork, if inclined to do so. In terms of poetry, it isn't that spectacular in the first place. To get to the bottom line, I'd recommend this only if you don't want to spend the money on &quot;Wildlife.&quot; It's not a bad collection in and of itself, but &quot;Wildlife&quot; is much better and contains nearly every painting seen here, minus the poetry."},{"Title":"Song of Creation","review":"I don't know about these other reviews of this book. This artist is the best of the best! You don't get any more real than this man!

It's not only a handfull of paintings, but 15 paintings that appear in that book and that are not in \\"The Nature Paintings of Carl Brenders\\". There is a beautiful portrait of a tiger, a polar bear standing on snowy bank, Broken Silence, and a few others of his famous paintings that have sold out as print and that you can't find anywhere.I think without this book the collection of his work is simply not complete. With the 2 books, one has a much better representation of Carl Brender's work. In the Song of Creation, one can find especialy his earlier paintings.The printing is a little lacking in vivid colors, but the images are still of good quality to see the detail in the painting."},{"Title":"Song of Creation","review":"I agree with Sola's review and it's true that most of the pictures in _Song..._ can be found in his previous publication, _Wildlife_. Here are a few extra considerations: One of the things that makes the earlier work, _Wildlife_, a better book, is layout: none of the pictures in it are split between two pages. In _Song_, several of Brenders' best paintings are laid out this way, and it seriously detracts from one's appreciation of his work. Even if I liked the (generally insipid) poetry which is splashed all over the pages of _Song_, the addition does nothing to enhance either the poetry or the artwork. The few redeemming features of _Song_ include a larger, somewhat better copy of &quot;Pathfinder: Red Fox&quot;, a stunning painting of a snow leopard, and also a tiger (not in the first work). Otherwise, a great artist deserves a better presentation than this book provides."},{"Title":"Song of Creation","review":"I purchased this book for a relative who is religious and enjoys beautiful art.

This writer takes us inside the head of Taylor Drysdale who tells us, from page to page, about the &quot;art of going crazy.&quot; When Taylor steps onto the porch of Saint Jude for the first time, the boards creak with her weight. The reader enters the weighty world of Saint Jude as Taylor describes a world that is &quot;billowy and shaking,&quot; a world that is &quot;all underwater.&quot; When Taylor finally leaves, however, she is aware that the boards no longer creak, as if she has somehow grown lighter. Dawn Wilson invites all readers to visit Saint Jude; she invites all readers to understand what happens there."},{"Title":"Saint Jude","review":"I could completely relate to this book.

Plus, the author didn't write it solely as teens with mental illnesses story, but the pages perceptively weave in the total picture of teen issues such as body images and gossip at high school and making life decisions and so forth. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Saint Jude","review":"Inside a mental illness house. I liked it. It showed growth and struggle. A great teen fiction read."},{"Title":"Saint Jude","review":"This book was o.k., and a little weird. Though I probably would not consider the actual writing very good (quite a few typos, and some neglected puncuation)the ideas that are formed in your mind when you read are very real. Self-mutilation is growing more and more popular in the U.S., and people really need to start accepting this more as a real issue. Also, just because you cut yourself DOES NOT mean you have a mental problem, afterall... Overall, I think that this book was pretty good, but could have been better. It left some to be desired, though the haunting realness of the book, especially at the end, really brought it all together. I think that this is a good book if you or a 'loved one' cuts, but I certainly wouldn't suggest it for some random, light reading.

She creates complete empathy for the often shunned and misunderstood members of society who deal with mental illnesses, giving incredible insight into their trials and tribulations, hopes and dreams.

My favorite line from the book is when the new, no-nonsense director of Saint Jude, Dalton, suggests to Taylor, \\"Why don't you let God go to high school and you can run the universe?\\"Well worth your time."},{"Title":"Saint Jude","review":"I thought this was an excellent read, and found myself actually getting verbal with some of the events of this book, such as becoming emotional when seeing how the lives of the residents of Saint Jude were affected when Princess died. In my opinion, the sign of true talent is when an author can bring you into the story to the point of feeling the pain of the characters.Saint Jude has touched some very familiar emotions, because I have a brother with the same condition as Taylor. So this book has helped me look at what before has been considered an unapproachable subject, and made it very real to me. There were parts of Taylor's character development that really touched me, especially her escape to music. I have found that very thing to have given me great comfort, and when MS. Wilson used this, it made it very easy to identify with Taylor, and really become a part of her life.I would highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Qualitative Marketing Research","review":"A gem of a book - the first section on research philosophies alone makes it worth reading.

In the stories of Jumping Ship, there's a twist in every other dancing word. The prose is playful, yet highly sophisticated.

These are really fantastic adventures. There are a couple lengthly ones and some short ones, but most all of them are great reading. I would say that even if you don't find the legalistic/feud-based Icelandic sagas particularly appealing, these are a quite different. These seem much more like mythical stories, although the Norse gods play only a limited role in them. In some ways they are like Beowulf because they portray Norse dealing with fantastic creatures and magic. They would make great movies, but not really for children."},{"Title":"Seven Viking Romances (Penguin Classics)","review":"I picked this up on the way back from Iceland, hoping to learn a bit more about the legends and myths surrounding the viking culture.

At any rate, they are funny, sometimes outrageous, chauvinistic, and give an excellent picture into Viking life. The writers of these tales were very witty people indeed. I loved reading 'em! Definitely buy this one! Ten thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Seven Viking Romances (Penguin Classics)","review":"The sagas (prose narratives) from medieval Iceland are more diverse in subject than would be indicated by the more readily available translations. Of course, the major \\"Islendingasogur\\" (\\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\") are, alongside the series of Kings' Sagas (mainly in Snorri Sturluson's \\"Heimskringla\\"), and the lives of the Earls of Orkney, among the great glories of medieval literature, and deserve the attention they have received. The stories of Icelandic families, conflicts and legal disputes, poets, outlaws, and lawyers, are unlike anything in Europe before the modern novel, and the accounts in the Kings' and Earls' sagas of both dynasty-builders and feckless rulers also deserve the praise they get.But there are also \\"Fornaldarsogur,\\" the \\"tales of olden times,\\" retelling ancient Germanic and Scandinavian legends (notably \\"Volsunga Saga,\\" \\"Heidrek's\\" or \\"Hervarar Saga,\\" and \\"Hrolf Kraki's Saga\\"). Only a few of them are as well-known as they deserve, and then often because of associations with other works (the Sigurd / Siegfried legend, \\"Beowulf\\"). And there are accounts of bishops and saints, translations and imitations of Arthurian romances and Carolingian chansons de geste (\\"riddarasogur,\\" \\"knightly tales,\\"), and fantastic stories (\\"lying sagas\\") of adventure and romance among supernatural beings or in distant lands. \\"Sturlunga Saga\\" is a compilation of partisan reports of contemporary events, somewhat cloaked in the objectivity of the saga style. These are largely under-represented in English translation, or at best such translations usually are available only in large or specialized libraries.The great period of saga-writing was the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but stories in the native style continued to be written in later times. There has been tendency to date \\"good\\" sagas early, and \\"inferior\\" sagas late, and reject the \\"late\\" works. But most of the genres (if not specific surviving examples) seem to have been around from the beginning, at least as oral tales. There are close parallels to some of the more extravagant attested before 1220, in the \\"Gesta Danorum\\" of Saxo Grammaticus. The present volume was an interesting attempt to make examples of some of the more neglected kinds of saga more familiar to ordinary readers, without worrying overmuch about their relative age or degree of literary sophistication.The contents will be less surprising to those not directly familiar with great sagas, however. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the distinctions were not at all clear, and the thin antiquarian veneer of (the now obviously fictional) \\"Frithjof's Saga\\" was treated with immense seriousness, and even accorded great political importance. Boosted by a retelling by the poet Tegner, it achieved European celebrity when a masterpiece like \\"Njal's Saga\\" was just a name (at best). Quotations from its late medieval and hyperbolic version of Viking life are still found in circulation in popular accounts, treated as serious evidence. (For this, and much else, Andrew Wawn's \\"The Vikings and the Victorians: Inventing the Old North in 19th-Century Britain\\" is illuminating.)The confusion is understandable. After all, among the realistic tales, \\"Eyrbyggja Saga\\" includes a dramatic haunting -- although the exorcism takes the form of a properly executed legal eviction notice! Visions of the dead, prophetic apparitions, witches, marauding reanimated corpses, trolls, and (in foreign parts) more vaguely conceived monsters may play small roles -- or large ones in \\"Grettir's Saga,\\" and some other accounts of famous outlaws. But these were, for the most part, matters of contemporary belief, and in any case the \\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\" were set mainly between about 850 and 1050, when, it was held, Christianity had yet to drive out the pagan powers, and odd things might be likely to have happened on familiar ground. (Not that the supernatural ceased to be a menacing presence in Icelandic life -- accounts through the nineteenth-century make that clear enough.)The \\"Seven Viking Romances\\" in this volume fall somewhere between the mainly realistic \\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\" and the most extravagant of the \\"lying sagas.\\" Some at first seem to come close to being \\"Sagas of the Icelanders,\\" and some may properly be considered \\"legendary sagas,\\" albeit with more than a little extra-traditional elaboration. And they are particularly interesting because they don't quite fit expectations. They are examples both of literary invention and of the preservation of archaic beliefs. Sorting these out has been a problem for scholars, but not the sort of problem that should prevent a reader from enjoying the stories.How does this work? Some of these seven involve notable Icelandic families or their ancestors in the \\"Old Country\\" (Norway), and they all rely to some extent on the standard stylistic devices of the saga literature. Characters are often formally introduced to the reader with genealogical particulars, and geographic settings. Everyday activities and plain household furnishings are mentioned instead of being avoided (as in the dignified forms of contemporary European literature).But the pretense of being a history of a family's settlement in a new land, marriages, inheritances, and lawsuits, or an account of famous feuds in a district, and how they were resolved, falls away in favor of a rollicking good time. There is not a lot of worrying if there is enough hay to last the winter, and who has the legal rights to the stranded whale. Instead we have slaying of monsters, rescuing of princesses, or slaughtering of hordes of enemies (or at least an evil giant or two). It is rather as if what started like an historical novel rather quickly turned into one of Robert E. Howard's stories of \\"Conan the Cimmerian.\\"\\"Seven Viking Romances\\" starts with the relatively long \\"Arrow-Odd\\" (\\"Orvar-Odds Saga\\" -- the Orvar nickname and name Oddr taken together mean \\"Arrow-Point\\" and the pun could have been made clearer, or just left for a note). The hero seems at first to be a typical saga-age Icelander, with not-too-untypical named heroic ancestors (like the \\"I was delayed by that big fish\\" dragon-slayer, Ketil Trout) known from other stories. But we soon learn that he is destined to live many human lifetimes, and the pagan gods show up to take a (small) part in his adventures abroad, far from Iceland. The actual trade through Arctic waters with Permia figures in the tale, in a suitably fantasticated form; there does seem to be a lot of authentically old, if not very accurate, background. The extant saga reworks older tales of heroes. There is a substantial overlap with the Heidreks/Hervarar Saga tradition in chapter fourteen, featuring the burial of the hero Angantyr with the (cursed) sword Tyrfing -- and of his eleven brothers, one of whom, confusingly, is also named Tyrfing. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus mentions Arvarodd in connection with the fatal battle. In addition, the story of Odd's predicted death shows up in the Russian \\"Primary Chronicle,\\" although there it is told of Oleg the Seer, one of the Scandinavian-descended Princes of Kiev.This translation of \\"Orvar-Odd\\" was originally published separately, as \\"Arrow-Odd: A Medieval Novel\\" (1970), where I originally sought it out after studying some of the related works (such as Saxo). It appears here in slightly revised form, along with the appendix on \\"Sources and Parallels\\" (perhaps a little too condensed to be entirely clear to the uninitiated). Most of the rest had already been published as \\"Gautrek's Saga and other medieval tales\\" (1968), and are also offered with revisions.The following story of \\"King Gautrek\\" (\\"Gautreks Saga\\") is one of a short series of sagas (see \\"Bosi and Herraud,\\" below), and is set in western Gautland (West Gotaland in modern Sweden) -- slightly foreign to Icelandic experience, and apparently a good setting for odd events. (As Geatland, it was Beowulf's home, and his Icelandic counterpart Bodhvar Bjarki was the brother of another King of Gautland; Odd visits it during his travels.) Frithjof's descendants show up in the story, and so does the more certainly venerable figure of Starkad, well-known from Saxo Grammaticus (and some other sources) -- like Arrow-Odd, he was one of those heroic-age figures blessed or cursed to outlive his times. Like \\"Arrow-Odd,\\" \\"King Gautrek\\" clearly belongs among the legendary sagas (\\"Fornaldarsogur\\"), but some of it seems invented, or at least \\"improved.\\"\\"Halfdan Eysteinsson\\" takes us to the Odin-descended kings of Trondheim, and another complex of apparently traditional tales of adventures in legendary versions of real places (Permia) and less likely ones (the Land of the Undying, discovered off-stage by one of Halfdan's relatives). It was newly translated for this collection.\\"Bosi and Herraud\\" begins among King Gautrek's relatives in East Gotaland, and includes a visit to the quasi-mythical King Godmund of Glasir Plains (Gudhmundr of Glaesisvellir), a sort of friendly giant, who recurs in other tales, some included here.\\"Egil and Asmund (\\"Egils saga einhenda og Asmundar saga berserkjabana,\\" \\"The Story of Egil One-Hand and Asmund Berserkers-Slayer\\") is set in the possibly even more exotic land of Russia. Knowledge of a long-lasting Eastern Scandinavian (Swedish) presence there, and adventures of Norwegians and Icelanders at the court of Kiev, and on the way to Byzantium, presumably inspired the setting. (Compare the extra-textual Russian connections of \\"Arrow-Odd.\\") There are excursions into Tartary, and the Aegean, but also to Halogaland (Norway), and Jotunheim, the realm of the Giants; a not untypical mixture of the known, the exotic, and the mythical.The volume is rounded off with two short tales, \\"Thorstein Mansion-Might\\" (\\"Thorsteins thattr baejarmagns\\"), which opens with a visit to the Underworld and an encounter with a dwarf, and continues with exploits among giants, and the very brief \\"Helgi Thorisson\\" (\\"Helga thattr Thorissonar\\"), set in the reign of King Olaf Trygvasson (995-1000). Both of these return us to King Godmund and his legendary realm of marvels and adventures, which are also attested in Saxo Grammaticus and the \\"Hervarar Saga.\\"Not great works -- although \\"Arrow-Odd\\" has some claims to be an especially well-told story, and the shortest works have their own compressed charm. But definitely worth having available alongside the \\"crowned masterpiece\\" examples of medieval Icelandic literature. Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards were not wasting their time, and readers interested in giants, dwarves, and trolls, magic weapons, and the like, probably won't feel that they are wasting their time, either."},{"Title":"Seven Viking Romances (Penguin Classics)","review":"Arrow-Odd went to Permia and was remembered forever.I read Arrow-Odd once and will never forget it.Far from what we might consider a hero, Arrow-Odd kills, rapes, and piliages without reason. Yet for its hero's downfalls, Arrow-Odd is an interesting tale that involves trips to Giantland, the conquering of several viking hoardes single-handedly, and Arrow-Odd's brief stint as &quot;Bark-Man&quot;. This tale could be likened to the comic books of today, but with no pictures and in verse.I would recommend this collection, particulary the reading of Arrow-Odd, to anyone interested in the cultures of old, the evolution of the hero, or a kooky trip into viking lore."},{"Title":"Seven Viking Romances (Penguin Classics)","review":"This anthology includes various heroic sagas from the Icelandic Middle Ages, written at a time when Icelandic work was more open to European influences. Hence the translators prefer to call these \\"Romances\\" referring to the European influences than \\"Sagas.\\"At the same time, there are a great many important tales here. Gautrek's Saga, for example, is included here. On the basis of comparisons between the deaths of Vikar in this saga and Baldr in Snorri's Edda, de Vries drew important conclusions about the nature of initiation rites among the Norse.The one thing I think the translator could have done to make this better would have been to add footnotes explaining some of the elements of the translation (particularly the names). Some of the humor of the writers fo the sagas has thus been lost in translation. For example, in Arrow-Odd, it is helpful to know that 'Odd' means 'point' and thus there is a pun on his nickname that is not evident from the translation.Having said this, these are all quite enjoyable to read and important for serious Norse studies. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Seven Viking Romances (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Icelandic Sagas rank among the greatest treasures of world literature, though even Scandinavians find their original language daunting.

The seven \\"Viking Romances\\" included in this book lean toward the latter category.In English and without the geneologies incorporated in many sagas, an extended work like Njal's or Hrafnkel's Saga can read remarkably like a modern novel, while some of the most naturalistic short sagas are reminiscent of stories of family strife by Alice Munro. No other Medieval literature approaches the grim realism of violence in these sagas, and in my opinion no other literature before the Spanish picaresque displays their sardonic humor or acknowledgement of the attractiveness of rogues.Colorful rogues are the mainstay of these so-called romances, which were plainly told and then written for entertainment rather than edification. There are touches of naturalism even here, amid encounters with trolls, berserkers and giants and the casting of spells, but the fun is in the obvious mockery of everything pious or credulous. Arrow-Odd, the antihero of the longest tale in this volume, is a spiritual ancestor of Harry Flashman and Davy Crockett. Whoever composed these tales was no backwoods illiterate; there are shameless plunderings of stories and of graphic details from Greek and chivalric sources. Iceland in the Middle Ages was unquestionably an outpost, Ultima Thule, but the Norse and Swedish peoples were travelers, with travelers' sophistication about others.You may come to the sagas for valid reasons of historical scholarship, or with fantastic expectations based on Tolkien and such, but once you begin to look at them, you'll discover how compelling they are as \\"good reading\\"."},{"Title":"Seven Viking Romances (Penguin Classics)","review":"I was expeting something akin to the family sagas when I read this and was disipionted.

I just finished reading &quot;The Color Of Summer&quot; by the late Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas--and what a challenge it is for me to describe or assess this extraordinary work of fiction. It seems to be a hybrid of memoir, satire, and wild, hallucinatory magical realism. Maybe I should de-emphasize the term &quot;realism.&quot; Historical events are exaggerated or transmogrified by the author--often with hilarious and irreverent results. The relentless pursuit of pleasure is constantly at odds with the pursuit of power. In one chapter entitled &quot;The Garden Of Computers&quot; Arenas brilliantly satirizes the bureaucracy of informants. &quot;...denunciations, backstabbings, and betrayals of friendship were the nourishment the machines lived on.&quot; This is as brilliant as anything Dickens ever wrote about corrupt institutions. Other authors that came to mind as I read &quot;The Color Of Summer&quot; were Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, William Burroughs and, especially, Salman Rushdie. The amazing word-play in this book(in which 30 tongue twisters are interspersed)is delightful. Credit for this must surely be shared by the English translator Andrew Hurley. Sex(especially gay sex)is an obsession with most of the characters in this book-including the central tyrant Fifo(Castro). This is not a book for the timid or prudish. However, underneath it all there is a powerful affimation of the human spirit. Arenas expresses profound sadness, frustration, and anger--which cuts right through all the raucous humor. But, more than that, he imparts a sense of real joy through his characters' acts of defiance and creativity. I thoroughly recommend this book. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","review":"If the famous altarpiece of Hieronymous Bosch , similarly titled the Garden of Earthly Delights, could become words, those words would probably read much like Reinaldo Arenas' last volume. As with any fine writer (and make no bones about it, Arenas is one of the best of the Latin writers), the act of drawing an audience into a book is part enjoyment but also part labor. Plan on working to catch all the subtle metaphors and references as well as the obvious in-your-face slapstick that flows continously from these pages.Arenas' bifurcated feelings about his native Cuba are well know to the readers of his other novels: Cuba he adores - Castro he loathes. And as the author was dying from AIDS in the US he was able to concentrate all of his ambiguous responses to his native homeland into a grand guignol carnival Farewell Party. The precis for the story is the preparation for the celebration of Fifo's (thinly disguised name for Fidel Castro) &quot;50th&quot; anniversary of dictatorship. Arenas very cleverly separates his personality into three faces - Gabriel, Reinaldo, and Skunk in a Funk - in order to give us the many facets of view of living in Cuba now and before Castro. His characters are hilariously drawn campy creatures in an endless pursuit of earthly delights (aka gay sex) and if the interchange of gender pronouns (him/her) at times gets a bit overused, the premise is sound and keeps the stew bubbling. Even the atrocities attributed to &quot;Fifo&quot; are handled in sure polished slapstick that we are drawn more to laughter than to loathing. Cuba is finally liberated by being separated from its mooring to the sea floor to float out blissfully toward Europe..or....Arenas was a brilliant writer who died too young, but as this final translation of his output proves, his was a significant voice not only as a gay writer, but as a revolutionary thinker under the duress of loss of freedom that still plagues Cuba. Highly recommended book....just plan to work some and to take your time......."},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","review":"Tragic yet hilarious, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; is a bitter frolic through the lives of homosexuals in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Opening with a stunning 50-page play, the farce continues to sing throughout the remaining pages. The ill-fated sojourns of so many characters are detailed, but always with a willingness to see the humor within the suffering of men who seek pleasure despite the risk of punishment by a tyrant and his faithful firing squads. A nice piece of political commentary aimed at the seat of Castro's olive-green pants, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; reveals the leaks in the dictator's &quot;air-tight&quot; oppressive regime, leaving Castro at the center of ridicule. With wonderful character development, gleaming threads of honesty appear within the blanket of mischeivous men whose tales are told in the most amusingly crass manner."},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","review":"Amazing. Explicit. Can be hard to swallow at times. Arenas is a true reactionary artist, making you cringe at his unapologetic prose yet yern for more. I couldn't put it down.

He had to write this story, what?, seven times? It was confiscated, stolen, and lost over and over. And he re-wrote it over and over, until he could escape to freedom and finally see it in print. The story is a scream of queer humor atop the most tragic background of brutal state repression. Yet, in a way that only imprisoned Cubans seem to know how to do, his pride and dignity survive."},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","review":"This is one of the most unusual and wonderful books that I have had the pleasure of reading. This book begins with a play then has many small chapters, filled with wit, humor, and all manner of unbeleivable images. Reinaldo makes no apologies for his sexual leanings, or spare the feeling of the dictator Fifo (Fidel Castro) or his brother Raul. Many people are mentiond by name, and many have mulitiple names, sometimes male, sometimes female. This book is enertaining, tittilating, and wonderful. I would reccomend this book to anyone, but not for children. There are some extremely strong sexual images. Read it, it is truely unique.

He had enormous influence on twentieth centry type founding, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of type. It's a fascinating subject, partly because type design, more than just about any other art, is vividly aware of its own past, and is inextricably bound up with commerce.Up to about p.38, this book keeps the promise of its title, the search for a \\"scientific\\" classification system (a teeth-gritting misuse of the word). It discusses the history of letter forms as they appeared in cast type. The second essay also discusses one strand in the tapestry of calligraphy's history.After that point, however, Morison seems to switch gears. Gradually at first, he mentions earlier commentators on typography. By the end of the first essay, the topic is wholly the history of such commentaries, making this a history of typographic histories. It's a great starting point for someone about to embark on an academic study, but of limited use to the practicing typographer.It's brief, though, and still interesting to any reader wanting to know more about the typography's history.

(Don't ask why...she just really wants to learn them) I saw this book being used by the 10th graders at the local private school and I was very impressed. The organization of words into groups with similar meanings is fabulous. It really helps you to talk about those \\"shades of meaning\\" that you get with different word choices. Of course, these are not the most difficult of the SAT words, but I think it is perfect for the average to above average student. The highly gifted child who is taking the SAT as a senior should probably know the majority of these words already, but for most students I think it is perfect.HERE IS THE TRUE SECRET to the vocab section. Go through the entire 10 test prep book and underline each and every word that you do not know. (The college board book with the cheap grey paper, costs about 20 bucks). Then make 3x5 cards.

Writing within the impossible crime/locked room genre of detective/mystery fiction, Carr is a guy who piles it on, like a rococo architect, elaboration on top of elaboration. Often, once he's set the scene with a fantastic crime, just as you begin to understand it, he's hit you with another one - and perhaps another. The Crooked Hinge is the story of in imposter, which becomes a story of a suicide/murder, all the while weaving through hints of the supernatural. You get hints of where the detection is going, only to have them pulled out from under you with new disclosures and new directions. In short, this, and most other Carr stories, are not for the 'cozy mystery' set. You don't get three red herrings and a murderer - you get a crime that can't possibly have happened, no matter who the villain might be, and just when you think you're starting to understand, you'll be blindfolded and spun around. If you don't like these sorts of elaborate puzzle-mysteries, you probably won't like Carr. If you do, Carr's the master, and The Crooked Hinge is one of his masterpieces."},{"Title":"The crooked hinge","review":"John Dickson Carr's popular mystery, The Crooked Hinge (1938), is often found on lists of the greatest classics of detective fiction. Nonetheless, the solution is bizarre, Byzantine, and implausible to the extreme - and thus a rather typical Carr explanation to an impossible murder. The Crooked Hinge is the eighth novel featuring Carr's popular investigator, the corpulent lexicographer, Dr. Gideon Fell.The setting is the manor Farnleigh Close near Mallingford village in Kent. The year is 1937 or 1938. The baronet, Sir John Farnleigh, is accused of being an impostor, a masquerader, and a fraud. The challenger claims that he himself is the actual Sir John Farnleigh, and that the fraudulent Farnleigh had left him as a young boy for dead years ago on the Titanic. A contentious evening ends unexpectedly in death. Was it suicide or murder? And is the true Sir John Farnleigh now alive or dead?John Farleigh is found face down in a shallow pool with his throat slashed. Independent witnesses claim that no one was near him. No weapon was found. Complicating matters, a thumbograph, an early fingerprint record that would have identified the true Sir John Farleigh, was stolen during the confusion.As the investigation proceeds, supernatural elements intrude, that is, rumors of a local witches coven as well the appearance of a repulsive, hag-like, mechanical contraption - an eighteen century automaton - that had been locked away in an attic for many years. In keeping with the rules of a Golden Age mystery, Carr's solutions do not rely on supernatural events, but he does enjoy creating a suspenseful atmosphere that clearly hints at the supernatural.The Crooked Hinge was reissued in 1976 in hardback (ISBN 0891630260) by The Mystery Library, a publication of the University of California, San Diego Press. The introduction and end notes by Robert Briney are interesting, but what makes this edition valuable is its extensive checklist of the numerous novels and short stories by John Dickson Carr (as well as those published under his byline, Carter Dickson).I always have difficulty ranking John Dickson Carr's mysteries. I thoroughly enjoy the stories, but the solutions are often so convoluted as to be implausible. And yet, I always come back for more. The Crooked Hinge is among Carr's best, along with The Burning Court and The Three Coffins (also titled The Hollow Man)."},{"Title":"The crooked hinge","review":"It's honestly suspenseful, with little of the tedious interruptions that slow down the story in later books. It's scary, too, really frightening when Brian looks out the window and finds the automaton sitting balefully in the middle of Madeleine's garden.Best of all, the ending is a surprise, a shocker. Often when i read Carr I feel that he's been so busy putting together an impossible crime that he allows \\"any old suspect\\" to be the killer, but here THE CROOKED HINGE has an almost Agatha Christie feel, it is really the \\"least likely suspect\\" who commits the crime.Does Carr play fair with the reader? He may think so, but I don't. For example, how many times does Dr Fell assure Brian and the constabulary that \\"only one person\\" was responsible for all of the crimes? And then, the final chapter tells a very different story, doesn't it? (Fell says it was necessary to prevaricate in order to smoke out the more heinous of the killers. But that isn't playing fair, if you ask me.)One note that may amuse, during the flashback sequences, during the struggle of the two John Farnleighs during the sinking of the doomed TITANIC, I kept waiting for Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet to float through and say hi, or perhaps to rescue our heroes from their watery fate.The writing of THE CROOKED HINGE is so good that we forget that the whole premise of the book depends on an amazing, unbuyable coincidence, that one of the two John Farnleighs would consult the other on a professional errand without realizing who he was? No way, I don't think so! (I don't think I've spoiled anything by divulging that much.) Carr's mysteries are always subtle, a disturbance of the atmosphere."},{"Title":"The crooked hinge","review":"This is one of John Dickson Carr's best mysteries. I spent several years tracking down copies of his work and reading them. The Crooked Hinge has his eery supernatural creepiness, the historical trivia, and a false heir. Gideon Fell is not my favorite Carr creation. I like his wildly eccentric Sir Henry Merrivale, but this is best one with Gideon Fell. I must admit the cover art for this edition strikes me as poor art and it also gives out too many plot points. I suppose the Titanic connection would help sell books, so they include pictures of the ship on the cover. But the hinge cannot possibly resemble the \\"hinge\\" in the book!If the book helps you find other John Dickson Carr books, you really should buy it.

Published in 1938, the book has an interesting premise; two men--survivors of the 1912 Titanic sinking--both claim to be the heir to a title and estate in the English county of Kent. At a showdown meeting between the claimants, one of them dies, and although there are witnesses, it is initially impossible to determine whether the death is suicide or murder.From the claimant's death onward, the story is crammed with arcane dialogue and little other action. My biggest problem with this short book is the stilted and opaque language that doesn't allow any real flow to the story. A second criticism is the lack of flesh and blood in the characters. They have no credibility as living people with personal stories, and when they speak, their language is alternately blustering, convoluted or hysterical. This is the antithesis of an Agatha Christie mystery of the same period, where the plot is advanced by open and meaningful dialogue. At \\"Hinge's\\" end, the whole tortured mess is brought to a close by an improbable letter from the killer who sums up in numbing detail how crimes were committed and for what reason.My advice is to avoid this book and the stick with Agatha Christie, if you want a period mystery."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"Picked this up at a used book store in Georgia last year and just now got around to reading it.

The brothers relate stories of their unconventional childhood with their single mother and MIA father as well as offer present day anecdotes about their entertaining guests, neighbors, and pets. Also interspersed throughout the book are recommended reading lists such as &quot;Hector's List of Favorite Authors for the Bath.&quot;This quirky, whimsical novel is ideally suited to be a reading group selection and likely to be enjoyed by any book lover."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"The Bachelor Brothers Bed &amp; Breakfast remains one of my top five books. The sequel falls right behind it, and in fact, is even funnier than the first. U.S. readers may not be familiar with Mr. Richardson who is well known across Canada as one of the funniest and most interesting of the talk show hosts on C.B.C. radio. The novel has, I think, a Canadian quality to it, but in all respects, any lover of books, good humour, and exellent writing will enjoy this book. It is not a &quot;deep&quot; read but still witty, thoughtful, and by no means &quot;fluffy&quot;. Bill Richardson has been referred to as a Canadian Garrison Keillor. The comparison is likely not incorrect, but from my perspective, Richardson is much funnier. Buy BOTH this book and the sequel (don't wait because you will indeed want to read the next one) for a fun, enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"This is such a wonderful book! It was one of the few books that I've read that I actually laughed out loud. The best part is when I tried to describe it to others, the characters seemed even more eccentric and loveable, even though the people I was telling it to thought it sounded insane. Richardson writes in a gentle way, never knocking you over the head with his attempts to be witty or clever. Who can't read the chapter about the disastrous Halloween party without doubling over? All in all, a wonderful, fun book for a rainy Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I was browsing the local (independant) bookstore shelves the other day and this little gem veritably leapt off the shelves into my hand. I read over the back cover and was sufficiently intrigued to carry it to the till and purchase it. I must say it's one of the best buys I've made in a long time. This book has been described as whimsical - I find this little paperback a work of comic genius. It is no surprise to me that it was awarded the Stephen Leacock Award... it's a well deserved win.The ever-endearing Canadian charm that holds us in high esteem about the world shines through this brilliant penning. It is laugh-out-loud funny... particularly the eccentric Mrs. Rochester. One of my fave sections of the book is the birthday serenade by bagpipes. Thankfully I hadn't finished my coffee and needed a toilet break whilst reading that segment. Brilliant writing and my kudos to Mr. Richardson. I look forward to reading more of his work. 'Bachelor Brothers' has instantly become one of my all-time favorite novels. Can't recommend this title highly enough!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"For those of us who do not prefer to read grizzly horror novels, but instead clever, amusing stories that de-stress us on work breaks or ease us gently into sleep....this is a great book! I've read it four times - and it has become a bedside favorite. Ignore the cynical Kirkus review above...everyone I know has loved this book and has passed it along to a friend."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I picked this book up off the shelf of the library partly because I could not find anything better to read. What I found was a treasure. I don't know why this book isn't better known. I laughed out loud in quite a few parts. It was refreshing to find a book that was funny and smart without being vulgar and too cynical. (Not that cynical is such a bad thing.) Anyway, I can't wait to read the sequal. Being a bibliomaniac myself, I was delighted with the snippets of poetry and book lists in between. You've got to read this. If you like this, you might try P.G. Wodehouse or James Herriott."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I love Bill Richardson! I just caught up with the Bachelor Brothers; it is rare for me to laugh out loud while reading, but this book and one of its sequels had me roaring. All I could think was, &quot;How can I start a similar bed and breakfast?&quot; It is touching, funny, literate -- a real bibliophile's delight. Nuts to Kirkus Reviews for not liking the lists (bathroom reading, bathtub reading, etc.); I was very grateful for them. Hector and Virgil rock!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I'm a great fan of Barbara Pym, Emily Eden, Margaret Oliphant, Anthony Trollope, PG Wodehouse, and similar writers of gentle (and not-so-gentle) social humor. When I found this book, then, I was pleased to find another promising author that seemed to fit this type.The first chapter was amusing enough, written from one of the Bachelor Brother's points of view. Richardson has some very nice turns of phrase and is very good with his imagery. He's also skilled at changing the &quot;voice&quot; of the narrator for each chapter. The book very quickly palled for me after that first chapter, though, and it quickly became just a tedious read. I found the characters uninteresting, the setting only mildly engaging, and the overall lack of plot dull.Fortunately, it was also a very short book, which is good for anyone who has to finish whatever book they start. As light summer reading, one could do worse that this light-weight volume, but one could undoubtedly also do better."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I love the wonderful 'play on words' which is delightfully scattered throughout this book. I enjoyed the paperback version so well that I ordered the audio version for my father to hear during long car trips. The audio is great! I recommend this book in any medium. Very entertaining. The sequel is also good."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I stumbled across this wonderful book and hesitated buying, and I'm glad I ended up taking it home. My husband and I shared reading this book outloud to each other, and there were times I couldn't read because I was laughing so hard. It's a perfect book for reading at the beach, or up at the lake cabin. The characters gelled together so well and the authors style of writing was delightful. The chapters were short and I looked forward to each escapade. The list of &quot;good reads&quot; was helpful to me. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found it quite unique. I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"It's a light read--slow paced yet easy to digest, and quirky enough to be worthwile."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"This book was suggested to our reading group because of its rave reviews. I felt that this book had no character development, no story and had very little to offer. Even the writing style was weak. Why was this novel so highly recommended when there are so many enriching book to encounter?"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"This book was well-written but too &quot;cute&quot;. The author tried a bit too hard to make each character an eccentric. While I consider myself well-read, the numerous literary references grew tiresome. It is simply not an interesting book and one I quit reading before reaching the end."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"What a stupid book! I was expecting a good read, but the writing was pretentious and pedantic and the plot was pointless. I'm so disappointed!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I have to admit, I'm easy to please. Great audio books are few and far between, but the writing, the reading, the tone and the stories on these cds were to me pretentious and overbearing. Save yourself the money and buy a classic. I enjoyed the &quot;seabiscuit&quot; story on Cd. Get that. I should have known better. Was it quaint? Maybe. Interesting or well done- no. I'd have more fun just reading a log book from an inn than listening to this again."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"This is a GREAT story, brilliantly written. The audio version is a let down.It is titled 'unabridged' but parts of the book ARE missing. For instance when we first meet Mrs. Rochester - in the book we get a few paragraphs about Virgil & Hector's mother's dying moments. These paragraphs are censored on the audio version.While it was some curiosity value to hear the author's voice, his delivery is akin to an uninspired newsreader at times.The material means it will be good. I am sorry it is so pasteurised. It could have been so much better.B~Gal"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I read this book with delight in every page.

Don't read all at once for then it will be over too soon."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"Everyone in the story seems to be eccentric, and perhaps that's why they all fit together so well. I enjoyed the story, and the idea of place you could vacation where you'd actually have the time to read. The two lists of authors that one of the brothers offered intrigued me. And a couple of the stories that were told had me laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"What a delight &quot;The Brothers&quot; are - this and the follow up, &quot;Pillow Book&quot; are delightful to read and to give to those who love books, love life, and love off-beat lifestyles. One can, from Bill Richardson's descriptions, picture well the brothers and their guests and neighbors.Alas, I've had friends in Vancouver check and it seems the B&amp;B and the brothers are .. fictional but if one could ever find a B&amp;B of this sort, with characters that make the town lively, do pass it on."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I love this book!!! It is the only book I have ever read that I immediately wanted to re-read as soon as I finished it. My husband read it at the same time as me, he would pick it up as soon as I put it down. The book left me with a happy feeling every time I read any part of it.Bachelor Brothers' Bed & Breakfast"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"This book is a delight - an educated, hilarious romp through the stories of middle-age twin brothers, living on a remote west coast island, who run their own bed and breakfast. Chapters consisting of stories about the brothers' past are interspersed with anecdotes written by their guests. Particularly sidesplitting are the arrival at the B&amp;B of Waffle the cat, and the account of one guest's &quot;decorator&quot; robbers. Endearing characters meander their way in and out of the stories. Overall, a refreshing sense of humour prevails; it is very sad to have to put it down after the last page is read"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"Wonderfully relaxing short read. I loved the stories, the characters, visiting the idea of that kind of life vicariously. I'd read it with a cup of tea or coffee and a whole grain muffin with fruit.I read a lot, 2 to 4 books per week, depending on length of books, a lot non-fiction, but love my fiction and literature (junk too to keep up reading speed). Always have 4 or more books going at a time (no, I don't have a hard time keeping them straight). I'll remember the feeling of this little book and I do.

Reading this book is like a mini retreat in itself. Every page brings something to smile about or to reflect upon in the gentlest way. In this bed and breakfast the food is good, solitude is encouraged, yet good company is never far away. I refuse to believe this place is fictional, but then again, I keep looking for Middle Earth around every corner. This is a great gift book, sure to bring many smiles of pleasure to the bibliophiles in your life."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"This enchanting book is made up of vignettes from the points of view of two bachelor brothers who own a bed &amp; breakfast, as well as the perspectives of many of their visitors. I had a lot of trouble putting this one down because I looked forward to reading what new insights the characters might have. The format made it even more difficult to put down, as it is made up of short sections, leading me to constantly think, &quot;Just one more chapter, then I'll do something else...!&quot; I loved the observations in the book, and found myself calling up people I knew or typing short excerpts into emails just to share the delight with them. Many of the excerpts were funny, many were thoughtful, a few were sad, but all were interesting. This one is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I have just finished reading this book and am already looking for more titles by this author. It is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read - and I have read many. I loved the style of writing and the humor. I only wish I could visit that bed &amp; breakfast. It sounds like my idea of the perfect vacation. I will read this one again. And Bill Richardson, if you read this, please write more!!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"A friend gave me this book feeling that I would enjoy the way it was written and how Mr. Richardson uses language throughout. She was half right.The twists and little turns of phrase and language were enjoyable, but rare. Instead, uncommon words are used to fill the simple sentences and try to lend some weight to an unremarkable book.Otherwise, the brothers are barely distinguishable, though they have completely different mannerisms. There is nothing that grabs hold of the reader to differentiate between them or any of the guests.If I found it in a $.10 box at a yardsale, I would buy it. Otherwise, it isn't worth the cost of shipping."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I laughed so hard, I nearly bought a round of drinks! Especially the part about what the parrot said when their mum was found dead.It was that hysterical kind of laughter; you know, you think you're done laughing and then out comes another hysterical giggle. A laughing jag, I guess you'd say.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I stumbled upon a well-worn copy of this little gem while vacationing at the Pudding Pan Guesthouse on the south shore of Nova Scotia. I advise each of you to buy a copy, then rent the Pudding Pan for a week or so (902-354-4944).

There is a danger in this endeavor, however...it may cause you to question your current hectic pace of living."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"You'll be glad you checked into the Bachelor Brother's Bed &amp; Breakfast. What a delightful read! The twins Hector &amp; Virgil alternate chapters telling tidbits of information and charming stories about their lives, their b&amp;b and people they have met along the way. Thrown in are entries from guests of the B&amp;B. There are many laugh out loud moments. The pictures painted are cozy, light hearted and humorous. Reading it is like curling up into a warm quilt and spoiling yourself with a mug of hot cocoa. I can't wait to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"Bill Richardson is always brilliant. Bachelor Brothers B&amp;B is touching, whimsical, hilarious and eloquent. This is the perfect book for a rainy day at the cottage.

A great gift for book-lovers, your best friend or your grandmother."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"I first noticed the colors and fonts on the binding in the library, and that's what made me pick this book up in the first place. But at soon as I started reading I knew I would love it! One of the great things about this book is that you can open it anywhere and start reading and it's just as fun.

As other reviewers have said, I began re-reading the book immediately upon finishing it! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast","review":"Some of the small moments are cute in this book but I wouldn't recommend it as a must-read.

The title immediately made me smile, so I read it. The contents didn't disappoint.Heimel writes about women, PMS, and even compares differing reactions to porno movies depending on the sex of the viewer. (No pun intended.) The book is hysterical - I've read the list of things men want out loud to many people, but while the subjects are written humorously, they aren't exactly untrue....So laugh if you like (I know I did), but according to my own independant poll, men really do want a lady in the living room and a sex-starved tiger in the bedroom!"},{"Title":"If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?!","review":"This hilarious book hides some hard hitting truths about our relationships, insecurities, doubts &amp; regrets, and helped me get through a nasty breakup without going back. Every time I felt tempted to call him, I'd read a chapter &amp; be laughing too hard at seeing the ridiculous nature of my relationships boldly outlined with laugh-at-myself-and-heal humor. After a breakup is when I feel the most depressed, taking life way too seriously! This book had me laughing the whole way, or smirking, chuckling, snorting, almost-peed-myself, non-stop, nodding-my-head, giggling. Whenever I'd get upset about a man, I'd read a few pages &amp; it was like seeing the guy naked to the core--and myself too (because we're not so innocent either)! I now have the whole set of books this author has written, the humor is timeless &amp; there will always be breakups or jerks who make my hair stand on end, and this book helps release the pressure of taking life too darn seriously."},{"Title":"If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?!","review":"I really wanted to like this book. With a great title like that, I expected it to be a comic look at the relations between men and women, likely coming hard down on the side of women. Instead, it is a mismash of New York angst mixed with the fading regret of yet another runaway from the 60s. In short, choppy doses (each section was originally published as individual essays in Playboy, Cosmopolitan, or The Village Voice), Heimel raves against the world, but not of it ever is funny enough to make you laugh out loud or close enough for that frission of understanding to occur. Oh, you might be able to identify with her if you are a single mother of a teenage son who supports herself by writing in Manhattan, but I wouldn't take bets on it.The essays are grouped into sections labled \\"The Times,\\" \\"Women,\\" \\"Men,\\" \\"Women and Men,\\" and \\"The Writer's Life.\\" The best stuff is in \\"The Times\\" such as \\"Notes on Black\\" about how all the trendy people who were the originators of the black look are conspiring to forgo it for another color until all the sheep quit wearing it, then they'll go back. The worst stuff is in \\"The Writer's Life,\\" which should instead have been entitled \\"Cynthia Heimel's Life\\" because I saw nothing there that resembled any other writer I know.I guess I looked in the wrong place. I had noticed that I had a lot of comic stuff by men on my shelf, but nothing by a woman, so I browsed the shelves and came up with this. I'm not necessarily a fan of the comic essay (Dave Barry probably being the prime example of it today, and whom I can read but I never feel like purchasing a whole volume of his stuff). In essays, I tend to like humorous political commentary (say Molly Ivins or P.J. O'Rourke) better than Andy Rooney style essays on the little things of life. Instead I should have picked up comic fiction by a woman, I guess--except I'm not aware of any. Zora Neale Huston? Anyway, with due apologies to Heimel, I can live without her."},{"Title":"If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?!","review":"Cynthia Heimel's &quot;If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?&quot; is a collection of her columns from the Village Voice, Playboy, and Cosmo. The book is half painful wisdom, half male-oriented feminist anger, and half fall-on-the-floor-laugh-out-loud comedy. If you think that doesn't add up right, you haven't taken into account that anger can be funny, and sometimes even wise. The columns date from the 1980's and are totally New York oriented, so if you don't think the Big Apple is the center of the universe you may find yourself annoyed, and the discussion of drug use will profoundly disturb some. But Heimel's not out to offend--she's just an urban divorced mother trying to live a worthwhile life. She's caught in the crossfire of mindless masculinity and rabid feminism, looking for a safe place for a love life, a job, and a family. Her most moving columns are about her son, and &quot;Childhood is Powerful&quot; should be required reading for prospective parents. In it, she talks about guilt, and how honesty with your child is more important than parental authority; and how limits must not be placed on your child in order to create that authority. &quot;As much as love, empathy cures all evils.&quot; And &quot;For Rent: Empty Nest&quot; is a tear-and-smile inducing bit of writing that will resonate with every mother. &quot;If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?&quot; isn't a perfect book, but it's bite-sized slices of life are well worth the price of admission, especially if your date is paying!"},{"Title":"If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?!","review":"...kept it because the book did too! Fun, easy, thought provoking, good to have stashed in the purse for a train ride or a nice afternoon read."},{"Title":"If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?!","review":"Heimel is brilliant. I do love her work. Her essay on &quot;Clothes and PMS&quot;, included in this book, stands as one of the funniest things I have ever read (&quot;I am a symphony of reds!&quot; she sings, before she is saved from herself). Her slightly embittered, I-don't-even-want-to-know approach to life rings true.The only place the book sags is when it tries to be too serious. Heimel should stick to comedy. Some people just can't be trusted with biting social commentary. About a third of the book seems to fall within this category. I skipped most of that. But the rest is pure genius, with insight and wit."},{"Title":"If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?!","review":"I read this book just recently and laughed at many of the sections.

In this installment, C.S Forrester's indomitable charactor is sent away with a very &quot;daunting set of orders&quot; to the Pacific coast of the Central American isthmus, being instructed to aid an insane land-owner in a revolt against Spanish control, to open up a route across the isthmus, and to encourage trade- all under the menace of the Spanish 50- gun ship, the Natividad.CSF reaches his pinnacle with several stunning single- ship duels in which Hornblower pitts his diminutive but capable 36- gun Lydia against the fearsome Natividad.These are, by far, the best battles in the series, and that's saying a lot.And then, of course, there is yet another problem for HH- the quick- witted and determinded Lady Barbara, to whom the captain must pledge a passage to England, although already harrassed by the turns of fortune he previously had to endure."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This book (often collected with \\"Ship of the Line\\" and \\"Beat to Quarters\\" as \\"Captain Horatio Hornblower\\" is the best \\"boy's\\" adventure book ever, the gold standard by which all others are measured. It inspired, among others, O'Brien's Aubrey, Cornwell's Sharpe, Kent's Bolitho, and Weber's Harrington. It works perfectly as a sea story and romance, as the middle class Hornblower, Captain of the Lydia, meets and falls in love with Lady Barbara, the sister to the Duke of Wellington. Along the way he battles enemies of superior force, overcoming them as well as his own inferiority complex. Historical detail is superb and this book, as well as the series as a whole, is a superb introduction to the Napoleonic period, particularly class society in Britain. Forester passed away before he could write to Trafalgar, but Hornblower and the Atropos has a lovely description of Lord Nelson's funeral that I remember vividly 39 years later and used as a guide on a recent trip to London last month."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This book definitely ranks among my favorite books ever, which puts it up with scifi pageturners like Ender's Game and classics such as LOTR and Dune. For the warfare, military history, or historical fiction enthusiast, this is a must read...the ship to ship duel between the Lydia and the Natividad is honestly one of the best military engagements I have read, it spares no reader the intensity and gore inherent in naval battles of the period, and is all told from the unique pespective of Hornblower, our intellectual, talented, yet insecure protagonist."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"BEAT TO QUARTERS is the first Horatio Hornblower novel that C. S. Forester wrote, though it takes place sixth chronologically. This novel is set during the Napoleonic Wars off the west coast of Central America. Hornblower and his crew are exposed to danger because of the shifting political realities back in Europe, and to complicate matters, Hornblower is forced to accept a British noblewoman as a passenger.I suggest reading this novel before reading others in the series because it really introduces Hornblower and his personality. Forester presents Hornblower as an outwardly confident and taciturn British captain who inwardly is at war with his own perceived inadequacies. Read this book first, then readShip of the Line (Hornblower Saga)andFlying Colours (Hornblower Saga). After that read some of the earlier books to experience the fun of seeing how Hornblower became Hornblower.BEAT TO QUARTERS is a fast-paced novel with many scenes of naval engagement. Forester's description at times can be quite technical for the layman, and often I found myself understanding nothing of his descriptions, e.g., a significant rearranging of the ship's rigging. Amazingly, in spite of my lack of comprehension, I didn't find these passages boring. Instead I read them with the realization that if I had been witnessing the maneuvers, I would have been just as bewildered by what was going on. Forester is at his best when he's depicting the workings of the British navy (and its socio-political realities). His portraits of these sailors at all ranks is very compelling and helps to create sympathy in the reader. Forester also doesn't shy away from the gritty realities of naval life, nor does he shy away from its mundane aspects (aspects that he describes rather interestingly).The one thing that I didn't like about this book, which certainly won't irk every reader, is Forester's annoying habit of narrating the events from the modern perspective. For example, Forester writes, \\"The phrase 'globe trotting' with all its disparaging implications, had not yet been invented, but it expressed exactly Hornblower's feeling about her.\\" And another example, \\"The day was yet to come when Florence Nightingale was to make nursing a profession in which women could engage.\\" Every time I came across an anachronistic description like these I winced inwardly. Other than these infelicities, I felt that Forester evinced a good prose style, and he is especially adept at fleshing out characters."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"For new readers to the Hornblower saga, this is the book to start with, even though it's not the first book chronologically. It introduces many main characters, like Leutienant Bush, Lady Barbara Wellesley, and of course, Horatio himself."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"I purchased this book because I could not get it as an E book for my reader ( the other brand ). It was in good condition for a used book, and got delivered faster than I expected."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This is not a bad book or story, but the love interest angle that develops here turns out (in later books) to be too lucky. But, the story is quite decent otherwise."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"A good match for the \\"Sharpe\\" series of Napoleonic War stories set on the land (largely). You should start with the first of the series and read right through. Well written and interesting situations."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Forester eventually backtracked and wrote four books set in Hornblower's earlier career. This book introduces two important characters: Lt. Bush and Lady Barbara. Before reading the series I had already read all 20 of the \\"Master and Commander\\" books by Patrick O'Brian. When I finished that series I never thought I would meet characters as interesting Jack Aubrey or Stephen Maturin. I was wrong. Hornblower, Bush and Lady Barbara keep me asking for more. I am on the 9th book in the series, and I am going to be as depressed as I was when I finish number 11 as I was when I finished O'Brian's 20th."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This was my first Hornblower book but I intend to plow through his whole canon, because this book was arguably one of the best sea stories I've ever read. Hornblower is a complex, wonderful character and Forester is at his best when he is dealing with the nuances and internal dialogs of the man. Suspense starts building on the first few pages and by the end, the reader is satisfied that he has read a captivating masterpiece. I love sea stories but my favorites have mostly been tales of modern seafaring. This book takes us to the British-Spanish sea battles of the early 17th century. Forester's battle descriptions are deftly done and graphic. Not only does he show the pain of war, but he masterfully shows us life aboard the massive sailing ship. There's even a hint of romance in this book which, for a disciplined captain like Hornblower, can be as challenging as battle. A very well done book. An excellent introduction to what I am certain will be a most delightful series of books."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"If you're new to the Hornblower series, start with this one. Then read Ship of the Line, then Flying Colors. The three are practically a triptych, whereas the others all feel like they have space between them. Also, since Forester actually wrote Beat To Quarters first, there's in 'introductory' quality to it that no other book in the series has. The series compares favorably with the Aubrey/Maturin series I think. Odd that they were both cut short by the deaths of their respective authors.In short, start with this and the next two as a trilogy, then proceed in any order you want."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"...or, to be more precise, I sat within yards of a major Civil War re-enactment so engrossed in this book that I managed to ignore artillery and musket fire. I am a big fan of the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian, but previously looked down my nose at Hornblower, I think because I knew it solely from TV and movies. This book never slows down for a minute--not just battles but ship repair and revictualling seem gripping in the hands of Forester.Based on the films, I was not expecting Hornblower to show much internal life--he always seems to be superhuman on screen, but in the book he must struggle with his softer nature to develop his imperious style. Likewise I expected nothing interesting in the way of female characters, but it was a happy surprise to find Lady Barbara Wellesley on board ship.If you will forgive a few O'Brian/Forrester comparisons: O'Brian is funnier. Forrester's battle scenes are a bit easier for me to follow. Hornblower is a more interesting or at least complex character than Aubrey, but O'Brian has the advantage of Maturin, who not only adds character but allows for dialogue rather than the perennial internal monologues Hornblower has with himself because he has no one of rank to talk to.I hope that more seasoned readers of the series will agree with this appeal to newer readers: Even if you have read neither author, this book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"I first read BEAT TO QUARTERS when I borrowed it from a public library in 1940. It is now 1998 and the third copy of the book is in my book case, the other two copies, being paper-backs, having been read until worn out.I might add that, in my opinion, any aspiring writer would do well to read Forester, not to copy his style, but to realise that any good author can entertain, but only the great can enthrall; and only the greatest can make you &quot;see&quot; a character (even a minor one) in only two short lines of print.His death robbed the reading world of one of its most readable authors."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Although it was the first book C.S. Forester wrote, Beat To Quarters is chronologically the sixth book in the Hornblower Series. One can see instantly why the series took off when this book hit the press. It is not only a thrilling adventure but establishes a depth of character rarely seen in its genre.This book is the first of a trilogy of connected titles that cover Horatio's rise from an unknown frigate's captain to one of the most famous officers in the Royal Navy. Posted to duty west of Central America, he is expected to navigate not only the water of the Pacific, but the troubled political waters of rebellion and shifting alliances that characterized the Napoleonic wars. He's required to engage a ship of twice his might not once but three times. And of course, he meets Lady Barbara -- destined to become one of the most intruiging characters in his life.I was surprised to find little discontinuity with the &quot;prequel&quot; books that were written after Beat to Quarters. The book almost seamlessly blends with the cannon of Horatio's life, referencing his previous adventures with the Castilla and Captain Pellow. The only real continuity problem is that Bush seems to have lost his memory of the events in the second and third books.This books works because it doesn't try to confine itself to a simple genre. It is, of course, a splendid action adventure and wonderful historical fiction. But it also works as a simple character drama -- establishing three powerful characters -- the taciturn Hornblower, efervescent Bush and charming Barbara -- and creates memorable scenes built solely from conversation and interaction."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"The first Hornblower book that Forester wrote, and the best. Exciting action, wonderful characterization--particularly Hornblower himself, who is a three-dimensional human with failings, not a cardboard cutout action hero--and even a bit of romance for those who like that sort of thing (me! me!). The scenes with Hornblower and Lady Barbara were so evocative and delightful--I felt as if I was sitting on the deck with them under the stars, listening to their conversations. I would recommend that the series be read in chronological order of Hornblower's career, rather than the order in which Forester wrote them, but BTQ is the jewel in the crown."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Hornblower series are not bad. Unfortunately, I read Aubrey/Maturin (which is much, much better) first. Basically, one could classify the Hornblower series as very good adventure, as opposed to Aubrey/Maturin, which could be classified as very good literature. I started with Midshipman Hornblower, which is probably the best book in the series, and recommend the sequence of reading published on the cover of the books. If you have not read O'Brien yet - good for you!! Start with Hornblower to warm up (it's only 11 books), and then sink your teeth in Master and Commander of Aubrey/Maturin (20 books)."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"One of the strengths of the C.S. Forester series about Horatio Hornblower is that Hornblower's character is developed in great depth in a variety of different ways in each book. Beat to Quarters places Hornblower at the center of a spectrum between madness and mental incapacity on the one hand, and being ruled by the emotions and passion on the other hand. Hornblower finds it quite challenging to deal with both extremes, and you will enjoy reading about his reactions.To make the story even more delicious, it involves a series of misadventures based on the slowness and uncertainty of communications. Those who have studied the War of 1812 will probably remember that the Battle of New Orleans was fought well after the British and Americans had already made peace. But the word had not yet gotten to New Orleans. Similar issues are involved in this book.Unlike most of the other books in the series, Beat to Quarters will probably be as appealing to female readers as to male ones. For over half of the book, Lady Barbara Wellesley is a central character. Unlike the earlier books where male-female relations are made as simple and brief as possible, Beat to Quarters shows how two outstanding people of opposite sexes might come to respect and appreciate each other, despite vast differences in their circumstances and social standing.Beat to Quarters is an extremely important book in the series, because it sets up major plot developments in Ship of the Line (the next book chronologically in Hornblower's life in the series) which many people feel is the best action book that Mr. Forester wrote about Hornblower.If you have not yet read any of the Hornblower novels, I strongly urge you to begin with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and continue through in the order of Hornblower's chronological life, rather than the order in which the books were written. Mr. Forester went back and added books here and there in the chronology, later in his life.How can you keep your focus strong, by balancing your emotions and thoughts? What benefits will you achieve? When should you be willing to let emotion reign?"},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Beat to Quarters is the sixth book in the eleven book series covering the exploits of Horatio Hornblower. It is also, in my opinion, the best one out of the ones I have read. It's story flows from one point to the next and there is plenty of action in this installment.The first thing I should mention is that Mr. Forrester's description of life onboard a War Ship is quite accurate. Being a member of today's Navy, it's amazing to see just how little has changed in 200 years. Sure, the ships are made of steel, we have satellite communications, etc... However, much has remained the same. We still spend hour after hour cleaning the ship, drilling for action, etc... and Mr. Forrester does a wonderful job capturing this.The second thing about this novel I enjoyed was the description of the battle between the Spanish Warship and Hornblower's Frigate. I was on the edge of my seat wondering how Captain Hornblower would be able to win a battle against the much more powerful Spanish ship. I'm sure you will enjoy this book for these reasons and many others. IF you like good historial Drama then I would HIGHLY recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Though 'Beat to Quarters' falls in the middle of the Hornblower series it was the first written, as well as one of the best. The story takes place when Hornblower is ordered to assist colonial Spanish rebels. After defeating a Spanish warship and handing the vessel over to the rebels Hornblower recieves shocking news: Napoleon has invaded Spain. Now that Spain has become Britian's ally Hornblower must reagain control of the Spanish warship from the rebels and give it back to the rightful owners. The action that follows is the naval adventure that author C. S. Forester is known for. Also, Forester throws his gallant protagonist a curve ball by introducing him to Lady Pamela Wellesely, sister of the Duke of Wellington. The attraction is sudden and unexpected but more than a little complicated. One of the best novels in the series, 'Beat to Quarters' is consistantly exciting and absolutly entertaining.

If I had a son, I would encourage him to read them when he was old enough. In THIS age, they convey true integrity, along with true courage...Oh yeah, and true adventure! Not just combat adventure, but how the characters in the political world of the Imperial Navy of the 1800's can appreciate the humility, modesty, and dedication of one of their own.And as many have said before me, the detail is incredible, as if Forester was there.

I finally took the time to order the 1st book and experience it myself. My background as a long time boater (sail) and having worked as a commercial fisherman endear all maritime books anyway. I found this first Hornblower novel by Forester to be a quick and enjoyable read - very detailed in the life aboard a British Naval frigate and Hornblower wins the reader over as he display's the many offsets between normal human vulnerabilities and the rigors of command. I highly recommend reading this book before watching \\"Master and Commander\\" it provides a wonderful primer to the film. I chose to read the 1st novel written as opposed to keeping with chronological order of Hornblowers career - I'm not sure if it makes a difference.

The first was Mr. Midshipman Hornblower. This is the sixth book that I have read.Now that I have read this book and if I was asked which order to read them, I could argue for either way. This book does an excellent job introducing Hornblower and leaves you wondering what adventures he had prior to the events of this book. I'm happy with the order that I read the books, but would have been just as happy reading them in the order written.The major item that seemed like a discrepancy from the earlier books is that Lt. Bush seemed to be a new acquaintance of his on this voyage, though the other books showed that they had a long history together.Either way, I can see why this book started a whole series of sequels. It is great story telling with interesting characters and great lessons on seamanship. I highly recommend this book to lovers of action and adventure who like a thinking hero."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Although Midshipman Hornblower describes the beginning of Horatio Hornblower's naval career, Beat to Quarters was the first Hornblower book that Forester wrote. As a result, it stands well on its own, and doesn't require any background provided by the other books in the series. It is also a much better book than Midshipman Hornblower. For want of a better comparison, Midshipman Hornblower introduces and describes the character, whereas Beat to Quarters truly develops the character.Additionally, Beat to Quarters is simply a compelling read. Hornblower begins by sailing his ship to the Pacific coast of Central America, where he is to foment a rebellion against Spain. His mission is complicated by the rapidly changing diplomatic situation in Europe, which causes many plot twists. We are also introduced to an interesting lady, whose presence threatens to complicate Horatio's own domestic tranquility. Throughout, Horatio Hornblower is an intriguing character, and this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"The entire series of the Hornblower books are a must read. Forester was able to tell stories that had no boring sections, unlike Master and Commander, a book written of the same period and about the same types of life. This was Forester's first book of the series, but I think it is best to start with the first of the eleven books, all paper back and all done by the same publisher with the same type of cover illustrations. I read the entire series many years ago and found a fair number of inconsistencies based largely on the fact things happened in the books covering Horblower's earlier life that were not considered when Forester started the series. Some still remain, such as Hornblower's ability to speak French. As a younger officer he spoke it well. Later, he knows only a few words. Still, the books are so excellent it is best to overlook the inconsistencies."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"\\"Beat to Quarters\\" was the first book that C.S.

This book is full of diplomatic intrigue and naval action and serves as a great introduction to the series (although you should not start with this book if you want to read them in chronological order).This was the first Horatio Hornblower book that I read, although I had seen the A&E; TV series. As a devotee of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, I was pleasantly surprised with this Hornblower book and I found Hornblower a much more authentic character than the superman of the TV series. Still, it is hard for me not to compare Hornblower with Captain Aubrey: although I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I find Aubrey a much more fun and likable character than Hornblower. Hornblower is a much more serious and deep character who is driven by self-doubt.This is a very good book, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in naval warfare or historical fiction. It is a great account of naval life and warfare during the Napoleonic era. C.S.

ForesterBeat To Quarters is the best account of an adventure at sea that I have ever read. It's part of a series by C.S. Forester, about Captain Horatio Hornblower, a sea captain who must fight his inner self to appear the iron-nerved, quiet, model captain that he wants his crew to see. Inside, he is a talkative, nervous, and incredibly smart man who has worked his way up the levels of sea faring.In this book, he must fight with his inner self as he performs many missions for the British government. It's the year 1808, and Captain Hornblower is sent to a country in Central America to congregate with an insane leader that goes by the name of El Supremo, to try to start a rebellion against the Spanish. After capturing a Spanish ship with almost twice the size, guns, and men as his named the Natividad, and giving it to El Supremo, Captain Hornblower is told that the British are no longer at war with the Spanish, and that he must re-seize the ship and stop the rebellion. Captain Hornblower continues to follow the almost impossible orders of the British, using his remarkable seamanship, while also carrying a British noblewoman onboard for a trip back to England. Through all these incredible tasks, he manages to stay alive, keep his self-image, and win the heart of every sailor in his crew.Beat To Quarters is an excellent book, and although it is not the first book in it's series chronologically, it was the first written and so possesses an introductory quality that the other books don't. I would recommend this book to any reader who wants to read a remarkable account of a sea adventure, even if you haven't read any other books in the series. This book is a great, exciting read, and the author C.S. Forester did a superb job writing it."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This was the first Hornblower novel written. The original Hornblower motion picture was based on this novel and the following two novels (\\"Ship of the Line\\" and \\"Flying Colours\\"). The author later went back to fill in the details of Hornblower's early career, explaining the early relationship with Bush, etc. You could actually start reading the novels with this one, but it is better to start with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, and follow Hornblower's career from the beginning. C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a fictional biography of Hornblower which fills in a fictional account of his early life. C.S. Forester later wrote \\"the Hornblower Companion\\" which should probably be acquired when you start reading the series.Hornblower is sent off to the Pacific to aid a revolutionary leader who is in rebellion against Spain (an enemy of my enemy is my friend), a dangerous practice (Germany later aided Lenin to start the Russian Revolution during World War I). After arming the revolutionary army, and capturing a Spanish ship which he gives to the rebel leader (who has him under the guns of a fortress), he discovers that Spain is no longer at war with England. Slow communications across the ocean caused many miscues during that historical period.Having turned loose a rebel army, Hornblower now finds he is allied with Spain, and must now fight the rebel army he created. He must retake the ship which he had captured and turned over to the rebels. He is fortunate that the rebel leader is not a seaman, and prevails at some cost in casualties.Hornblower also acquires a romantic interest, meeting the woman he later marries as his second wife (see Commodore Hornblower), a woman with considerable influence at court. As usual with Hornblower, he gets no prize money but lots of official recognition, so starts out in the next novel as a financially poor captain in command of a ship of the line.The three novels, \\"Beat to Quarters,\\" \\"Ship of the Line,\\" and \\"Flying Colours\\" should be read as a trilogy."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"No matter how large your queue of books-in-process (waiting to be read) is, drop them all and read the Hornblower series.

Its orders were to seek an alliance with a rebel government against Spanish America and to take, sink, burn or destroy a ship with three times the firepower of the Lydia. The book displays the shrewdness of its captain, Horatio Hornblower, who's calculated leadership accomplishes its duties and does it with effienciency. However there are twists in the plot that derail Hornblower's orders from the admirality in the Pacific as well as the need to take on board a female passenger seeking a way home due to unforseen circumstances. One note to take interest in the book is the introspection from the captain. As the captain of the ship, Hornblower must seem imperturbed even in the most distressful situations in order to maintain calm amongst his crew. But in private Hornblower anguishes about keeping the crew in control, maintain the operation of the ship, devising the tactics of the battle of maneuvering the ship and determining when to fire upon an enemy ship, as well as other problems that can come up. He also has a wife in England whom he thinks about. The female passenger in the book didn't really develop a romantic relationship until the second to the last chapter and the author isn't very thorough in developing those kinds of plots anyway. The battles were the most intriguing in the book and the aftermath of both battles left the captain with some challenging problems of which you needed to read on in order to find out.All in all one of the better books in the series."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"It is the year 1808 and Hornblower, with the 36 gun ship HMS Lydia, is sent somewhere west of Nicaragua to join forces with an insane Spanish landowner to fight the Spanish government.

Upon reading it some eighteen years ago, I became interested in a naval career. Now, after nine years of commissioned service, and counting, I have reread Beat To Quarters at least four times. I enjoy it more each time. The character of Captain Hornblower is an excellent leadership study. While the uninitiated reader may question Hornblower's efforts to remain distant from his men, the military leader will recognize in Forester's hero a human being struggling to maintain a necessary distance from men whom his orders may kill. His moment of self-satisfaction at a perfect landfall after weeks out of sight of land, his self-doubts as he makes momentous decisions without contact with higher authority, and his sobering knowledge that, as captain, he is all alone make us believe that Horatio Hornblower is a very real man.The battle scenes are extremely well written, and the presence of Lady Wellesley, which could seem contrived, adds to the quality of the book by showing the reader one more facet of Hornblower's personality. As she sees through his protective callousness, so do we.After nearly a decade in the Naval Service, I still view the Hornblower saga as the best naval fiction I have ever read. The only book which approaches Forester's ability to place the reader into the minds of men on board a ship of war is Wouk's The Caine Mutiny.I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"If you are reading it you have to have this one.

Patrick O'Brian was the more capable writer.

Did any of you read the same book that I did? Specifically, did any of you read it any more recently than, say, when Dr Martin Luther King was assassinated?Practically every character is introduced with derogatory racial statements. The author has painfully outdated attitudes against every single non-English person in the book. I learned a new slur for southern Europeans while reading the second chapter (page 19, and throughout the book). All Spanish sailors are sweepingly condemned as talkative, lazy, and incompetent.Of course, Europeans fare better than non-Europeans. The people in Central America are all swarthy, dirty, and ragged. Their loyalty and convictions are constantly suspect. Nearly every person in the villain's service is disparaged as multiracial. Not described -- disparaged. The most fearsome and least sympathetic characters, such as the major domo, are those multiracial characters with some African blood.Speaking of Africans, Lady Barbara Wellesley announces within minutes of setting foot on the deck that she will have to lock up her black maid because otherwise the maid will unashamedly have sex with every possible man on the ship: '\\"It is not on my account, Captain, that I need a key. It is Hebe here whom I have to lock in unless she is directly under my eye. She can no more keep from the men than a moth from the candle.\\" The little negress grinned widely at this speech, showing no resentment and a good deal of pride.' (page 110 -111). Lady Barbara then explains that her method of keeping her maid in line is simply to beat her into submission -- just the kind of sweet lady you want for a story's love interest, right?I've read the entire Aubrey/Maturin series repeatedly. Jack Aubrey would have had nothing but contempt for Hornblower. He's a scrub with absolutely zero respect for the men under him. The lower deck consists solely of men that can't do anything except wring their hands unless an officer tells them what to do. (Yes, these would be the same men that are supposedly at risk for self-organizing a mutiny in the first pages of the book.) He flogs twice a week. He lies to and deliberately manipulates his junior officers. He deliberately tortures them with unfelt displays of serene chat about playing cards when they would rather be preparing for battle because he thinks it might improve their opinion of his god-like infallibility.His first lieutenant is best characterized as the son who wants his father's approval -- and will never get it, because his father is a stuffed shirt. Hornblower's hang up about talking to his staff results in withholding critical information. The men under him are supposed to mindlessly obey his orders like automata, and nevermind that a little bit of fair warning would have saved at least one life.There are certain stupidities in the storyline, like the author's decision that Hornblower would be the sole person aboard that speaks any Spanish. Nevermind that this is unbelievably unlikely in a collection of nearly 400 sailors that had spent so many years at war in and around the Mediterranean, and that lifelong sailors picked up a few words here and there of all sorts of languages. The average sailor's speech might not amount to much more than \\"Woman\\" or \\"Beer\\", but speaking none at all is 'poetic license' at best.In the initial capture of the Natividad, the timing on the action is completely wrong. The ship drops sails, closes a significant distance, fires a broadside, and lashes its yardarms to the Natividad -- in the length of time that it takes Hornblower to run from one end of his smallish frigate to the other; nevermind that in the very first pages of the book, just getting up the masts and setting (all) the sails takes 24 minutes, firing three broadsides in five minutes was considered a quite good rate back then, it takes a couple of minutes to lash spars together (especially when your opponent is trying to kill you at the time), more than a few seconds to get dozens of men up and down the masts so that you can do any of these things, and a fifty-yard dash (Hornblower was actually running less than that distance) is usually measured in mere seconds--as in, less than ten of them. But somehow, the author thinks that Hornblower's running from the quarterdeck to the bow takes just as long as all of the above, which is absurd.There are things in this book that are well done -- they do exist, and for that, see all the other reviews -- but overall I cannot recommend it, and I hope that future readers will go into it with more awareness of its contents than I did."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"A Character loosely based on Nelson, Hornblower's series takes you through being a Midshipman to being an Admiral in the Napoleanic Wars. This series was created during WWII and was the most popular series in England until James Bond came along. The author went on to write other books (like the African Queen), but will always be remembered for this great combination of action, character-development and historical realism. This is a great book for anyone; but as a teen, it was the first series to introduce me to how fascinating and worthwhile reading could be."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Beat to Quarters (1937), also known as The Happy Return, is C. S. Forester's original Horatio Hornblower novel. It fits sixth in the chronology. In 1808, Hornblower, captain of the frigate Lydia, sails to Nicaragua to aid a mad warlord in his revolution against the French. Complications ensue, as usual, including the married Hornblower falling in love with another woman (which is rather unexpected).Beat to Quarters has a fair mix of action and drama, although things drag along at times. The climax of the book is a fifty-page sea battle, during which Forester immerses the reader in naval warfare and at the same time overloads him with nautical details.Beat to Quarters was written over ten years before any of the chronologically-previous novels, and there is a noticeable difference in style and tone. For one, the narrative here does not flow as well as it does in Forester's later writing - he gets bogged down in details and he has a tendency to repeat himself. Hornblower is still fundamentally Hornblower - he is self-loathing, insecure, posturing and hypocritical, although his manner is not quite the same and he has manifested a bizarre habit of saying, \\"Ha - h'm,\\" all the time.It will become clear to anyone who has read the Hornblower books that Forester did quite a bit of retconning when he went back to write the novels of Hornblower's early career. Notable examples include Hornblower's age and his relationship with Lieutenant Bush, and there are quite a few other small things.On the whole, Beat to Quarters is a decent novel not with out its problems, although its flaws are easier to forgive knowing that Forester was still finding his way with Hornblower. New Hornblower readers would do better to start with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Recently I was consumed by the O'Brian series, devouring all in a short time. Since I an a surgeon, Maturin was appealing. Simply out of curiosity, I returned to Forester, whom I have not read in thirty years. There is no comparison. The writing flows,the language is not contrived, the battle scenes are riveting. Contrasting the description of his feeling towards Lady Barbara is just wonderful. Beat To Quarters is the best of the two series that I have read."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"I don't get it... why is this book so highly rated?There must be a lot of nostalgic old folks who read these as kids... Or in light of having read the entire series, have decided to have an unusual opinion in order to sound erudite in matters of Hornblower. Or they could know something which I don't; however, let me respectfully submit that Beat to Quarters is pretty mediocre as action/adventure/historical fiction novels of the 1930's go. The characters seem contrived, the archvillian hopelessly cliche, and the storytelling is painfully explicit. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it, because I did -- the pacing is good, and as forced as it may seem, Forester is trying to create interesting, complex characters, which pays off in the later novels. The writing improves tremendously too, so keep with them if you can.Righto, the summary. Horatio Hornblower is captain of the frigate Lydia, the sole English ship wandering about the Pacific. Horatio is marked by his reserve and and critical powers which he applies as vigorously to himself as that which surrounds him, but despite all this, he is garrulous, and therefore has a habit of saying \\"Ha... H'm\\" in conversation to avoid speaking too much. Lieutenant Bush is loyal, but, as we are told, unimaginative, so it's up to Horatio to come of with all the brilliant plans. He has been sent on a mission to aid in an uprising against the Spanish in Central America, but, as the delegate of a morally disinterested third party, he finds that alliances can be slippery things... There's a bit of romance mixed in with all the sea battles, but since Horatio never quite gets clear of trouble, there's not a dull moment throughout the entire 250 odd pages... That's probably all I can say without giving away the rest of the story -- I recommend Beat to Quarters for anyone who wants a light read and is a fan of seafaring stories of the Napoleonic era.We have to compare O'Brien and Forester, right? From what I've read of both of them, O'Brien is the better writer, but Forester is a lot more readable. Hornblower doesn't feel as historic, which is partly because Forester didn't do his research quite as throughouly, but also because O'Brien succeeds in creating characters which feel genuinely \\"foreign\\". Jack and Stephen are not men of our time to be sure, but this also makes them a lot more difficult to relate to.Well, there's my two cents. :)"},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"I understand that this is the first Hornblower book written. That explains a lot. It is actually the sixth, chronologically, in Hornblower's career.First of all, Lieutenant Bush is back. But, it is not too well described the relationship and history between Bush and Hornblower. But, this is the first book written, so at the time of writing, there wasn't any history....Anyway, Hornblower is his typical self. Very unsure of his skills and abilities and far too worried about keeping up his image in front of the men.The story is excellent. A seven month voyage on a secret mission. Hornblower follows his orders explicitly. Never to touch land until his destination. Well, imagine how the world of politics can change in seven months. Hornblower has had no new information about the war since he left England.Enemies are now friends. Friends are now enemies.As for the action scenes.... This is one of the best described ship to ship sequences I have ever read. As usual, Hornblower is outgunned. However, he has the smaller faster ship and is able to outmeneuver his opponent. The battle lasts well over 12 hours of his time. It is interupted by a driving storm and night.At dawn, the enemy is sighted. There is little or no wind. Hornblowers lowers the boats and begins a stern chase by being towed. As he closes, the other ship uses it's heavier weight of iron to deliver broadside after broadside at extreme range. Hornblower has to endure this for several hours before his smaller guns are within range. At that point, the training and discipline of the English sailors takes it's toll.With the politics aside, this book is a great read."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"The original Hornblower novel. This book started the popular 17th/18th century naval historical fiction trend.Beat to Quarters is the story of British frigate on assignment off the Pacific coast of South America. Forester does an excellent job portraying the roles and responsibilities of a commander on foreign station. The story line is well put together, reads easily and moves quickly.The story concentrates on Captain Hornblower, the commander of the vessel. Many of the details that we currently expect to see in naval historical fiction dealing with ship operation and interaction with the crew are only partially developed. At the time Beat to Quarters was written, there was no assumption of knowledge based on prior reading. There was no other similar reading available!Overall, Beat to Quarters is worth reading both as a classic and because it is a good book."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"It's interesting to read the first of the Hornblower books within its chronological order. As the first published, but chronologically within the middle of Hornblower's career, it offers some unavoidable dissonance. As another reviewer stated, it feels more \\"introductory\\" than even the chronological first of the series. Hornblower doesn't yet feel as well developed (or as likable) and some of the details seem just little off from the chronologically earlier books (although that might just be my memory). But that aside, this is no slouch of a book. Forester demonstrates his historical and action-scene chops throughout, and the Lady Barbara subplot brings a whole new layer of personal complications."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Beat to Quarters was the first of the Hornblower books that Forester wrote. It's a tale of adventure off the west coast of Central America during the early part of the 19th century. Among the problems that Captain Hornblower faces are the changing politics of Spain, are they on our side, or against us. Are we supporting the rebels fighting Spanish rule, or helping them? Hornblower has to capture a much larger Spanish ship twice, once from the Spanish, and once from the rebels he turned it over to. Like all the Hornblower adventures, Forester includes a lot of detailed description of the daily life and hardships of life in the English Navy during the age when ships were of wood and men were of iron. After his final sea battle, which sinks his prize and prevents him from gaining prize money, Hornblower has to careen his own ship on a hidden beach to patch it up before the long trip home. He meets Lady Barbara in Panama, who is to be his future wife and love, but that is for a later story. Whether you read them in the order written, Beat to Quarters first, or in chronological order of Hornblower's life, it's a rousing good tale of the sea, of men and of honor."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This book is the 5th in the \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" series by C.S. Forester. It is in my opinion the best book of the series, and this is high praise, because this is one of the best adventure series in all of literature.In this novel, Captain Hornblower, Captain of HMS Lydia, a British frigate, is dispatched to the west coast of South America, on a mission to make trouble for Spain, which has allied itself with Napoleon, against whom Britain is in a desperate struggle. At first, all seems to go well, but events beyond Hornblower's control intervene, and soon he is fighting battles and using his wits. It is all wonderful adventure.Forester's writing is taut. His storyline is brisk. The novel moves from adventure to adventure in a manner that is absolutely absorbing. This book never drags. This is a story of adventure and hardship. Captain Hornblower, El Supremo, Lady Barbara are all unforgettable. The battles at sea are so real you can smell the powder. This is a great story.This is one you'll want in hardcover, because you'll want to read it over and over and perhaps later introduce to your children and friends."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"The Hornblower novels are famous as the first in the age of fighting sail novel revival. First published in 1938, this and the following two volumes (Ship of the Line and Flying Colours) were quickly reissued on the eve of WW II as a trilogy, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. These three &quot;Captain&quot; novels come midway in Hornblower's career, but were written first.Set midway in the Napoleonic era, with Britain against the Spanish, then with them (as Hornblower learns to his chagrin), we first encounter Hornblower as already a frigate captain, with frequent references to mysterious battles and escapades in his past. Currently he is dealing with the consequences of a secret, long, seven month voyage across the Pacific to a dead-on landing in Central America, during which he has vowed not to utter an unnecessary word! Captains are already omnipotently separate from their men, but HH goes to an extreme out of fear of some career-ending embarrassment. Indeed there is little dialogue, aside from interior monologues. We learn considerably about the running of a ship under sail, but the detail and jargon is not so heavy as in the Patrick O'Brian novels, nor is the language so authentic. (If overwhelmed by either at first read, there is an admirable book on all the terminology, Dean King's wryly titled A SEA OF WORDS, where you can learn of the origins of such common expressions as &quot;scuttlebutt, the bitter end, in the doldrums,&quot; as well as the esoteric sailing terms.) &quot;Hornblower&quot; might be thought to be a joke name, but as a character he is much too serious and shy, indeed full of self-doubt (that never threatens to pull the story down), and not too lovable.Once on station, Hornblower engages in diplomacy with all parties, and fights battles with a more powerful ship. His greater battle is with his petulant self concerning a young Lady who has imperiously sought his aid to return to England, which leads to some delicious scenes at sea as Hornblower's emotions gradually overman his desire to have her speak well of him to the Naval Lords in aid of his career. Forester balances well the setting, action, and characters, but with a lighter tone and fleeter pace than O'Brian (whom you might wish to read only after the Hornblower saga). I think most people would find something to enjoy in this novel of adventure on the high seas."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This is unquestionably the best of the Hornblower books, and also the first written. The only problem is that you can't stop at one because the story doesn't end at the end of the book so naturally you have to get the next one to find out whether he ever gets to make love to Lady Barbara and marry her. So you read the next two books but they are all good. It's hard to stop reading any of these books."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"My love of seafaring stories began withThe True Confessions of Charlotte Doyleas a young girl. I then discovered theMutiny on the Bounty (Back Bay Books), enjoyed it enough to readMen Against the Sea: A Noveland loved it anymore. I've seen the A&E; miniseries of Horatio Hornblower, and between my enjoyment of that production and love of the seafaring genre, I wanted to check out the Hornblower books.Beat to Quarters is the first book that Forester wrote. In this book Hornblower is already a captain, and an experienced one at that. If you've ever seen the Gregory Peck movieCaptain Horatio Hornblower, it's based on this book. After the success of this book, Forester went on to write more Hornblower books, five of which would deal with Hornblower in his earlier years at sea. I began in the middle of the Hornblower series (in terms of Hornblower's experience) based on recommendations to start with this as it was Forester's first book, and a better introduction. I believe that was a mistake.This book is good, but not outstanding by itself. The reason that I continued on to read other books was because I had the A&E; miniseries experience, and felt that other books in the series would be better. In this book, Hornblower has forced himself to become more gruff and restrained in an effort to maintain an appropriate distance from his crew. Unfortunately, it resulted in an element of emotional distance from me as the reader as well. I think more experience with a younger Hornblower is needed to be able to have the appropriate appreciation for this one.So, if you haven't read Hornblower, I would recommend beginning withMr. Midshipman Hornblower (Hornblower Saga), which is a collection of 1 or 2 chapter stories of his midshipman years. It is from this book that the A&E; miniseries obtained the basic plots of the first four episodes. It gives a very good feel for who Hornblower is. ThenLieutenant Hornbloweris a more typical cohesive narrative, and it's where I felt the real fun began. I look forward to continuing on through the series, and I think I will appreciate this book more after reading of Hornblower's career and experiences up to that point."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"C. S. Forester, Beat to Quarters.Patrick O'Brian, Master and CommanderI've begun reading C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels for the fourth or fifth time and I'm enjoying them almost as much as the first time through. Last year, I read about half of Patrick O'Brian's stunning Aubrey-Maturin sea novels for a second time: they didn't lose a thing in the rereading, they're so good. Both authors knew their subject matter thoroughly -naval battle in the age of sail, the sea campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Both succeeded admirably in conveying the nature and feel of life at sea in crowded, sometimes ungainly, often elegant wooden sailing vessels that in the heat of battle often became floating coffins for the men who inhabited them. Self-doubting Hornblower and his loyal lieutenant Bush, ebullient Jack Aubrey and his surgeon-spy friend Stephen Maturin are men we easily come to admire, full-fleshed characters. The love stories which form a second melody in many of the books in both series are engrossing; you root for the course of true love, for Hornblower's indomitable Lady Barbara and Jack's virginal and stubbornly maternal Sophie.There are differences. O'Brian is the more consistently superior writer and you laugh more when you read his books. Forester has the annoying habit of telling the reader about changes (largely naval practices) that occur later than the events described rather than, as does O'Brian, simply letting the details of the narration build up a sense of past times in the reader's mind. But Foresterr doesn't indulge himself often and it's a very minor irritation in a splendid narrative that spreads across how eleven novels.The ambition of these writers is abashing. How did they keep narrative focus through eleven (in Forester's case) and eighteen (O'Brian's) books? How did they succeed -and succeed they truly did--in creating real characters who mature from book to book and communicate their humanity as well as their heroism to readers of a time two hundred years later? These are exceptional books."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"I came to Forester's series on the &quot;recommendation&quot; of David Weber, who attributes to Forester's Hornblower the inspiration for his highly enjoyable space opera Honor Harrington series. Having read only the first, I must say I am glad I took the time to read (or listen) to it, as Horatio Hornblower is a character that one can like, admire, and sympathize with, even having never served in the military.I found Hornblower to be a character of great depth. While I pity his self-deprication, I admire him for it. I see the contradiction, the struggle in him, and I sympathize. I admire his sense of duty and his willingness to carry it out. I admire his compassion in a compassionless business, but his duty takes prescedence. While I don't always agree with him, he is a believable and likable character.I don't know if Forester assumed that everyone who would read his novels was a seaman or if everyone in Britain in the 1940's WAS a seaman, but there is a great deal of jargon in the novel. I'm afraid that, having grown up in suburban America, I have no idea what the difference between a mizzenmast and a mainmast, what a forecastle is, which one is the quarterdeck, or (I looked up the others but still can't figure this one out) why they would SAND the decks for Hornblower's morning walks. I'd rather NOT have to look these things up in order to enjoy the book.Forester has no gift for dialogue; there is not much speaking in the books, but for some reason, though I love dialogue, I don't mind it that much. I wish he would have dwelt more on some of the conversations between Hornblower and Lady Barbara, but I can live without them. Their relationship grows in a believable way nevertheless.I am told this is the best book to start the Hornblower series with, and I believe it. It explains some of the relevant nuances the of Post-Napoleonic British Navy to the reader and gives a true feel for what it MIGHT be like to be a Captain in His Majesty's Navy. Despite the jargon, I did not feel like I was missing anything.A good book overall. I will read the rest."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"This is not the novel by CS Forrester. It is a GUIDE.

Hornblower's life of sailing through molten shot and through a hail of grapeshot (bullets) is so amazing, i almost wanted to live during his time (exept the fact that i would probably die at a young age.)

And the sad thing is that I read the book 2 years after actually buying it (I had to get through 20 books of Aubrey/Maturin)and it would be silly to ask for return now.But, the book was fast-paced with action - though at first it was difficult to cope with Hornblower's character, knowing just a little bit about him I could say he whined a lot :l, not outwardly, but - and I hope to read about his early years, intact."},{"Title":"Beat to quarters (Armed Services edition)","review":"Though I'm not a huge fan of maritime adventure novels, this one was quite enjoyable and in my opinion is much more readable than the Aubrey/Maturin series.

I couldn't say the same for Patrick O'Brien's Master and Commander, the first installment of the Aubrey/Maturin series. Beat To Quarters isn't so much a maritime adventure novel as it is simply an adventure novel that happens to take place at sea.There's a little bit of everything in this book - some good battle scenes, a bit of humor, and even some romance. It's one small step above \\"fluff\\" fiction, a good summer read at the beach.It took me a long time to figure out which book in the series to read first. Beat To Quarters was the first one Forester wrote, even though it chronicles the middle the main character's life. (Five books in the series detail earlier periods of his life even though they were written later.) I would recommend starting with this one.

I hope she keeps writing forever."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"That's just one thing you will learn from this book. Whether you are from the Appalachains or visit there you will be transported in Sharyn McCrumb's books. She not only accurately decribes the land but the people and culture as well."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"This book was required reading for a Southern Literature Class, I took last year, and I immediately fell in love with the book. The characters in the book are well developed and the plot artfully merges a the past to the present--one of the continuing motifs in Southern Literature...(I know, because I made an A in the class.)"},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"After the much deserved, raving reviews of her earlier work, it is glaringly obvious while reading this novel that McCrumb is trying too hard to live up to her own standards, and the results lead to a very disappointing effort. This author is a \\"natural\\" storyteller, and that's why her previous books were so fresh and applauded. While reading The Rosewood Casket, the reader is often aware of the author's erratic attemtps to please the critics, and this truly effects the flow and believability of her natural storytelling. There are many groan inducing passages throughout the novel, many highly forced and completely unbelievable, and many appears to be rushed without much thought being put into them. The overall feeling after completion is that it was basically a very silly and mediocre tale, laced with moments of the author's natural gifts, alas, fleeting moments, but, not nearly enough to ever recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"McCrumb has a way with her story telling and writing. If her stories aren't pulling you in and making you stay up at night to finish the book...I think you're in the minority. She's a great writer and I've enjoyed all of the Ballad novels I've read so far, very much. I think if you try her books, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"I came across the Rosewood Casket in one of my bookshelves, a first edition I had no memory of buying. Most often drawn to British writers (or Americans who &quot;write British&quot;), I was quickly drawn not only into Sharyn McCrumb's story, but her style and clear indication that she knows English and how to use it to great advantage. She is unpretentious and even her other-worldly concerns are non-intrusive and never offensive. She is a very gifted writer, indeed. I'd regret that I hadn't read her before, but now I get to read EVERYTHING. Now that I've finished the Rosewood Casket, I handed it to my husband, Allan Eckert. We sat across from her last year at the Kentucky Book Fair and I enjoyed her delightful personality very much. Now I can enjoy her wonderful books."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"\\"The more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" The Rosewood Casket demonstrates how true this old saying is. McCrumb cleverly melds historical figure Daniel Boone with novel character Clayt Stargill, making this close to a time travel mystery with history repeating itself. The timeless tensions inherent in relationships - father/son, brother/brother, husband/wife, friend/friend, nature/man - play a pivotal role in this story that revolves around basic questions about who owns the land. The resolution of the central mystery involving the apparition in the woods is chilling.McCrumb is a skilled, elegant writer - her prose is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"As I read this novel, the old song &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; ran through my mind. The endless circle is the losing of the land. The prehistoric animals of iceage Appalachia lose the land to the Cherokees, who lose the land to the settlers, and their descendants lose the land to the real estate speculators. When Randall Stargill's four sons gather on the family farm to build their father's coffin, they embody the latest generation to face the quandry of losing the land. This is a story of cultural politics as much as of family dynamics. McCrumb lets you feel the love of the mountains while suffering the pain of losing them."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"This was my first novel by Sharyn McCrumb and I loved it.It's not all that suspenseful-so if that's what you're looking for,you might be disappointed.Although the hunt at the end was exciting.This is a truly wonderful book about a family coming together when they find out that their father is on his deathbed.I loved all of the characters and from reading this novel I can tell that the author has good insight into what makes people talk and react the way they do.Her characters were wonderfully developed and I couldn't help but fall in love with themI'm sure we have all met people who have reminded us of some of the Stargills.The description of the mountains and land where the story took place was also done very well.It made me feel like I was there and not too many writers can make me feel that when I'm reading.I felt like I could feel the atmosphere of where everyone lived.I also like the way she tied the present with the past and the undercurrent of mystery added to the novel.Sharyn has got a new fan and I hope all of her other books are as enjoyable as this one was.I noticed our local library has The Ballad Of Frankie Silver so I think I'll go down and pick it up."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"I have read four of Sharyn McCrumb's books now, including The Rosewood Casket, and have loved each and every one of them! She has a knack for bringing the reader inside the story and making you feel as though you were there. Her descriptions of the Appalacian mountain area make you feel as though you are there, able to see the breathtaking views described in her books. I also admire the way she tell several different stories all during the book and brings everything and everyone together, rather than confusing the reader, as some authors do. She is truly a master at what she does. I hope she continues her art in the same fashion for many years to come. I look forward to reading the other books she has already published."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"I have now read several of Sharyn McCrumb's books. (Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, She Walks These Hills, and Rosewood Casket) All have been excellent reading. I read for entertainment, and all of her books have fit the bill. Her characters are very real and you come to care about them a great deal. Her description of the mountains and the land are just beautiful. She weaves the past and the present together into a very interesting story. Sharyn is a great story teller and I am now going to the library to get other books written by her. You should too!"},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"I have read &quot;She Walks These Hills&quot; and &quot;The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter&quot; and thought both novels were great. But this third one, which involves Nora Bonesteel more in the story line, is definitely the best so far. Nora Bonesteel has become one of my favorite fictional characters (I would love to see a movie based on her)and Sharyn McCrumb my favorite writer. This book sends a chill up your spine at the very beginning - and keeps it there all the way to the conclusion!"},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"If Sharyn McCrumb wrote the book you know it will be great. She is a wonderful author and all of her books are so good. She makes you feel like you are there and that you know the people that you are reading about. From the first to the last page it's got you. Do read this wonderful book.The father has saved Rosewood so that when he dies his sons will built him a casket. The sons all live in different places and have not seen each other for a while but they all come back to do this for their father.Excellent book"},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"More a character study than a mystery (the murder is rather incidental to the plot), &quot;The Rosewood Casket&quot; is still a must for fans. McCrumb can get a little preachy at times, however. In &quot;The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter&quot; she pontificated about water pollution; in this book it's the overdevelopment of the wilderness by unscrupulous realtors. I sympathize with the issue, but feel sometimes that all the talk gets in the way of the plot. Also, the seven year old in this particular story is just a little too well-spoken and philisophical for her years. All that said, time spent with McCrumb is time well spent. She continues to be one of the sharpest, most serious &quot;mystery&quot; writers around."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"When you first pick up this book you may think that it's just another murder mystery. However are you in for a real treat when you get your first taste of the master McCrumb weaving her tales of the Appalachian people and land into a very intense and somewhat haunting tale of history and emotions.Being myself from western North Carolina I can relate to the setting. But even someone who has never set foot outside the streets of a city can relate to the characters like Dovey Stallard, a woman caught in an entanglement of consequences or Robert Lee in his ever ending quest to make his daddy proud. It also tells how in death everyone may have a secret that needs to be let go and how these secrets can burden our lives while we are living.My take on this book may be a little different than most but I can guarantee that Sharyn McCrumb has found a fan for life."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"This was flat out the best book I have ever read and I have read a lot of books. I have also read &quot;Zombies of the Gene Pool&quot; by Sharyn McCrumb and that too held me on the edge of my seet. The Rosewood Casket is amazingly good. It is well written, has a lot of plot, and is just good! This book did something to me that most books don't do to me when I am reading them. It was the best book I ever read!"},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"Sharyn McCrumb is doing for Appalachia what Tony Hillerman has done for the Navajos. She presents a realistic picture of these fine, brave, proud people without the grotesqueness of Cold Mountain or the distortion of Deliverance. This is not so much a mystery novel as it is a novel that happens to have a mystery in it. Her characters are well-rounded and the setting is true. My only quibble with it is her vagueness in the matter of firearms and their use. I would like to have seen a closer connection between the use of the rosewood casket and the actual ballad. Otherwise, this is a good one."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"THIS IS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL BOOKS I HAVE READ BY MS.MCCRUMB. IT HAS GOT ME HOOKED! THE CHARACTERS ARE REAL, HAVE REAL FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND PROBLEMS, AND USE REAL DIALOGUE. I COULD RELATE THIS STORY OF 3 BROTHERS AND THEIR FATHER TO MY OWN SIBLINGS."},{"Title":"The Rosewood Casket","review":"This book is possibly the most boring novel I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. I am in agreement with another reviewer in that the word &quot;mystery&quot; being applied to this book is a stretch. I fancy myself a fan of mysteries, and this one fails in the most elementary of mystery criteria; to keep the reader interested in the story and to provide an element of surprise. The problem here is not that the author didn't endeavor to surprise the reader at the end but that by the end of the book the reader no longer cares about the story, therefore rendering any potential surprises completely lacking in impact. The dialogue between characters is canned, and the characters themselves are cookie-cutter personalities without real depth. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it is fairly quick reading. This allowed me to fulfill my self-imposed obligation to the loved one who gave it to me by finishing it."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"At a glance, Drumming at the Edge of Magic may seem like an autobiogrphical journey by the Grateful Dead's Mickey Hart. While the book is autobiographical, it goes far beyond that to discover the real meaning of drumming and music in general.The meaning of drumming (or life?) comes in many forms, and many disguises. As Hart begins to unluck the secrets to why humans desire to express themselves in music, one can't help but say, &quot;YES!&quot;. Hart, and to a certain extent, Jay Stevens, put into words what drummers and other musicians have felt all along but have never known how to express. The journey ends up being a look inward; not just for Hart but for the reader as well.After reading this, I had my wife and father read it. I explained, &quot;This is how I feel about drumming.&quot;The companion CD and sequel book, &quot;Planet Drum,&quot; are nice additions but the book stands by its self as an outstanding source for understanding music at its most basic form.This book will move you."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"I'd lost interest in playing for about 5 years before I read this book, but Mickey Hart's book brought me back to the reasons I started hitting the bottom of tin cans woth a wooden spoon! This book follows, to a degree, the history of drums, and studies the emotional, spiritual and physical effects of drums, old ancient, and new on people. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to play for any or no reason, and to andone who can't explain why the music makes them dance."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"When I decided to take up hand percussion, I sought out this work out of respect for the authors' musicianship, and his ongoing projects with the Smithsonian Institute and the Library of Congress. This book led me quickly past the idea of playing drums, and into areas which effect us spiritually, emotionally, and even physically. I've read it twice, and will read it again--and again until I REALLY understand it all. If World Music interests you, if you are a drummer, or if you are seeking inner peace, this book belongs in your hands."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"This is a truly incredible novel written with a definite joie de vivre. Most of the book deals with Mickey Hart's (former Grateful Dead drummer) journey towards an understanding of ethnic drumming. Filled with fascinating stories, like the Tibetan &quot;power&quot; drums that are made from human skulls, the book also incorporates stories from Hart's life, like how one of these same drums almost killed him, and eventually changed his life. Half biography, half ethnology, it's all written with incredible ease and fluidity. A definite must-read for any ethnic music lovers."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"Drumming At The Edge of Magic is a truly inspirational book for all people interested in drumming and rhythms. It details Harts cathartic exploration and eases the modern drummer into other-worldly potentials."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"A wonderful peek at a quest for understanding the role the drum has had on our developement as a species. A tall order and you might not get all the answers, but the passionate tale of the hunt is first rate!"},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"A fascinating musical journey and also a must for those who are into ethnic / world music. Now occupies a space on my shelf beside &quot;World Music: The Rough Guide&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian Sound.&quot;"},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"I am not a Deadhead, nor am I a drummer, but I have really admired this book, and Mickey Hart big time. He really went off the deep end of his knowledge of percussion, both conventional, and exotic. I had not had this book with me since 1995, so my mind is a bit foggy, but if I remember right, the book is also a trip down Memory Lane, speaking of the hippie days of the Haight-Ashbury, The Grateful Dead and the whole scene in general. One of my favorites was of a drum he got in Tibet made from human skulls. He was wondering why he felt like he was being cursed, and he was told that he was using the drums wrong and it was used to wake the dead. He decided to return the drums and get a similar one not made of skulls. Drumming at the Edge of Magic was also a tie-in to what was then Mickey Hart's latest CD called At the Edge. This book really makes me wished I was there with the hippies and the Deadheads, even if I, myself don't listen to the Dead. It's too bad the Dead isn't around anymore thanks to Jerry Garcia's untimely death. Whether you're a Deadhead or not, whether you're a percussionist or not, this is truly an enthusiastic and well-written book on the subject of percussion."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"Fascinating as when I first read it - knoweldgable and puts the thought that all rock musicians are dumbheads (sorry) out of your head, (again sorry). Well worth buying and would hope all rock fans would read."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"I had to purchase this book for a world music class that I am taking. Not only was I excited to read a book written by an amazing drummer from one of my favorite bands, but I was also pleased to see that it quite engaging. It is well written and contains a plethora of interesting information. This is one \\"textbook\\" I don't mind reading!"},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"I've owned at least a dozen copies of this book across the course of the years. I've read it as many times, finding new thoughts and feelings exposed within me each time. Then, without fail, I meet someone who would benefit from owning this book, and I give it away. Those are always good days. Truth be told, I don't know anyone who wouldn't be a better person for having spent time with this book. Perhaps I haven't yet met the person I will give this copy to somewhere down the road. Maybe I have. Reading is always an adventure. 'Drumming At The Edge Of Magic' is an epic journey. Allow it to, and it will change your life."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"This is a great book if you can find it. Lots of history. His next book Planet Drum is just a picture book, and a repeat of what was in last book."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"I am a drummer. My main focus of interest is jazz. I am also an avid academic reader. One thing that is obvious is the lack of dedicated books on the subject of drums and drumming, particularly drumming as it is practiced today, in my world.Hart's book is a great read, building on a lot of research. At times, it is rather evident that Hart's band was the Grateful Dead. That kind of \\"fuzzy\\" logic is the only thing I can hold against this book. And then again, I am not sure I even agree with myself here.Hart's book is a must read for any drummer. It contains Hart's own personal story. But it also contains loads of interesting information on drums and drumming, some of it not easily available anywhere else.The only reason not to get this book is if you cannot find it. Shame on the publishing company for not re-printing it. Pronto. Please..."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"Mickey expressed what I feel when I play the drums. Explaining the spirit of drumming / rhythm and sound in the best way. So true.."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"To be clear, this is primarily a book about the life and times of Mickey Hart. It's too pretentious to say it's a journey into the Spirit of Percussion. Better to pick up a percussion piece and learn its secrets firsthand, without the egotistical interposition of this author. It's a fine autobiography, to be sure, just be clear that that is what you're purchasing. It's about the accomplishments of Mickey Hart first, and only secondarily contains perspectives on rhythm and percussion. And as might be expected, these perspectives are expressed from a New Age-flavored platform."},{"Title":"Drumming At The Edge Of Magic - A Journey Into The Spirit Of Percussion","review":"it was recieved in a very timely manner - no complaints at all and in fact I would gladly do business with this vendor again!"},{"Title":"Cash Is Still King: The Survival Guide to Cash Flow Management","review":"Keith Checkley believes in a simple premise: Cash flow is the heart of business. It is also the heart of his new book, a sequel to 1995's Cash is King. Using a detailed and exhaustive discussion of the cash-flow cycle as his springboard, Checkley leaps into the depths of business strategy, product development and restructurings. Just when it's all getting a bit too deep, he surfaces with penetrating case studies from companies like Dell. We at getAbstract recommend this book to financial and non-financial pros alike, all of whom will benefit from its succinct definitions of finance terms and its clear explanation of critical mathematic formulas. While many business and management books suffer from a lack of hard fact and applicability, Checkley gives you the numbers, or more importantly, he gives you the knowledge you need to crunch your own."},{"Title":"Schnauzers (Complete Pet Owner's Manual)","review":"This is a very simple book, and doesn't give any real guidance unless you've never owned any dog before.

The students are enthralled by it. Since we have already studied this time period in Social Studies, they can easily make connections because the book includes actual events from Florida's history.I personally found the first book to be much more intersting than the second. Although both were good, the second covers a longer time period and thus must do so with less detail."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered, Vol. 1 (Student Edition)","review":"It's easy to see why almost every reviewer gave this book 5 stars. The story follows the MacIvey family from 1863 through three generations to the present. As they scratch out a hardscrabble living, the reader follows their experiences during the Civil War, and through Florida's pioneer days.Immerse yourself in their struggle to build a home, drive cattle to market, start orchards, deal with rustlers, wild animals, life and death in Central Florida.You learn so much about Florida's early landscape and the damage done by settlement, as well as the effect on the Native Americans. Some of the homespun life reminds me of Rawling's classic, The Yearling. I highly recommend it, not just for Floridians, but for everyone to know more about their country's development in this unique region. The story is compelling."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered, Vol. 1 (Student Edition)","review":"This is truley one of the best books I have ever read.

The fourth and fifth grade students are learning about the origins of the cattle and citrus industry in our state in a way that leaves them begging to read just one more chapter each week. They have broadened their vocabulary and geography skills through this book study. The depth of the characters expose the students to examples of hard working people that survive inspite of tremendous obstacles.

It was recommended to me by several people before I read it.

When you read this book you will feel happy, sad, informed, surprised, and much much more. My favorite part of this book is when the main character Tobias MacIvey's son Zech MacIvey goes to and Indian village to give the Indians a very generous gift and Zech ends up sleeping or laying down with one of the young Indian girls. I also like the part when Tobias MacIvey saves a group of the same Indians form being whipped to death by some mean, selfish, and ruthless cowboys. As I have said before this a great book and I really would recommend anyone who is likes books about life in the old days and cowboys to read this book and you will see what a great book it is.

Pure fun for those with few inhibitions."},{"Title":"Mau Mau man-hunt: The adventures of the only American who has fought the terrorists in Kenya","review":"I have read and actually own nearly all books about the Mau Mau and their struggle. However, this book is the worst..It is an in your face slam dunk by a European male who, by being such will never convince me or any other Aftikan that he is /was nothing other than a CIA agent or a tool of the British.I took this book from the library, and returned it after regurgitating and feeling comfortable enough to know that there is more to this writer and this trash than the eyes read.The very title is a misnomer. Terrorist? If anyone is/was a terrorist it is the European colonizer who has taken every meaningful thing from my mother Afrika, and to date continues the same.Bottom line, the one who enslaved us cannot lead us or overstand that freedom means that is why the author chose the label terrorist vs freedom fighter..Takes one to know one, and i and we are unforgiving."},{"Title":"Mau Mau man-hunt: The adventures of the only American who has fought the terrorists in Kenya","review":"It would be easy to fall into the trap of modern liberal myopia and dismiss a book like this as too colonial or racist in nature to be of value, and for sure this book will never be assigned reading in any college course. But I think the parallels with contemporary life and international occupations are rather clear. Places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone in 2011 immediately jump to mind. In addition to crafting a first rate adventure story, the author takes the time to reflect on the conditions that lead up to the Mau Mau insurrection and the British response to it. Only an outsider could relay this objective viewpoint. There is no doubt that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."},{"Title":"Explorations into the eternal: Forays from the teaching of Nisargadatta Maharaj","review":"I have read this and 'Consciousness Speaks', but I prefer this book.Ramesh's teaching is different than Nisargatta's, but Nisargatta said that is to be expected.

Even thought the characters are the same as in the printed edition and the basic story line is the same, there are enough differences to make you wonder if they are two different versions of the same story. The audio edition has beed &quot;sweetened&quot; up quite a bit. In the book, Vin Ricker is a genuine &quot;bad guy&quot;. In the audio, he is just a misguided star-struck cowboy/foreman of the ranch. There are no evil people in the audio version at all. Still, it is very enjoyable to listen to in the car on the long commute to work. One that I re-listen to once or twice a year."},{"Title":"Fork Your Own Broncs (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Putting it bluntly I love Sally Kenyon's voice in this! This short story has been seriously enhanced with actors and special effects (listen carefully for wind noises in the background). Everything is well presented. The sound is clean and crisp and easily heard in the noise environment of a car. The story itself is very well laid out and flows nicely. The story is about a would-be rancher (Mac Marcy) who buys a two-bit ranch on high, dry ground and begins to run a couple of hundred cattle (for which he has saved several years). Things are complicated by a rich next door ranch and a serious lack of rain. Enough said. You feel as if you are there. An excellent buy."},{"Title":"Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy (Transversals: New Directions in Philosophy)","review":"De Landa's Deleuze, as presented in this and other works, has its own unique \\"niche\\" among the various ways of reading this important figure. His approach tends to take as its principal text Deleuze/Guattari's *A Thousand Plateaus* and emphasizes that difficult \\"subtext\\" surfacing throughout Deleuze's broader corpus that involves what DeLanda refers to as an \\"ontology\\" derived from chaos and complexity theory and the non-linear mathematics underlying them. \\"Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy\\" is certainly the best available elucidation of this often perplexing strand of Deleuze's work and any serious student of Deleuze will benefit from it. The problem, addressed by the author in an \\"appendix\\" to the work, is that Deleuze quite deliberately alters his basic terminology from one work to the next, making a good deal of forcing necessary to fit other Deleuzian texts into DeLanda's \\"ontological schema.\\" It is, in fact, not at all clear that Deleuze would have accepted DeLanda's claim about him operating with a fixed \\"ontology.\\" And since DeLanda is convinced that the \\"key\\" to Deleuze is to be found in modern non-linear mathematical theory and its scientific applications, he tends almost completely to ignore that which constitutes another major aspect of Deleuze's work, namely, his intense and extensive engagement with the history of philosophy. As a helpful introduction to one very difficult aspect of Deleuze's work, this book excels; as a broader account of Deleuze's philosophy and its influence, it is quite limited and somewhat contrived."},{"Title":"Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy (Transversals: New Directions in Philosophy)","review":"This book is a reconstruction of the ontology of the Continental philosopher Gilles Deleuze, but it is one of those rare commentaries that goes beyond being a mere commentary and achieves the status of an original work of philosophy in its own right. DeLanda's reconstruction of Deleuze's ontology is, interestingly enough, approached from the standpoint of analytic philosophy. DeLanda admits that he is taking a risk in attempting to reconstruct the ontology of a Continental philosopher in terms of analytic philosophy. He runs the risk of being 'too Continental' for analytic philosophers, and 'too analytic' for Continental philosophers. Personally, I tend to think that most philosophy students these days are a bit fed up with the Continental/analytic divide and are more then willing to make accommodations for those working in differing traditions. At any rate, the brilliance of DeLanda's reconstruction should be enough to silence any complaints.DeLanda believes that Deleuze's ontology is fundamentally based on replacing the philosophical concept of 'essence' with that of 'multiplicity' (pg9). DeLanda writes, \\"In a Deleuzian ontology...a species (or any other natural kind) is not defined by its essential traits but rather by the morphogenetic process that gave rise to it...while an essentialist account may rely on factors that transcend the realm of matter and energy (eternal archetypes, for instance) a morphogenetic account gets rid of all transcendent factors using exclusively form-generating resources which are immanent to the material world\\" (pg.9-10). DeLanda's book is an attempt to explain in detail how this process works. DeLanda attempts to define multiplicities by using the resources of chaos and complexity theories (symmetry breaking bifurcations, vector spaces, attractors, etc.). DeLanda has recourse to a new modal status (the virtual) when determining the ontological status of multiplicities and he attempts to explain the differences between the virtual and the traditional categories of modal logic (possibility, necessity, and actuality). This is one way in which DeLanda attempts to provide an ontological account of a basic Deleuzian concept (the virtual) in terms that are more familiar to analytic philosophers (modal logic). DeLanda also gives detailed accounts of how virtual multiplicities and their singularities along with intensive properties and differences drive the processes of morphogenesis and individuation. For example, DeLanda gives a very interesting description of embryogenesis which is based on the work of Gerald Edelman and Stuart Kaufmann in which intensive properties (the rates of synthesis and degradation of different adhesion molecules, and the birth and death rates of cells) as well as attractors existing within nearby state space drive the structural and qualitative differentiation of cells which ultimately produces a fully formed organism from a single cell (pg62-65). This example illustrates the \\"three ontological dimensions which constitute the Deleuzian world: the virtual, the intensive, and the actual\\" (pg61). The virtual are the attractors which are nearby in state space and which guide the qualitative differentiation of the cell (these attractors are real but not actual, hence the term virtual), the intensive in this case are the rates of synthesis and degradation of different adhesion molecules and the birth and death rates of cells (DeLanda explains in detail and great clarity the difference between intensive and extensive magnitudes), and the actual is the actual structure of the organism which possesses both extensive and qualitative properties which then come to hide the intensive processes and the virtual multiplicities which produced it in the first place.This is definitely a difficult book. DeLanda delves fairly deeply into a number of subjects which are going to be outside the scope of the average philosophy student (the history of mathematics, topology, chaos and complexity theory, embryogenesis, thermodynamics, etc.). A great deal of this book is still over my head. DeLanda's great saving grace is that he is an extremely clear and lucid writer a quality that differentiates him from many Continental philosophers including Deleuze. DeLanda also gives many concrete examples illustrating his abstract concepts which greatly aid the reader in understanding. Even with this help from DeLanda this book is still going to be a challenge for anyone who does not have DeLanda's grasp of all the relevant scholarship (and very few readers, if any, will). But unlike many philosophers DeLanda's difficulty does not simply frustrate but rather inspires. DeLanda inspires the reader to want to learn more about the subjects he is discussing in order to better understand what he is saying (if the reader is like me he or she may even wind up developing an entire research project centered around mastering the material referenced in this book). Unfortunately Deleuze, in my opinion, can often be more frustrating then inspiring. So even though I may take some heat for this I would actually recommend reading this book before attempting to read Deleuze himself. At the very least DeLanda should convince the skeptics that Deleuze does have something very interesting to say and he is worth the frustration which will inevitably accompany any attempt to read Deleuze's works first-hand."},{"Title":"Our Own Devices: How Technology Remakes Humanity","review":"\\"Why Things Bite Back\\" stands as one of my favorite books, and is definitely the best single volume available on the unintended consequences of technology. I was, of course, eager to read Edward Tenner's \\"Our Own Devices,\\" a volume more focused on the historical adaptations of a select few technologies and man's co-evolution with them.Tenner intentionally selected mundane technologies that get no more than a passing thought on a daily basis, and in several cases not only tracks historical adaptations of specific inventions and technologies (the history of the baby bottle, or eyeglasses, for instance), but also contrasts the diametrically opposed ends of the technological spectrum as it applies to what are similar design constructs (for instance posture chairs versus reclining chairs, and musical keyboards versus text keyboards.)The scope of Tenner's research is astounding, and makes seemingly mundane items interesting. Particularly strong are the chapters on the zori (a sandal), and eyeglasses. In the chapter on zoris, for example, Tenner documents the work of a Liberian craftsman, Saarenald T. S. Yaawaisan, who recycled old sandals into toy helicopters until he had acquired all the used sandals in Monrovia, at which point he began purchasing new sandals to make into toys. The story goes on to explain the subsequent problems with Monrovian sandal recycling vis-a-vis the release of dioxin into the environment. This illustrates the fanciful research Tenner put in to make this an eminently readable book.My favorite chapter, and one that will strike a chord with many readers is on the history of eyeglasses. Eyeglasses have a much longer and complex history than I had expected, and I found his insights correlating the rise of literacy with the rise in myopia interesting. Particularly interesting in the chapter are references to the visual range requirements needed for more primitive hunter-gatherers versus modern civilized man. Tenner correctly credits the work of behavioral biologist Jakob von Uexkull, and discusses his concepts of visual perception (\\"merkwelt\\") and related theories with great aplomb. Also discussed in this chapter is the role the Catholic church had in promoting the perception of eyeglasses (even during the Inquisition), and the role of aristocratic Europe in shaping public perception of correctable lenses. Specific technologies and manufacturing techniques (mainly European) are discussed, including those of famed presbyope (and cryptologist) Duke August the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel, who promoted fine craftsmanship of lenses over cheaply made products from Florence.This book is extremely well researched, and is generally very absorbing for those interested in the history and implications of technology. Even though it is a bit longwinded at times, I give it five stars for eloquently describing the co-evolution of man and machine."},{"Title":"Our Own Devices: How Technology Remakes Humanity","review":"Tenner gives loads of citations and research but doesnt even have a thesis. He rambles off example of interactions between humanity and its technology. His writing style is poor and will lose you in his trail of thought. He is very bad at describing what he is thinking. He never actually \\"says\\" anything. All he does is present research.He very rarely, if ever, derives a conclusion from what he brings up. He should not be called a philosopher of everyday technology, because at least in this book, he never actually does any thinking.Very very poor. I would not recommend it at all."},{"Title":"Our Own Devices: How Technology Remakes Humanity","review":"The book finished more interesting than it began, but overall the book was a disappointment. Many of the topics were interesting - shoes, chairs, music and text keyboards, eye glasses - and occasionally the writing was interesting.Mr. Tenner's style was more academic - many facts and dates and names - but he rarely made any of the people or situations come alive. If he followed that path, the book would have been far more interesting and entertaining. For me, what makes history is not the the facts and figures, but the people and the color of the situation.After reading the book I have many interesting tidbits of information, but unless someone is HIGHLY interested in the history of chairs or one of the topics in the table of contents, I can not recommend they pick up this book. I wish I could."},{"Title":"Byzantine Christianity: Emperor, Church and the West (Waynebook)","review":"Dr. Magoulias produced a useful manual for the study of the early Eastern church. The work looks at Caesaropapism, or the union of church and state. This issue, which provoked controversy with Latins, arises out of the Eastern Emperor's position as guardian of the Church, and his duties, which, in church tradition, were above those of the laity, but of a lesser nature than that of a full priest. Magoulias also considers East-West relations; over the course of centuries, from the final temporal split of Eastern and Western Empires in 410 to the Great Schism of 1054, he treats of each controversy, and how they progressively divorced the two great branches of Christanity in the Middle Ages. Lastly, each of the controversies, heresies and schisms is discussed breifly, from the Donatist Schism of the early 300s, to the debate over Heschycasm on the eve of the Byzantine Empire's fall in the fifteenth century. Iconoclasm is given the deepest treatment, which is appropriate, given the centuries-long struggle it percipitated. Reading about the various heretical ideas spawned then will give the reader an appreciation, if he contemplates the revival of so many of them today under different names, of how things do not really change so much as they stay the same. -Lloyd A.

This book covers the time from before the German occupation of Poland right up to the election and is very easy to read.The book leaves you feeling a lot closer to John Paul by sharing with you his expriences through the eyes of Malinski. The chapters each told a story of a point in time of John Paul's life and helps you to understand more about not only what he has been through but how those experiences have made him the great man he is today.You feel you're with him as he is working in the factory or trying to make his way around an occupied Poland after dark. You feel warmth as he works with young people to give them something to hold on to and you smile as you find how much of a sportsman he was (and probably still would like to be).This is an excellent book and not just a book for Catholics to read."},{"Title":"PCAT Success 2005, 8th edition (Arco Master the PCAT)","review":"Along with my biology textbook/cd from my freshman year, this was my primary study guide (I was after my junior year of college as a chem major).

However, I thought the test questions paralleled what I saw on the test very nicely. I scored in the 92nd percentile overall. Practice a little bit everyday to get your fundamentals down and hopefully you'll do well too!By the way, the PCAT has a writing section now, and I don't think this book covers it. The question is seems to be something rediculously general ans science related.

There is also a practice test at the end. There are \\"explanations\\" for each question, but they are much too brief to be helpful, especially for verbal.The first 45 pages cover non-test related topics about preparing for pharmacy as a career & preparing for the schooling.

I have never read a book like this, even in the rest of Erikson's (rather impressive) Malazan Book of the Fallen. There are portions of it that alternately confuse, disgust, thrill, and break your heart. This book is truly an anomoaly among novels. The only downside I can offer is the necessity of trudging through Gardens of the Moon (the preceding volume) before venturing into Deadhouse Gates. You gotta do it. You'll be impossibly lost if you don't. But believe me. it's worth it.I don't know what it is about Deadhouse Gates that grabs tight and won't let go - like I said, it's an anomaly. But in hundreds of pages of conflict, romance, mystery and adventure Erikson does not make a single misstep - not one false note. Even the ending, which would come across as forced and ham-fisted in any other book, simply flows into the imagination of the reader like a bittersweet wave. I love this book. The subsequent volumes of the Book of the Fallen (all 7 of them) certainly have their moments... but for some reason nothing quite rings true like Deadhouse Gates. I've recommended it to many non-fantasy fans and never heard a complaint.Got some bedtime reading to do? get Gardens of the Moon (2 stars) and Deadhouse Gates (5 stars), you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"It's taken me less than 2 weeks to read both Gardens of the Moon and Deadhouse gates. The Malazan series is exactly what I've been looking for a loooooooong time to satisfy most all of my reading preferences. I can't recall the last time I've been so immersed in a world, its history and people - well, yes I can, back in the early 1980's when I read Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant.

I enjoyed the character's in Garden's of the Moon but the pov characters here aren't the one I wanted to follow so I skipped this one to read Memories of Ice. In hind sight, I was following Erikson's lead since he wrote MOI before DG.Anyhow, I read this one after The Bonehunters(the latest book out at that time). By that time I was used to how Erikson construct his stories, so this one was a breeze to read. I was astounded at how good it was, what an idiot I was for skipping this. But on the other hand, I was glad because it felt as though I left the best for last."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I found this book to be startlingly good, even better than the previous GotM. Steven Erikson has definitely taken epic fantasy to a new level."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Such a complex story, deep in the fantasy history and massive world-building departments, well littered with realistic, complex characters that mingle, breathe, and die unpredictably. For one thing, several notable characters died by the end of the book, and even though I hadn't recognized them from the first book, I got to know them and like them so well over the course of this book that their deaths were startling, despite the fact that all odds were against them. Then again, despite my sorrow at their apparent deaths, that's not the end of their stories. I felt cheated, frankly, to cry over so-and-so's sudden, gruesome, undeserved death, only to have it negated in such a contrived manner.I'm hooked on this series, but I see that main characters in one volume probably won't appear in the next volume, so all the emotional attachment and history/setting memorization for one volume gets voided at the end of that particular volume. And the following volume will require brand-new emotional investment and history tracking. The thought wearies me. Seriously, I never put this much energy into studying REAL history!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Book 1 was tedious at times, but book 2 is a must read - what an epic!

Totally original, he takes his skill and obvious flare beyond the boundaries in this thrilling new book. The Chain of Dogs was simply wonderful, the brutality of it made it all the more exciting and the characters' point of view was a very nice touch in helping the reader understand the sequence of events.The story never gets boring; you get to see all the heroes' flaws and villains' good sides. Also Erikson doesn't associate villains with black and darkness and all that other nonesense found in most books.Well, that's it I guess. I recommend it to all readers up to a challenge. Never slows down but can get a bit complex - NOT FOR AMATEUR READERS!!!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I must confess that I quite enjoyed Gardens of the Moon, however, I was left wondering how some of Erikson's universe worked. Now I am starting to see that this universe is simply massive which could deter many from reading this series completely. *Some minimal spoilers await*The Good-The information one gleans from the Deadhouse completely blew my mind (I will hold off on going into more detail as I don't want to spoil anyhting)-Duiker maintaining his role as the historian is fantastic as you get much of the strategic depth of Coltraine and see the battles from an excellent vantage point-Icarium, Mappo and Iskarel Pust were both interesting and entertaining-Apsalar, Crokus and Fiddler were entertaining-An appearance of the Hounds of Shadow-Insight into Cotillion and his House of Shadow-The showdown between the Imperial Claw and Corporal KalamThe Bad (or maybe better put slightly annoying)-The book took a while to really draw me in. It wasn't until the last 100 or so pages until I really got hooked. I think this book may be setting up a future book to really wow me.-The whole shipwreck/flooded warren confused me but I think more light will be shed later in the seriesThe Ugly (OK this could be rephrased 'absolutely annoying')-Like Jordan's Wheel of Time the character list continues to grow which is quite easy to lose track of-Felisin, need I really say more? A very annoying character indeed although things may improve in future works-Lack of maps: I hate not knowing where I am period. It would be nice if the publisher took a few pages to give you all the continents on maps and then the entire Malazan Empire as well!Be on your guard in this book as you will need to remember some important pieces of information for future books, not to mention in this book itself! I have also noticed many complaints about Erikson's writing style but I find it absolutely fascinating. This series is not for the faint hearted and for any reader a reasonable amount of previous fantasy reading should be mandatory as well as an analytical capacity. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Deadhouse Gates begins shortly after the events at the conclusion of Gardens of the Moon, but features an almost entirely different cast of characters, and is set on an entirely different continent. This transition can be disconcerting, but is a prevalent feature across the Malazan books, and an appealing one, I find. Rather than the same location and characters becoming stale book after book after book, Erikson constantly brings us to new places, where we meet new and interesting people and creatures, each more fantastical than the last.Without going into detail, the best way to describe it would be to say it is like Gardens of the Moon, but better. In every way. Erikson is famous for the pacing of his books, which always start with many disparate elements that slowly start to meander about, gathering speed, until they suddenly converge in the book's climax. Not the most complex structure, perhaps, but Erikson delivers it with a punch like a freight train each time, and while the conclusion of Gardens of the Moon was a tad lacking in terms of weight, this one pulls no punches. The plotlines and characters are gripping, and you will cheer for them and feel for them like never before.If you read Gardens of the Moon and liked it, this is a no-brainer. Read this book. You won't regret it. If you read Gardens of the Moon and were on the fence about it, I think you owe it to yourself to give this one a try. Gardens of the Moon was Steven Erikson's first foray into novel writing, and it shows in some of his stumbles in that book. This one suffers from no such problems, and should provide a much better idea of whether the series is one you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I have never read a book that deals heavily with a 'long march' situation. Coltaine's March is an intellectual triumph, following the revolution in the city, through the epic, horrific journey to safety. It was done incredibly well.Then we get to Felesin's own long march. She and her two odd companions go through hell and back. But she and her companions are such unappealing characters that reading about them is a chore. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, she has this incredible transformation and is now incredible mature, wise and insightful. Clumsy editing, but nowhere near as bad as Gardens of the Moon.It is a good read, but hard to do sometimes."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"The second entry in Erikson's Malazan series is a good step up from the first book, though I still found it lacking in parts. The first 150 pages were well written and engaging, but then something slipped and the middle didn't quite grip me. The last 150-200 pages were great, engaging and very tumultuous - a highly enjoyable conclusion.While many of the characters from the last book are left behind, there are a handful who remain. This has a balance between good and bad: having to associate/build relationships with new characters is started from scratch in most cases, but it also provides a platform for wider storytelling and a new start for Erikson at character development.Fortunately, he succeeded in this, though not entirely. Character development is much more fleshed out here, though there are still enough cardboard cutouts running around (be assured, the entire character profile will become obvious if the character either squeals or growls). There's a wider variety of characters, each with their own struggles and character crises, and the way Erikson handles them borders on impressive.The plot is sprawling. There are numerous plotlines to follow here, other sub-plots happening, and then a huge undercurrent of implication. There's alot more military action (in great detail) in this book, as well as some sea voyaging, desert trecking, so on and so forth. With such a wide story, though, things do become a bit harder to follow, with there being 300-400 page gaps between rather short scenes which seem to carry a great deal of significance; in one instance there was a not insubstantial reference to a character from the previous book which took an internet search to recall.The writing itself, again, leaves something to be desired. Erikson continues to flit between characters, but much less frequently than the previous book. How it seems he's structured most of the book is that each chapter covers a portion of the timeline, and each portion of that timeline is covered from all the characters perspectives. The story could do with more chapter breaks; while a tight timeline can be good, forcing it in such a way isn't necessary; there are enough opportunities for chapter breaks within the chapters as they are, considering that many of the sections with each character are long enough to warrant their own chapters.There's also a problem with descriptiveness. It's very uneven. Some things need less description, other things more. The character perspectives in this regard tend to be weak and unfocused; Erikson is, after all, trying to tell this from third person subjective, and I find he varies from this perspective in describing whichever setting the characters are in.Also, his transitions between scenes leave something to be desired. Alot of the scenes open with a description of the environmental surroundings which, while good for setting the scene, are confusing because he'll wait until the next paragraph to introduce the character whose perspective we're behind. It's slightly baffling because 1) there's no indication that there may have been a switch between characters and 2) without a character to give some the narrative some solidity, something for the reader to hold on to, the story enters a temporary freefall.I'm tempted to give it a high rating because of the opening and closing sections mentioned at the start, but the middle and the writing issues can't be disregarded.3.5/5"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"This was the book that sold me on the Malazan Book of the Fallen. The first volume of the series - Gardens of the Moon - while a rich and plot-filled reading, was too confusing. Deadhouse Gates has a more linear plot (and it shows you where it's going). Erikson's ability to summon lost epochs and legends also hits the perfect balance in this volume. Most characters are well-rounded and sufficiently charismatic (or tragic) to keep your attention and the twist applied to many classical elements is refreshing."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Admittedly, I had a hard time getting into Gardens of the Moon. Took about 4 tries, but then I really liked it. The series really gets going in Deadhouse gates. Erikson hits his stride from page 1, and the book just gets better and better. Deadhouse Gates is a masterwork of multi-genre dark epic fantasy fiction, possibly surpassing (for me) Martin. Deadhouse Gates was make or break for the Malazan series for me. If it was better than GoTM, then I decided to finish the series. If it was the same or worse, I decided to take a break and read A Dance With Dragons when it comes out, and maybe a few others I've got on the shelf. Not only is Dedhouse gates better than GoTM, it's one of the best I've read from any genre. Characters are interesting, and developed very well. The plot is complex, yet more focused and easier to understand on the first read than GoTM.To be fair, Erikson was doing a lot of \\"setting the stage\\" in GoTM, so I can understand some of it's shortcomings, although it's still a 4.5 out of 5 stars for me. Once you dig into Deadhouse Gates, you won't regret the time you spent re-reading GoTM. I'm really excited about reading the rest of the series, although I might take a break for A Dance With Dragons."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I read this book in about two days.

Which is quite a statement because Deadhouse Gates was the clincher for me. Gardens of the Moon could be confusing, where as Deadhouse Gates is just a knock down in your face book! Pick it up, you won't be disappointed! I promise! Come yell at me if you didn't like it, I'm a fan of varied opinions."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"What a phenomenal sophomore effort from Mr. Erikson, following Gardens of the Moon (GOTM). This is one of the most fascinating stories I've ever read! The level of detail of the suffering, trials, and conflicts faced by the characters -- especially in The Chain of Dogs portion -- was thoroughly riveting, and at times, quite disturbing. My brand-new paperback is now dog-eared after 4 days of use -- it went everywhere with me, whether it was in my work bag, gym bag, or my cargo pocket. I couldn't get away from it. I thought GOTM was a pretty good book, but the second installment of The Malazan Book of the Fallen series takes it to a whole new level. The hard work reading GOTM (especially the first half) paid off, as the story really begins to flow smoothly in this book.As I've mentioned in other reviews, I've read just about all of the popular fantasy & sci-fi series under the sun, and had been saving this one until it was nearly completed, but I did not expect it to be this good. I have no idea how he can keep up this level of intense storytelling for thousands more pages, but I intend to find out with book 3, Memories of Ice, sitting here at my side."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Great book, action packed. I am definately hooked on the series now... it takes a little time to get used to Erikson's writing, but once you do... words cant describe."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Out of the first five books (all that I've read so far) Deadhouse Gates is the best. You have to understand that Erikson introduced so many characters in the first book that you're not going to get to read about everyone in every book. With the exception of book five, most of the books cover about half of the main characters. This book is amazing. The story about the chain of dogs could not have been written better in my opinion. I don't think Erikson was ever in the military but he writes soldiers so well it's hard to believe he wasn't."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Steven Erikson, Deadhouse Gates (Tor, 2000)I finished up page 598 of Deadhouse Gates, and my next act was to go to my library's website and put the third book in the series, Memories of Ice, on hold.Deadhouse Gates is Erikson's second entry in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, which, despite its rather clumsy series name, is bang-up stuff. Few authors write martial scenes quite this well in high fantasy; Tolkein's final battle in Return of the King, Elizabeth Moon's depictions of day-to-day troop life in The Deed of Paksennarion, just about every aspect of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Yes, I'd rank Erikson with those three. Easily.Readers of Gardens of the Moon may find themselves slightly confused when opening up Deadhouse Gates, no doubt because it takes place half a world away from Darujhistan, the city at the heart of Gardens of the Moon. You'll remember that everyone was worried, at the end of that novel, about something called the Pannion Seer. Well, you'll not see the Pannion Seer, nor most of the surviving characters from Gardens of the Moon, here (from the description I just read, that tale continues in Memories of Ice). Instead, a select few characters have fled east across the sea for various reasons, and only they link the tales.Like Gardens of the Moon, Deadhouse Gates is an ensemble tale, but is even more sprawling in scope; at any given time, Erikson is following between two and six plot threads in alternating sections of any given chapter. There are four main plot threads, through they meander towards and away from each other, split off, and join together differently, throughout the text. The first concerns a trio pressed into slavery-- an ex-priest of Fener the Boar God, a noble-born teen, and a barbarian, none of whom seem to have anything in common, yet who are forced by circumstances to forge an uneasy bond. The second revolves around Duiker, the Imperial Historian (mentioned, but never met, in Gardens of the Moon), who accompanies the Seventh Army on a grueling overland journey from the northern city of Hissar to the southern city of Aren. The third involves Crokus, Apsalar, and Fiddler, three of the characters from Gardens of the Moon, who have come east to try and get Apsalar home to her father. The fourth involves another refugee, Kalam, who has come east for decidedly different means.Deadhouse Gates is, essentially, a tale of journeys. In epic fantasy series (and this one is truly epic in scope; the first three books alone total close to twenty-five hundred pages), the book of journeys, or the book of transitions, is often the weakest in the series (cf. Martin's A Clash of Kings, or King's The Waste Lands). Erikson, on the other hand, has crafted an amazing piece of work in Deadhouse Gates, investing the journeys, and the underlying transitions, with more than enough action and intelligence to keep the reader going, while still getting all the boring stuff out of the way under the surface. Everyone gets where they're going, all the plot threads are eventually sewn up (except those left as obvious hooks into the remainder of the series), all the details that one almost expects, these days, to see disappear into the dust of all these riders on their journeys come to satisfying conclusions. Erikson's eye for detail is truly astounding in some cases.One word of warning, though, in case you hadn't yet realized it after reading Gardens of the Moon. Erikson is just as hard on his main characters as is George R. R. Martin; some of the characters in this novel have a decidedly Janet Leigh air about them, but Erikson never once, in the hundreds of pages before he dispatches them, lets you know which ones they'll be, and their deaths often come with the same surprise (and surprisingly-felt sorrow) as the surprising death at the climax of A Game of Thrones (the identity of the victim of which I shall not reveal here to spare those handful of you who have not yet started that equally brilliant series).An incredible piece of work, quite likely to find its way onto my Best-I-Read list for 2005. ****"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"It is actually a tribute to Steven Erikson's writing that this book is so hard to plow through. This is because his vivid descriptions of the central heroic event of the novel -- a retreat from a conquering army that is akin to Mao's Long March (although it's the potential \\"good guys\\" who are retreating, not a future oppressor of 1/2 of Asia) -- is so realistic. The retreating army's despair, desperation, resignation, determination, heroism, intelligence, brutality (and those of its enemy) are palpable to the point that it is difficult to read of the dire straits of the heroes. The second main plot thread is nearly as dreary as the youngest sister of Gardens of the Moon (book 1) hero Ganoes Paran is captured and sentenced to imprisonment in a mining camp. Her transformation from happy noble youth to defeated young woman to embodying a cultural icon conveys numerous tribulations, and few triumphs.Deadhouse Gates also has three or more other major story threads that are largely separate from Gardens of the Moon (book 1 of the Malazan Empire series), and is essentially a stand-alone novel. Nonetheless, Deadhouse Gates fits squarely within the overarching narrative that connects all the books in the series (and which becomes more apparent in Memories of Ice, book 3 of the series). It contains the story elements that have launched Erikson's career -- gritty stories of heroism and villainy, vivid action, intriguing cultural elements, a long and rich history preceding the story at hand, unquestioned originality (especially in comparison to 95% of the fantasy fiction available) and the feel that the world he created is starting toward a gargantuan eruption with innumerable initial tremors.Note that the whole Malazan Cycle is projected at 10 books total, but Erikson writes relatively fast (he's slowed to about 3 Malazan books per every four years, which is pretty good considering the size of the books and the side projects he is working on). Nonetheless, they're worth the time and effort to procure and read.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"If you're looking for a low-calorie dish of light fantasy, this ain't it. If you're looking for a nine-course riot of taste and texture, exotically spiced to make your eyes water, your heart pump faster and your brain do cartwheels inside your cranium, I know a great little Thai place downtown. Or, if you want something analogous to that in your reading, stop at the 'E's and pick up the latest from Steven Erikson.Like 'Gardens of the Moon', and indeed like the whole concept for the 10-volume Malazan series, Deadhouse Gates is an ambitious work that is sometimes in danger of over-reaching itself. But if you can buckle down for the ride, it sure is a frightening one.I don't know what to say, this is the greatest fantasy book I have read ever for a few years. The book starts of a bit slow and your not sure what is happening, as you read on you start to understand what is happening. The book is not just focused on one Character, but serveral. Like most fantasy goods, its good vs Evil, this is different, Good guys do bad things and bad guys do good things and sometimes things that look good are actually bad. So you don't know who's side you are on. In GOTM (Gardens of the Moon), people were say there was not enough history background info, but you find out much in this book, and I'm sure we will find out much more in the future books. The second half of the book, starts to set off fireworks, fast pace action, this book makes you think. Kalam, Crokus, Apsalar, and Fiddler are back, and they got business to sort out.The characters have totally different personalities, and aims. Also we see alot of Parans younger sister Fesilin, and hear much about his older sister. The book is building up to a massive climax for the seven cities, where each side will later have to gamble, take risks, and have the nerves to do what they need to. Also you learn much more about Shadowthrone's and co, history. And the new characters are wicked. S.E really knows all about writing battles, and descripbing exactly what is happening. You'll know what I mean when you read about the Chain Of Dogs.It is quite challenging to read, but when you have finished it, you'll be demanding more. I just can't wait for the next one to come out when they return to Genabackis, coming out in Sep 2001 called 'Memories of Ice'."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Having been utterly amazed by the world building and utterly disappointed in the story telling of Gardens of the Moon, I started Deadhouse Gates. Had it not been for the epic world building and the positive opinions of people whose reading tastes and preferences generally aligns with my own I would have stopped right there with the Malazan Book of the Fallen. All over the internet almost everyone agrees that Gardens of the Moon is the weakest of the series, and that after you read Deadhouse Gates or (in some opinions) the third book, Memories of Ice, you will be hooked. Generally speaking, upwards of three thousand pages is a hefty undertaking, especially considering the return on investment is not so apparent. I have to say that Deadhouse Gates was a considerably better told story than its predecessor; but I'm not sure at this point if the time and energy spent was equivalent to the output received from Deadhouse Gates.The first (and most obvious) thing to note is that this book starts a whole new storyline on an entirely different continent than the events that occur in Gardens of the Moon. This tactic works well because it establishes how epic and vast the worldly struggle is. The problem, of course, is with Erikson's writing style it is a huge personal struggle to get engaged with the new characters and the background of the area. If you enjoyed the confusion from Gardens of the Moon of being dropped in the middle of a sweeping landscape of political turmoil and magical/metaphysical trouble then you have that to look forward to again; although Erikson has definitely improved in area of character introductions. Some might be frustrated that it took 650+ pages to finally understand who the characters were in Gardens of the Moon and now they aren't in the second volume. If the third volume really plants me into this series (as it supposedly will) then having the multiple plotlines spanning multiple books will be a solid victory in establishing this series as an epic wartime dark fantasy series.I thought the plotting of Deadhouse Gates was better than Gardens of the Moon and the storyline/character motivations were much more real and believable. In fact, I believe that Coltaine, the commander of the 7th army, is the most fascinating character of the series thus far. I was engaged with his hard nosed, duty stricken nature, cursed by both his objective of saving 30,000 refugees and his location in the heart of a savage desert. In addition to the plotting, the writing is so heavy and almost cumbersome to read at points. It takes a lot of focus and energy to read Erikson's writing.I think the most significant struggle with Erikson's series is not that the book is not descriptive; it is ripe with description; the struggle is that it is descriptive in the wrong areas. There is still too many random occurrences and/or knowledge of the world, magic, culture, and army hierarchy that feels like it should be basic knowledge to the reader; but it isn't. I find that overall the sheer lack of information (that supposedly all comes to light in later volumes) is simply more frustrating than the benefit I received from the epic world building and the few extremely fascinating characters. A reader should not have to read seven massive tomes and over 5,000 pages to fully appreciate the first 650 pages of the series; and if a reader doesn't mind doing that or being confused, lost, or overwhelmed more power to him or her; but, I still cannot in good faith recommend this series to anyone outside the die hard fantasy junkies.The cover art is wonderful and the maps, Dramatis Personae, and glossary are welcome additions to the overall purchase.Am I planning on reading the third installment, Memories of Ice? Yes, although at this point I feel it would have to be an unbelievably spectacular experience in order to make the return on this reading investment worthwhile.Good reading,"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"The sequel to the quite good Gardens Of The Moon, Deadhouse Gates continues Erikson's breathtaking invention.Firstly, perhaps it is just me, but Deadhouse Gates is less awe inspiring in it's invention. There is no 'gawd, would you look at that' type of thing in DhG, as in GotM with Moon's Spawn and the Azath. Personally, I find this to be a good move by Erikson, as more focus is on the plot and the characters. This is where DhG truly shines. Much like Shakespearean tragedy, the characters drive the plot, not the other way around.There is no 'most important' plot within DhG, all of them contribute to the book. In fact, what emerges is synergy, where the entirity is greater than the sum of it's parts. Each thread has it's own throbbing emotion which is beautifully lugubrious. I must make special note of the Chain Of Dogs sub-plot. The final episodes are the most amazing I have read in all of fantasy. In my opinion, fantasy has never produced anything so heartbreaking as the final few chapters of DhG.The characters are worth special note in DhG. They are all solidly constructed, drawing our sympathy, and in some cases - Mappo especially - our empathy. That Erikson achieves this is a true testament to his writing skill. To be able to handle so many characters so deftly and sensitively is a rare feat. Duiker, Felisin, Heboric, Icarium; all are followed with our compassion throughout the novel.While there are moments where it seems characters are walking mindlessly, with nothing going on, there is an important point to these moments. The Seven Cities is a place where the soul wanders, and returns different to what it was. Ultimately, this is what drives DhG. The development of characters. As for claims that some plots are difficult to understand, this is quite untrue. DhG is driven by emotion, not the military intrigue of GotM, or the ancient mysteries of Memories Of Ice. To understand DhG is to feel.Last, but definitely not least: the pace of the novel is still excellent. While the journies of characters are sometimes overwhelmingly detailed, they do not move in circles like Jordan's novels. Everything in Erikson is very direct.In short, better than GotM, and without doubt one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Deadhouse Gates and also its prequel, Gardens of the Moon, seem to defy all convention that is known to the genre of fantasy. These books are so different, in fact, that it is hard to compare them to most fantasy. For many readers who are tired of the usual sword and sorcery quest filled with heroes who are overly righteous and villains who cannot be any more villainous, these books will be quite refreshment. Deadhouse Gates shows you the real side of war that is usually untouched in most fantasy. It's a sight that at some times is so depressing that you feel that peace and happiness will never ever reign. The excellence of Erikson's writing ability shines through in this new novel. His characters are wonderfully human and have real human emotions that drive them to do human actions. There are no invincible &quot;good guys&quot; who always 'do the right thing' and win against impossible odds. And although Deadhouse plays out with mostly different characters, a wholly different plot, and on a totally different continent than its predecessor, the book still reads with a believable and connecting storyline. Deadhouse is not without its faults, yet is a distinct improvement from Gardens, which I felt was only adequate and sorely lacking what is necessary for a good fantasy novel.One of Erikson's greatest achievements here in Deadhouse Gates is his viewpoint characters. While Gardens of the Moon was plagued with over 20 different character viewpoints, Deadhouse is told through the eyes of only seven people; Mappo, Felisin, Duiker, Kalam, Fiddler, Kulp, and to a lesser extent, Lostara. These characters are vivid in their portrayals of simple people trying to survive and keep their sanity while lost within the horrific wars that are unleashed across the Seven Cities. There are no super heroes in Deadhouse Gates, no flame-throwing, Forsaken-killing do-gooders. These wonderfully gray characters do what they do to stay alive and that's it. While this war-torn crowd is usually hard to like, you can't help but to be holding you breath in the hopes that they will win out in the end.When Steven Erikson writes well, he writes superbly, drawing you into his story just like the mighty Whirlwind itself that encompasses Deadhouse Gates. His battle scenes are written so brilliantly and with such stunning ferocity that you can actually picture them in your mind down to the finest detail. In this sense, Erikson shows you a different side of fantasy that is usually shied away from, military fantasy. A large portion of Deadhouse is spent on the Chain of Dogs, an army that is \`escorting' thousands of refugees to safety. Here, you spend you time in the throes of battle after battle and live though exhaustion, dehydration, and depression. Reading about the Chain of Dogs can be so disheartening that at some times you almost have to put the book down. Deadhouse Gates is for a much more mature audience for it encompasses very bloody battles. Erikson also provides some very interesting, new stories of what actually happened to the Emperor and Dancer and shows a side of the Empress that you might not have thought possible. And at the same time, he keeps you updated on what is happening with some of the characters from Gardens of the Moon on Genabackis.Yet among the splendors that I have reaped upon Deadhouse Gates, it does have its flaws. Many times the story seems absolutely aimless and redundant on it self. These characters seem to spend so much time wandering and wandering that it can really get tiring and you wonder that Erikson is really leading to. Also, some of the storylines, especially Mappo, are rather confusing. You don't really understand the reason for the characters actions. The storyline between Mappo, Icarium, and Iskaral is rather difficult to understand. Of course, things are resolved and understood in the end, but it would have been more interesting to learn then earlier on. Also, Deadhouse Gates seems so totally depressing and unrelenting in its brutality. Many fantasy readers have commented on how brutal and cold Martin's \`Song of Ice and Fire' series is. Yet, this series makes Martin's look like a Disney movie. I don't even think that the characters in Deadhouse Gates know how to smile.Despite it disheartening storyline and sometimes slow, aimless plot, Deadhouse Gates is an excellent and very worthy read. It is extremely different from most of what is out in the fantasy market and will draw you in with its realistic writing and engaging characters. Erikson has shown himself to be an important new face in the fantasy field and have surpassed many authors whose books are only read as time-consumers between the next books in \\"the Song of Ice and Fire\\" and \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. I have heard that Erikson's next book, Memories of Ice, returns Genabackis and continues the Malazan storyline in what hopes to be an excellent new series."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Hands down, one of the best fantasy books I have ever read.I am not usually the type to complain about Tolkien-like books, and in fact I enjoy generic fantasy books quite a bit. I tend to steer clear of books such as Deadhouse Gates and its predecessor, Gardens of the Moon, because so often authors try to be original and instead come up with an R or X rated version of Tolkien.Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series does not fall into the previous category. The scope of history behind his work, as well as the living qualities possessed by all the societies and characters set him above any other book of this type.Although Deadhouse Gates follows an entirely different set of characters (for the most part) from the first book in the series, it does not take long to realize that although you might not have seen the actors before they are just as important as the \\"main\\" characters who make no appearance such as Whiskeyjack.As far as dramatic and sensational endings, this book ends on a note that will make even hardened readers cringe. Once again, it is not that Erikson employs an overabundance of violence (although plenty of that is included). Erikson brings the trials of Coltaine and his men to life, and it is through the life given to his characters that the reader ends up feeling the ending in his/her gut, right where the author intended."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Deadhouse Gates is a potentially great 300 page novel that turns into 943 pages of hard, war-weary slog. I suppose that made me feel empathy for the suffering of some of the characters, but I didn't enjoy the book...His world, introduced in Gardens of the Moon, is built upon dense layer upon layer of history and myth. It feels realistically *old*, the way many epic worlds don't. The magical-religious system is intricate and compelling. The conflicts are not black and white (... perhaps a bit too much so: the strategies driving the Empire and its foes are at times less intricate than simply vague...The problem is, the book is bloated and sluggish. It's not that any single story line is bad. Rather, potentially powerful stories (like that of Fellisin or the Chain of Dogs) are all too often buried under multiple subplots and a swarm of less interesting characters in the book's cast of thousands. Individual chapters and images stand out, but you have to sieve for gold: the whole is far, far less than the sum of its parts. By the middle of the book, I didn't care what happened to anyone.Erikson's inventive world kept me reading to the end, but I doubt I'll pick up the third book."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Erickson's debut novel, &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;, was one of the finest fantasies to appear in recent years.&quot;Deadhouse Gates&quot;, Erickson's second (and the second chapter in the &quot;Malazan&quot; series) lives up to the promise of its predecessor. It is like &quot;Gardens&quot; in many ways, but it is very much its own story.Consider: Like &quot;Gardens&quot; it is very intricate. At the same time, however, it is coherently plotted and admirably plausible. It is extremely violent, but through it runs a strong vein of empathy (and it is assuredly not, as some have remarked, cynical). There is a backdrop of extraordinarily deep history and myth; on the other hand, this is a very &quot;in your face&quot; and direct narrative.&quot;Gates&quot; shares all these traits with &quot;Gardens&quot;. But it is still, as I said, very much its own story.Consider also: It is set in a different continent (the Seven Cities), with its own costumes, society, and history. And only a very few of the characters from &quot;Gardens&quot; make an appearance in &quot;Gates&quot;, even though the events take place immediately after &quot;Gardens&quot;. And, most importantly, whilst the background of both tales is the same - the struggle between the Malazan Empire and those that oppose it - the focus of &quot;Gates&quot; is very different to &quot;Gardens&quot;. In &quot;Gardens&quot; the story revolved around a free city attempting to avoid subjugation and finding help amongst rebel Malazans. In &quot;Gates&quot;, the opposite is true: this story centers around the efforts of a Malazan general to save his army and the civilians it defends from a rebellion gone out of control.This last bit might sound confusing (who are the good guys here, anyway?), but bear in mind that the basic premise any reader would have after reading &quot;Gardens&quot; - that Empress woman sure is bad news - is succinctly (though not yet irrevocably) turned upside down by a few deliberately ambivalent paragraphs in &quot;Gates&quot;.This alone is arresting and makes me curious to see what will happen next. But I would buy the next volume anyway: this is Good Stuff.In fact, it is excellent."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"One of the previous reviewers said that this book was different from other fanatasy books he's wrong. The story has been done before, in Deadhouse Gates you read echoes of Glen Cook and David Gemmell, but then there is the scope and depth of Paul Edwin Zimmer. \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" features some characters from the previous \\"Gardens of the Moon\\". The premis is simple a plot has been hatched to slay the empress against this background you have the sub plot of an entire continent in rebellion, the fulfilmet of an ancient prophecy and the corresponding jihad it set's in motion, the introduction of a pair of immortal wanderers one who is potentially the deadliest threat to mankind and all who live, the machinations of shadowthrone, more on the eternal war between the T'lan mass and the Jaghut and on a more intimate and somewhat mundane level the development of a number characters from the previous book. It is all in all a very good read, with heroism that will sate any fan of Gemmell, unrelenting brutality and humour at it's blackest for any Glen Cook fan and finally depth and scope for those few fans of Paul Edwin Zimmer.It's nice to really have despicable villians that you can detest with relish.One character does deserve special mention Coltraine a study of stoic fatalism and master of the wry comment, his campaign of the chain of dogs alone is worth the read.I've been derisive of some writers who seem to write massive tomes with very little substance but Deadhouse Gates is almost 900 pages long, the pages literally turn themselves it's one of the few times that I curse my ability to read fast.I hope Robert Jordan reads this he might get a few ideas on how to get the point. Sorry couldn't resist that but I really have come to dislike his Wheel of Time series as some sort of pointless excerise of female emancipation.Not that there is anything wrong with female emancipation but come on surely I'm not the only one thats finding his series quite the yawn."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I'm thoroughly impressed by this series. It's sprawling, imaginative and just plain big. The plot is very even, that is, it proceeds at a breakneck pace throughout. No complaining here about how \\"nothing happens\\" in the series. The dialogue is snappy and the humor appropriately dark, to match the mood.It still can be confusing, but not as much as if you require answers to every question and demand to know the minutia of every detail. I haven't really connected with any of the characters yet, however the finale to the chain of dogs march (and the subsequent events) had me deliriously stunned.If Erikson devotes the time to flesh out some of the characters a little more so they actually appear to have their own voice, instead of being relegated to just another point of view to push the plot forward, this series will trump all that has come before. Truly impressive."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"All and all it's a good book, and if you are like me and are planning on reading the whole series, then it's a must.

Side note, I have not completed the book yet, I am 600+ pages into it, should take me a day or two to finish. At this time I am a little sick of reading about the Wickens and the 7th, I keep crossing my fingers Erikson will find a way to speed up that story line a bit.

It does suffer from numerous OCR errors from when they scanned it. They obviously didn't even run a spell checker on it.If I had to sum up Deadhouse Gates in one sentence, it'd be \\"A bunch of stuff happens from out of nowhere\\". There are 4 main plot threads and the Duiker plotline is well written and really enjoyable.The other 3 plotlines feature extremely passive characters who basically walk around the desert the whole book while stuff happens to them from out of nowhere. It's hard to give examples without spoiling too much, but one safe example does come to mind (Safe because everything's so out of the blue that you'll never see this coming). There's a scene where one character is killed by rats and nothing at all in the entire scene makes any sense. It's clear that Erikson wanted to kill the character but couldn't come up with a good reason for him to die. Frankly I would have been more satisfied if he had just written \\"A giant hand descended from the sky bearing Steven Erikson's prints on the tips of its fingers and snatched (the character) from the desert floor, then withdrew back into the sky with (the character) in its other-worldly grip.\\" This type of unexplained phenomenon is pervasive throughout the whole book.I also find Erikson's descriptions of locations lacking anchors in the world. It's hard to describe the nebulous feeling I get of the geography, but basically it feels like the characters walk for a bit and then sort of appear at destinations that are ill defined. I never get a sense of scale of any city or scenery.I give this 3 stars partially for the Duiker thread, partially because there is the cool integration in this overall plotline, and partially because my friends insist the Malazan work as a whole is awesome."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Book arrived promptly in excellent condition, however it's a library book.

Once I became so bored I started skipping pages without missing the plot I knew I was done with this book.

Magic this, magic that, magic everywhere. When in doubt, he uses magic. This in and of itself is not detrimental to his story.Or there are times where things are just too fantastical, which also lend to the notion that Erikson had but a few loosely collected ideas and wrote blindly to connect them. Three slaves escape and venture over a desert to the bay. Very believable. A ship was sent to rescue them. Believable again. Then the ship sinks and, poof, a ship out of legend being rowed by dead men without heads saves them. A dragon's warren causes the ship to set on fire so they jump overboard and poof, they land on sand. They get lost in the mainland desert and poof, they find a cave, and poof, the cave is an ancient city. They are dying with no water and food and poof, this ancient long dead city has a flowing fresh water well and succulent fruit for them to eat.Finally, the characters all seem to be geniuses and understand everything instinctually. Little fifteen year old girls are suddenly experts on life. Or how about someone will think something in their head, and the person they are with would look at them and know what they are thinking or say something that addresses what that person just thought.I could go on, but I won't. I did finish the book and I didn't mind reading it. Despite its shortcomings the book still empowered me, made me want to keep reading it. It left a flavor that I kept wanting to taste. For raw flavor, good book; for writing style, not so good. I would definitely say read the next one, but only if you can check it out of the library, or borrow it from a friend. Or do like I did and buy it for sixty cents used. Only then would it be worth continuing to read.3 stars."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I have been reading fantasy for about 22 years now having read Tolkien, Martin (my latest favorite), Jordan, Jones, Feist, Eddings, Brooks, Weis & Hickman, Donaldson, Stewart, McKiernan, LeGuin, Drake, and even 3 1/2 books of Goodkind. I gave up on a couple of the above authors, but hands down the worst of them all has been Steven Erikson.After pushing myself to finish Gardens of the Moon I decided to give him another chance with Deadhouse Gates in hopes things would get better. After quitting 100 pages into DG I was convinced by a friend to keep going and actually made it through another 250 pages before throwing in the towel. Unfortunately it's practically unreadable. Not once did I feel an interest or connection with any of the characters. Malazan is filled with people who are completely flat with very little description or personality to set them apart. Erikson gives you little to care about in any way. The world itself is poorly described. That might be because it's a barren desert most of the time. He needs to try placing a little detail with the topography.Erikson is also a poor storyteller. He jumps from one set of bland characters to another with very little plot to keep them going. Unlike Martin where he gives you perspectives from all sides and develops complex characters bursting with unique personalities, Erikson comes up empty on all counts. We actually see very little of what's behind the Empire or Laseen. They are simply a massive force looking to conquer all. A flat one dimensional enemy. She could kill every one of the main characters so far and it wouldn't bother me a bit. I am truly amazed how much he can write, with absolutely zero character development.Another major weakness is that there seems to be an unlimited amount of magic or magical creatures that can pour out of any warren or place at any given time. It's both silly and boring at the same time. What did it for me was the following event a little over 140 pages into DG. On one page alone one of the many groups of flat characters came across a ruined temple in the desert (only the brick floor remained) and one of the characters by some magical means managed to release a bunch of rats, who then attacked a bundle of snakes. Then a swarm of wasps and fire ants started attacking right before a black 12 foot demon popped out and started shooting fire before engaging in battle with a white bear (shapeshifter). This ended by one mage punching the one that started it in the jaw to end the nightmare and then everything returned to normal. Within a single page he throws everything and the kitchen sink at you and then a quick return to complete normalcy. When this much magic can occur at practically anytime, it really numbs the reader and cheapens it all in my opinion.Once I found out that the world of Malazan was really a D&D; campaign that Erikson transformed into a novel it all started making sense to me. His idea of character development is giving numerical values to dexterity, charisma, and hit points.Erikson is the master at muddying shallow waters (or keeping you in the dark) to give the impression of depth. But there's really not much there. I give him high marks for effort, just an F for delivery."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"This is simply one of the most (if not the most) captivating fantasy novels I have ever read (and thats including the Wheel of Time, Song of Ice and Fire, among countless others).

Buy Garden's of the Moon, then buy this."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Deadhouse Gates (2000) is the second Fantasy novel of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, following Gardens of the Moon. In the previous volume, Adjunct Lorn ran afoul of the Crimson Guard and received her death from assassins of the Eel. Captain Paran scared off the Oponn Twins. Anomander Rake took the soul of the Galayn Lord.Crokus saved Baruk from Vorcan and then Rallick Nom saved Vorcan from the Tiste Andii by fleeing with her into the young Azath Deadhouse. Kalam and Fiddler sailed off with Crokus and Apsalar to take them back to her home in Itko Kan. Captain Paran, Whiskeyjack and the Bridgeburners rejoined Dujek Onearm to begin their new career as outlaws.In this novel, in Unta, the Malazan Capital, Felisin -- youngest child in the Noble House of Paran -- finds herself among the chained nobles of the Cull. Behind her on the long chain of three hundred slaves is the ex-priest of Fener, Heboric Light Touch, and before her is the common thug, Baudin. After walking the gauntlet of commoners -- cannot run when chained together -- the survivors are shipped to the Otataral mines.In the Pan'potsun Odhan, Mappo Runt the Trell watches a corkscrew plume of dust race across the Basin while he chews a wedge of emrag cactus. Beside him, Icarium the Jhag idly flicks a pebble over the cliff edge. His black hair is dripping black sweat onto the bleached rock. After Mappo finishes his repast, the pair checks their weapons, Mappo packs the tents, utensils and bedding onto his large leather bag, and the two go down the path to the basin.Mappo and Icarium wander among countless ruins from long dead civilizations. They come upon a six-foot-high column and Icarium examines its sides. Near the base, he finds a scattering of tiny hand prints. The seekers are on the Trail; in this case, a set of rat D'ivers, probably Gryllen. There are others -- both Soletaken and D'ivers -- who seek the Path of Hands to Ascendancy.Icarium, however, is searching for his memories. He knows that they are gone and is convinced that they are very important to him. But Mappo travels with Icarium to keep him from discovering these memories; the Nameless Ones have given him this task and he is determined to fulfill their directives. Yet Mappo is beginning to have doubts.In Hissar, on the Seven Cities subcontinent, the Imperial Historian Duiker and Mallick Rel, the High Fist Pormqual's representative, watch Wickan horsesoldiers of the Seventh Army disembark from their ship. A cordon of Hissar Guard held back the demonstrative Wickans, hitching their shields and unsheathing their tulwars. The Wickans recoil and then draw their long-knives. A tall Wickan with fetishes in his hair waves his lone long-knife and bellows encouragement.Then the tall man issues a wild scream and the Wickans sheath their weapons, saddle their horses, mount the horses and guide them into a parade formation. The tall man -- Fist Coltraine himself -- leads the Wickan formation to their barracks. Duiker later meets with Coltraine and Bult, his uncle.On the Kansu Sea, a fisherboat carrying Apsalar, Crokus, Fiddler, Kalam, and Moby the familiar lands by a village on the Ehrlitan coast. The Seven Cities are about to rebel against the Malazan Empire and Kalam wants to acquire some inside information. Fiddler goes for a walk in the marketplace and rescues two young girls from the Red Swords and a pimp, then takes them home to their grandfather, Kimloc the Tano Spiritwalker.Kalam acquires a pair of long knives and a package to deliver to the Holy Desert Raraku. Fiddler finds that all ships have left the harbor and plans to take Apsalar and Crokus overland to Tremorlor as a newly married couple on a pilgrimage. He disguises himself as a Gral tribesman.In this story, Kalam and Fiddler find themselves amidst an insurrection. Both travel as natives, but Kalam is unknowingly followed by Red Swords. Fiddler finds his Gral disguise handy, but soon is being pursued by real Gral tribesmen. Apsalar has occasion to use her assassin talents and Crokus improves his skills with knives.Kalam briefly meets Sha'ik, the leader of the uprising. Felisin, Heboric and Baudin are caught in the insurrection on Otataral Island and flee across the island desert to the coast. After the initial rebel attacks, Kulp -- a cadre mage -- and a party of coastal marines sail to Otataral Island to rescue Heboric.This story recounts the massive rebellion of the Seven Cities natives against the Malazans. Everywhere on the subcontinent, Malazans are captured, tortured and killed. Others flee and some, such as Captain Keneb, successfully evade their native pursuers, but still lose kith and kin to the insurrection.The Seven Cities under the Malazan Empire is much like India under the British Raj. This particular story seems strongly influenced by the Indian Mutiny -- AKA Sepoy Mutiny -- of 1857. In most instances, the Malazans -- like the British troops -- were better disciplined than the natives. Still, the Malazans in this story do not use native troops as much as the British did, but the tribes are relatively more powerful.The Seven Cities tribesmen are as well armed as the Malazan soldiers, with the single exception of the Moranth munitions. Even their sorcery is comparable to that available to the Malazans actually on the subcontinent. Of course, the Malazan Empire, as a whole, has much more military and sorcerous power available to it than the Seven Cities forces, but such power is not immediately accessible.Highly recommended for Erikson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of native insurrections, military tactics and imperial corruption.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Though Gardens of the Moon was tripe, oftentimes a sequel can redeem a failure's legacy. Unfortunately things get worse. Gardens of the Moon was childish in how much magic there was and every main character was important based on their power levels and their affinity with Flat Random God A. But that is Shakespearean compared to this moronic excuse of a story.The story involves the Seven Cities Rebellion, known as the Whirlwind, announced at the end of Gardens of the Moon which is rising to challenge the ruling Malazan forces. As a result of this pending outbreak into anarchy, the Malazan forces are worried and paranoid about what might happen, so they entrust leadership of their army to a group of slaves under Coltaine known as the Wickans, who are the most one-dimensional savage minority characters you'll ever get this side of Alabama. There's other story arcs, involving a group of escaped slaves, including Felisin Paran, desperately struggling to survive domestic and wild horrors, Fiddler and Kalam coming to kill Laseen and deliver the newly exorcised Apsalar home, and a generic schizophrenic uber-warrior named Icarium on the search for his memories while his companion Mappo does everything in his power to prevent him from discovering his brutal origins.If you don't care now, you won't ever. For the first two hundred pages, all the characters do is talk about their plight. Essentially, aside from Felisin's story, everyone repeats how bad things are with a dash of nonsensical prophetic mysticism in order to remind readers that this is fantasy and hey, if you don't get it at first, it's deep right?Then things do happen and the Whirlwind and the routed Malazan forces do battle while everyone else in between is left helpless at the behest of natural and supernatural forces out to kill them. People die and animals are killed but no one should care since there isn't enough prior buildup to care about either the Malazan Empire or the Whirlwind and no memorable people or events are ever mentioned.Oh, and despite the body count per page recorded in these battles as well as some of the dire straits faced, we know that no one will die and if they do, so what? Why does a traveling wizard party arrive just in the brink of time to save Coltaine's party on their death throes with fresh resources and viands? Why did Felisin's party find a ghost ship where there is a magical wound that was coincidentally the destination of a group of traveling undead warriors looking to cure it who arrived just on the scene to save them from a bloodthirsty stalker? A WIZARD DID IT!That's actually an acceptable explanation for this series, making for comedy gold.The other story lines involve lots and lots of walking like Lord of the Rings minus the beautiful imagery and locales visited. The characters inevitably encounter dangers along the road like random bandits, hunger, and other difficulties but as mentioned before, there's always a solution. Exhibit B with Felisin's group involves that they're wandering in a desert and a sandstorm comes up but they luckily find a mountain for shelter. They're starving and it just so happens there's an old spring and food in the mountain.It would have been great if Erikson decided to wink at us subtly considering all these artificial plot devices and let us know he's in on the joke. I question whether anyone can actually keep a straight face when they read some of the more random salvations that occur, including Kalam's near death from the total Claw assassin troupe cornering him and then all of a sudden a rundown stranger he met earlier pops up out of the blue to save him on a horse as if a reversal on the knight in shining armor to the rescue on his valiant steed. Maybe that's the point after all. I did laugh quite a few times at not only the quantity of the deus ex machina's performed but also the quality and how none ever seemed to remark on how many consecutive lucky strokes they had.The dialogue is almost painful to read. Erikson betrays his nerdy RPG-ing roots, where people will say, \\"How dare you mortal!\\" or, \\"You disgusting warrior!\\", or better yet, \\"That's a good joke, human.\\" Overinflated internal monologues choke with angst and it's clear just how ignorant he is of basic rules of persuasion, this one being, \\"Less is more.\\"Ineffable magic phenomena still happens that attacks characters and suddenly makes them the host of some boring dormant angry god ready to kill some other god that looked at him the wrong way and you'll never understand how or why. There's one particularly ludicrous scene where the exorcised Apsalar suddenly has her memories under Cotillion flare back out of nowhere, making sure she's not only overpowered but also giving Erikson an excuse to make her conflicted in an instant without any proper character development. It still feels contrived.Some say the closest thing to Erikson is ancient mythical stories like Homer or Virgil. If my death rest was disrupted by people associating my beautiful saga with twirling mustache top hat wearing villain gods and generic grizzled warriors spouting adolescent philosophy, I'd start some cursed chain letters to punish this slander."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I thought Erikson's Tales of Malazan couldn't get any worse after \\"Gardens of the Moon\\", and second-efforts often improve the first. Not so in this case. It gets worse: much worse. In fact, so bad I found it funny when hit over the head with such profound insights as \\"all of history and historical study boils down to three words: children are dying.\\"Such 'metaphysical' banalities assault the reader on a regular basis. Nobles exist to oppress their servants for no reason, peasants exist to be wiped out en masse for no reason, every nation has massive standing armies of professional soldiers (no one ever goes home for harvest) with no economy to support them and so on. Wars are faught for Power in the post-modernist sense. No war is ever caused by famine, crop failure, point of Honour (as if honour exists in fantasy medieval societies!), territorial claim, change of ruler by marriage and all the rest of actual medieval, pre-industrial life. In fact, I have no idea why the Seven Cities rose in rebellion other than some vague prophecy about the Whirlwind.Just post-modern, politically correct 'narrative' disguised as a story: it has no conclusion, like \\"Gardens\\", just some random events that happen to characters for no readily apparent reason, and plenty of \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" cards supplied to all important characters at every juncture: the ones you want to see die a grisly death always get rescued from nowhere for no reason.It's written, like \\"Gardens\\", as a screenplay, not a novel. Scenes are set in boring detail, to cut to another scene in counter-point, to \\"flashback\\" scene, to \\"dream-sequence\\" scene. You know he is trying to intensify the action when he seems to be describing camera angles rather than the action itself. One page - Cut! - next character view - Cut! and so on. But nothing happens anyweay, just a series of POV cuts and 'camera angles'.Also, claiming Flashman as inspiration for the battlefield descriptions doesn't hold water. Fraser was describing historical battles people could (and did) check on. Erikson just makes it all up as he goes along, making for a very confused description of the action, and explains everything away as \\"magic\\" or \\"the gods\\". Why anyone worships these gods is not clear: no paradise or moral high ground or self-transformation to be found in this hideous caracature of religion, just blood-thirsty ex-humans who exist to fill in the ludicrous gaps of the absurd non-story.900 pages to say nothing of interest to an adult mind and tell no story whatsoever is, in its way, quite an achievement, one Erikson has mastered if the first 2 volumes are any indication. It was no surprise in its way to find out that these were all rejected screenplays from a non-D&D; RPG campaign (GURPS was the English system laughed at by 'serious' gamers of the time) rewritten through a Writers Workshop 101 class, and it shows in the poor standard of writing and lack of story. Seems to me to be a sequence of serial-drama teleplays, not novels or an epic at all.Save your money, or try to get a laugh. It's a hard slog any which way you look at it. I'd just like to find a fantasy author who doesn't project modern and post-modern politics, sensibilities and philosophies onto pseudo-medieval realms."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Characters are appealing and overall, the universe could have been great if Steven Erikson was not trying so hard to play to the game \\"I will try to get my reader lost by having 100 different characters\\"...It was recommend by a colleague with A Song of Ice & Fire and if I like the \\"A song\\" series, this series is not for a reader just trying to enjoy an epic heroic fantasy tale but more for those looking for a brain-damaging experience."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"THE GOOD: I must have read a different book than some of the other reviewers because the only thing I can say good about this book is I did not waste my time finishing it - though I tried.THE BAD: Have you ever smacked yourself in the head with a mallet, over and over again?

For anyone reading Song of Fire and Ice, imagine picking that series up at A Feast For Crows, with all the plot lines and characters already established.

Usually it's not a huge problem coming in on the second book of a series, but in this case... Tons of characters are mentioned and I have NO idea who they are and what they are doing or what's going on... And as this book is 600 pages long, that's a BIG problem. I suspect that I still wouldn't be any more enlightened if I had read the first book, however. This is a big epic mess about tons of races and magic and slavery-fitted around a military campaign that is somewhat like a forced march beset by enemies... after a sort of Jihad-like revolution called the Whirlwind is begun. And that's about all I can figure. This is one of the few books I've read recently that I really didn't care for in any respect. No sympathetic characters (I really wanted to rally around Felisin--but she is SUCH a horrible person to be around, even if she does have some cause, that it was unbearable). There were one or two somewhat interesting characters (the two historians, Heboric, who is an ex-priest with powers and a mysterious past, and Duiker, who wants to free Heboric from slavery. I also was intrigued and repelled by Baudin, another slave, mostly wondering what he was up to), but they really didn't really go anywhere--I was still as mystified by them at the end of the book as I was at the beginning. There was nothing about the plot that captivated me. This reminded me of later Robert Jordan books where a lot was going on but nothing really happening. I didn't even find the world that interesting. Actually, it reminded me a lot of Jordan's later books. (You must know that I stopped reading that series out of sheer boredom!

The scope is huge, the characters are interesting, flawed and we developed. Don't read this if you just want to breeze through a book, because after each volume in this series you will be tempted to go back and read the preceding work to tie things all together. I whole heartedly endorse this author and hope that he can keep it up. IMO many who become successful can't(Jordan)."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"This was an incredibly good read! It wasn't as confusing as the first book, manily because it was broken down into 3 main stories.

I have 3 more already published books to continue in this journey, and don't have to wait until George finally decides that the damn book that he has left so many of us hanging on is good enough to be published. I would rank Erikson up there with Martin in authors with the ability to create a very complex story line and leave you wanting more after reading 1000 pages or more. The difference? Steven somehow writes faster without sacrificing quality.

And this book follows the two Bridgeburners, Fiddler & Kalam as they go on their 'secret' mission, courtesy of the sly mind of Quick Ben. Along with them is Crokus, our lucky little thief, and Apsalar, the young fisherman's girl who's possession by Cotillion has still left her a cold-hearted killer. We also are introduced to Coltaine, the new fist, who's travails will become legend. And we meet Paran's younger sister, Felisin, who's own tale becomes the heart and soul of this book. This book is gigantic, compared to the first one, but so layered, textured and terrific. Unlike the confusion that some may have had with following Gardens of the Moon with it's lack of set-up and so many characters, this book is much more left to develop plot, characters, and you feel completely along a fantastic ride as 3 tales are told and woven like a great tapestry. Felisin's journey, Coltaine's march, Fiddler/Kalam/Apsalar/Crokus's search...these 3 tales are powerful, riveting, and a more larger tale is beginning to unravel. Book 2, though lacking the slam-bang ending of Gardens of the Moon, is a superior novel because of it's heart and soul. These are complex, troubled souls, admist a war and empire that is beginning to shake, and as the gods play their games, these humans and creatures set the stage of whatis to come...and in fact, seem to control the playing field in more than the gods do."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"In the world of Steven Erikson, the destination is secondary to the journey.This is the second book in the series, but shares little common ground with the first installment (The Gardens of the Moon). Geographically, it is set on a different continent, linked within a multi-continental empire. Regarding characters, only a select few carry over from book one- including Apsalar, Crokus, and Kalam (among the mortals) and several familiar deities. There are plenty of new faces, though, so the reader should be prepared to meet a huge and largely unfamiliar cast.That said, Erikson's world functions on so many levels that is becomes difficult to unravel. Politically, it concerns the rebellion of the Seven Cities from the Malazan Empire; and there are plenty of shifting loyalties in this scope alone. However, a nearly seperate quest is ongoing in the heart of the revolt of the supernatural sort. It is enjoyable to read about either one, but the real fun is watching the two plots converge (often through several shifting points-of-view), with true significance difficult to discern. The magic system and racial structures are complex, and Erikson rarely feels the need to define the limits of magical potential or give the \\"flashback\\" scene to explicate the scenario- at least, never entirely. Finally, the intensity level is set high and maintained through much of the book, all leading to a sense of weariness that can daunt any reader. This works to keep the pages turning, if somewhat frustrating the reader who longs for a deeper understanding.The conclusion is wild and unpredictable- only occasionally does a book surprise me quite like this one! All character threads are dealt with, some with more finality than others, with a few open-ended storylines typical of epic fantasy. However, the real hook for this reader is to figure out the full motives for the unexplained or half-explained actions of Kalam, Quick Ben, and the Malazan Empress (to name a few). One thing is clear at the end of this novel; the waters of Erikson's world run much deeper than the surface can tell, and it will require several more books just to plumb their depths! Very decent fantasy, but not for the young or the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"First note: Parents, I would rate these books NC16Erikson's first two books have been notable from the outset in four ways:1. He immediately plunges us into his system of magic and introduces very powerful figures (like gods). These types of characters are often used very sparingly in more typical fantasy fare. I liked that change.2. He has obviously spent huge amounts of time fleshing out his history and backstory, the books have the richness and texture that the best fantasy novels have and you feel pulled into a very deep and layered world.3. Mr Erikson loves gore and horror, but likes writing fantasy novels. So his fantasy novel has LOTS of gore, horror, rape, blood, the murder and rape of children (more often than is appropriate). He is unrelenting and it is off putting and makes the books very difficult. I understand these are \\"dark\\" novels, but he rarely balances that darkness. I don't expect levity from him, but at least a respite here and there. He rarely lets an opportunity to stop and fetishize a horror go pass. Instead of main character riding through a square the writer has them encounter a child who men are attempting to rape, the child is saved but the men are murdered in the most grisly fashion possible. In other parts of the book the child isn't saved. He is a talented writer and I am intrigued by his world building, and I recognize that some of this horror is necessary for his style, but I am getting put out by it... I think I will read through book three and if things don't even out then I will be done with this series, the books are really starting to bring on a mood for me that I don't enjoy.4. The almost total lack of romantic or simple kindness in love. People are loyal, they are comrades in arms, they back each other up as soldiers, but there is no overt caring or sympathy even between characters that truly seem to have that kind of relationship. I don't think he likes to write these scenes, so he doesn't... not when someone could be beheaded instead! I don't want the books to be mushy, I want Mr Erikson to stay true to his style, but the books are missing something so far, and I'm curious to see if he adds any more layers sometime soon."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"If you prefer fantasy that draws upon the familiar, the tried and true as well as tired conventions, a storyline that is easily recognized and with which you are already well acquainted, with a main character whose adventures you can readily follow and a plot that is simple and linear, this is not the book for you. Shifting between a rich and varied cast of characters, with events taking place at a pace that at times leaves the reader breathless, this vivid and multifaceted tale contains enough material to fill another author's ten books. And, despite all the twists and turns confronting the narrative, rarely does the story ever lag or falter, instead hurtling on through a world so richly imagined and textured that any other writer must look on in wonder and envy---I know I certainly do.Stephen Donaldson has hailed the author's imagination as being &quot;vast in scope&quot; and &quot;almost frighteningly fecund.&quot; I could not agree more. This is a work that demands the reader's attention: so much is taking place that if you blink you may miss it. Though at times the author's prolific weaving of plot threads and imaginative furies can almost overreach themselves, never once is the reader long left dangling, instead swept back into the maelstrom of events and worlds that not so much unfold as rush to be revealed, anticipation racing over every page. Even in rare moments, when the narrative's aims seem unclear, the vivid writing holds one spellbound.Quite an accomplishment, and not for the faint of heart. Without a doubt, one of the best books of the year. There's a new voice in fantasy, one as ringing and exuberant and clear as a legion's clarion call, and it belongs to Steven Erikson."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Deadhouse Gates is better than 90 percent of fantasy fiction; however, it is overrated in my opinion, plagued with repetitiveness, fragmented storytelling, and cliches. Erikson reminds me of China Mieville, who also excels at world building and original premises, but sometimes lets his words and ideas overshadow the narrative flow. Deadhouse Gates is not a page turner, and I do not recommend it to casual readers. The first 200 pages are a struggle because the pace is slow and the fragmented style forces the reader to pay attention. Many of the events and story elements are hazy and left unexplained, such as the Whirlwind, Azath, and Path of the Hands. Does anyone really know what's going on? The mystical mumbo-jumbo gets in the way of the storytelling and character development. The usual cliches abound: prophecies, invincible yet soft-spoken warriors, demons, dragons, wise old men, elder races. All of the characters seem to have a mysterious past--no one is quite what he or she seems. Erikson makes a valid point about sorcery, gods, and demons: Although the novel is rife with them, instances are rare, and the majority of people never witness them. Felisin acts as the ordinary witness to extraordinary events, but her experiences mar what should be undiluted horror and awe. The novel feels like an epic, with its mega-roster of characters and multiple storylines, but I wonder if the novel would be more approachable if it dealt with only a single primary plot. Imagine a military adventure about Coltaine's flight with the refugees (reminiscent of Xenophon's Ten Thousand) or high fantasy starring Mappo and Icarium and their tested partnership. There are 3 or 4 novels crammed into this epic. My biggest nag focuses on the dialogue. Everyone speaks with measured words, and most of the dialogue reads like soliloquies. The passages in italics are the worst, filled with pretension. I also hate how often characters say, \\"I would hear that tale some day\\" or something like it. Everyone has a tale, and everyone else wants to hear it. I get the point, Erickson; you don't have to repeat it 10 times. Despite my criticisms, I advise any serious fan of fantasy to read Deadhouse Gates and appreciate Erickson's originality, scope, and often brilliant writing."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I kept hoping that after two books I would be hooked, but never did. Confusing, rambling plot lines, long periods of the characters doing nothing with very little action. Some of the characters had great potential but the author lost me. A plodding, joyless series that I eventually realized was a waster of time."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"It's not often that I can read a book whose characters are not really loveable, or in some cases even likeable, and yet find myself glued to the pages. Well, the tablet screen anyway. Erikson weaves a VERY complex tale of magic, moral's and gore, and does it in such a way that I became spellbound. A worthy successor to book I in all ways, and a harbinger of book III. THIS is a page turner. You will follow several people, in different locations and circumstances. I marveled at how they survived and I was intrigued at how their stories, though disparate, could be seen to be weaving toward a similar goal. Excellent."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Complex plot, solid writing style, great read. Characters evolve and the plot carries the reader forward.

This book in particular is amazing and distinctive when compared to the first novel , this series is amazing"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I just finished this book, literally minutes ago. My thoughts on it are still swimming around. Overall, I have to say it was really well-crafted. Parts of it were really tragic, which was the point. Most of the character arcs had endings I really didn't see coming, except for Felisin. I predicted where she was going to wind up in the end. She was incredibly difficult to read, although I can't say she was unrealistic. Her chapters were just so difficult to get through; they were so bleak. But hers, as I said, was the only story I was able to guess at. I found Icarium and Mappo rather poignant. Fiddler grew on me quite a bit. And Kalam surprised me most of all.There were a lot of things that happened here that seem they'll have ramifications in later books. I look forward to seeing what comes of this."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Lots of new characters, some old ones. Great story with lots of twists and turnsAlready done with the second book of the series and main plot lines are still unfolding. Way too much good stuff is going on."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Another tale of the Malazan book of the fallen by masterful writer Steven Erikson, comes the second book within a series that has captured my imagination. Deadhouse gates cannot fail to capture your attention with its spectacular, vibrant & bold cover that is so striking and so mystical that you feel compelled to open the pages and glimpse inside...Met with widespread international acclaim this spectacular original fantasy creation is something to admire and which is totally remarkable and astonishing; I guarantee you will have not encountered anything similar. This author is extraordinary whose fresh, new and exciting style is so distinctive that brings complex plot and detailed narrative to life. Vivid, atmospheric and rich his world-building is second to none with an inner suggestion to an intricate history, lore and mythology which lies beneath the surface. Truly epic and astonishing scope his books are just breathtaking, spellbinding and magical which have you lost for hours and that certainly had me captivated under their spell. Thrilling action and fantastic sword & sorcery the realistic battle scenes and drama spring to life from the page, as the words jump out at you with such unmistakable energy. Absorbing and totally gripping this story maintains its momentum throughout, hence you will never find yourself bored or becoming weary with endless pages of description - as Erikson has got the balance between action & description just right!This tale continues in the Holy Desert with Raraku (the seer sha'ik) who is preparing for the long-awaited uprising named the whirlwind. Meanwhile enslaved in the mines Felisin (youngest scion of the disgraced house of paran) dreams of that longed freedom and also bitter revenge, which is eating away at their inner core bit by painful bit... Whilst the outlaws Fiddler and Kalam plan to rid the world of the Empress Laseen, two ancient warriors who bear a devastating secret emerge out of the shadows. Finally the Mazalan 7th army now weary is led in a valiant running battle to save the lives of thirty-thousand refugees. This thrilling chapter in the epic story of the Malazan Empire, war and betrayal, intrigue and magic collide, thus shaping dynasties and giving birth to legends...The depth of this world is staggering to comprehend and I am so impressed by this author, whose series is amazing and which I shall certainly be reading time and time again. The mixture of well-defined and individualistic, memorable characters within an absorbing and fast-paced narrative keeps you hooked to the page for hours on end so that you find yourself unable to put this down. If you love the fantasy genre then this author is one to put at the top of your list and who never fails to amaze me with each new installment within this lengthy and spectacular saga. Complete with some beautifully detailed maps at the front of the book and a stunning cover, these are books to collect and treasure.I just cannot fault Steven Erikson's series nor his writing, hence why the Malazan book of the fallen series is at the top of my must-read list for the fantasy genre (specifically epic fantasy)!!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I normally don't write reviews but I had to write one about this book. I just started reading Steven Erikson book on the Malazan Empire. People have said that it too many characters to keep track off, but it really isn't. You will have your favorite characters and you will also have characters you dislike so much (you just want to choke them). This is the second book I have read so far in the series and I cried like a baby. A lot of books don't touch me as much as this one did. I really think you should give the series a try, starting with Gardens of the Moon. I plan on order the next 2 books and I am happy with the series so far."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Malazan Book of Fallen is the best book series ever written. Each chapter contains more content than is usually met in regular books or even whole cycles :-).Reading the whole cyclce again and again reveals more details each time, a new story or thread wchich can be understood differently knowing what's comming up in next volumes.If you're new to Malazan Empire, a piece of advice: Do try to survive first 200-300 pages of part one (Gardens of The Moon) - Believe me - it's worth. And when you finish The Crippled God, start again, from the beginning. You find that typically, after first going through, you get like 50% of the content, and there is much more to discover."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"After reading first book of the series, Gardens of the Moon I was left astonished and eagerly went for 2nd book to get some answers. Not that the first one didn't offer any explanations but it was shrouded with mystery and simply opened questions about the world that I really want to know more about.Deadhouse Gates is great read, simple as that. It's a bit more simplistic then the first one but on the other hand it's a bit more complex since you start to get a feel about how huge the world is. Throughout the book rare are the moments of light and happiness... darkness, sorrow, pain is everywhere.Characters are really well developed, plot is outstanding with all those twists and turns and there are plenty answers to the questions from the first book. After reading it I got the feeling I just scratched the beginning of the great story big enough to be called The Malazan Book of the Fallen ;)"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"There are so many things to like about this book: stunningly enormous world, intricate plot, compelling characters, chillingly brutal realism, and some absolutely tremendous individual scenes/tableaux. And yet, it's just such a darned tough book to get into. Now, granted, I read this book over a three-week period with lots of interruptions, and it's been more than a year since I read the first book in the series. Both of those factors may contribute to some of my confusion over plot details. But, even still, this is a crazily confusing story that makes it very difficult for the reader to keep up with what's going on - all the more so since it includes only a handful of characters and references from the first book.All in all, I really liked it - and yet it was so exhausting that I honestly don't know that I want to tackle the next book."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Steven Eriksons world of the Malazan is complex and beautifully written. Deadhouse Gates is the second book in the series and is full of bloody battles, interesting characters and wonderful stories, enough to satisfy any fantasy lover.Some people may have been turned off by Gardens of the Moons complexity, but with Deadhouse Gates, Eriksons writing and storytelling has improved greatly.Check it out."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"If you enjoyed Garden's of the Moon (Erikson's 1st of the series) then your gonna love this one. I was a little put off at the start with the new characters but it was very well done. I can't wait to start the 3rd."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Enigmatic , superb. This series is a world so perfectly imagined, effortlessly rendered that it stands alone. If I wrote fantasy I would read this and Quit.

My review is nearly identical to the first book. I really enjoy the world, the races, the characters that Erikson has created. The book is a slow read and difficult at times but worth the effort. There are more editing errors than seem permissible, all cases where one real word is substituted for a very similarly spelled word. Also there is a lag in the 100 or so pages before the finale and the clean up take a bit long and is heavy on the deus ex machina (literally).Complaints aside, it really is a good book. I will read more of the series and I would recommend the book to anyone interested in some interesting fantasy."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"great book. was a bit slow to start but once i pushed through it and it got really good. I couldn't put it down"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Started the series a couple weeks ago and the books are fantastic. Very deep story along with great characters. Not the easiest read as nothing is spelled out for you but if you are willing to spend the time to understand the story you will be rewarded with some of the best fantasy writing i have read."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Overall, this book is a good read. Some parts are confusing, especially in the Kindle Version because there is no map, so you are never quite sure where they are. The characters are well written and become further developed throughout the story. From what I can tell Erikson's signature in his books is to tell you just enough to keep you wanting more."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Best book I ha've read in a while. Erikson spins an engrossing, exciting tale. Ready for next in series. get it"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"The story is well written and nicely constructed. But as with the first book, it is hard too identify oneselfs with the characters presented. They stay too distant and almost emotionless in my opinion. It may be that Erikson would've done a better job, if he would have presented less but more developed characters. I don't know if I will continue with the third book."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"If you read Book 1, this book is worth it to read. It can get a bit slow, but overall I liked it about as much as book 1."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Do yourself a favor. Read the entire series. Slowly. Savor it. It's the best of all, and when you get to book nine, you'll regret that there will only be one more and a real wrap up. Unlike Robert Jordan, Erikson's books get better and better."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"So - Just finished this and I tend not to write reviews, yet I feel compelled. The book drew me in with it's plots and exclusive magic system. The main characters, every single one, is a person you feel for - whether you despise them or love them. Erikson weaves his characters and the plots of the story in such a way that I find most to my liking. Reading this book I found myself so thoroughly drawn in to the point of feeling actual fatigue and pleasure and shock and disgust accordingly to what was happening in the book. One section that still rings vividly in my imagination is the fall of Coltaine and the gritty struggle that followed that, almost to the point where I couldn't bear reading anymore.One thing that I found slightly tiring was the constant inner-conflict with Duiker and those around him, so mentally delved in to the book as I was it was frankly depressing and exhausting. I understand the need to show how traumatized everyone was but after the first 6 mentions it just became draining and outright unpleasant. Nonetheless that plot was in itself a magnifico story-line. It's almost as if 3 separate books are in this one. I am deeply impressed how Erikson merges separate threads in a very very enjoyable way. You never quite know who is who (for instance Pearl). The charcters and so uterly intricate and careful constructed it amazes me - I ponder how any sane person can write so. Kruppe in the first book and then Pust in this one - though I might have predicted Kruppe, Pust was not something I foresaw.One slight complaint I could show is the simple naming of the category \\"God(s)\\" - I'd be lying if I said revering to certain characters as Gods irked me. To me a God in a book is an one of the most powerful characters, not just a mighty character - refering to Icarium, the Azath, If anything Ascendants should be separate from Gods. Calling a character a God is more than just a simple category - it holds much meaning and characterism. Oponn in the first book fails to meet these standards.Overall completely satisfying and undeniably Epic."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"More complex than the first book and yet completely engrossing. Only a few of the characters featured in Gardens are present in Deadhouse, but I'll be damned if one of the secondary characters in Gardens (Kalam), doesn't turn out to be one of the greatest characters in modern fantasy. Incredibly, each plot thread is woven with what has to be an enormous payoff, and yet the reader never loses interest. Well done again."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"A brief prelude to my review is in order. One of the things that drew me to this series were the 5 star reviews for Erikson's later works. There are two reasons why reviews can get better as a series continues. The first is that the author's writing can get better. The second is that people who aren't interested in an author's style of writing might drop out after a book or two. I'm of the firm impression that the reasons for Erikson's better reviews for later books is because he writes more confidently in later books.I read \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" and had many of the complaints that I'd read in its reviews. The author throws scads of characters, places, races, etc at the reader without explaining much. The plot meanders. Erikson doesn't describe non-human races particularly well. However, as many readers also mentioned, the book picks up midway through and ends well.\\"Deadhouse Gates\\" is almost a carbon copy of the above. The first thing for people thinking about starting this series, to know about this book, is that except for a small number of characters generally playing a much reduced role, there's little overlap with \\"Gardens of the Moon\\". You have to learn a whole host of new characters, places, races and politics.The good news is that the plot is much tighter overall, and while I can't really summarize \\"Garden of the Moons\\" plot, I could do so with \\"Deadhouse Gates\\". I'd prefer to not have many spoilers here, though, so I won't. Yup, there are side plots in abundance which often feel again as though a party of D&D; characters suddenly decided to do something else for a bit, but the main plot makes itself known quickly and it continues throughout to a series of almost breathtaking payoff scenes near the end. One thing that Erikson does exceptionally well is to create an almost movie quality image in the reader's mind for his epic moments, and he's gotten even better at it here.Again, as is the case in Gardens of the Moon, most of his characters are pretty static, in that there's little character growth except what's forced upon them, but there are more memorable characters. The pace of the book actually feels a bit more plodding than \\"Gardens of the Moon\\", but whereas the former was more unfocusedly frantic, this was a more coherent read and one that I recommend."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I came to Erickson because I had heard that many people who like George R.R. Martin also like Erickson. The first book (\\"Gardens of the Moon\\") in Erickson's series was decent but was not spectacular in my opinion and I found the plot difficult to follow at times.However, I decided to give the second book a try. I'm glad I did because it is much better than \\"Gardens of the Moon.\\" The writing style is essentially the same but the plot itself is much more interesting and this book contains scenes that are much more memorable.As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, it is difficult to follow what's going on in this book sometimes. This seems to be a product of both Erickson's writing style and the fact that there are many different subplots to follow at any given time.However, when I started reading and found that I had forgotten what was going on, I just decided not to worry about it and eventually I remembered. So, as other reviewers have said, you'll enjoy this book a lot if you \\"don't sweat the small stuff.\\" And if you were disappointed with \\"Gardens of the Moon,\\" give this one a chance before passing judgment on the whole series."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"The Deadhouse Gates is bar none the best of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series. It isn't my favorite (that would have to be Memories of Ice or The Bonehunters), it's just the best. I have read reviews of Erikson that state that he is a great \\"world builder\\", but isn't a great writer. I have to disagree. The ONLY fantasy writer that \\"writes\\" better is Guy Gavirel Kay (yes that includes George R R Martin). Erikson's work flows off the page. It isn't the writing that slows people down, it's the content.This book is tough to handle at times. The battle sequences are gritty, gory, and thoroughly believable. I read one review that compared it to a fantasy version of the movie Platoon and I think that is without a doubt the best comparison I have heard. The sheer pathos of the end of the Chain of Dogs is enough to make even the hardest tough guy wipe a tear from his/her eye.This book also begins the twisting of characters. In Gardens of the Moon, the Empress is viewed as \\"evil\\", but in this book, we learn more of her motivations.Sheer genius."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"A great fantasy read!Although Erikson's style and skill as a fantasy writer is evident throughout this entire series (and also in his short stories, \\"Blood Follows\\" and \\"The Healthy Dead\\"); I feel this is his finest writing achievement to date... let me elaborate a little.As with his other books in this Malazan series, there are several story lines in this novel as well, but the main tale of Coltaine and his soldiers of the Seventh Malazan Army simply excels; this hopelessly outnumbered group tries to protect thousands of refugees while traveling vast distances across hostile terrain and against countless odds. It was to me, one of the truly stirring, written accounts of any epic journey... anywhere; one of those rare narratives that has the ability to sweep you up and almost make you a part of the story line. I was emotionally involved with the telling of this wonderfully drawn out tale and unashamedly distraught at it's end.Some \\"side\\" stories (for example, Mappo and Icarium and also that of Fiddler and Kalam, to mention a couple) are nearly as good the main plot, with their own interesting twists and turns.All in all, just great fantasy writing! If you love this genre, you simply must have this book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Wow! Gardens of the Moon was great; Deadhouse Gates is even better. Dark, powerful, and complex with flawed heroes and (at least in some cases) sympathetic villains. The Chain of Dogs plotline may be the most compelling, but they all have something to offer, and each story is clearly heading somewhere). Don't bother if you're looking for light escapism and fairy tale endings.This is the best fantasy I've read since A Storm of Swords, and perhaps it's even better than that. It will be hard for the subsequent volumes to live up to the standard set by the first two books in the series."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"This really lived up to my expectations. The action if fast paced, especially in the second half. We follow the Chain of Dogs, which is a Commander trying to lead civilians and his troops to safety, while at the same times being chased by the uprising. We see the actions of that through a Historians point of view. Also we meet both Paran's sisters, both in suprise positions. And you meet great new characters, Icarium and Mappo, who's names where mentioned in GOTM. The assasins in this are superb, and the way Erikson describes it, is top class. Actually all the action, fighting and battle scenes are the best drawn and detailed scenes in any fanasty books. Normally when a battle, or fight is going on in a fantasy book, you don't really get know what is going on, and the detail is not that well done, but Erikson knows how exactly to write the battles. The Assasin Kalam, is awesome in this one, and we find out more than you would expect from Laseen and about the empire.If you've read Glen Cooks The Black company series, You will not want to miss this. Or if your a fan of any fantasy type of book, get this, its got a mixture of all types of the fantasy in one."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"After reading other reviews, there really isn't much for me to add other than my vote for 5 stars. Just starting book 3, and think I'm enjoying this as much as Game of Thrones. I think I might end up liking it more, as this author doesn't seem to suffer the writer's block that 'ol RR.Martin does."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"One of the bits of advice I gave to people interested in reading Gardens of the Moon is not to get too hung up on the details. Erikson's books have so many characters, lands, people, gods, warriors and kings that if you try to get everything straight from the get go, then you will most likely give up in disgust. If that advice was helpful or relevant for Gardens of the Moon, then double it for Deadhouse Gates.This second entry in the Malazan book of the fallen returns some of our favorite old characters, while mixing in a healthy dose of new characters. It has all the complexity and dense quality that made Gardens of the Moon so impressive. Unfortunately, for me, it was a lot less readable and much less engaging. I finished, but I really had to push myself to go further, particularly after the second half of the book. Don't get me wrong, I still find Erikson an impressive writer. But this was seriously tough going.As a side note, I'm currently reading Memories of Ice-- the third book in the series. I actually like it the best of all three books. I mention that only to encourage you not to give up on the Malazan Book of the Fallen. Deadhouse Gates may be hard going, but the pay off comes largely in the next book.Erikson is a tough writer. The battle scenes are gritty and realistic and the books have very adult elements. Not for the lighter side of sword n' sorcery fandom, nor for younger readers. As always, begin with the first book or you will find yourself even more hopelessly lost than you otherwise might be."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"The actual story I give 5 stars. I love this whole series and cannot recommend it highly enough. But after a re-read with this kindle version, I have to say this ebook version leaves a lot to be desired. There seems to be no editing whatsoever. The typesetting is bad in places. Worse, there are times you have to guess what the words are.Read this book, but get the dead tree version instead of the ebook, at least for your first read through."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"This Kindle edition of Deadhouse Gates contains many typographical errors. Early in the book, I noticed typographical errors that look like character recognition problems (e.g., substituting I for l). Later in the book, there are many places where several consecutive words are repeated twice in the text. Amazon customer service accepted my report of problems and offered a refund but has been otherwise unhelpful. The book is not unreadable; it is just below the quality that I have come to expect from Kindle editions."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I just finished Steven Erikson's follow-up to his first Malazan Book of the Fallen installment, Gardens of the Moon, and despite a small handful of flaws, found it to be an immensely enjoyable read.Like it's predecessor,Deadhouse Gates is hard to summarize. It consists of multiple points of view chronicling a period of time in the vast world the Malazan Empire and the other nations are located in. There are a ton of races, both existing and extinct, and of characters. A lot of storylines. A highly complicated and intricate magic system as well as an equally complex pantheon of deities. And an almost overwhelmingly complex history. All of these aspects combine to create a magnificently complex and realized universe that feels alive and truly sucks you in. The poems and excepts of historical records before each chapter lend even more atmosphere to the book.In this installment, the action shifts from Genabackis and the city of Darujistan that Erikson introduced us to in GotM to Seven Cities, a desert territory of the Malazan Empire in which a bloody, religious uprising known as The Apocalypse is about to begin. At the same time, a mysterious convergence of supernatural shapeshifters is taking place, destroying everything in its wake.The book basically chronicles how the main characters are caught up in these occurrences. As I mentioned, there are a ton of characters, and multiple Points of View. However, unlike in GotM, it is easy to keep track of the 'main' POV characters and group them together. I picked out 5 main POVs (though there are more, just not featured as much):--Kalam, assassin and Bridgeburner last seen in GotM, traveling alongside...--...Fiddler, fellow Bridgeburner and sapper, who along with fellow GotM characters Apsalar and Crokus embarks on a mysterious mission with Kalam, obstensibly to escort Apsalar to her homeland.--Mappo, long-time companion of the amnesiac wanderer, Icarium (both mentioned but unseen in GotM.)--Felisin, younger sister of GotM character Ganoes Paran, who along with the crippled priest Heboric and mysterious thug Baudin tries to survive her harsh new life as an imperial prisoner.--Duiker, an old and cynical historian who witnesses events that deeply impact him while traveling with Coltaine, a newly appointed Imperial Fist.In additon to these protagonists, there's a slew of incredibly fascinating supporting characters, too many to mention in detail here, though for me, Coltaine, the deranged priest Iskaral Pust, and the Coastal Guard trio stood out as the best. I almost wish we got to see things from their perspective.As for the POVs, I found Felisin and Duiker to be the most heart-wrenching and gripping perspectives, though all are excellent. The stories told in DG definitely top GotM in every way. DG is gripping, dark, and often very gory stuff. Like it's predecessor, DG contains incredibly detailer military battles that are simply epic, as well as some awesome one on one fights.While not as frustratingly mysterious and complicated as GotM, DG, particularly towards the last 200 or so pages, still gets lost in itself, and I found myself finishing chapters and thinking \\"wait...what the hell just happened?\\" with no explanation offered, subtle or expository.Also, and I had this problem with GotM too, the character, setting, and glossary guides were utterly useless. I understand Erikson not wanting to simply explain everything, as that would take away from the magic of it all, but still, it would have been nice to have a easy to refer to guide to refresh the memory, as it is quite easy to get lost in it all. I daresay that if there was an actually helpful guide, I would give the book 5 stars.Nevertheless, Deadhouse Gates is still a wickedly fun read, with some surprising moments of humor between all the gore, war, and drama. A dark fantasy arguably on the same level as George Martin and Joe Abercrombie's works, the Malazan Book of the Fallen continues to be one of the better fantasy series I have read recently."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"In and around the Seven Cities, the wind blowing from the holy Raraku Desert carries the warnings of a rebellion brewing in the whole continent. As Sha'ik unlocks the Whirlwind and sends her followers out on a holy war, the continent becomes a very dangerous place for the Malazans.We were in Darujhistan when we turned the last page of the Gardens of the Moon. However in Deadhouse Gates Erikson brings us to the Seven Cities, on a different continent.As soon as I decided to read Deadhouse Gates, the first question that came to my mind was: \\"Will I read about the same characters in this book?\\" Well... If you're asking the same question then let me tell you that the only characters from the Gardens of the Moon that we encounter in Deadhouse Gates are Fiddler, Crokus, Apsalar and Kalam. The story of the first three is told in one of the story threads as Erikson masterfully manages four main story lines in parallel. We find the charismatic Kalam in the second story thread. The third thread is about a trio who just fell into slavery: Felisin Paran, a noble teenager (whose family name should be familiar), Heboric, an excommunicated priest of Fener the Boar God, and Beneth, a brute. The last main story thread revolves around the imperial historian Duiker (whose name was mentioned in the first book) who accompanies the Seventh Army in a perilous journey. Contrary to Gardens of the Moon, though, the characters in each story thread in Deadhouse Gates are most of the time separated by very long distances.From the first page to the last, Deadhouse Gates progresses as a runaway train that imprisons the reader's attention. The parallel story lines are well crafted and have well balanced weights. These stories pull the reader in different directions, most of the time in different parts of the continent. Furthermore, Erikson continues his world building without overwhelming the reader. He's not afraid of showing gore and blood, and he proves that he is one the best fantasy writers to describe martial action and battle scenes.I also noticed two things after reading the second book of the series: There is not any deep romance in Erikson's books, at least not in the first two books of the Malazan book of the Fallen. And Erikson seems to be just like George R. R. Martin in that no protagonist is safe in his books. There's something good about being caught off guard that way but it's also sad to see one of your favorite characters disappear.All in all, in Deadhouse Gates, Steven Erikson raises the bar one more notch. It was an incredible read and I'm definitely thirsty for more. My mind is already set on Memories of Ice. I can't wait..."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I can't think of any novel quite like this one. Its dense plotting, with its torrent of bizarre supernatural concepts and hastily sketched characters, is often blindingly difficult to follow, and there were times when I looked forward to ending the book.However, once I did finish, something almost unique happened: I had a genuine emotional response. This is particularly rare in fantasy. I don't read much of the genre because it's hard to find good, original writing and ideas that aren't derived from Tolkien. But this story ultimately produces a profound emotional impact, and while I may quibble with Erikson's obscure concepts and welter of detail, I can't deny his ability to make us care. That is quite an achievement.This second volume in Erikson's mammoth \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" does not pick where the first volume left off. With these exception of three characters from \\"Gardens of the Moon\\", you'll have to wait for the third volume, \\"Memories of Ice\\", to find out what happens next. But don't skip this one. Erikson is slowly revealing an almost impossibly bizarre world, one that is much closer to Greek mythology than the Celtic-derived world of Tolkien, and you'll miss important information that's revealed in this second book.Gods and goddesses, immortals and demigods populate the narrative along with the mortal/human characters. The gods squabble and meddle in human affairs, much as in the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are clearly Erikson's models. It's like a mixture of Homer and H. P. Lovecraft, with perhaps a dash of A. E. Van Vogt, David Wingrove, and George R. R. Martin, but it's all uniquely Erikson and uniquely weird, easily repaying the effort it takes to make the journey.Don't worry about trying to understand everything that's going on. You can't. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, and as you get into the third volume, more will become clear. (And things will keep on getting weirder.) If you're looking for something to get lost in for a long while, this should fill the bill."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Having read all 5 of the Malazan books (released in other parts of the world), I can say without a shred of doubt that these are one of the top 5 fantasy series of all time.This book follows some of the same characters from the first book \\"Gardens of the Moon\\", but adds in others as well. The Bridgeburners that readers of the first book remember are not as involved, mostly playing a cameo role, with the exception of a few off on their own missions.Kalam and Fiddler are on their way back to the Seven Cities, the birthplace of the Bridgeburners. On a mission to pay someone important back for betryaing them on Genbackis.The Holy Desert of Raruku has brought forth it's prophet, signalling a cleansing of the Empire from the Seven Cities.Erikson's sense of scope and the epic feel of the books would compare favorably to the Song of Fire and Ice books (and after my last re-reads of the 2 series, surpass them in my mind.)The dialogue never seems strained and the characters are vibrant.If you can stick through the first part of \\"Gardens of the Moon\\", until you understand the world, everything becomes clear. This is an excellent followup.An excellent read for all fans of fantasy."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I am in awe of this book. Buy a six pack of Mountain Dew and call in sick for work, because \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" grabs hold and won't let go. The campaign \\"The Chain of Dogs\\" is one of the finest pieces of literature I've read, topping even \\"War and Peace\\" and its spectacular battles. When the rollercoaster was finally over, I put \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" down, convinced that Erikson is better than either Robert Jordan or George Martin. The world is brutal and original yet strangly beautiful; the characters aren't as dynamic, but just as memoriable; and the plot is completely unpredictable. Though he won't be published in the USA until 2004, (he finally got TOR to sign him on) buy Erikson off Amazon, and you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"There is a large misconception about the word \\"dark\\" in fantasy. People call something \\"dark\\" and suddenly they are talking about werewolves or vampires or a rather perfect example to my point, Anne Bishop, where there is \\"pain\\" and rape and the like with characters with bat wings. But that's not really dark. At the heart of the novel, Bishop and many of her dark fantasy brethren are soft. The violence doesn't have any more impact than violence, the rough sex is always overblown like they are trying too hard to make it dark without understanding the mind set, and in the end, you know the main characters are going to make it out okay. They confuse darkness with dark.That isn't dark. Dark, like Heavy Metal, isn't about how loud you are playing, its about how you are making your point. Erikson is dark, so gloriously dark, it almost makes me giddy as a school boy as I turn each page, reveling in each grisly scene, wondering what next horror he is going to unleash, fearful for every character because the world of Malazan the Fallen is a sick, violent world where you could get utterly raped, tortured, killed, possessed, maimed, and/or crucified at one single misstep. See that cloud of flies over in that pond? Those are bloodflies. Bloodflies will burrow into your flesh and their larvae will eat its way out in a few minutes. If you don't die from the pain then you'll have huge gash-like scars on your body for the rest of your life.THAT is dark. That is the mindset of dark. The world can and will kill you, you will die and be forgotten and the only way to escape that fate is for you to do something so gloriously brave and outrageous in the face of that dark world that some historian or poet remembers your name and tells your story. Erikson understands that by making his world dark, by making it that tough and bitter and cruel, it makes every victory that much more amazing.Sure, Richard Rahl is going to pull off some huge feat in the last SoT novel, and I'll smile at it (and be relieved its over). But I won't be wowed. A character just managing to make it through a Malazan novel? I'm amazed.And I'm not just amazed at that. I'm amazed at the prose and the characters, about how much I like some of them and how much I hate others. I'm amazed about just how high fantasy this work is while at the same time being so dark, how humans can ascend to godhood and how other humans can bring those gods low. The \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" is even better than the first. Another continent has rebelled against the Empire and a lone Fist and his army must march across it to survive. Some might make it, but from what I've already told you, it will come at a bloody price, and it will be amazing if they do. If.Final Though: One of my Top Five authors in fantasy right now. Its not everyday that someone is more brutal and dark that Martin, and Erikson does it in spades. A real winner."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Deadhouse gates is not simply just a great book but also has one of the best tales you are likely to encounter in fantasy. Gardens of the moon was more like taster to help the reader understand this magnificent world that Erikson has created and deadhouse gates gets down to business. The character portrayal is excellent as each individual in this epic struggles in the name of revenge, sinister secrets, honour but mostly survival. Seven cities is on the brink of rebellion and the blood lust is contagious.The plot grips you from the start and you still have to keep sharp as it is a complex tale. But Erikson's superb writing creates awesome scenes and a brutal atmosphere that will make you sympathise with many characters. In contrast to the mostly gritty and violent events in the story, Erikson injects a good amount of humour usually bizarre but which complements the story.There are 4 major stories. Kalam, Fiddler, Crokus and Aspalar are on their way to the capital and decide to pass through seven cities. We are introduced to Felsin the youngest daughter of the Paran house as she is being carried off to slavery, yet the indifference of her sister - the new Adjunct- is more painful. Duiker is the imperial historian is in seven cities and will live the full horror of rebellion, as Coltaine the new fist struggles for the lives of thousands of refugees. Then there is the powerful yet tragic story of Icarium, Mappo and their friendship. There is also more mystery in the form of a gruesome convergence drawing nightmares from all over to the holy desert.Power draws power and power must be contained or risk unbalance. But even with all this world shattering power and the super beings wielding it, the more basic and human struggles make the most impact. And even on my second read I was still moved by this tale. However I got an idea of the magnitude and scope that I had missed in the first read and am humbled. The connection between history, sub plots, main stories and even short conversions or poems made me consider taking notes. All plots are relevant and some minor statement could be the solution to a great mystery, it is fantasy at its best.With this second instalment Erikson shot himself up on par with Martin, in memories of ice (book 3) he went 1 up.An amazing series which deserves more praise."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"The Chain of Dogs.wow. What an incredible tale. Just imagine making it into a movie. The raw emotions in the soldiers and the refugees were written so realistically that I found it hard wading through them. well, the emotions as well as the blood and gore.Try imagining yourself as one of the refugees, and you can see why human nature is such a debatable topic. In the worst of times, it either flowers or descends into the pit of hell. Human selfishness. Betraying the very people who're risking their lives to keep you alive. Look at the cook pots.... too ghastly. A commander who is so hard as to be made from iron. Without his iron will, the Chain of Dogs would have died when it starts marching.Reading through this book is an incredible journey. It's soul-scarring and heart-wrenching. Gardens of the Moon pales besides it. I first picked up book 2 of Erikson's series. Not because of its plot because I tend to shy away from novels that are too painful to read. But I got hooked by Erikson's beautiful and vivid writing on the first page. A painful read? uh, but it's well worth it. I've read this book two times. It's by far my favourite out of all the Malazan books."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Steven Erikson wins again, his first book in the series, \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" was amazing, one of the best I have read in years, and is up there sharing space at the top of my all-time list with greats like Robert Jordan, JRR Tolkien and more.The story is such a wild mix of characters, magic, battles, good and evil, and those in between, that it really holds on to you and keeps you going. As in the first, this book starts off building up the story, leading to non-stop action and a great climax at the end.Without a doubt, I would recomend this book along with the first in the series, and anything by Steven ERikson, to anyone who is a true fan of fantasy."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Never have I read a book or series of books that have so captured my imagination, my spirit or indeed all my emotions as Steven Erikson has with this series. I have read all of them up to book 5 several times, and each time is like the first. I have indeed cried for several of the characters lost during the telling of the tale. Each book is unique and you cannot read one without \\"having\\" to read the others.Lord of the Rings was indeed an excellent series until you have read Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. It is a complex story of war, love, magic and human/non-human nature. The characters themselves are so unique, so full of life it is hard to imagine it is all make believe. I would not have said I was a great fan of science fiction, but Mr Erikson has certainly changed my mind.If you never read another book, the Malazan Book Of the Fallen, is a must read. Read from the beginning, you will want to read them all."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Steven Erikson's Malazan series is the series that I've been looking for for the past ten years. Having read and re-read Tolkien (and his high-fantasy clones), I was ready to give up on the genre that seemed to be going nowhere. Why did everything have to revolve around Tolkien's early twentieth century themes? We live in a current political climate where governments practice fear campaigns designed to demonstrate the ability to protect the frightened individual against an unseen enemy. Religious and ethical issues are endlessly debated. Countries go to war to make money. 'Man' is only concerned with himself and is encouraged to get ahead of his neighbour in any way possible. This is a world away from the early twentieth century. Finally, a novelist has embraced the themes of our current world and placed them into a fantasy context. Erikson questions the morality of war and occupation, the essence of being individual, and the use and abuse of power.Erikson's world is very complex - the most complex I've read. I much prefer this type of series over a superficial one that I would just skim through (unfortunately the bulk of fantasy). With the substantial appendix and maps, names can be followed without too much trouble. I love this level of complexity as it allows the reader to discover much more with subsequent readings.Erikson's world consists of many gods, ascendants, races and peoples of various classes; some seeking solitude, some power, some following orders, some rebelling, some seeking answers. Erikson does not focus on heroes, kings or courtiers as main characters, but demonstrates the abilities of the individuals and factions underneath the nobility - the real players: soldiers, assassins, mages, warlords, spies. The Malazan series does not follow one or two key characters, more like 20 key characters with intertwining destinies, each with a distinct personality (very impressive), along with a cast of hundreds. I was initially suprised to find only four charcters from 'Gardens of the Moon' in this sequel which serves to highlight the scope of this series as all events are important.The series is set on at least three continents: Genabackis (the setting for the first book \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" and the third \\"Memories of Ice\\"); Seven Cities (the setting for this book and the fourth \\"House of Chains\\") and, Quon Tali; the capital of the Malazan people. \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" mainly follows the story of the famous squad of soldiers in the Malazan army called the Bridgeburners who would become outlawed by their empress after leading the campaign. The Bridgeburners return in the third novel \\"Memories of Ice\\". \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" follows four groups of characters on the recently conquored semi-arid Seven Cities continent which is preparing for rebellion against the Malazans. Included here are two outlawed Bridgeburners: Kalam and Fiddler; keeping the continuity of the series flowing. Also central to \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" is the build-up of the apocalypse (rebellion of the natives) and the flight of the Malazans to safety.Erikson is a clever writer. His handling of characters is second to none in fantasy. His themes are contemporary and his worlds are vast. Erikson has written a desert-like world with much more depth than Robert Jordan and on a par with Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\". The aspect of his writing that impresses me most is his ability to reach a climax that builds and builds for the last few hundred pages.You must read this series if you are a fan of serious fantasy. Not only is the world complex, but the characters are brilliant and the stories first rate. Steven Erikson, along with George R R Martin and R Scott Bakker, are the future of fantasy."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Deadhouse Gates continues the Malazan Book of the Fallen series bringing in a whole load of new characters and really progressing the series towards what will obviously be a great climax. Reading this book, I got immersed in the struggles that the different characters were trying to overcome. I could easily picture in my mind everything Erikson described and really understand why the characters felt the way that they did. I eagerly await book three. This series is a must read for anyone who likes a good book, even if they're not hardcore fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"It is actually a tribute to Steven Erikson's writing that this book is so hard to plow through. This is because his vivid descriptions of the central heroic event of the novel -- a retreat from a conquering army that is akin to Mao's Long March (although it's the potential &quot;good guys&quot; who are retreating, not a future oppressor of 1/2 of Asia) -- is so realistic. The retreating army's despair, desperation, resignation, determination, heroism, intelligence, brutality (and those of its enemy) are palpable to the point that it is hard to continue reading of the dire straits of the heroes.Deadhouse Gates also has three or more other story threads that are largely separate from Gardens of the Moon (book 1 of the Malazan Empire series), and is essentially a stand-alone novel. Nonetheless, Deadhouse Gates fits squarely within the overarching narrative that connects all the books in the series (and which becomes more apparent in Memories of Ice, book 3 of the series). It contains the story elements that have launched Erikson's career -- gritty stories of heroism and villainy, vivid action, intriguing cultural elements, unquestioned originality (especially in comparison to 95% of the fantasy fiction available) and the feel that the world he created is starting toward a gargantuan eruption with innumerable initial tremors.These books are hard to procure in the US because Erikson does not have a US publisher yet. Also -- the whole Malazan Cycle is projected at 10 books total, but Erikson writes relatively fast (one book/year). Nonetheless, they're worth the time and effort to procure and read. Recommended."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"* No spoilers *The first book of this series really got me hooked. I love the intricate weaving of the world Erikson has created. He is does a masterful job of revealing an enticing amount about the structure of the world he created, while leaving enough as only hints to keep the reader interested and engaging the most important weapon of the fantasy writer, the reader's imagination. The more I read, the more I realize just how complex Erikson's universe is! I love that he put so much detail and planning into its construction.Deadhouse Gates follows the same basic trend as the first book of the series, Gardens of the Moon. The reader is introduced to the world in bits and pieces rather than an upfront explanation. I enjoyed this method because it feels more authentic than, &#34;alright guys, here is what is going on...&#34; The only downside of this novel is that it moves fairly slowly compared to the last novel. It is certainly not boring, but there were times that my interest began to ebb. The structure of this book is more like those of Robert Jordan, a long buildup to a climactic ending. The hinting and suggesting lasts a bit too long for many of the pieces of the story. Still, the climax is worth the wait!One thing that I disliked about this particular book is how devastatingly sad and disturbing certain parts of the story are. Like the red wedding in Game of Thrones, on certain occasions, I did not leave the book feeling good. This is another testament to Erikson's skill at manipulating the readers' emotions. It also plays in with an interesting theme. What we thought was the enemy becomes the hero and the hero the enemy. No one side is glorified in this book, nor is one cast as the antagonist. Rather, bits and pieces of each faction have heroic or evil qualities. This is very much true to life!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I read twice the whole serie and my first impression remains: they are a masterpiece of modern fantasy. The second time I enjoyed much more the use of the language, the whole structure of the books and the depth of the characters ideology.

Why is it different than the rest you may ask? First, the scale is epic in the full sense of the word - a lot of continents, hundreds of tribes, races, states, characters, more than a hundred thousand years history of the world, legends, many gods, factions and intrigues. Secondly, Steven Erikson writes superbly - the sentences flow effortlessly and he can play on the readers emotions like few other authors. He uses words people like Robert Jordan don't know that even exist in the dictionary. His characters are neither &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and his plot is as little cliche-plagued as possible while actually staying in the epic fantasy genre. Plus Erikson is a master of the humorous dialogue and hilarious characters.About this volume - most of the characters are different from the Gardens of the Moon which may annoy some readers but be assured the cast from GotM returns in Book 3. This book is Dark fantasy in the true meaning of the word dark - bloody (and I mean really bloody) rebellion, gruesome battles, slave labor mines etc but SE doesn't describe the details with the sick passion of G.R.R.Martin he just shows us the real face of war. Erikson's world is not the nicest place to be.:) The Chain of Dogs military campaign is the best in the genre and its ending is one of the most emotionally touching scenes I have ever read in any book from any genre. If you like non-conventional fantasy you just have to give the Malazan Book of the Fallen a chance."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"If you're looking for a light fluffy easy-reading fantasy, read Brooks or Eddings. If, however, you are looking for something thought provoking, brutal, staggering, heartbreaking, & breathtaking with believeable characters to boot, then read Steven Erikson.This book can be hard going. Even after 700 pages into the book I still found myself refering to the glossary and index of the book when new characters popped into being; no shortage of characters here folks as seems to be the case with all Erikson's Malazan books.The book focuses on four separate but still connected groups of characters and their stories. I found characters whom I had forgotten about 400 pages back suddenly reappearing(thank God for the glossary!).Erikson creates a thoroughly believeable world;This is not a \\"Good vs. Evil\\" story, in fact it is usually impossible to discern between the two; Men and women fight side by side in battle; Assassins have \\"soft-spots\\"; Even the Gods themselves have \\"human\\" qualities such as weaknesses and a good sense of humour.This is the second book in the Malazan Series(out of ten; however only four have been published so far) Gardens of the Moon is the first book. The reason I only gave it 4 stars was the lack of depth in certain characters(eg. Coltaine; leader of the Chain of Dogs: for someone so important to the story we know very little about him).This book can also be purchased through amazon.ca. Erickson's books are usually in stock and sent out within 24 hours."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"After reading Gardens of the Moon, I had the distinct impression this was going to be a grand tale the likes of which is rarely seen in the fantasy genre. Once this tale is complete, I am under the belief it will be one of the best for a long long time.Now, before I start on this review, know that I loved Gardens of the Moon.In Deadhouse Gates at times I felt like I was being pulled in too many directions at a time. I fully understand that there are multiple plot lines with-in this book, but I'm not sure if having all 6 plot lines in one chapter is the right delivery was the right way to do it.With that said, the vastness of the various plot lines is fantastic. I love the fact that Erikson has no qualms about killing a character if it will better tell the story. Unlike most Forgotten Realms/Dragonlance books, characters shouldn't always 'make it'. There needs to be some reality mixed in and that is certainly present here.I enjoy the richness of the world building that Erikson pus forth. It is fairly easy world to 'see' in your mind as Erikson mixes in a good amount of detail. He toes the fine line of not telling the reader too much detail to let the reader see things how they want to.His character development continues to be very good as well. Although, just when I though I was understanding a character, he went and killed him. Each and every character is a complex individual person with their own ideals of what should happen within their part of the world. Erikson does a great job of mixing these ideals between characters and between plot lines.While I personally don't think Deadhouse Gates is as good as Gardens of the Moon I don't think it's a terrible book either. If fact I enjoyed it quite a bit, except for the pulling in too many directions."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Patient readers who struggled through Gardens of the Moon are amply rewarded for their guts and patience in Deadhouse Gates. In Gardens of the Moon, Erikson drops the reader, unprepared, into the middle of a world war that spans continents. Deadhouse Gates returns to the same world and a few of the same characters, but is a much easier read for those already familiar with the Malazan world.Malazan is an empire that expands its boundaries and riches through military conquest. The aristocracy of each conquered land are culled upon defeat. Culled means killed or sent to the ottataral mines. Enter Felisin, daughter of an aristocratic house who is given to the cull for her city by her sister, Tavore, new adjunct to the Empress. Deadhouse Gates follows Felisin's trip to the mines and her trip to despair and ultimately a way to challenge the might of the Malazan Empire and her sister.A revolution is brewing as well and the Malazan cities have been taken back in a brutal uprising that leaves Coltain, a Malazan commander, fleeing across inhospitable desert with tens of thousands of refugees in his charge and a revolutionary force dogging his every step to safety. This portion of the book is narrated by the Malazan historian, Duiker and makes for stunning reading.Crokus and Apsalar and Kalam and new characters in the form of Icarium, Mappo and Pust are also wandering this vast desert and the magic of the world, which both helps and hinders is present in every storyline as well. Deadhouse Gates is as rich and complex as Gardens of the Moon, but reads more easily, though the astute reader may wish to revisit certain parts of the tale in subsequent readings as other information becomes available in further volumes.Erikson has reset the bar for complex epic fantasy. His imagination and attention to detail are astounding. His writing is a joy. Recommended for serious lovers of intricate fantasy."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"While Gardens of the Moon was, though a great book in its own right, the worst book in this series, Deadhouse Gates is one of the best. However, Deadhouse Gates is also one of the two most difficult reads of the series. Not only is it long, 943 pages, but it is extremely heavy reading. I won't give you any details, don't want to spoil the book, but the story follows a small army of refugees known as the Chain of Dogs, as they attempt to make their way across a continent in the midst of rebellion. This book and the next in the series Memories of Ice contain the most difficult, and most mature, thematic material that I have come across in the series, and it would not be entirely inappropriate to compare them to works such as Schindler's List or events like the Trail of Tears (in my opinion a possible source of partial inspiration for the story here, though I am not privy to Erikson's mind). That being said, Erikson handles difficult subject matter beautifully, and what results is a deeply moving, emotionally trying, and ultimately uplifting reading experience.Overall: 10/10Where Garden's of the Moon was the easiest of the series to read, its immediate sequel, Deadhouse Gates, is possibly the most difficult. However, though a difficult read, it is also a phenomenal examination of both the best, and the worst, of human nature. You will find yourself enamored of characters like Coltaine and Duiker, hurting for Felisin, and laughing at the antics of Iskaral Pust. All together this book weaves several storylines into one, like most of Erikson's work, while still keeping each story distinct and important.Writing: 9.5/10Erikson's writing is at its best in Deadhouse Gates. While it lacks the flowing grace of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, Deadhouse Gates is written in a masterful style that manages to be both simple and meaningful at the same time.Characters: 10/10Erikson's characters are always wonderful. However, the devastating events of Deadhouse Gates truly allow his characters to shine. Like Whiskeyjack and Quickben in the first novel, you will find characters here that you will never forget. However, they will be all the more meaningful because of the situations through which they shine. Coltaine and Duiker stand out as my two favorite characters in this novel, both because of their intense realism, but also because of their overwhelming humanity. Through these two characters Erikson shows us some of the best of which men are capable.World: 10/10While we do not see much of the continent of Genabackis (the setting for Gardens of the Moon), Deadhouse Gates takes the reader on a long, and sometimes meandering, tour of the Seven Cities, a large and very barren continent. The world that Erikson creates here is not only broad, but real (often devastatingly so), and humbling. Erikson's world truly begins to take on the shape that it was missing throughout Gardens of the Moon, and this draws the reader in that much further.Plot: 10/10Deadhouse Gates is not only original, epic, and realistic in its plot, but it sets the tone for the series as a whole. Erikson's work in this book feels complete, but it is not until two books later, at the end of Chain of Dogs, that you realize how much he begins here that he does not end. This ability to provide a complete story, while creating foreshadowing, and unknown anticipation for what is to come, becomes a hallmark of the Malazan Book of the Fallen. I have never before read a series that allowed me to feel that the story was complete, while at the same time knowing that there must be more to come - to be satisfied, and yet yearning for more.Pacing: 9/10While the pacing in Deadhouse Gates is excellent, it is a slow novel overall, and this will make reading it even more difficult for those of you who lack patience.Commentary: 10/10Deadhouse Gates has some incredible commentary on the nature of man, both good and bad. Erikson also offers us brief comments on the value and place of academia, and the purpose of power.Conclusion:If you can finish Deadhouse Gates, then you will want to read the rest of the series. If you can't finish it, either because of length, the nature of the content, or the depth of the content, then the rest of the series probably isn't for you."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Brilliant characters.

I would settle for more general approach to the battles.Otherwise fantastic book."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"This 2nd installment, was an improvement over the first book in that the descriptions were more vivid, especially for the warrens and the descriptions of \\"other non-humans\\".The characters (new and old) were moving, and there was certainly deep irony, especially at the end when Kalam meets Lasseen.Nonetheless there are still deep issues that need to be addressed, and I do hope there is improvement:* The action at times really got confusing and it was hard to keep track of what was going on.* The author still resolves deep issues with totally random leaps Example - at a critical battle during the 2nd half of Coltaine's march, one tribe that was about to harass Coltain's army decides they will fight with their collaborators. That was just ridiculous, and could have been solved easily, by spending some time in Coltaine's opponent's camp, and using a POV that showed how Coltaine's antagonist ran his camp. That would have been positive from many perspectives, because the treacherous turn could have been anticipated, and it would have provided an excellent contrast to Coltaine's leadership skills.* the arrival of fresh supplies at just the right moment ( from a warren a continent away) was also badly drawn.* that sudden turn of events was flimsy indeed given what finally happened to Coltaine's army* the Malazan garrison surrendered at the order of their High fist outside of Aren, once the High Fist had been \\"removed\\" from command, and the sentence for the entire garrison was announced, you would think they would do anything to avoid their fate. That ending did not at all jive with the Malazan army as a general rule. the idea that they just blindly obey and that is their weakness was not good enough for me.* there were other similar short comings, but the writing is getting more immersive.* In addition I found several very quotable passages, which is nice.The writing keeps me going, but it is not unreasonable to expect more."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Okay, right off the bat if you don't like lots and lots of characters this book...no this series...isn't for you. But, this is real world building, not some tale that centers around a central character with just multiple people coming in and out of scenes. I have yet to define a main character. This is why its real world building, because in the real world there are many many people who all play their roles. Erikson weaves an interesting plot with characters that are complex, not just flat/static people. Now he does bail some characters out when it gets tough, but other big characters he doesn't. The book kept me enthralled all the way to the end. Yes, its long, but whats wrong with that personally i think thats good, more to read for me!"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"After reading book 1, it was a little disconcerting to start with another new set of characters, though it was nice to have a couple of the old ones. His detailed narration of strategy, war, and his character developments are just incomparable. I've never been so blown away by any other author. I LOVE erikson's writing. His stories each stand apart, and this is the FIRST fantasy writer (other than Tolkien) who's sequel does not in ANY WAY sell the reader short. I bawled my eyes out at the end. It's amazing! His style, writing, and command of a story... breath-taking. There is not praise enough to give for this writer."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I won't waste time with what others have said. Okay maybe a little: this is dark, epic fantasy at its best, and you better keep track of the plot and characters, because the author is not going to walk you through this one. Erikson is a master of writing an emotionally gut-wrenching scene but then following it up with an uplifting glimpse into the future that will have you smiling in anticipation of what's to come.Unlike many other series in this genre, you see the world and its characters progressing. Each book pulls the world forward and you can see a grand design taking place. You want to read this series because you *know* all 10 books will be great, and so far, each is greater than the last."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I've decided that after reading the first two books in the Malazan series they are a lot like listening to the stories my 4 year old son tells me. The stories my son makes up are stream-of-consciousness and full of things that appear out of the blue but serve to keep the story going. Reading Erikson has been similar - the author has a great deal of creativity going, but the writing seems somewhat stream-of-consciousness, and when the characters get in a bind, something comes in from out of the blue to keep the story moving along. It can be fun, but also very frustrating.To be fair, Deadhouse Gates is somewhat better written than the first book in the series and at least one of the storylines invokes only a couple of \\"out of the blue\\" events and is set up quite well. It even includes a character who questions what is going on, so that other characters can explain things to the reader - something that was sorely lacking in the first volume of the series. The other main storylines have more \\"divine intervention\\" from godlike/immortal beings; as with the first volume this tends to be a weak spot in Erikson's writing so these plotlines generally feel a little more like listening to a story a certain previously mentioned four-year old might make up.I want to like Erikson's work; the world and the sort of adventures are generally my cup of tea. And I did enjoy this book at a certain level - the one where I really suspended my disbelief, read the story very much in the moment and tried not worry about where things were going or why they were happening. But in the end I want something that is better planned and better explained; something with good contextual underpinnings and good character motivation. Taken as a whole, this book reveals too many inconsistencies and happy (or sometimes unhappy) coincidences to stand up to any in-depth analysis; as such I can't recommend it as more than a group of entertaining (if sometimes a bit gruesome and depressing) adventure stories.Will I continue in this series? I'm really not sure. Certainly I won't be rushing right out to get a copy of the next volume, I feel I have better options to spend my reading time on right now."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I really enjoyed Gardens of the Moon, and had high hopes for Deadhouse Gates. It started out well, very engaging. 1/3 of the way through it starts to bog down, then proceeds to the absurd. It seems around every corner, Erikson is trying to outdo his last description of grisly death. I started rolling my eyes at the predictable \\"how much more gruesome can I make the next scene\\" and also there's always some new terribly powerful entity to make mincemeat of the latest extremely powerful entity. To the point of absurdity, somewhat laughable.The interminable march of Coltaine's army, I ended up skimming over. Got through the book pretty quickly that way and felt less resentful of having my time wasted. The last straw for me was, one thousand of the cursed crucifixes??? At this point, I'm assuming the reader was supposed to be shocked and saddened, but I was just frustrated. It and other scenes were absurdly excessive."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I was quite eager to read this second book in Mr. Erikson's series after finishing the first a few weeks ago; unfortunately I have been underwhelmed, if not worse, by this sequel.Some moderate to minor spoilers follow.The story follows the exploits of Fiddler, Kalam, Apsalar(ex-Sorry) as well as 2 new sets of characters, Felisin & friends, Icarium & Mappo, and Duiker and friends. The first half of the novel moved quickly, but into page 500 and beyond, it just seemed as if the author had too many things which had to be slowly moved forward to get any plot momentum going. I found myself starting another book, and looking at what else I had on deck to read. While the overall plot does move forward, I do think pacing needs some help in this matter.I will start the third book at some point, and presumably pacing will pick up, but hopefully Mr. Erikson will avoid this pitfall further into this series. At one point late in the book when a certain character was in a situation with no escape, I began guessing which other plot device would be introduced or used to facilitate said escape. Something is wrong in a book when you start thinking like that.On the positive side, this is a fascinating constructed world, with depth of history which shows in how his places and cities are described. I reserve final comment on the series until I see how future books are mapped out plot-wise."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"Similar to the first book in that I found this book readable,compelling/exciting in parts,imaginative,so well done thus far Mr Erikson.Now I have finished the book I look back and see it was also hard work; disjointed,comparatively joyless,characters too numerous(not to mention shortlived) to gain much depth.I sometimes felt during the course of the book that the author was trying too hard to make it convoluted and asking too much of me to keep track of all the characters.I kept beginning a chapter or paragraph and thinking \\"Duicker?...hmm Duicker,I remember that name\\" and I'd try to remember his past and character for the two or three pages untill it was some other characters turn to test my memory(which,normally,aint bad).To conclude-neither myself nor Erikson were up to what was required but both of us had enough to make the effort JUST worthwhile.Good luck."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"\\"Deadhouse Gates\\" is a complex fantasy tale interweaving the plots of multiple characters. Part of what makes it such a fascinating read is these characters have very different agendas. In this way, the reader is able to understand major plot developments from various perspectives.Such a mode of storytelling may not be for everyone but it is executed well. Steven Erikson's writing is generally quite precise and easy to follow -- it has to be in order for him to carry off such a sprawling narrative.Finally, I'll say that I was often surprised, sometimes even shocked, at how the plot developed. I enjoyed this as Erikson kept me on my toes in a way that few authors can."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"\\"Deadhouse Gates\\" continues \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" saga immediately after \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" with a darker story with scenes and insinuations not appropriate for young readers. However superb battles compliment the fine tale introducing numerous characters and exploring new locations while keeping Crokus and company as an integral part of the plot. The author appears to capture the internal and external struggles of a forced march by a tough foreign commander to save Malazan refugees.Felisin, Ganoes Paran's youngest sister, justifies the brutal treatment by her desire for vengeance and ultimately her destiny. Mappo and Icarium, a Trell and a memory challenged half-Jaghut, are an interesting duo wandering the land seeking to unlock Icarium's past. Yet excommunicated priest Heboric Light Touch and the assassin Kalam develop into the most fascinating characters.Many characters have unusually high skills, whether combat or magical, which unbalances the series. I find myself frustrated by unnecessary implied remarks or half-said comments but enjoyed the novel nonetheless.A better comprehensive appendix would have been useful addressing racial characteristics, relating magical powers, and describing creatures along with catch phrases and terms.I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"This book is definitely better than Gardens of the Moon. Let me establish that up front. Unlike Gardens, where I was struggling through the first 200 pages before finally putting the book away, Deadhouse actually was very enjoyable to read for the first 250 pages. The prologue, in particular, is memorable and well-done.And that's where the problems began. It's not that Erikson can't write strong, in-depth characters. Felisin was arguably well-written in this book, although the same can't be said for most of the other characters. Nor is the plot entirely uninteresting, although it is nothing new, to be frank.It's more that it feels like Erikson is burying you under a mix of details and plot elements, to the point where the quality characters get swamped and start losing development, and the poorly developed characters just become awful to read. The characters run into one \\"warren this\\" or \\"god that\\" every two seconds, along with all kinds of Ancient Mysteries, to the point where you are wondering, \\"What's the point?\\" You just never get a good framework for all these details, like you do in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, for example.Other than that, my only complaint is that parts of the books felt anachronistic for the technology and society described. This and the above did very little to draw me into the Malazan world."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"It was a bit of a surprise to me, coming into Gardens of the Moon, to find a series that is as simultaneously thrilling, interesting, and deep as George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Ever since picking up that particular series, I have been unable to find a series to fill in the long time in between each new addition, and other fantasy often fell full upon it's face and proved to be uninteresting.Luckily, a friend recommended Gardens of the Moon, and with some trepidation, I launched myself in. It wasn't long until I devoured that particular volume and immediately found myself back at the bookstore for a second helping.The result was Deadhouse Gates, a tale as equally ambitious and brutal as the very best of the genre. In this volume, Erikson takes a short break away from Genabackis, where fell deeds and ancient evils are rising once more, to another continent entirely, and we follow several different groups of people on their journeys. From slave girls and ex-priests to fearless, nearly unbeatable warlords, Erikson weaves these journeys in and out with customary brilliance and force.The story of Coltaine, in particular, captivated me nearly every single page. The depiction of a ragtag army on the run against impossible odds was shown with a maturity and an incredibly visceral style that had drooling for it's ferocity. So too, the story of Mappo the Trell warrior and his long-time Jaghut friend Icarium struck an emotional cord that few other authors could even approach.For all that, the book does have its faults. This might have been a more personal choice, but I felt the story of Felisin, in particular, came up short. I had no love for the character, and I nearly stopped reading every time I came upon one of her chapters. The only thing that kept me reading was looking for more of Duikers chapters. Still, the ending of that particular tale is also satisfying, and well worth the read.A few other things fell short, such as the character of Crokus; such a strong and well-defined character in Gardens of the Moon is relegated to a non-entity in this particular book, and a complaint that I had about Gardens of the Moon that I feel the need to drag on to Deadhouse Gates as well - Erikson never once gives a full description of ANY of his other non-human races. Sure, we know that a Jaghut has tusks and dark skin, and a Tiste Andii has the ability to change their eye-color, but beyond that we know very little, and at some points it's very frustrating.Aside from those few complaints, Deadhouse Gates is a wonder of a book, and well worth picking up. 4/5"},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I started reading this series from the beginning and am totally hooked. Stevens skills are those of a storyteller rather than an author of literature, and although the prose can be a little odd at times, the pacing is just fantastic. It is easy to lose oneself in these novels, which conjure up a detailed and internally coherent universe, of immense complexity.This is adult storytelling, complete with sex and violence, so is not a read for the squeamish or under-age.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Deadhouse Gates","review":"I gave up 100 pages into Gardens of the Moon, so can't say how good this one is.

Virtually all of his catalog is present and some which have never been published before. Well worth having both as a collectible and for its content."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Elton John Collection Boxed Set","review":"The publisher Hal Leonard calls this the \\"Deluxe Collector's Edition\\" and that's exactly what it is: It's very pretty, great-looking gift, looks great on the shelf. But the first hint that this might not be as ultimate as you'd like comes the moment you open it: it doesn't stay open nearly as well as you'd hope.This collection's best feature is that there are more songs here than you will find anywhere else at the price. There are over 100-songs here, including rarities you won't find printed in other books. Still, it's something of a quantity-over-quality approach: \\"Someone Saved my Life Tonight\\", \\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\\", and \\"Sacrifice\\" aren't in the right key. But if you want \\"Skyline Pigeon,\\" you'll only find it here.It's also important to note that These Are Not Transcriptions. Meaning that this is not what Elton John plays exactly (for that, look to the Elton John Keyboard Book). The melody-line is built-in to the right-hand, and it's somebody else's interpretation. This is terrific for folks who don't sing, don't want to sing, but still want to hear the melody. This is irritating for folks who want to sing along with the music without the melody echoed in the piano.It is what it is. Decent interpretations, incredible selection, at the expense of something more detailed and accurate, for 3x the price of other books.

He doesn't give in to the temptation to be totally flippant, as he sometimes does in his later novels; out of the three published in the U.S., I think this is definitely the best. You still might want to look into importing some of his other books (he's really quite prolific)."},{"Title":"Flying Dutch","review":"Jan Vanderdecker is the Flying Dutchman. He has been alivesince 1553. He is not real happy about it. His crew isnot real happy either (one of them keeps trying to killhimself by jumping out of the crows nest ten or 15 times/day).The problem with living so long is that you leave a papertrail. Enter Jane Doland, CPA, who makes her living followingpaper trails. She has discovered that someone still has an openaccount in a bank her CPA firm audits. What follows isthe funniest book I have read in years. The reason everyone infinancial community should be frightened of the Flying Dutchmanis silly. The reason the crew of the Verdomde can only visit landonce every seven years is absurd. The possibility that themembers of the crew could live over 400 years and still beidiots is somewhat disturbing. Humor is rare in the fantasygenre.There were more laughs/pagethan I have seen any any humor book I have read."},{"Title":"Flying Dutch","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD. Not major ones, but some plot points will be revealed that you might not want to know now. Be Advised.I really give this book 3 and a half stars. I liked it, but not as much as I had hoped.To be sure, this retelling of The Flying Dutchman legend has its moments. I highlighted a number of passages that made me laugh out loud.but the book took too many words to get to the point, and all of them weren't that interesting or necessary.It may speak more to my haphazard reading style lately than to anything else, but I found some of the characters to be confusing. Not the situations the characters were in, but more of a \\"now....who is that, again?\\" About halfway into the book, two new characters showed up without any real introduction. After that rude interruption, one of them stays there and develops a story line. It's not a great storyline. Then the rude guy keeps dragging in more people! (I admit, it's hilarious that the guy is being held at gunpoint by his own boss, because he's never seen the man and doesn't know his name. This was not a funny enough moment to justify either of them showing up in the book.)Less than halfway into the book, a character who's been introduced in the first chapter gets a fascinating assignment, then completely disappears. We never see or hear from him again. I think his story would have been more interesting (in an accounting kind of way) than the guy who just showed up at a regatta in the middle. There could have been more conflict with the original people in the story, is the point I'm trying to convey. I didn't have much sympathy at all for the David character. But maybe I'm wrong, and David shows up in other books. I hope he does, in fact, otherwise he's just a random stranger who showed up here.But, I liked Julius Van Der Decker, and the cat, and the insane crew of the Verdomde. I loved Jane, and completely sympathized with her. I even like Montalban. I thought his accidental inventions in trying to solve his own issue should have gotten a LOT more stage time.Overall, not a bad read for a rainy January. At least this one will make you laugh."},{"Title":"Flying Dutch","review":"\\"Flying Dutch\\" is the first of Tom Holt's books that I've read. I'm pretty impressed. His writing is very much in the style of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman (clever dialog and storylines that nicely interconnect). Most of the book exudes the care Holt took to mesh everything together. Unfortunately, the last quarter of the book feels a bit rushed: people don't stay in character, a main storyline and character appear without earlier preparation, and a sort of \\"then a miracle occurs\\" tie-up. But, the book is written well enough that this \\"lesser writing\\" is still acceptable and the book as a whole is clever, interesting, and fun to read. So, overall, I recommend it and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Flying Dutch","review":"Holt's books are generally a fun read, and this one for my money is the best of the bunch. The cover tells it all, so I won't go into the details. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"Flying Dutch","review":"It's Tom Holt at the top of his form: funny, literate, and equally at home in any of five or six recent centuries. That's a good thing, since that's what it takes to trace Cornelius Vandervecker from the fifteen-hundreds on, sailing forever across the loneliest wastes of the seven seas. Yes, Cornelius is the Flying Dutchman. No, he's no myth. And no, he's not exactly cursed - well, not as such. It's more of a blessing, really, if you allow blessings of the mixed sort.There was an incident involving an alchemist, a hasty retreat from a suddenly-unfriendly shore, and an untested elixir of eternal life. And alcohol, lots of alochol. (Well, everything around Vandervecker seems to involve alcohol.) That elixir just happened to work, but has a teeny little side effect - a personal pong that would knock a buzzard off a dungwagon. On the whole, it's a good idea to put a few thousand miles between the crew and anyone with a normal sense of smell. There's that alchemist, though, who's still trying to fix that little problem. There's also Danny Bennett, an enthusiastic journalist with a nose for news, and whatever else it is that surrounds the Flying Dutchman. And there's also this little matter of Vandervecker's long-term investments - I mean, very long term.Flying Dutch is a good bit of amusement, filled with characters from the nearly inert to the flamboyant, from the witless crew to the scheming Montalban. The story keeps its pace right to the end. If you've never read Holt before, this is a great place to start. If you're tired of waiting for Pratchett's next, it's a great place to stop. If you've read Holt before, it's a great way to carry on. Go ahead, be part of the goings-on, they're huge fun.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"PC MagazinePrinting Great Digital Photos","review":"This clear and concise guide is a great resource for beginners and serious amateurs. Well-organized and well written, it covers all aspects of digital photo printing, from selecting equipment, supplies, and software to preserving and presenting photos. Windows and Macintosh users alike will find good information. Rather than focusing upon a single photo-editing program, the author gives general photo editing advice, with examples from a variety of software packages. Confusing issues like camera resolution versus screen resolution versus printer resolution are explained clearly. One shortcoming is that the explanations of how to set levels and apply sharpening to images are too brief and simplified. There are also a few too many illustrations showing equipment and supplies.

And what a voice it is! Memory of Hands is a collection of short stories but all interrelated and written in such poetic and lyrical language that it reads more like a poetic stream of consciousness (for those of us who have experienced everything she writes of) rather than a collection of short stories. This is a fabulous book for those who are muslim american seeking awknowledgement of their own personal experiences and a great read for non-muslims who want to understand the burdens of bicultualism that many muslim americans must deal with."},{"Title":"The Memory of Hands","review":"The Memory of Hands is a collection of 10 short stories, plus a prologue and epilogue. The common themes across the collection center on the struggle of second generation Muslims of Indian background in America to adjust to a radically different cultural milieu than that in which their parents were raised, to make that adjustment in the face of parental, familial, and Indian cultural expectations, and to develop and establish their own identities as Muslim Americans. While the book focuses exclusively on Muslims of Indian background, the major psychological issues highlighted in these short stories are challenges to personal and cultural identity that must be confronted and resolved by all immigrant Muslims living in America.How does one develop and affirm one's religious identity as a Muslim and one's cultural/national identity as an American without compromising either one? How does one develop one's American identity while sometimes being seen as different or foreign by one's American peers, while being \\"guided\\" by parental and familial pressures to remain an Indian, and while being asked to sacrifice personal freedom and goals on the altar of Indian definitions of marital, vocational, and professional success?In addressing the above issues with rare sensitivity and insight, Reshma Baig has done a masterful job in allowing the reader to peer inside the very soul of her characters. As an example, consider the case presented in chapters three and four of a young girl who was born in India who develops what appears to be a variety of stress-related psychosomatic complaints as she struggles to adjust to life in a first grade classroom in a large New York City school. Cheer for the young woman of Indian background who defies the matrimonial expectations of her parents to find a physician of Indian or Pakistani background to be her husband; instead she meets her lifelong companion in a sensitive and creative teacher who is an American convert to Islam (chapter six). Admire the young woman who knows enough about her faith of Islam to refuse to follow blindly the teachings of one of the charismatic \\"sheikhs\\" that attempt to set themselves up as a third foundational element of Islam, alongside the Qur'an and the actual teachings of Prophet Muhammad (chapter seven). Pray for the young man to find and free himself before he commits himself to a path of slavery to a medical profession that he does not really want, merely in order to meet parental expectations (chapter eight). Cringe in gut-wrenching agony at the birth and infanticide of a baby girl in a sleazy motel; a newborn life destroyed in order to maintain the career paths and recreational dreams of her single parents (chapter nine).These are powerful stories that are beautifully written by a true wordsmith. The stories grab the reader by the heart and then compel the reader to race breathlessly from page to page, pausing only occasionally to stop and admire a phrase or a sentence of pure linguistic triumph. The book is nothing short of being a masterpiece of fiction, one that is heavily grounded in the realities of life for immigrant Muslims of Indian background who are struggling to find their place in American society."},{"Title":"The Memory of Hands","review":"Fabulous collection of short stories centering on the lives of Muslims in urban America.

Got a little tangled up at the end with situations I felt didn't really advance the plot. Sex scenes were HOT but not vulgar. Written in great detail and great taste."},{"Title":"The Turquoise","review":"I first read The Turquoise several years ago, and just read it again. Luckily I didn't remember much about it from the first time around (except the vague notion that it was a really good story), so I was able to enjoy it anew.The story traces the life of Santa Fe Cameron Dillon Tower and, unlike many of Anya Seton's works, none of the main characters were actual people --except perhaps, as she explains in her forward, Santa Fe herself. The story is wonderfully crafted, full, rich with detail, and showcases Seton's wonderful imagination and ability to build an entire life story around a little scrap of legend she once heard. The first part of the book is beautiful, as Seton paints such a vivid picture of the old city of Santa Fe and the western trails during the mid-19th century. Her writing is nearly flawless; there were many times when I stopped and re-read a passage slowly in order to capture each word and savor Seton's talent for painting a full picture with so few brushstrokes.If you like lighthearted stories or those with happy endings, then you probably won't like this book. Again and again the reader watches Fey make bad, even devastating, choices, overriding the advise of those who love her and even her own sharp conscience. Although in the end she does eventually face the truth and find redemption, even then it is less than a full healing. She -- and the reader -- fully understands what her life COULD have been, but she bravely shuts the door on that opportunity forever, and does all she can to make amends to those she has damaged, living out the rest of her life with the consequences of her selfish and short-sighted choices.The only flaw I could find in the book were some aspects of Simeon Tower's personality and behavior. I found it hard to believe that Fey could have won him over so easily. And I found it even harder to believe that such a man, even one as troubled and insecure as Simeon obviously was, would so blatantly and plainly - almost like a child -- express his desire to become part of the \\"in-crowd\\". However, I don't feel that this took away from the overall story, and so I am still giving the book a \\"5\\".If you like bittersweet stories that are full and well-written but that don't always end with people living happily ever after, then you will love this book. It is too bad that it has been largely overlooked in the shadow of Green Darkness and Katherine."},{"Title":"The Turquoise","review":"Not sure why my old review didn't carry over to this new edition, I'm sure it will as soon as I repost.This is the story of Santa Fe (Fey) Cameron, named after the town she was born in, Santa Fe New Mexico. Her high born spanish mother died in childbirth, and her father (the disinherited younger son of a highland laird) died when she was a young girl, leaving her to be raised by a lower class mexican family. When Fey turns 17 she meets Terry Dillon, a handsome, charming but ever so unscrupulous medicine man who is headed back east to make his fortune in New York after having run afoul of something in San Francisco. At this same time, a distant cousin of Fey's travels to Santa Fe in search of her on behalf of her grandfather, who is now sorry for the estrangement between himself and his (now dead) son, and wants them brought home to Scotland. Ewen just misses Fey, and his trail turns cold.Once they reach New York, Terry leaves a pregnant Fey to her own resources as he leaves for brighter pastures. Fey takes work where she can, and sets her sights on the very wealthy and powerful Simeon Tower. Fey's cousin Ewen just misses her once again prior to her marriage to Simeon. The story slows down a bit after this point, as the author describes the opulent lifestyles of the very rich in 1870's New York as Simeon and Fey try to crack the upper circle of New York society.The story picks up again as a surprise return from the past threatens Fey and Simeon, and Fey finally comes to realize that she has only herself to blame for the choices she made in life and that she is not a victim of circumstance, and that she will have to atone for those bad choices.All in all a pleasant read, but certainly not up to the high standards Seton set with Katherine, Devil Water and the Winthrop Woman. I enjoyed the first part of the book the most, the author did a lovely job of describing old Santa Fe and New Mexico, along with the trip east on the Santa Fe Trail. Recommended for die-hard Seton fans (and I am one). 3.5/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Turquoise","review":"Born of Scots/Spanish parents in 1850s New Mexico and orphaned at a n early age, Fey is raised by poor neighbors. At 17, she hitches a ride out of town with Terry Dillon, a \\"special-elixir\\"-selling quack. While traveling the Santa Fe Trail, they marry and eventually arrive in Kansas with enough money for train fares to New York City. Predictably, Terry abandons Fey within days, just before Fey realizes she is pregnant. Alone, pregnant and without a source of income in the 19th-century metropolis, Fey must make some important decisions quickly.I consider Seton to be one of my favorite authors, but I didn't care much for this book. Seton's prose is as usual superb, but there is something lacking in the appeal of the story itself. Fey's financial aspirations didn't ring true to me. I didn't understand why she wanted money so badly, and then why she didn't seem to care much about it when she did have it. This aspect of her personality felt like merely a plot device.I recommend nearly all of Seton's other works, especially 'Katherine.'"},{"Title":"The Turquoise","review":"Not as riviting as other Seton novels I've read, but still worth reading.

Because y'all, this book was magnificent.It was published first in 1946, and the copy I got from the library was bound in one of those old style books - unassuming, no pictures, gold lettering on top of an orange cover. I looked at that book and thought.. what was I thinking? And then I started to read... and I read more and more and next thing I know I'm waking up at 6am so I can pick up where I left off.This is an epic story. Santa Fe Cameron was born to a dying mother, and her father dies when she reaches the mere age of 7. She is taken in and raised by a local family - but is always considered to be different, due to the Scottish features of pale skin and gray eyes. Early in the story, she is told she will have to make one of two choices, and ... you, the reader, can decide if she made the right choice.Santa Fe's trip through this story is a rough one. It's filled with love and heartbreak, gain and loss, and some of the most intelligent, strong, female characters I've ever read in a book of this age. I adored this story, and like I said earlier, I am so glad I put it on my list. This one is highly, highly recommended by me - and I cannot wait to get to the other Seton book I have here sitting on my desk."},{"Title":"The Turquoise","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Has really helped me in my walk in the Lord.Since having read this book I have been able to stand on God's promises with a better understanding and footing.

My prayers are miraculously answered now that I have learned to pray and walk in true faith that is taught in this book.I thank the Lord that he is the same yesterday, today and always. That he didn't fall off his throne after the first century. And that he hears the prayers of the righteous, and still heals the sick.With all the false teaching that is out there in the present age this book is sorely needed. There are the hyper faith people who treat God as if he is a puppet on a string to answer all of our prayers whether they are in the will of God or not. There are the prosperity teachers teaching that you should be blessed in the flesh or you are low in faith or lacking with God. None of them have ever read the second half of Hebrews 11. And finally there are the dispensationalists who have taken all the power and authority out of the gospel. Because of their lack of belief in the scriptures and wanting to justify themselves before God and men they say that certain scriptures no longer apply.It can be very confusing to a young or even an older believer.

Written more like an historical account than a docu-drama, this book is a seamless narrative spun from the individual accounts and recollections of the survivors themselves. It was evidently not written to be a tear-jerker, though I found myself moved throughout by the unembellished story. And just as compelling as the heart-rending tales of those Schindler helped is the tale of Schindler himself. I still don't know what moved him to do what he did, but it is clear that near the end he felt he was fighting as much for his own survival as for that of those he sheltered. He developed a sense of true solidarity with the Jews.I read started the book before seeing the movie, then picked it up again and finished it a year later. In terms of style, the interpretations are like night and day. For those who have seen neither, I recommend the book first."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List is the story of Oskar Schindler, a German business man that saved the lives of \\"his\\" Jews (those that worked in his factory) during World War II. The book is, in large part, nonfiction: some dialogue comes from the author's brain, but the events and characters are generally based in well-researched fact. As a result, the text is informative but lacks emotion, gets bogged down in numbers and reports but still managing to introduce and discuss one small aspect of the war: a man who saved lives. To be honest, I only appreciated the book for its historical and educational value. As a novel, it's lacking in humanity and overfilled with detail. It didn't live up to my expectations.I read this book to gain a better understanding rather than to be absorbed by the reading, and in terms of information and learning more about the Holocaust, I'm mildly satisfied by the text. It is very well researched and doesn't stray far from fact even when telling a story, and so the data is there. To that extent, it's an interesting, informative read, especially because it presents a smaller side of a large story by concentrating on a man that saved lives rather than a man who ended them or the people that died.What the book lacks, however, is storytelling, and where the narrative fails the contents becomes much less interesting and much harder to absorb. Keneally becomes obsessed with his research, quoting numbers, dates, and full names as often as possible in order to base the story in fact. No doubt he is trying to maintain fidelity to the events and to Schindler himself; the result, however, betrays him. The book reads like a somewhat creative textbook and the facts have the same limited impact. Although the text claims to do otherwise, the focus on numbers and data detracts from the human element. The reader can't connect and so loses interest. As it is a novel, the book is disappointing, and because the novel fails the facts lose their impact.I don't mean to say that the text is without merit. The research is there and the story is interesting and, needless to say, admirable. However, I expected a lot more, and was disappointed by my lack of emotional attachment to any part--plot, characters, ending. My holding back some of the data while still keeping to the truth, Keneally could have written a much more emotional, and therefore more effective, text."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"So, you want to know about Schindlers list. If you have alot of time on your hands, then I would choose this book. This work, for some people may be hard to follow, or to understand because it has many strange and unfamiliar names of people and places. If you have seen the movie, do not try to think of it too much as you read because it is like most books that have been made into movies, very different. this is a very good story, and teaches you how cruel man can really be."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Not as poignant as Night or as eloquantly descriptive as Approaches to Auschwitz, Schindlers List is as the back cover suggests- a book written for development into a movie. It was interesting to see where Speilberg took liberty. The author himself cautions that certain elements of the book were fictionalized, however this does not detract from the absolute horror the reader is put into. This is perhaps a decent introduction into Holocaust literature, but is by no means conclusive, comprehensive, or in the same league as Weisel or Rubenstein's work."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"I must say, the beginning of the book was extremely boring, in the sense that it felt dragged on. The book gets interesting towards the middle, however, if you plan on reading this to smaller children, think again because this book will be hard for them to follow along, considering they would have to remember all these German names, ranks, places, etc. The story is extremely sad and tells the story of the holocaust well."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's list was really interesting- i'm still deciding on whether i like it or not. for me, there are two main things that make a good story:1)GOOD PLOTSchindler's list definitely had a good plot. it was historical fiction, almost even non-fiction, and it was therefore based on true events. i've read tons of historical novels that just aren't that interesting- you have to stick to what actually happened in real history; they don't have that advantage that fantasy has where you can just make it up. but schindler's list wasn't one of those books. any holocaust book, we know, already has a good plot. the events that happened in the book are horrifying, as one can expect, but there is also hope- it'sone of those 'finding light in the darkness' kind of books that doesn't leave you depressed. so, i think Schindler's list definitely had the plot.2)WELL WRITTENthis is where the story let me down a little- yes, it is a classic, but many of the details were just too irrelevant. the middle part of the book was definitely the most well-written, and it described the suffering and pain of the Jew, Poles and gypsies in vivid, necessary detail. However, the beginning of the book was quite slow. i was disappointed when the first 100 pages couldn't be summed up in five pages. too much description went into the business and financial aspect of the story. Keneally also used a great number of German terms, which, only explained once, got confusing and frustrating throughout the course of the book.all that aside, i'm still deciding- i personally don't think that enough of the book was written around the main subject- the holocaust. i liked how the author sometimes changed the perspectives and points of view so that the reader could see what the other characters were experiencing.the book is a classic, which i haven't read much of, and i know my opinion differs from many other's, but that's what i think. all in all, the novel was extremely powerful in conveying the message to the reader: 'HE WHO SAVES ONE LIFE SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE\\", and the plot itself was very powerful, but the book just lost me often. great plot, pretty good writing.also as the reader you would need at least a general understanding of holocaust/WWII terms-the book can otherwise get pretty confusing. i recommend this to fans of The Book Thief, or Schindler's List (the movie). i know the book wouldn't appeal to everyone, but you should still give it a try, just be patient. :)"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"I saw the movie when it came out and just recently read the book. This makes it strange because I clearly pictured Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes in my mind's eye as I read.This is an absolutely amazing story that details both the lack of humanity of some people and the humanity of others. The power of this story is undeniable.Schindler was a bit of a scoundrel and definite ladies' man but was also a great salesman and networker. He was such an unusual source of tremendous good and his character is baffling. On the other hand, as I read, I stopped questioning why he was taking such risks to save the Jewish people from his factory and was just thankful that he was doing so. In the end, he wasn't a saint but simply a good person who chose to be honorable at great personal risk.This is a story of how some people act reprehensibly to save themselves but offers hope for us all that some people simply wouldn't be part of the evil.I found the movie to be a very true depiction of the book and both are very good.Ultimately, Keneally had a difficult task. He had an amazing true story to tell and it was advisable not to corrupt the basic plot.In the end, he simply told the story. I don't think the writing was particularly good nor bad.The star is the true story and I'm glad Keneally let it be told."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindlers list was a very enthralling read that came across as heavy duty the first time i read it and the second time i had a clear perspective as to what was actually going on.

This book helps to chop that image a little more down to size: it portrays Oskar as rather hedonistic, unfaithful to his wife(one girlfriend, an affair with his secretary, the list goes on...). But, being disturbed by his regime's ways, he actually decided to do something about it, namely, set up a haven for Jews, under the disguise of an armaments factory. And it just so happened that he was really rich, so he could pay off all the necessary bribes, and had a lot of connections, or he would have landed in a prison or concentration camp himself long ago. It tells his story from a much more human perspective.Schindler's List also attempts to delve into the psyches of various people in various positions, from the noble people who sacrificed themselves to the civilians who mocked and hated the Jews. It also zeroes in on specific incidents that are not so important in the big scheme of things, but are crucial in the life of an individual.Schindler's list also does a good job of exploring the face of evil, and how \\"All that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing\\"---Edmund Burke"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. In the beginning of story it was really uneventful, but near the end it got really interesting. I especially like it when Oskar Schindler goes to jail and meets the army man in there for going awol. The best parts of the story are at the end like when Oskar's heart kept going out of pure stubbornness. I recommend that you read this great book and if you don't read it you will be missing out on a great book to read."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindlers List is a true story of a heroic man who used his fortune to build a camp to pretect Jews fromt he Nazis during WW2.

However, between the German words that I can't understand and the sentences that run on and on, I personally found this a difficult book to get through."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"There are a lot of reasons why I loved Schindler's List. I mainly liked it because it was written so well. It took a few pages before I got into it, but after that it was hard to put down. Some parts were a little bit hard to understand. That was mostly because of all the German words and names. They were easy to skip over and didn't take away from the book at all. Thomas Keneally did an excellent job researching the book. I liked the fact that there was so much detail. It made you feel like you really were there. I also liked that there were so many different characters. Sometimes you would meet a character in one chapter for only a few paragraphs, then you wouldn't find out what happened to them until way later in the book. Even though that made it hard to keep all the characters straight, I still liked it because it keep the book from getting boring. You were always wondering what was going to happen to somebody or if someone would get out of jail or be killed. The reason that this was such a good holocaust book is that it shows the war from so many different views, and how for two opposite people the war could mean two compleatly different things. This is a very good book that has action, mystery ,and drama all in one. I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Spielberg's film is superior to Keneally's book. Keneally is a good writer, but his dustjacket photo sporting a great big grin and a cowboy hat seems a less-than-ideal choice given the subject matter of this book. You learn several things about Oskar Schindler in Keneally's book that help you appreciate the Spielberg film:1. Schindler was a successful race care driver as a young man with immense personal magnetism.2. Schindler was a member of Admiral Canaris' Abwehr, the German Secret Service, the Nazi counterpart of the CIA. So Schindler's \\"powerful friends\\" weren't just shmoozed SS officers; they were members of an extremely powerful wing of the German intelligence establishment. Unlike the thugs of the Gestapo and the atheistic racists of the SS, the Abwehr was typically composed of level-headed, well educated, well connected gentlemen. And the Abwehr was no friend of either the Gestapo or the SS. (And of course the shmoozed SS officers that were Schindler's friends looked out for him, also.) So Schindler's protection was doubly redundant. And of course there was his personal friend General Schindler - no relative - but no doubt a help if need arose, and a wonderful namedropping opportunity.3. Schindler decided early on in the war (contrary to the film's dramatic premise) to help his Jewish workers, taking trips secretly to Hungary and Turkey to alert foreign powers of the Nazi agenda, which he witnessed first-hand.4. Schindler was arrested by the Gestapo three times, and each time it was more and more of a closer call. The film shows the second arrest, but Keneally maintains the incarcerated soldier sharing Schindler's cell was an SS man; in the film he wears an Army (Wehrmacht) uniform. And the off-color joke was real, as was the little girl in the red jacket.5. Schindler lived in South America after the war, eventually abandoning his wife there. (The Spielberg film concludes stating Schindler \\"failed\\" at his marriage. Abandonment would certainly qualify.) He spent the rest of his life living off the charity of the former Schindler Jews who took great pains to care for him.6. Schindler suffered intense ostracism in Germany after the war once his heroism on behalf of the Jews became known, but eventually he was recognized as a hero and received several civil commendations. And just as Spielberg relates, Schindler always was haunted by the horrible feeling that he \\"could have done more\\".While the movie is superior, the story goes that if it were not for Keneally's book, the Spielberg movie would never have been made. It was Keneally who happened to run into a former Schindler Jew (in, of all places, Hollywood), learned the story, and had the verve and talent to put that story to book.Informative, well-written book."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"After seeing the film of SCHINDLER'S LIST, I had the feeling that it covered so much, included and recreated so much that it wasn't necessary to read the book.Last month, I visited Jerusalem and toured the Holocaust Museum (a profoundly disturbing experience I would recommend to everyone). I also found Oskar Schindler's grave just outside the Old City walls and saw the small stones atop the gravemarker. (There's a sidewalk next to it now where the survivors filed past in the grass at the end of the film).Now I wanted to read the book and I realized how wrong I'd been to ignore it. I finished it last night and can tell everyone: there is so much more to the story!You will be even more blown away by Herr Direktor's wily recklessness in saving his Jews. As played in the film, Schindler makes the gradual realization of the horrors around him, breaking down at the end when the scale of the inferno hits him. In the book, Schindler knows what's happening to the Jews and he despises the SS Officers from the very beginning. Schindler constantly questions his workers about everything going on. He knew. And he did everything he could to save as many as he could from the very start of the madness.Actually, SCHINDLER'S LIST should've been a mini-series like BAND OF BROTHERS. There was certainly enough material and you'll find that material in the book. As written, it's also very easy to see in visual terms.Definitely read this. Like the film, I was brought to tears in the final chapters. An astonishing true story."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Thomas Keneally's account of the life of Oscar Schindler is an outstanding book and probably one of the best Booker winners. In many ways, it is better than the movie. I read the book after seeing the movie and was more impressed by the book as it covers the life of the person better. Most people do not understand how the book traverses the life of the person right from childhood to old age and shows his gradual change. While the movie largely covers the brutality, the book does a superb job of both the brutality and the person. The lives of some of the people were covered in greater detail and stylistically, this book was superb in its flow and account of the history of the Sudeten Germans and the gradual changes that affected all the people around them. Most importantly, Oscar Schindler is treated in great detail, including his relationship with his mother and father, which is interesting as one sees that a lot of him comes from his father. He never had any racism, he was petty, unscrupulous and unfaithful to his wife. However, he was disgusted by the brutality of the local SS and tried to avoid them. His last days are also dealt with very well and is very sad as he was not treated well in Germany after the war (he was called a \\"Jew kisser\\") but was treated benevolently in Israel. It is interesting to note that people like Amon Goeth tried to get some of the Jews to give testimony that he was kind to them. The author has written many wonderful novels before this such as \\"Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith\\" and \\"Gossip from the Forest\\" . However, this book was a masterpiece and his doom, as every book after this was compared to this and found to fall short. Well, that is really too bad and I personally am sorry for the author. The movie was good too, but this book was much better. It probably will not be liked outside the literary circles (most people do not read these days anyway), but it holds a special place among the books written in the past 30 years."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"One of my favorite books. Thomas Keneally writes about a good german who saves the most number of jews during the holocaust. Though the movie portraits only the good side of Schindler, the book gives a more clear picture of Schindler's character. The first chapter itself puts you right into the ww2 picture. From there, Keneally tries to portray the unspeakable horror done to Jews by the Nazis. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in knowing about what happened to jews during the ww2."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"\\"Schindler's List\\" written by Thomas Keneally is a great book that took place in the late 193s.

During what is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of human history, in a time where a person would sell off their own grandmother to the Gestapo, his selflessness enabled the lives of 1500 Jews to be saved, and indirectly, he saved many more lives - the children, grandchildren, and greatchildren of &quot;his&quot; Jews are alive today because their ancestors were fortunate enough to have their names on his list.You can't help but contrast him to the likes of Adolf Eichmann, who protested during his trial that he had no choice but to do what he did, he was a soldier who was &quot;only following orders.&quot; Schindler too, had a choice, and his choice and its consequences are lovingly chronicled in Kenneally's book.That he had the courage to make this choice is a point that should never be forgotten. And neither should Oskar Schindler."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"I had seen the movies many times before reading the book. It was great to read passages in the book that were also in the movie. I have deeper respect for both movie and book and also for Oscar Schindler himself.

A playboy who loved fine wines and foods, he was also a smooth-talking manipulator (and briber) of Nazi officials, as well as a clever entrepreneur, already on his way to stunning financial success by the early days of World War II. Nowhere in Schindler's background are there any hints that he would one day become the savior of eleven hundred Jewish men and women.While the excellent film of this novel concentrates on the dangers Schindler and \\"his Jews\\" faced daily throughout the war, Keneally, well known for his depictions of characters acting under stress, concentrates on the character of Oskar Schindler himself, beginning with his childhood and teen years. As he explores Schindler's transformation from war profiteer and \\"passive\\" Nazi to a man willing to use his fortune to ensure the salvation of his factory workers, Keneally reveals a man of enormous courage and derring-do, a man who thrives by living on the edge.Presenting episodes from the lives of some of the \\"Schindlerjuden,\\" Keneally highlights their humanity, creating moments of high drama. Characters such as Leopold Pfefferberg and factory manager Itzhak Stern move in and out of the narrative, illustrating graphically the extent to which their lives depend upon Oskar Schindler, while the constant intrusion of sadistic SS commandant Amon Goeth in Schindler's life shows the fragility of their security. Other stories, of people who just missed being saved by Schindler, highlight the arbitrariness of fate--chance--in their (and our) lives.Throughout the novel, Keneally stresses the importance of bearing witness and testifying to the atrocities. In one of the novel's most moving passages, Schindler and his lover ride horses to a ridge where they can view the expulsion of the Jews from the Krakow ghetto, watching, horrified, as old or crippled laggards are murdered in front of Jewish children. \\"They permitted witnesses because they believed the witnesses, all, would perish, too.\\" Later, Schindler works with a Zionist rescue organization, secretly going to Budapest to testify about the hidden death camps.Schindler's heroism, his goodness within a country committed to the extermination of other humans, his recognition that witnesses are essential, and his ability to use the system in order to hasten its end bring this story of one man's fight against the Holocaust to life. But it is Keneally's incorporation of Schindler's faults and excesses which gives texture and depth to this portrait and make Schindler a character with whom the reader can identify. Keneally's meticulous research and his portrait of Schindler after the war, beloved by Jews but at loose ends personally and professionally, make this novel an unforgettable study of character and time. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"I saw the movie ten years ago so I thought I knew what to expect from this novel.(By the way, this is a _fictionalized_ account of a story that is, for the most part, true, and is well-researched by the author)This novel is very well written, and full of themes that apply today as much as they did during the holocaust. The thing I like about this story is it forces the reader to examine what makes a man good vs. what makes a man evil. Schindler starts the novel as a brilliant but self-serving war profiteer, exploiting his jewish workers in some of the same ways as the Nazi Party starts out doing. However, Schindler sees a few things that start him on the course to becoming a modern-day saviour, the most impressive image being the brutal killing of a little jewish girl whose beautiful red dress he had admired from across the ghetto.The book is filled with shocking imagery such as this, which make it all the more moving, but not recommended for the faint-of-heart. There were many passages I read, after which I could feel my stomach turning.Oskar Schindler saw all this first-hand, and you feel as if you do as well when reading this book. Schindler risked his life throughout the entire war to save thousands of jews who were completely dependent on him. The whole time he was also competing with an SS Captain who probably killed, on any whim, ten Jews for every one life that Schindler saved.I would highly recommend this book, despite the fact that there are thousands of holocaust books on the market. This one transcends the setting."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This is Thomas Keneally at his best. The chance meeting with a Schindler Jew in a Los Angeles shop made a book, then a movie, then a global project to catalogue the stories of Holocaust survivors. It took Spielberg and Hollywood to bring the story to the screen but it was Keneally and his evocative text on the life of Oskar Schindler that bought the story to the world. His choice to use the texture of a novel works well. As the author said himself, this seemed the best way to handle a character with the ambiguity and magnitude of that celebrated Sudeten charmer.But a novelist's approach also makes it easier to convey meaning, to explore and probe every shadow, each emotion, any nuance. Keneally's gift is to do this well. The highlight of the book is his brilliant study of Oskar and Amon, good with bad, the German bon vivant versus the Dark Prince. Like two heads of the same coin, Keneally shows nobility and evil as uncomfortably close bedfellows. There go I but the grace of God...Keneally has a well-deserved reputation as one of Australia's greatest writers, but the forces this book has set in train, perhaps, have not been fully acknowledged. Fortunately, for a select group of southern Polish Jews in World War II, a saviour was in their midst. Fortunately, for those that followed, there was a writer who saved the saviour's story for us all."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"It appears as though everyone loves the book and therefore I may be writing an unpopular review. However, though I think it is a valuable use of your time to digest Keneally's effort, I was a little surprised at its style and content. Now, I don't normally read fiction, so I probably don't have an adequate basis for judging good fiction, but when I saw it was a novel I figured it would be a pretty easy read.I was surprised to find Keaneally's novel read a lot more like a biography--filled with facts, but not much of a plot. Most of the book is written in the narrative and there is very little dialogue. Though the facts are interesting and have valuable historical content, they do not read, at least for me, like a novel.Also, the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the book is laden with German terms and words, which are in themselves educational and undoubtfully helpful for anyone who wishes to deny their ethnocentricity. However, I found the terms to be obtrusive to the flow of my read and found myself straining a little as the book got underway.If you had the choice of reading the book or watching the movie, I would definitely recommend the book....the effort is worth your time. However, don't expect a light read. The book will flesh out the atrocity with greater detail and paint a picture of Schindler which is not quite matched by the movie. Hollywood seems to lack the objective approach. However, if you're not too interested in details, you don't mind a romanticized Schindler, and you have a hundred other books on your reading list, then see the movie and you'll probably still understand, at least in part, the essence of the Holocaust and the man with the list."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"&quot;Oskar had done nothing astounding before the war and been unexceptional since. He was fortunate, therefore, that in that short fierce era between 1939 and 1945 he had met people who summoned forth his deeper talents.&quot; -comment by Emilie Schindler to a German TV documentary crewThis, of course, is the essential mystery of Oskar Schindler. How was it that this charismatic but morally ambiguous man, a failure in every other endeavor he ever engaged in, was both willing and able to save over a thousand Jews from Nazi predation? And, if someone like him was willing and able, why were other, arguably &quot;better&quot;, Germans unwilling or unable to do the same?These are the questions that Thomas Keneally's raises, but, despite the use of fictional techniques to tell the story, Keneally does not seek to answer them. Instead, he lays out the facts of the story (in thrilling fashion) and leaves the reader to search for answers. The result is an immensely human and interesting portrait of an enigmatic hero--infinitely more interesting than the simplistic black and white ubermensch of Spielberg's vapid movie.Perhaps the greatest import of the book is that resistance was possible, even in Nazi Germany. In the face of this fact, those Germans who went along with the Nazis must be judged even more harshly. This book and Jonah Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners combine to make a powerful case for the view that the Final Solution was perpetrated by the German Nation as a whole and that most Germans were willing to see it happen. More than that, they raise the question of whether it is appropriate to consider the citizenry of totalitarian states to be merely innocent victims of the regimes, or whether we need to hold every citizen responsible for even the silent capitulation that enables a reign of terror to continue.I know that Spielberg has made a big deal out of making his movie available to schools and young people; it would be much better to give them copies of this book. That a man like Oskar Schindler necessarily seems so remarkable to us, should be troubling to every person of conscience. This book forces us to look within and ask ourselves whether we too would have done the right thing. The answer is not as starkly clear as Hollywood would have us think.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"[My last review was botched in transmission. Please forgive the resubmission.]The Holocaust is a difficult topic to deal with as subject matter for a work of art; its horrors have been explicitly brought to light countless times in several different formats and knowledge of these horrors has pervaded our society such that nearly everyone has been exposed to them in some way or another. In order to tell an effective story about the Holocaust, one must do more than shock the reader with the evils that took place in concentration camps or Jewish ghettos--this has been done once and for all by those who lived through it. In Schindler's List, Thomas Keneally goes beyond such shock value by telling of the profound goodness that emerged--from such unspeakable evil--in the character of prison camp Direktor Oskar Schindler and his Schindlerjuden.In his telling of the story, Keneally's sure-handed prose adds credibility and its occasional delve into the poetic adds great emotional weight. The effect of such a telling is that of a slow toxin that siezes the reader by the heart and squeezes to the point of anguish, leading to a novel that is both deeply moving and absolutely believable.As for the story itself, Keneally focuses mostly on the actions and ambitions of Schindler, leaving the horror stories recessed in the background, creeping around the edges. When such evils are brought to the forefront of the tale, they are potent and real, but somehow serve more as chiaroscuro to the divine goodness of Schindler's deeds. Thus it is that much more effective when Schindler spends every bit of his entire life's fortune to literally buy life for as many of the Jews as he possibly can. When all is said and done, Keneally has done no less than consecrate the sanctity of life by weighing its importance against that of essentially meaningless things such as money.Schindler's List, by telling the story of a good man living in such evil times, has become an important addition to Holocaust literature."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning, fictionalized biography of Oskar Schindler memorializes a member of the Nazi party who endangered his own life for four years, working privately to save Jews from the death camps.

Even the girl in the red dress (which I was sure was a cheesy embellishment) really existed: her name was Genia and \\"in red cap, red coat, small red boots,\\" she was the last of a column of evacuees who witnessed the cold-blooded execution of a family found hiding in the ghetto. Seeing Genia see the execution convinced Oskar Schindler the horror of what was happening: \\"They permitted witnesses, such witnesses as the red toddler, because they believed the witnesses all would perish too.\\"Although this is a \\"novel,\\" Keneally in the introduction is careful to stress he attempted \\"to avoid all fiction\\" while distinguishing between the facts and the myth of Oskar Schindler himself. That is, he uses the novelist's craft to re-create dialogue and reconstruct incidents to fashion a narrative that tries to explain why a seemingly amoral industrialist would go to such lengths--to risk his own life and to undergo (on three occasions) imprisonment by the SS--in order to save a community with whom he had the most tenuous connection. For this \\"novel,\\" the author interviewed dozens of survivors and his book tries to sift and reconcile their various accounts and memories of a man whose life was otherwise unremarkable.While most of us would like to think we would be as brave, it's almost impossible to explain Schindler's success, much less his motives. But, for two reasons, Keneally's book is hardly a hagiography: Schindler is presented as a deeply flawed, even selfish man, and the people he rescued proved to be equally courageous--and many of the survivors are presented in far more detail than is possible in a two-hour movie. The novel makes clear that this is as much their story as Oskar Schindler's; their survival was a coordinated effort by a large group rather than a miracle effected by one man. And Commandant Amon Goeth, whose villainy, incredibly, is even worse than the character depicted in the film, comes across not simply as an evil man but, in the end, a truly pathetic and cowardly one.\\"Schindler's List\\" is not meant to be a history of the Holocaust. This biographical novel is set in a terrible time and a unique place, and its perhaps unseemly hopefulness can seem jarringly out of place for an epoch that had no silver linings. Instead, Keneally's (and Schindler's) underlying story is a lesson for us all: what might have happened if there had been not one, but one thousand Oskar Schindlers."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List, Thomas Keneally's 1982 non-fiction \\"novel\\" about Oskar Schindler's transformation from a hedonistic bon vivant German (actually, Sudeten German, born in what is now part of the Czech Republic) war profiteer to savior of over 1,000 Jews during World War II, is one of the most fascinating accounts about the darkest chapter of that global conflict, the Holocaust. It vividly portrays the horrors of the Nazi effort to exterminate the Jewish inhabitants in German-occupied Europe while at the same time proving that one person, no matter how flawed and contradictory in nature he or she is, can rise to the occasion and make a difference.In his Author's Note, Keneally explains that he uses the oft-used technique of telling a true story in the format of a fictional account, partly because he is primarily a novelist (Confederates, Gossip From the Forest) and \\"because the novel's techniques seem suited for a character of such ambiguity and magnitude as Oskar.\\" He also acknowledges the persistence of Leopold Pfefferberg, a Los Angeles leather-goods store owner and one of the \\"Schindlerjuden\\" -- the handful of mostly Polish Jews saved by Schindler from the SS by Oskar's use of his charm, connections with high Nazi Party officials, and ultimately, the fortune Schindler had gone to make in Krakow after Poland's surrender in the fall of 1939.Like Steven Spielberg's 1993 Academy Award-winning film it inspired, Schindler's List (published in Europe as Schindler's Ark) describes how Schindler takes over a factory -- formerly owned by Jewish investors -- and makes a fortune selling, among other things, pots and pans to the German Army. But as the war goes on and Schindler sees first-hand the horrible crimes the Third Reich is committing in the name of the \\"Final Solution,\\" the well-connected charmer and ladies' man becomes more concerned about saving lives than making money. First, he has a few fortunate Jews listed with the SS as \\"essential war-industry workers\\" in his Krakow factory; later, when he discovers that SS Commandant Amon Goeth has been given orders to dispose of every inmate and slave laborer at the Plaszow Labor Camp before the advancing Soviets reach Krakow, he spends all of his wealth paying Goeth and other corrupt SS officials for the lives of nearly 1,200 of the Jewish men, women, and children who form Schindler's workforce.While Spielberg's movie faithfully captures the novel's account of the Holocaust years, Keneally's book gives the reader more details about Oskar's life before and after the war, including a short account of his prewar activities and his postwar business failures in Europe and Argentina. However, Keneally's focus is on Schindler's inspiring transformation from shameless and charming entrepreneur to \\"Righteous Person,\\" proving that decency and righteousness can triumph over even the most implacable tyranny and hatred."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List is an extremely well written novel. It truly grasps your attention and makes you feel as if you're part of the story. Adults may have an easier time reading this book rather than children younger then the age of twelve. What makes it so difficult to understand, are some of the gruesome details and the very straight forward way of writing. If you are interested in chronicles about war and history, and aren't bothered by some mind blowing facts, this is a very appealing book.It is about Oscar Schindler, a heavy drinker that loves women, and cares mostly about himself. Not until he realizes how horrible the Jewish people are being treated in the concentration camps, is it when he takes action. Schindler was able to save over one thousand jews. He saved them from having the same fate as millions of other Jews.This novel is one of the best i have read in along time. Though very heart-breaking and deppressing, it truly lets you see what it was like for the Jewish people in that area of time."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This gripping book was published a decade before Steven Spielberg began filming the Academy-Award winning movie. Czech-German businessman Oscar Schindler (1908-74) was flawed and hedonistic, and he profited from Jewish slave labor in his wartime factory producing cookware for the Germany army. But Schindler had a big heart, and he took many risks to save his 1,100 employees (and others) from near-certain death at the hands of their Nazi captors. We see how Schindler operated, stuffing gifts into the hands of the SS commanders, and profiting from the skills of his fearful employees. Readers get a strong feel for Schindler's life, including his flaws and excesses. We also learn of his largely un-successful years after the war, where Schindler received support from some of the employees he'd saved, but was occasionally griped at by Germans for having betrayed the fatherland.This gripping book resulted from a chance 1980 encounter between the author and Schindler employee Poldek Pefferberg (1913-2001) in the latter's Los Angeles store. Officially classified as fiction, this is a very real tale, and it contains much information the movie didn't have time for. In short, this superbly readable effort is worth your time even if you've seen the movie."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning, fictionalized biography of Oskar Schindler memorializes a member of the Nazi party who endangered his own life for four years, working privately to save Jews from the death camps. A playboy who loved fine wines and foods, he was also a smooth-talking manipulator (and briber) of Nazi officials, as well as a clever entrepreneur, already on his way to stunning financial success by the early days of World War II. Nowhere in Schindler's background are there any hints that he would one day become the savior of eleven hundred Jewish men and women.While the excellent film of this novel concentrates on the dangers Schindler and \\"his Jews\\" faced daily throughout the war, Keneally, well known for his depictions of characters acting under stress, concentrates on the character of Oskar Schindler himself, beginning with his childhood and teen years. As he explores Schindler's transformation from war profiteer and \\"passive\\" Nazi to a man willing to use his fortune to ensure the salvation of his factory workers, Keneally reveals a man of enormous courage and derring-do, a man who thrives by living on the edge.Presenting episodes from the lives of some of the \\"Schindlerjuden,\\" Keneally highlights their humanity, creating moments of high drama. Characters such as Leopold Pfefferberg and factory manager Itzhak Stern move in and out of the narrative, illustrating graphically the extent to which their lives depend upon Oskar Schindler, while the constant intrusion of sadistic SS commandant Amon Goeth in Schindler's life shows the fragility of their security. Other stories, of people who just missed being saved by Schindler, highlight the arbitrariness of fate--chance--in their (and our) lives.Throughout the novel, Keneally stresses the importance of bearing witness and testifying to the atrocities. In one of the novel's most moving passages, Schindler and his lover ride horses to a ridge where they can view the expulsion of the Jews from the Krakow ghetto, watching, horrified, as old or crippled laggards are murdered in front of Jewish children. \\"They permitted witnesses because they believed the witnesses, all, would perish, too.\\" Later, Schindler works with a Zionist rescue organization, secretly going to Budapest to testify about the hidden death camps.Schindler's heroism, his goodness within a country committed to the extermination of other humans, his recognition that witnesses are essential, and his ability to use the system in order to hasten its end bring this story of one man's fight against the Holocaust to life. But it is Keneally's incorporation of Schindler's faults and excesses which gives texture and depth to this portrait and make Schindler a character with whom the reader can identify. Keneally's meticulous research and his portrait of Schindler after the war, beloved by Jews but at loose ends personally and professionally, make this novel an unforgettable study of character and time. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This book is not only a good biography of Oskar Schindler, but (I'm betting) helps the reader understand the Holocaust better than before reading this awesome novel. I had to read it a little at a time, and the writing was not the easist, but it became much easier to read as I went on and I am so glad that I persisted with it. It is a story of man gradually possessed by a goal which he basically manages to achieve. Kineally let the facts speak for themselves and there was little embellishment, yet I found myself thinking about the novel all day and literally couldn't wait for my evening read to see what Schindler was going to do next. Only four stars (wish could give 4 1/2!) only because at times there seemed to be a bit of dryness and way too many names. I would have loved to have had more character development of any number of characters, but I suppose Kineally would have given us that if he could."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List, by Thomas Keneally, is based on the true story of a German industrialist who saved over 1,000 Jews from extermination during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It presents a very realistic and persuasive account of how Oskar Schindler placed himself at great risk (he was arrested three times) to oppose the Nazi regime and protect the Jewish workers in his factory. The book also describes the subhuman treatment of those that Schindler could not save.Most of those reading this brief review will have seen the movie and it must be said that the book does not have quite the impact of the movie. Still, this is a fine book and a tribute to a man who chose to act decisively when he met evil. It deserves to be widely read."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's list is a great book written by Thomas Keneally about Oskar Schindler, a 'nazi' member who saved thousands of Jews by having them to work for him and by making a lot of bribes and huge efforts to save as many Jews as possible. This is the best book about Holocaust and yet it can not describe not even 1% what the helpless Jews have been through during the Nazi's cowardish empire of horror. It is impossible to read this book and not feel all the terrors and injustice done to Jews. You simply become one of them."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Given the awards lauded upon this biographical novel, the acclaimed film it inspired and the subject matter of the story itself, I had expected SCHINDLER'S LIST to be a compelling portrait of an extraordinary man and the extraordinary times in which he lived. After the first couple chapters, however, it is also a gripping page-turner, and an involving read.Thomas Keneally's intelligent account of the industrialist Oskar Schindler and the 1300 Jews who survived with his help is more than a morality play about one good man surrounded by incomprehensible evil. Despite Keneally's matter-of-fact journalistic style, Oskar Schindler is mythologized in the novel, as he was mythologized by the \\"Schindlerjuden\\" themselves. He is compared to King Arthur, Robin Hood, Zeus. His moral complexities and ambiguities are left intact. He is charismatic yet flawed, larger than life yet tragically human.Perhaps it is inevitable that Oskar Schindler would take on such an aura. The Holocaust is a mythical era. The human mind cannot wrap itself around an evil so all-consuming and horrors so staggering, so they are simplified. Hitler and the Nazis become a shorthand for evil men; the Holocaust becomes a shorthand for death -- thrown around as weightily yet lightly as Satan, monsters, and Hell. For one to accomplish what Schindler did would require an equally supernatural force.Even when he is not directly involved, miracles happen: A man with whom he is associated is saved from an execution when not one, but two guns jam. Two women separated from the others on his list and exiled to a camp of certain death somehow find their way back into the group to survive the war. After the German surrender, two German shells hit his factory but cause only one woman superficial wounds.A similar mythologizing happens to Amon Goeth, the dreaded Kommandant of the camp at Cracow and (in Keneally's words) Schindler's \\"dark brother\\" -- both physically similar and prone to Schindler's excesses. In the minds of the Schindlerjuden and hence Keneally's account drawn from their testimony, Goeth becomes a god of death, oozing evil and brutality, presiding over their nightmares to this day.To what extent the events in the novel are objective fact and to what extent they are subjective myth is therefore unclear but immaterial. In preserving the life of Oskar Schindler, Keneally has taken to heart the line from the film \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\": \\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\\""},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"A book should be reviewed by itself, but considering the wide resonance the Spielberg's movie has had since its delivery, and that I happened to read the book some years later, it is hard to me to keep it apart, so I am not even trying to. The book is well written, and Keneally turns out a very skilled writer, but the main interest lays of course in the narrated events, and I am a bit puzzled about classifying the book either as fiction or biographical. The most outstanding feature I met is the different kinds of rhetoric used by the writer and by the director: the former strict, descriptive and inquiring, the latter powerful and simplifying. Keneally takes the core event as an axiom, and do not to prove it, while he examines the complex stream of events that have taken place in such a complex situation. He also admits that some events, such as the rescue of women from Auschwitz, have never found a satisfactory explanation, and that he is not able to detect when Oskar Schindler made up is mind in trying to save the Jews, then he tells what happened. A completely different view is provided by Spielberg. Moving first from a rough approximation of the events reported in the book, he reinvents the story, depicting it as the human development and moral growth of Schindler. For example, all along the book Schindler remains an unfaithful husband, whilst in the movie it seems that at the end, when back to Brunnlitz, he makes some kinds of promises to his wife Emilie, and also the ending script refers of a \\"failure of the wedlock\\": in the book, it is explicitly written that Schindler left his Emilie. In the book the different natures of Oskar Schindler are always con contemporarily present. In the movie he seems like St. Paul on the road to Damascus; in the book he \\"is dallying like Zeus\\". According to Keneally, many other Germans give help to Jews, but none of them is mentioned in the film. In a nut, I would say that Keneally tried to tell Schindler's story, and Spielberg, however giving a likelihood representation of Holocaust, have wrought out a story of his own."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"The Holocaust is a difficult topic to deal with as subject matter for a work of art; its horrors have been explicitly brought to light countless times in several different formats and knowledge of these horrors has pervaded our society such that nearly everyone has been exposed to them in some way or another. In order to tell an effective story about the Holocaust, one must do more than shock the reader with the evils that took place in concentration camps or Jewish ghettos--this has been done once and for all by those who lived through it. In Schindler's List, Thomas Keneally goes beyond such shock value by telling of the profound goodness that emerged--from such unspeakable evil--in the character of prison camp Direktor Oskar Schindler and his Schindlerjuden.In his telling of the story, Keneally's sure-handed prose adds credibility and its occasional delve into the poetic adds great emotional weight. The effect of such a telling is that of a slow toxin that siezes the reader by the heart and squeezes to the point of anguish, leading to a novel that is both deeply moving and absolutely believable.As for the story itself, Keneally focuses mostly on the the background, creeping around the edges. Whenactions and ambitions of Schindler, leaving the horror stories recessed in such evils are brought to the forefront of the tale, they are potent and real, but somehow serve more as chiaroscuro to the divine goodness of Schindler's deeds. Thus it is that much more effective when Schindler spends every bit of his entire life's fortune to literally buy life for as many of the Jews as he possibly can. When all is said and done, Keneally has done no less than consecrate the sanctity of life by weighing its importance against that of essentially meaningless things such as money.By telling the story of a good man living in such evil times, Schindler's List has become an important addition to Holocaust literature."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"I read this book for a school assigment, and found it to be very powerful.

It gives you real life accounts of prisoners from multiple concentration camps, from guards, and from others who knew Oskar Schindler about what actually took place during all the terror and evil of the time. In this book you can actually feel the terror and fear mothers had for their children. You can hear the cries of the children as their mothers are pulled away from them by Nazi guards. And you can see the sliver of hope offered by this stranger who is setting up a sub camp and wants you to be a resident of it.This book is the true story put together by Thomas Keneally based on accounts of the Schindlerjuden, or Schindler's Jews. This man knows the fate of the millions of Jews in Europe. Like other factory owners, Schindler has many Jews who work for him in his factory. After a series of events Oskar Schindler builds his own camp for his workers to stay in. There he provides them with the more food and comfort than any other camp in Europe. He begins to build friendships with his \\"prisoners\\", and after the war is looked down upon for his acts of bravery and courage. His homeland becomes his enemy and Israel honors Schindler's actions in many ways.While this book does get hard to understand at times, it is an excellent book that really blows you away with the actual stories of people who experienced such evil no one should ever have to go through. And through the tough times of Germany shines the hope of one man who was able to save more than 1,000 lives during this reign of terror.(P.S. Scott says \\"Squids are our friends!

However, one night when I was reading it, I suddenly flung it across the room in anger after reading a section about &quot;man's inhumanity to man&quot;. Even though the movie is very good, it does not even come close to doing justice to the book.True heroes are people such as Oscar Schindler, a man that deserves to be honoured in our hearts and minds forever.

Nonetheless, Keneally has clearly researched this issue with passion and a desire to tell the real story as a result of his interviews with the people involved. He brings out the agonizing ambiguity of the man, Oscar Schindler, a man who can play his dangerous game of saving &quot;his&quot; Jews from the horrors that hang over their heads.The book is told by using several vignette's of the legend of Schindler. As a researcher, Keneally is honest in admitting in part where some of the stories may be overblown or even not true, but that they carry with them the essence of this remarkable man, a man who was so devoted to the Schindlerjuden at the expense of his relationship with is wife.Writing in such a way is interesting in bringing all the disparate parts together. Unfortunately, it also seems disjointed and hard to follow at times. Even so, reading it is not easy. Finding out the truth of the Holocaust is paramount to understanding the evil that men can do, but also the lengths to which some can go to fight that evil.Read and Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Mr. Keneally's wonderfully written book - as the film which followed - is a powerful reminder that even in history's most bloody and barbaric century decency and morality did yet exist, even if on too small a scale.

It's about a man, Oskar Schindler, who starts off as a first class industrialist who recruits Jewish workers to work in his labor camp. Oskar, who had many important contacts in the military and government, was able to supply his Jewish workers with more food, clothing, and better living conditions that any of the camps that had been established for the Jews in World War 2. In other words, if you worked for Schindler, you were in paradise. As the mass murders of the Jews in the concentration camps began, and Schindler's labor camp was moved from Moravia to Brinnlitz, Schindler became obsessed with the welfare of the Jews. He concocted a list of 1000+ Jewish prisoners from concentration camps to go and \\"work\\" in his labor camp in Brinnlitz, though they didn't do much working. Finally, after a long, hard battle, the Schindler and imprisoned Jews were liberated.The plot of the story was itself amazing, but the way it was written wasn't as extraordinary. Thomas Keneally used many German words in his writing that made it hard to understand what he was talking about. Also, at some points of the story, he would be telling them very well but then would stray from the subject. It is very easy to get confused while reading this book. He would sometimes go into far too much detail, making the story too much for what it should have been.

While it's true that this additional information in no way takes away from the scope of what Schindler accomplished, it still provides additional and illuminating detail.While it's necessary to understand the greater horror that was the Holocaust, this book reminds everyone that for that horror there were also the occassional heros (like Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg) who through courageous and repeated efforts showed the good they could do."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List is unadulterated proof that a part-fact, part-fiction book can succeed.

Oskar Schindler is far from perfect. He's a hard-drinking womanizer and profiteer. But that's what makes him so appealing. Schindler rises above his faults, and, at great personal expense, risks his life to save thousands. Beware, this isn't a book for kids.

Nevertheless, the novel is still worth reading.On a stylistic level, it's difficult to figure out what the book is. To be sure, it's a novel, an embellished, woven-together story based on historical events. Liberties were taken. Words were put in people's mouths. In that sense, the book is fiction. But it reads much like a history book (complete with a chart of US-German rank equivalents) and, indeed, seems to have been researched like one. Ultimately, then, it's an amalgam, and I think that's the point: that the story of Oskar Schindler as we know it today is part history and part fiction, a strange brew of fact and myth.At the core of the book is an exploration of good and evil and that gray area in between. Oskar Schindler was a morally flawed man who cheated on and ignored his wife and for whom the bottom line often outweighed morality, as in joining the Nazi Party to advance his business interests. But at the same time, it was his success as a businessman and his ties to Nazis that enabled him to stay in business, to save himself from prosecution for certain \\"crimes,\\" and to save the Jews that he did -- and saving them was a highly moral act.Keneally writes extremely well and creates near-perfect metaphors. Just to cite one example, his descriptions of Auschwitz are especially stunning and apt: \\"It was a phenomenon. The moral universe had not so much decayed here. It had been inverted, like some black hole, under the pressure of all the earth's malice.\\" Quite so.It's a worthwhile and memorable read, even if you've seen the movie."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This book gives a lot detailed information and shares a number of things that we need to know about, I recommend that school students read this book.

He was far from flawless, but flawed men are capable of great things. Thomas Keneally doesn't just bring him interestingly to life; he brings the situations to life as well. Sometimes, the novel seems immediate and urgent; other times, it seems sober and indifferent. The observations and keen duality of Keneally telling the story and BEING the story is very curious, and indeed, some of the events are just eye-poppingly coincidental, since many of them actually happened in history.

You can work on yourself and help others at the same time. When you reach a ripe old age, you still probably will not be a perfect person. That's okay. You can still do great things. Sure, I could have figured this out on my own, but it's nice to have a living, breathing example. I also learned that even with people who fundamentally disagree with you, you can be a lot more open than you would think. And instead of telling people that they should do something differently, which I suppose can be done well, Oskar asked people to help him with his project. &quot;My workers . . . highly skilled . . . essential labor.&quot; It was genius. When I first heard of this story, I wondered if it was true. And sometimes I still find myself wondering, Did this really happen? Was Oskar really able to pull this off? Oh yes, he was able to pull it off. This is a true story. &quot;Ah, Oskar Schindler, now there's a name people won't soon forget.

An amazing story that have been very well written by Keneally. And even the story behind the book is a story of it's own, which makes the book even more special.This is the story about Oscar Schindler, a German, who had a factory with Jewish slave workers in Poland during the 2nd World War. Schindler is corrupt, a heavy drinker and loves women. A powerful and provoking book about Holocaust and the Nazism. But Schindler wasn't a Nazi, and most of the Jews, that worked for him, survived Hitler. Over 6 million Jews were killed, mostly in concentration camps, and Schindler stands as a symbol to those to survied because of him. He managed to do justice when no one else seemed to care.You'll be filled with anger, sadness and other emotions throughout the book, as it's so very provoking and sometimes sad. Highly recommended for anyone and everyone. You will not regret reading this book, and most likely you will read it again, trying to understand..."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This was a gripping book - disturbing, but not as grotesque as some Holocaust histories can be. Keaneally's portraits of Schindler and his adversary are exquisite. It's easy to see how the actors in the movie got their inspiration. If you liked the movie, this is an excellent accompaniment, as it explores the man, his life, and the history around him in much more detail than is possible even in the very long movie. Even though I've read a lot about WWII, the Nazis, and the Holocaust (Hitler's Willing Executioners seems to have been an important influence for the writer), it was hard at first to follow the detail in the book, particularly the German terminology and SS ranks. Ultimately, I didn't worry about that too much, and it didn't affect comprehension. Keneally's main sources are personal interviews with &quot;schindlerjuden&quot; and the testimonies of same given to fact-finding courts in Israel right after the War. This is the only story I know of that explores the fascinating idea of bribing, seducing, and schmoozing with the enemy to save lives."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Keneally says that he is writing a novel here, but also that this is history. With these two partially contradictory claims, it is hard to know just how much of this book is truth and how much is fiction. Assuming mostly or all truth, this is an almost incredible story; Oskar Schindler, for almost no discernible reason, decided to preserve as many Cracovian Jews from the conquering Nazis as he could. The blurb claims he saved more than anyone else during that horrific period, which is fairly easy to believe, as one does not know of many being saved at all. Through the whole story Schindler carries the aura of invincibility and fore-knowledge which adds both credibility and colour to the characterisation. One cannot imagine an author seriously expecting to be believed when he claims to invent a man who, virtually in the shadow of Auschwitz, is able to winkle Jews away from the death-chambers; the very outrageousness of the claim speaks for it."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Keneally's approach to recreating history in &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is an intelligent and responsible one: he labels his representation exactly what it is, a fiction. (Contrast this with Spielberg's pseudo-documentarian methods, which seem to want to claim some sort of absolute historical authority, in the film of the same name.) Despite a wealth of historical minutiae culled from research and interviews with surviving &quot;Schindler Jews,&quot; Keneally is fully aware that his novel treads troubled and troubling ground; correspondingly, he is careful to alert his reader to the fact that he cannot faithfully reproduce human reality but will, rather, make every effort to get his story close.Constructed like a well-plotted novel, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; sees Keneally's narrative powers at their finest. His characters are full-bodied and believable, each with their own often very private motivations for their very public actions. Keneally speculates on such motivations or contexts but does not pass judgment easily. Most importantly, there is little of the handy black-and-white demonization of the Nazis that the film mobilizes to great rhetorical effect; while Spielberg's version forces one to take the uncomplicated side of Schindler and thus believe that he or she too would have done the right thing just like Oskar, Keneally allows a much more unsettling thought to percolate, one that is probably truer to life in insisting that, were we in the Nazis' shoes, we sadly and mistakenly would likely have done exactly what they did. Keneally's Schindler stands out as a much more complex aberration of a very human (no matter how monstrous their actions) group of people.I feel a little bad for having simply pitted book against movie as one so often does, but I have done so out of deference to the depressing likelihood that Keneally's book will forever be overshadowed by and tethered to the Spielberg ball and chain. I have read that Spielberg's film is required viewing in many high schools. Sad that Keneally's book isn't required reading. Absent the triumphalism of the film, it stands as a sobering reminder that people can do terrible things, and that not all heroes are saints."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List, originally published as Schindler's Ark, is the true story of how Oskar Schindler, an aristocratic German industrialist, heavy drinker, briber, and womaniser, was transformed into a saviour during the horrors of World War II. His remarkable rescue of more than a thousand Jews is retold brilliantly in this honest and detailed account by Thomas Keneally.The story is set in Poland, where Schindler struggled to protect his Jewish factory employees from the cruel and terrible claws of the extermination camps. Schindler's efforts in saving souls increased as the war worsened, and climaxed with Schindler's List, the book of life and ticket to freedom for many Jewish survivors, whose accounts are carefully retold in this book.Although Keneally's long and descriptive sentences require patient concentration, and could become a stumbling block for some readers, once overcome, no reader could fail to be drawn into the action-packed plot. For Keneally summons terror and disgust with his gruesome profiles of the SS Gestapo, and draws smiles and smirks with his descriptions of Schindler's devious dealings with them.In Keneally's book, metaphors and similes vividly contrast the characters and scenery, omitting no details, and succeed in taking the reader to a different time and place. Although a biography, and therefore brimming with names, dates, and numbers, Keneally manages to navigate history so that no event is left without significance.Schindler's List is a riveting read which no one should miss out on, as not only is it an exciting story, it also gives an accurate glance into the labour camps of World War II, and takes a look at the darker side of humanity. A Booker Prize-winning novel, now also an Oscar-winning movie, Schindler's List is a must for anyone over 15."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Too often, we are led to believe that no one can make a difference, that evil is too strong, and it's better just to go along, or to maybe do the best WE can and ignore the struggles of others. What \\"Schindler's List\\" shows is that one person can make a difference in the face of overwhelming odds.Unlike Corrie Ten Boom or Raoul Wallenberg, we are shown that Oskar Schindler started out with no moral underpinnings to make him able to stand with courage against the Nazis. He was a would-be war profiteer, plain and simple -- a man out for a mark, who would get in and get out when it suited him.Keneally takes you inside Schindler with a remarkable deftness, showing the truly amazing growth that made Schindler able to turn from making money to spending it to save more than a thousand lives -- as Spielberg showed at the end of the moving movie he made from this book, Schindler's survivors and their descendants outnumber the Jews remaining in Poland. The Jewish people believe that no matter how strong the oppressor, \\"God always leaves a remnant.\\"Although this book does not do so, it is interesting to consider Schindler as an agent of God in this -- during the war, he made millions of marks, yet after, he hardly had two pfennigs to rub together. After he saved their lives, the \\"Schindlerjuden\\" took care of him for the remainder of his."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"I have wanted to see Spielberg's movie for quite some time, and I think I'm glad I read the book first. There is a lot of detail here that almost certainly will be lost in the movie.Initially, there is the complexity that is Oskar Schindler himself. It is fascinating to follow his development from a war profiteer and a major operator in the black market to a man obsessed with saving as many Jewish prisoners as he can. It would be convenient to view Schindler as an industrialist using the Jewish prisoners as a cheap source of labor to boost his profits, but it is quite clear that he ultimately was willing to pay any price to save people. His actions could have easily cost him his life. One the other hand, care must be taken to recongize that Schindler was not a saint, but a flawed man who happened to have performed a great deed. His story is truly remarkable.I also found that many of the descriptions of other individuals included fascinating details. Here we find an array of complex and all-too-human characters. Schindler's greatest gift seems to have been his ability to determine what was required to motivate individuals to help Schindler achieve his goals. He was a master a bribery, but could also locate unlikely sources of compassion and conscience. While this is a story that proves that not everyone looked the other way during the Nazi reign of terror, the shame of it is that the numbers of such people were so small."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This poignant book by Australian author Thomas Keneally, was originally published as Schindler's Ark and in which Spielberg based his move. Schindler is a bragging, boozing opportunist who makes a fortune in Poland during the second-world-war German occupation, buying up the businesses of dispossessed Jews. We read about his black market deals, his backslapping relationship with the authorities, his parties and his mistresses - and gradually discover that his lifestyle is a faade, that his true activity is saving thousands of Jews from the gas-chambers. A remarkable man and a testement that we should never forget the terror that the Jewish people were subjected to during world-war-two."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"I understand that there was some controversy when this book won the Booker Prize because, though it is presented as a novel, it is non-fictional in approach and detail. There is very very few events mentioned here that weren't witnessed by someone (one of the hallmarks of historical fiction is that the author uses flights of fancy to imagine what happened behind closed doors). Similarly, there is very little that wasn't backed up by research and/or witness testimony.Noting this doesn't detract from SCHINDLER'S LIST as a literary achievement. The writing is heartbreaking and taut, and the story is compelling. On a purely technical level, I was grateful that most of the chapters were very short, simply because these frequent breaks allowed me to rest briefly before delving into the relentless terror and pain that the Schindlerjuden were experiencing. I would love to know what has happened to each of his \\"his Jews\\" in the days since their liberation. The 1,200 people he saved have, as of 2006, grown to more than 7,000 living all over the world. The machinations that Keneally writes about; the bribes, the schmoozing and the glad-handing of officials in order to save these human beings is nothing short of super-human. Why did this \\"passive Nazi\\" risk his own life in order to save so many others? I don't know. I'm only grateful that he did.Thomas Keneally reaffirms faith in the human spirit and the willingness to do good, even if the person doing it is no angel."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This is the most important book I've read so far this decade. The author Thomas Keneally writes extremely well and even if you know quite a bit about the Holocaust, you will learn more as a result of reading this book. Characters of all varieties are brought to life here and force you to consider ethical principles and the nature of human behavior.I watched only part of the movie of this book as it made me nauseous. For those who may have avoided the movie for similar reasons, I can highly recommend the book. You can read it slowly, taking in all the historical facts, and though the brutality is described, you do not have to witness it with your eyes. It is still difficult but leads you more to an interior exploration of your own ethics and opinions about society.One of the important aspects of the book is that Schindler was no angel. He had many character flaws. But he attempted to save as many victims of the Nazis as he could despite the danger. Therefore, the book though depicting the worst kind of brutality can give us hope. I urge you to read this book."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"To anyone who has read this book it can come as no shock to learn that Keneally not only picked up the Los Angeles Times Award for Fiction but also the Booker Prize. Keneally confronts the Holocaust head on in cold factual style, with this account of the life of Oskar Schindler and the lives he saved.The story, based heavily upon fact is so powerful and emotive that legendary Hollywood producer Steven Speilberg set about adapting it for film. This however, far surpases the film in terms of it's effectiveness in outlining the true horrors of the Holocaust. A tale that will disgust you, and a tale which will warm your heart. Two extremes of humanity meet each other - unparalled evil and raw, human compassion. This will always remain as one of the 20th Century's most influential books, it's implicit message will hopefully serve as a stark warning to future generations. The man, Oskar Schindler has been immortalised through this - hopefully he'll serve as inspiration for others in his position."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Most people who haven't read this book undoubtedly have seen the film. Like nearly any film, it is better or more fulfilling to read the novel. This is somewhat different in that the movie is by any standard excellent.

While Spielberg is to be commended on his incredible talent at filmmaking, there was much of this story that wasn't brought to the screen, and maybe couldn't have been, I'm not sure. This was such a powerful story that it needed to be told. Normally when we think of how truly evil our world has been, we have to travel much farther back than just the 2nd World War, but not in this case.Oskar Schindler, risking his life and the lives of those he loved, made what he felt was the morally right choice by saving a few Jews while the Nazi's used his business to further the War effort for Germany. Rarely can we find someone who so selflessly risked their life in such a way to save a number of people his own government had marked for extinction. Oskar recognized what the Nazi's refused to acknowledge, that ALL human life is precious, regardless of race or color of skin. How much farther would we all be if everyone held fast to what Oskar risked his life to hold true?"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Even though Keneally is working from a true story, there are some fictionalized elements.

I didn't like that Schindler had like 2 to 3 lovers not counting his wife. The end of the book was the best. It was very sad.

Rated PG-13 for intense thematic elements, violence and language."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This review is dedicated by a Jew and Zionist Until Death, myself! , To the Righteous among the Nations, those Gentiles who have stood by the Jewish Nation in times of travail and murder, and those who continue to stand by Jews and Israel, in these frightening and sombre times of today.Many people have wondered how the nation that gave us such great contributors to humanity, such as the Statesman Frederick the Great, the poet and writer Johan Goethe, and musicians such as Bach and Beethoven, could have allowed themselves to be led by the Satanic Adolph Hitler (may his evil name be erased from history) produced the SS and Gestapo, and allowed those evil forces to carry out the Holocaust against 6 million Jewish men, women and children, as well as millions of Roma, disabled people , Slavs and Armenians.An yet we must not forget the righteous among the nations, which included Germans like Pastor Niemoller and Konrad Adenauer, who opposed the monstrous Nazi tyranny, and Oskar Schindler (and Emily Schindler) among others, who put their own lives on the line to save Jewish lives.Oskar Schindler was a maverick Sudeten German industrialist, who put his life and livelihood on the line to save 6 000 Jews from the Nazi death machine.Unlike the move \\"Schindler's List\\", in this book we read something of the world before and after World War II and the Holocaust (Shoah).Hence we see something of the anti-Semitism of the Catholic Church, and how the centuries of Catholic poison against the Jewish people, in some ways paved the way for the horrors of the Shoah (as well as having caused untold suffering and death to Jews through the centuries - since Roman times! -and it continues to cause suffering and death today to Jews when the Catholic Church sides with Palestinian terrorists against innocent Israeli Jewish women and children!In 1929 Oskar Schindler married Emilie, a German speaking Catholic girl (who would prove to have a heart of gold, but would be treated shabbily by Oskar). From her girlhood Emilie would have a close friendship with the daughter of the local Jewish storekeeper in her village, Rita Reiff.On a visit to Emile's father, the parish priest told him that it was not good , in principle , for a Catholic girl to have a friendship with a Jew. It is a testament to Emilie's character that she resisted the edict of the bigoted priest, and remained a close friend Rita's, until Rita was executed by Nazi officials, in front of the store, in 1942.It is a testament to the love and honour that Schindler would be held in by the Jews he saved and their descendents, that when this book was written by Thomas Keneally in 1982 (37 years after the war and 8 years after Oskar Schindler passed away) that a family called the C's who spread malicious rumours about Schindlers, still had to be protected by being granted anonymity by the author! Clearly the Schindlerjuden or their children or grandchildren could take revenge against the C's if the author had revealed their identity!He was not held by all Germans with such esteem after the war, and as late as the 1960's were spat out and verbally attacked on the streets of Frankfurt (but more of that later).Just as there have always been a handful of righteous Gentiles, so too there have always been Jews who have acted in ways that have brought destruction on their own people.The Judenrat (The Nazi puppet councils of Jews) that helped the Nazis oppress their own people, where mainly made up of secular intellectuals, as are the leftist Jewish traitors today, like the loathsome Noam Chomsky, who back the \`Palestinian' efforts to destroy the tiny Jewish State of Israel, and thereby subject the Jewish people to a second holocaust.Over half of all holocaust survivors today live in Israel (as do many descendants of holocaust survivors), and it would be a hideous twist of history for these too to perish in the flames of anti-Jew hatred, as they would do if Israel was destroyed by forces of evil (G-D forbid that this should ever be allowed to happen!)Towards his later life in the 1960's and early 70's Schindler would be well looked after by the Schindlerjuden in Israel (where he spent half of every year, spending the other half in Germany in poverty and loneliness), and he would choose to be buried in Jerusalem.Many Schindler Jews mourned him at his funeral in Jerusalem in 1974.While we will always remember evil enemies of our people those like Pharaoh Amalek, Haman, Torquemada, Chmielnicki, Hitler, Stalin, Gaddafi Arafat, Edward Said and Chomsky (may their souls be eternally erased), we too must remember the Righteous Among the Nations such as Rahab, Emperor Darius, Pastor Niemoller, Oskar and Emilie Schindler , Reverend Pat Robertson , David Dolan and Mike Evans (may they be eternally blessed)."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"\\"Schindler's List\\" is about a heroic and brave man named Oskar Schindler.

The main character in this book is Oskar Schindler, who is a catholic German, that gives his life saving to save over 1200 Jews from labor camps, and gas chambers. Oskar Schindler took in a Jewish man who he had taken a liking to. This man helped Oskar with papers he had to make for the Jewish people who worked for him. These papers had to be shown to the Nazi soldiers that they belonged to Oskar Schindler. If any Jews did not have these papers then on the spot the soldiers would ship them away to camp, and there they would become slaves. One day he had forgotten his papers, when he was walking across the street a solider stopped him and asked for his papers. He couldn't find them so the solider arrested him and put him on a train to a Jewish camp. Luckily Oskar found this out before the train left and got to the train station in time to get him off of the train and back to safety. I only recommend this book if the subject of the holocaust does not bother you. I really enjoyed this book because reading a true story is so much better to me then something made up. The truth in this book really makes you think how cruel the Germans were at this time, but not ever German was a bad seed."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List, by Thomas Keneally, while extraordinarily accurate on the events of World War 2, was not a very captivating story. It's about a man, Oskar Schindler, who starts off as a first class industrialist who recruits Jewish workers to work in his labor camp. Oskar, who had many important contacts in the military and government, was able to supply his Jewish workers with more food, clothing, and better living conditions that any of the camps that had been established for the Jews in World War 2. In other words, if you worked for Schindler, you were in paradise. As the mass murders of the Jews in the concentration camps began, and Schindler's labor camp was moved from Moravia to Brinnlitz, Schindler became obsessed with the welfare of the Jews. He concocted a list of 1000+ Jewish prisoners from concentration camps to go and \\"work\\" in his labor camp in Brinnlitz, though they didn't do much working. Finally, after a long, hard battle, the Schindler and imprisoned Jews were liberated.The plot of the story was itself amazing, but the way it was written wasn't as extraordinary. Thomas Keneally used many German words in his writing that made it hard to understand what he was talking about. Also, at some points of the story, he would be telling them very well but then would stray from the subject. It is very easy to get confused while reading this book. He would sometimes go into far too much detail, making the story too much for what it should have been. The structuring of the sentences was also quite extravagant, sometimes too extravagant to understand.

Frequently, books with such sensitive subject matter are not subject to the same scrutiny as books with less disturbing topics. But apply that scrutiny to this book and the book holds firm. It is excellently written, harsh and clear in its detail as well as quite historically accurate."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Awesome. Even the film, which by all accounts is superb fails to do justice to this masterpiece. Keneally'striumph deserved to win the Nobel Prize for literature. The images are sharp and the pace manages to balance the harrowing truth with a reminder to the reader that yes, this did happen. I know this is a cliche, but it's deserved in this context:&quot;If you only read one single book in your life-timemake it this one&quot;"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"The book did a very succesful job in letting me know the true feeling and dedication of the character, Herr Oskar Schindler. Presents amazing mental pictures and lets you feel the relief and pain of all of the captives. It developed a true respect for WWII and helped me understand the anguish that these people went through. Truly the most moving and touching book that I have ever encountered!Kalan S.

As the Jewish ghettos in Crackow are &quot;liquidated&quot;, Oskar Schindler manages to keep his conscript Jewish workers safe from most German atrocities. When the plant is shut down, he gets approval to transfer his workers to a new plant in Moravia, saving them from Auschwitz. The book is more a documentary of survivor accounts than a novel. The story is told honestly and does not inflate the legend of Oskar, rather tells it in a matter of fact way. A wonderful story of humanity in the face of the Holocaust"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List is a book that can both captivate and troublea person at the same time. It is a book that brought out manyemotions; laughter, sadness, anger, tears, and a great joy forthe triumph of the human spirit. I felt like I was actuallyback in time with Schindler's Jews willing them to survive.While the book was somewhat difficult to start out with becauseof all the different German and Polish names, it quickly drewme in and would not let go! Shindler's List was excellentand I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially thoseinterested in learning about a true story the man who singlehandedly saved hundreds of Jews from the Holocaust of WWII."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This book is both enjoyable and enlightening. It details how a German industrialist Oskar Schindler managed to save the lives of 1,200 Schindlerjudens (Schindler's Jews) during the Holocaust by sheltering them first in his enamelware factory in Zablocie, Cracow and later in his (supposedly) anti-tank shell factory in Brinnlitz, Monrovia.I watched the movie before I read the book. While the movie succeeds beautifully in portraying the human suffering and the thin ray of hope Oskar managed to instill in his prisoners/workers, the book includes a lot more little details that readers could appreciate. For example, while this is definitely a depressing book, I find the little dark comedies of life and witticisms quite enjoyable. For example, after the war, when there was disbelief surrounding the story of Oskar's improbable rescue of the Jews, he was challenged by some journalists and was confronted with the fact that he personally knew many of the high-ranking SS officials in the Cracow region and beyond. Oskar's coolly replied: \\"At that stage in history, it was rather difficult to discuss the fate of Jews with the Chief Rabbi or Jerusalem.\\"I you enjoyed the movie, the book won't disappoint. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, I suggest you do both."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This book is masterfully-written, accessible to the layman, fascinating, and gripping. You'll finish it at one go, if you are not disturbed. Wipe the tedious, overpraised Spielberg movie out of your consciousness--this story is too complex and monumental to be adapted to film (especially by the guy who directed Jurassic Park 2). Keneally has no answers for Schindler's actions--the man remains an enigma. The story, as it unfolds over the course of many years, examines exactly what Schindler achieved, and the odds against him doing so. Schindler was no saint: Keneally presents him warts and all. But thousands--literally thousands--of people are alive today because of him. Keneally has delivered a fitting legacy to one of the true heroes of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Schindler's List, the novel by Thomas Keneally, is a well researched but fictionally written book about the Holocaust. It tells the story of Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman that enjoys a good cocktail party. Oskar has a wife, Emilie, but he cheats on her and doesn't treat her well. He takes over a factory previously owned by Jews. Schindler then begins to use imprisoned Jews to work in the factory. They were cheaper than normal laborers, so he used them as a way to make a larger profit. The cruelty of the Nazis progressed, and people in the ghettos began to say, \\"An hour of life is still life.\\" It is amazing that nobody showed any resistance to this Nazi torture. Even a drinking buddy of Schindler's, Amon Goeth, brutally killed many people. Goeth even killed a young child that hugged his legs, pleading for life. Oskar began to get a soft spot for Jews, thinking that they should be respected as human beings. Some of the Jews he saw in the camps and ghettos were old prewar friends of his. He spent a lot of money in the black market to get extra food for them. At one point, Schindler was jailed, accused of being a \\"Jew Kisser.\\" He was let out with a fine and a strong warning. He also received a letter that basically told him he better exterminate Jews or else. To pass SS inspections, he used bribes, like bottles of vodka and cognac. He opened up a second camp (mostly at his expense), which produced nothing. He did it just to save more Jews. They all wanted to get on Schindler's List. No Jews were murdered in Schindler's camps. Schindler's Jews were very thankful for him. It is true that one individual can make a difference, Schindler proves it by saving the lives of so many innocent people who, if it weren't for him, would have died.I enjoyed this book. It was packed with some interesting and unbelievable Holocaust facts. This book told an amazing story of life, love, and courage. The only down to it is that it is very long and some parts can get very boring. There are also some German names that can get confusing, but they do not take away from the story. I would recommend this book to anyone that has the time to read it."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"The book Schindler's List is one of the best Holocaust books I have ever read. It gives you real life accounts of prisoners from multiple concentration camps, from guards, and from others who knew Oskar Schindler about what actually took place during all the terror and evil of the time. In this book you can actually feel the terror and fear mothers had for their children. You can hear the cries of the children as their mothers are pulled away from them by Nazi guards. And you can see the sliver of hope offered by this stranger who is setting up a sub camp and wants you to be a resident of it.This book is the true story put together by Thomas Keneally based on accounts of the Schindlerjuden, or Schindler's Jews. This man knows the fate of the millions of Jews in Europe. Like other factory owners, Schindler has many Jews who work for him in his factory. After a series of events Oskar Schindler builds his own camp for his workers to stay in. There he provides them with the more food and comfort than any other camp in Europe. He begins to build friendships with his \\"prisoners\\", and after the war is looked down upon for his acts of bravery and courage. His homeland becomes his enemy and Israel honors Schindler's actions in many ways.While this book does get hard to understand at times, it is an excellent book that really blows you away with the actual stories of people who experienced such evil no one should ever have to go through. And through the tough times of Germany shines the hope of one man who was able to save more than 1,000 lives during this reign of terror."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Thomas Keneally, honoring the request of Schindler survivor Leopold Pfefferberg, researched and wrote this story of Oskar Schindler and never took a penny for it...Schindler was a good man but a flawed one, and this is made clear; he saved the lives of over a thousand but could not remain faithful to his own wife; but whatever reason he performed this act of rescue, the fact is he did it, and over 20 years after his death Schindler finally receives his just acclaim for decency for what he did for the Plaszow Jews, and gambled with his life and the mad commandant Goethe...reading it gives new meaning to the verse in the Talmud&quot;To save one life is to save the world entire.&quot;"},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"If, as Hannah Arendt points out in \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\\" (first published in 1963), evil is banal, then institutionalized evil protects itself with the very ordinariness of its agents. That is what makes evil so incomprehensible, often even to its perpetrators because once evil has become institutionalized, even the most innocuous among us can become willing participants. On the other hand, saving lives against the machinery of institutionalized evil requires extraordinary compassion, great courage, often great sacrifice and ingenuity. The Oskar Schindler of Thomas Keneally's excellent account of good versus evil possesses in rare degree each of those qualities as well as an abiding humanity which allows him to confront evil on equal terms and triumph.There's a rich English language literary tradition dealing with holocaust victims, a tradition which exemplifies and explores the proverb from the Talmud, \\"Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.\\" Keneally's story of Schindler's epiphany of his own humanity and subsequent efforts to save Jews from the Nazi final solution is based upon the life of an actual German industrialist and Nazi Party member and fuses fiction and history into a smooth eminently readable whole, granting the reader insight into the qualities and character of a man willing to risk his own life and spend his fortune to save others. For a while, Schindler was able to defy the inexorable machinery of the Nazi death camps by employing Jews in his \\"essential\\" war industry, and, although Schindler's life after the war never achieves the success he had during the war, he is recognized as a \\"Righteous Person.\\" Keneally provides the reader with a better understanding of what it means to be human in the midst of unspeakable inhumanity and illustrates just how rare good can be at times."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Wow! The book is every bit as good as the movie, and that is saying something. Though heartbreaking and gut-wrenching at times, the overriding message from this book is the triumph of good over evil. And the contrast between the two opposites is remarkable. Oskar Schindler had his flaws, but the good he was able to accomplish (at his own peril) was truly amazing. And as a testament to that, there are many human beings on this Earth today who would not be here had it not been for his extraordinary efforts."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"This is the uplifting story of a great and courageous man, who essentially gave everything he had to fight his personal guerilla war against the Holocaust. Though calling the book a novel, Keneally addresses it as an historian, setting down fact after fact in dispassionate style, building a record whose example may be inspiring, but whose effect is merely stultifying. Where there should be the warmth of blood and tears, there is only dust and ashes. So why a novel? Presumably to allow room for speculation, to devise specific encounters, imagine dialogue, describe feelings. Yes, describe them. For to paraphrase Hemingway, this is all tell and no show.Reading this makes me appreciate even more the work of Steven Spielberg and his screenwriter Steven Zaillian, whose 1993movie adaptationsurely stands as one of the great peaks of Holocaust art. These two did take the approach of a novelist, focusing on a few major characters, making you feel with them and for them, and bringing them together to raise fascinating moral questions. In particular the comparison between Oskar Schindler and the camp commandant Amon Goeth, two birds of a feather it would seem, until the moral chips are down. Or Schindler and his bookkeeper Itzhak Stern, who serves as his conscience and goad, but is almost invisible in the book. Spielberg's achievement remains in my memory 16 years later, but I will quickly forget the Keneally book that gave rise to it."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"The book is amazing for its wealth of information and doggedness to tell the story of not only Oskar Schindler but of what life was like for the people interned in the factories and death camps. In the author's note, Keneally tells that he chose to write the story as a novel but used documentary evidence and extensive interviews for most of the exchanges and conversations and all of the events detailed in the book and made reasonable constructs of conversations where only the briefest record exists. As a novel, the storytelling is lacking--it doesn't flow well or have a strong narrative--but as a record of a truth, it is astounding."},{"Title":"Schindlers List","review":"Because of the movie's fame, I avoided the book - thinking the movie had already provided the majority of the story. Not so.Mixing fact with some fiction, this book recites most of the major historical events which are now covered by great and encyclodepic non-fictional accounts of the Holocaust, as well as by museums which mushroomed throughout Europe and the United States. This is a great historical perspective of the 20th century's darkest hour. Throughout the fact is a fictional story so closely tied to truth that the reader cannot tell what is not the truth.Keneally's depiction of the oh-so-human Schindler whose great protection of a few thousand people can only be described as oh-so-saintly. Best described by his estranged but not embittered wife: \\"Oskar had done nothing astounding before the war and had been unexceptional since. He was fortunate, therefore, that in that short fierce era between 1939 and 1945 he had met people who summoned forth his deeper thoughts.\\"Nazi German historians must ask the nagging question of German efficiency having gone array in order to carry out the Holocaust. At one time in the book, Keneally asks why they wasted men, ammunition, materials and more in order to proceed to the execution of laborers with expertise. Why not use their services in servitude - like Schindler - in order to make shells, armaments and more for the cause? Free labor for the soldiers was what Schindler saw, and he made a good deal of money from this situation. But, when the Germans transformed the edict from suppression to extermination, commencing with inhumanity at the labor camp, Schindler left his capitalist instinct for his Judeo-Christian ethic and lived what can only be described as a remarkable tale.At the war's end, he managed to have hundreds of women removed from Auschwitz for his factory. This feat unfortunately is perhaps his most unique event. \\"There never had been, and would not be, any other Auschwitz rescue like this one.\\"Excellent details to Schindler's three imprisonments, careful detail to historical events which affected the issues of Schindler and his people, as well as great story telling, make this an incredibly good book. Because the weaving of truth with fiction is totally unobservable to the eye, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Romantic Poetry: Recent Revisionary Criticism","review":"This volume is exceptional for a few reasons: the essays are focused on well known, canonical texts and authors; they are by major critics; and they are surprisingly easy to read and comprehend. If you are familiar with Romantic poetry and would like to know more about how it has been interpreted in light of the last few decades' major critical trends -- New Historicism, deconstruction, and feminism, especially -- this is a great resource."},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Blues","review":"It's 1963 and after numerous Sunday altar calls, 13-year-old Layla Jay decides it is time to seek salvation. Never mind that she was pretending to be \\"saved\\" and that she feels a certain amount of guilt. Layla Jay wanted to make her grandmother happy, get noticed by a boy and besides, she had been dramatically playing out the scene for a long time. And it played just like a movie.Religion becomes more interesting to Layla Jay when a handsome preacher comes to stay at her family's home. Wallace gives Layla Jay his attention until the beautiful Frieda (Layla Jay's mother) waltzes back home. Wallace and Frieda marry and for a brief moment Layla Jay believes she'll have the father she lost to death at age two. She soon learns that Wallace is not as he seems and her mother's childish and reckless behavior places Layla Jay and herself at risk. During this troublesome time, Layla Jay has to deal with her best friend's betrayal and a boy who can't seem to make a decision about who he loves. Ultimately it is an act of love and sacrifice to protect her daughter that places Frieda at risk. It is a lie told by Layla Jay that just might keep her life and that of her mother's from disintegrating.I love Bev Marshall's ability to tell intriguing stories. She mixes a bit of humor with a whole lot of tragedy. She also introduces us to humanity in the form of her rich and complex characters that you hate to say good-bye to when the last page has been read. I can't wait to see what she writes next. And you'd better believe I'll be waiting for its release. And none too patiently I might add.Armchair Interviews says: You'll also enjoy Walking Through Shadows and Right as Rain."},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Blues","review":"Basically, I had nothing in common with Layla Jay's character except that I was a girl, had once been a teenager, have a mother and feared God! This was more than enough to connect to this intensely fascinating story of a wonderfully, interesting family that basically struggles to survive and find a greater understanding of things beyond our control. The characters are interesting, sometimes charming and mostly flawed! This is what makes it a great story because on some levels it is a true reflection of humankind!Great work Bev!"},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Blues","review":"I picked up this book after reading \\"Walking through the Shadows\\" by Bev Marshall. That was a great book, she is such a talented storyteller. However, I must say though, I loved this book more. I will not give away any hints as to what this book is about. There was one point when I felt that if I did not finish the book that I would come apart with worry and angst over Layla Jay's situation. Ms. Marshall really grabbed me with this one and I really, couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Blues","review":"In 1963 at the Pisgah Methodist Church, thirteen years old Layla Jay week after week disappoints her grandma by not accepting Brother Thompson's offer of salvation. Grandma fears that her only grandchild will follow the sinning examples of her husband and her daughter. However when Jehu Albright comes to the church Layla Jay decides to impress this teenage Steve McQueen hunk of a boy by accepting Brother Thompson's prayers.However God answers in mysertious ways as she sees Jehu with another \\"woman\\", her drunken mother marries Brother Wallace Ebert and is in a car accident, and grandma dies. When Ebert starts with twitching her nose and leering at her, but soon tries to rape Layla Jay, her mom intercedes with a 7-Up bottle. Life will never be the same in this household.HOT FUDGE SUNDAE BLUES is more than a historical perspective glimpse of the 1960s in small town Mississippi; although that provides the background, the tale is more a deep family drama that looks closely at love between extended kin in spite of flaws, and deception and dishonesty to hide these defects from loved ones. What makes a loving relationship is not just shared gene pool, but the ability to forgive not necessarily to forget even the biggest transgressions. Bev Marshall provides a powerful perspective of the good, the bad, and the ugly of human interactivity.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Blues","review":"Bev Marshell Spins a story of true 40's and 50's rural southern lifestyle.When reading her books, the reader can feel the humidity and smell the air.

Very good reads and they would make great heart felt movies."},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Blues","review":"This book was a great read, that captured not only my attention, but my heart.I was surprised because when I saw the title-I believed I wouldn't like it at all. Yet, I became captivated by the main character/narrator Layla Jay and her rural family's experiences in Mississippi during the 60's. Eventhough the book is set back in that time frame, the author manages to write a story about a family's struggle,hardtimes and goodtimes-that very well could have been about a family of today.I found some of the stories laugh-out-loud funny, like Pawpa's mishaps with the hen,etc. Then others, like the slimy \\"saved-again\\" stepfather Wallace's actions toward Layla Jay, nearly left me in tears. Very very good book. I want to read more by this author now and I would recommend others to do the same."},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Blues","review":"Bev Marshall's third novel, Hot Fudge Sundae Blues, begins with thirteen year old narrator, Layla Jay faking her own salvation to impress a boy at church.The novel is a coming-of-age story set in the 1960's, in the small town of Zebulon, Mississippi. Layla Jay lives a quiet life on a farm with her mother, Frieda and her grandparents. Her mother marries Wallace, a so-called man of God who turns out to be phony. Frieda doesn't care whether or not Wallace is religious, as a matter of fact, she prefers it when he goes out drinking and dancing with her since she only married him so she and Layla Jay could move away from the farm. Layla Jay is uncomfortable around Wallace, and rightly so. Their lives together, under one roof, throw Layla Jay's world into a tailspin and when a problem arises, Layla Jay finds herself doing two things: praying and lying. Not always in that order, but always praying and lying. She means well, and we know it. Her mother means well and we are forgiving of her as well.The first half of the book is filled with problems that seem somewhat disjointed; however the second half deals with the consequences of choices and the complexities of familial love. Layla Jay talks with God every step of the way, but this novel is not about Layla Jay's relationship with God, it isn't even about her relationship with Wallace even though he is the reason for so many of her problems. This novel is about relationships with those we love-for Layla Jay it is about her grandma who longs to see her family saved by Jesus, her best friend June who harbors an aching secret, her relationship with her fly-by-the-seat-of-her-pants mother, and her first love, a sweet boy named Jehu.In Marshall's first two novels, she made us fall in love with her characters. Once again, Marshall makes us fall in love with Layla Jay and Frieda despite their elaborate lies and poor judgment.Even more, Marshall does what all great story tellers do-she gets you to keep turning the pages. The chapter endings are seamless and filled with questions that force you on to the next chapter, while the tone and pace is strong and steady. The novel is an easy, fairly quick read and the action is not loud. It doesn't have to be. Marshall knows how to pique our curiosity bit by bit without ever insulting our intelligence as readers, and in Hot Fudge Sundae Blues she has done just that.[...]"},{"Title":"Seducing Alicia (Zebra Bouquet)","review":"Alicia Underwood is a scientist developing a bacteria toreverse the effects of radiation She is a woman without a social life.When the women in her department start talking constantly about the luscious new janitor, Alicia tries not to pay too much attention.
