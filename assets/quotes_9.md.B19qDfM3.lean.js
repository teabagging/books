He provides numerous examples as well as detailing the pattern, its reliability and what the pattern means in regards to how trends should react once the pattern is completed.

I very highly recommend this book to any serious investor who wishes to improve his winning percentage through the use of stock charts."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"It is my opinion that William Jiler does a great job explaining technical analysis. Pattern explainations are backed by wonderful chart illustrations. Not only is this book a great tool for understanding technical patterns but Jiler explains why these patterns form. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in technical analysis."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"This book is really a classic. It is a classic because it is so good. It doesn't matter that it was written in the sixties; human nature, fear and greed as reflected in stock prices, is the same now as it was then.This is a good book with ideas clearly spelled out and illustrated. It is a great introduction to charting. In my opinion, more modern authors overly complicate charts. It's really about how many buyers versus sellers there are now and in the recent pass.As will all technical analysis, it is often better in hindsight. But that is like driving using your rear view mirror. By the time you are sure, it is often too late. In both cases, you may end up in a crash.It is very difficult in the heat of trading to have any idea where the market will go. Still, there are some things that help you, such as identifying trends and areas of support and resistance. And I like a few indicators such as MACD and stochastics, but they help time a trade if it continues in the same trend. It is still a crap shoot as to what direction the market will take and change the trend."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"If the current round of corporate accounting fraud hasn't awakened you up to the usefulness of charting, maybe this book will. After having tried a pure fundamental analysis approach in my investing for years, someone finally convinced me to look at charts, which I considered to be the same level as reading tea leaves -- au contraire. After spening the past two years studying technical analysis, I am happy to report that this is one of the better books on the subject, and inexpensive, too. This book, along with websites like TradingMarkets.com, will give you a fantastic basis in technical analysis."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"I have read some TA articles and books before.. but many of them were explaining what would happen when a particular pattern is formed and for me, it was like memorising those patterns. But this book aims to imbibe the basics onto you.. the author gives you the reasons for the expected results eg.. he explained the resistance concept by asking.. how often did you bought a stock, saw that drop down and eagerly waited for the stock to regain the price at which you bought it, so that you can sell the stock with no loss on your part !! I really thought that this was simple logical teaching..The 200 dma behaviour explanations are great !Highly recommendedNB:Given the cost of this, its even more appealing to buy this book"},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"as always AMAZON comes thru finding books of interest for all customer bases. shipping was RAPID as promisedcouldn't ask for more in the way of service, product availability, and delivery!!!!!"},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"Although this book was written some time ago, the basic principles of the use and analysis of stock chart patterns has not changed. The technology has changed and it is even easier now to bring up charts on your computer and search for patterns. I like Jiler's description of patterns particularly when he brings in market psychology to help understand why patterns develop in the first place. I also like the examples he provides at the end of the chapters; real stock chart patters are more sloppy and usually harder to recognize than the \\"ideal\\" pattern.Continue your investing education at my blog HowToStudyFinance .com"},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"As a work in the year 1962, the author with his good writing skill and his lavish but clever use of charts and figures, deserves a salute from all who appreciate the power of TA.However, though market psychology doesnt change, technology and the speed and means of information distribution do, leading to shorter business cycles and thus trends that confirmation of which through &quot;visual only&quot; chart patterns almost always come too late. The situation is even worse in that &quot;traps&quot; in trend following are so frequent in today's highly competitive market when power traders with the help of deteriatives fully exploit the stop loss orders of mass investors.I dont mean to undermine the value of this book. I just wanna say that there are many alternatives that cover TA wider and deeper. This book can be a low cost reference book in chart patterns. It just cannot provide a compeat course on TA without the introduction of other tools like Fibonacci, Moving Average, MACD, Stochastics etc. Afterall, TA is just a tool for money making. There's no point not to take a more productive route to achieve the goal."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"My broker gave me a used hard-back copy of this book in 1981. I still have the book, and he's still my broker. I have probably read it 6 or 8 times, and I use it for reference on a regular basis. Until I discovered that it was not out of print, and was in fact available at Amazon.com, I considered my copy valuable and guarded it as such.I have found it to be a very simple and straight forward explanation of the predictability and repeatability of the behavior of stock traders. I guess a study of traders in financial markets is timeless, as this book is filled with charts of stocks during the late 1950's and early 1960's. Charting patterns and formations haven't changed since then, and probably never will.I attribute most of my investing success to this book, and consider it a must for ALL traders and investors."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"Great book for beginning investors concerned about the TA side investing. I have owned this book for years and still find myself referring back to it on a constant basis. If you follow the market using charts or would like to start then this book is a must. It is extremely informative on the different techniques, formations and patterns to examine when reading charts. It is easy to follow and the examples are very descriptive. It does not get to technical, yet it maintains a clear, concise &amp; knowledgeable approach to the various explanations. This book has unquestionably broadened my horizons &amp; guided my investing success."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"This book is not only an excellent resource for beginner investors, but also a great review and tool for those more experienced. Originally written in the '60's, this book has stood the test of time due to its clarity and usefulness. The explanations are very easy to understand. The best part of this book are the many charts that clearly identify the patterns discussed. The system offers a &quot;sell philosophy&quot; as well, something that most other investment systems and news services do not (effectively) offer. Chapter's 8-11 get a little esoteric, and I recommend them only for those really into Chartology. But don't forget the end of the book, as some of the best material is in Chapters 12-17. His explanation of the 200-day moving average is beautiful. I've given this book to many people as a gift and I keep a copy of it for reference."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"If you want a primer on technical analysis, this is a great way to start.

Obviously, you won't find any discussion of \\"indicators\\" because the book was written in 1962, before computers became mainstream for calculating/applying them.If you ever struggled or passed on reading the Edwards and Magee classic TA book, which is over 800 pages and dry as hell, you'll find Jiler's book to be a much more pleasant and shorter read. It's basically the \\"abridged\\" version which I reference multiple times throughout the years for my own trading.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to incorporate charts for their trading/investment decisions. The focus is on pure price action/patterns/trendlines and an excellent \\"starter\\" book."},{"Title":"How charts can help you in the stock market","review":"This book as absolutely a perfect book to introduce new traders to charting. This book was written in 1961 well before stochastics, Willams%,force index and other new computerized indicators. However it is a great introductions to basic charting concerning resistance levels and support levels and how to read them. You will find explanations for head and shoulders formations, double bottoms, double tops, cup with handle and all the traditional patterns we look for. If you are a beginner read this book to get started. I learned a lot of these patterns on my own and made ten thousands of dollars off understanding when to buy at confirmed support and sell at the first strong sign of resistance.

Coils, wires, spark plugs, distributors, distibutorless systems, inductive ignitions, CD ignitions, multiple-spark systems, computer ignition controls, rev limiters-all are covered for both street and race applications.Author, Todd Ryden, who's day job is working for one of the aftermarket ignition industry leaders, Autotronic Controls Corporation, manufacturer of the well-known \\"MSD\\" brand, leads you through the various systems, subsystems and components, explaining theory behind their operation and how the parts work with each other to provide an accurate, powerful ignition system.In spite of Ryden's employment at Autotronic Controls, the book is not biased towards MSD parts. Components and systems from a fair amount of the aftermarket ignition companies besides the MSD brand, including Crane, Mallory, Electromotive, Performance Distributors, Pertronix and others, are covered in the book. Mr. Ryden is to be complimented for this impartiality.The book's strongest points are its discussions of basic ignition theory and components in the early chapters, its discussion of the advanced-technology ignition products used in high-end racing applications towards the end of the book, its high-quality photography and that it covers a wide range of ignition components from stock, point distributors and inductive ignition to crank-triggers, individual coil racing systems with all sorts of add-ons like multi-step rev limiters, timing controls and window switches.Weaknesses are few. There is not enough coverage of and perhaps even a little confusion about detonation and pre-ignition. In a section on distributor gears, there's no mention of the pressed-on, cast iron distributor drive gears which have made it possible to run roller cams on the street with the durability we've come to expect from flat tappet cams. Lastly, there's little mention of blown fuel and blown alcohol drag racing ignitions. Admittedly, few of this book's readers require that, but it would have been interesting just because of some of the high technology in those kinds of ignition products.Todd Ryden's &lt;u>How to Build High-Performance Ignition Systems&lt;/u> is, well..shocking...in the good job it does in explaining today's high-performance, automotive ignition systems. This book will be a welcome addition to any automotive technical book collection."},{"Title":"How to Build High-Performance Ignition Systems (S-A Design)","review":"Great Book - Ok so I thought I understood how an ignition systems worked and its parts,Decided to buy the book before spending hundreds to upgrade my High Performance Ignition - Looking for some ideas on ignition curve and digital Vs the rest as well as programmable VS the rest.

The author also tells you what you might want for your car and what you don't want due to driving conditions.This book is loaded with information.

I enjoyed so much I purchased the whole series to read about the members in this gifted family.Enjoy reading for yourself, and guess what gift each member has."},{"Title":"Madam President","review":"I've read this book twice now and i adore it. I won't go into details about the actual storyline, see other reviews for one, I'll just tell you how the book made me feel. It made me feel like I feel when I'm in love. It made me feel that I'd somehow opened a window on someone else's world, a world that felt as real as my own. I couldn't put it down. It's a wonderful novel about a true deep abiding love between two women. A warm, funny, touching and wonderful hearwarming story that you just wish could be true. I loved the fact that you weren't presented with sex two pages in... infact there isn't really a full on sex scene in the whole book... that's not to say that I wouldn't have enjoyed some though, but somehow that just wouldn't have been right in this story. That's not to say that there wasn't attraction, there was and plenty of it, but the novel just didn't go the whole way into hot and heavy sex, (there are of course some introductory sex scenes but they are beautifully handled and somehow don't come across as just sex for the sake of it) and I for one thought it was wonderful. It allowed me to use my imagination and to really feel the characters emotions. I loved the way the women started out as stranagers, strangers with a strong attraction but strangers nervertheless. I loved the way the story brought the characters friendship and deep love, the type that we all long for but don't always find. I can't wait for the follow up FIRST LADY which I will buy asap. This story has pride of place on my bookshelf, buy it today and make it yours. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Madam President","review":"I so love the sense of humor in this book. It's so well written that I forgot I was reading about fictional characters and laughing out loud at the most unexpected times.The story was excellent and the supporting characters as well defined as the tow leading ladies.If ever I need an upbeat book with a wee little angst I will grab this off my bookcase.I plan on buying both this book and the sequel First Lady as gifts for friends, I only wish they were available in hardcover.This is a Keeper !"},{"Title":"Madam President","review":"Ok, so this takes place in the future, but it will be historical when we finally have a woman in the white house... Devlyn Marlow is elected as the first female president of the USA. Not only is she a woman, she's an out lesbian too. She hires biographer Lauren Strayer to do her biography. The two women have wildly different political views, Lauren is recently divorced, and Dev's wife was recently killed by a drunk driver. Add all that together and the talented team of Cooper and Novan have delivered a gem.Not only are there many layers of supporting characters, the authors have created two multi-dimensional main characters with real life problems in this book. They have done a great job setting the premise for 'First Lady,' the sequel. At 423 pages, this is a real bargain because it doesn't get boring and the story never drags. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Madam President","review":"While this book and its sequel \\"First Lady\\" may not be filled with the drama or edginess of TV's \\"The West Wing\\"; it does have romance that is set against the backdrop of the White House and the difficulty the demands of presidental responsibility and media attention place upon a relationship.Both books use the technique of chapters representing months of the year and within are contained snapshots of moments; tender, tense, humorous, frustrating, soulful and chilling. They become perfect pearls strung together to provide a necklace filled with all the elements of an evolving and growing relationship. As Devlyn Marlowe must learn to balance her Presidental duties with the needs of her children and her own heart; so must Lauren Strayer, her chosen biographer, come to terms with her own growing admiration and affection for the woman she finds beneath the presidential image.Balancing out this book are a plethora of engaging supporting characters including a pug who has little use for the power of the Presidency. In addition, three precocious children insure that neither woman can ignore the reality and mundane aspects of building a family.I thoroughly enjoyed both books and all the characters warmed my heart. The dialogue and characterizations provided a pleasant read and I was overjoyed to continue their tale in the sequel. If you are looking for believable characters who just happen to call 1600 Pennsylvania Ave home, consider these books."},{"Title":"Madam President","review":"One of the best 'real world' Xena ubers I've read. This novel and its sequel are exciting, romantic, amusing and politically savvy enough for one to be able to accept the possibility as something that could actually transpire.

While it focuses on on Black/white racism has been used, it provides important information about the conditions of all working people since the earliest days of settlement. I found Jones' discussion of attempts to exploit Native Americans as slaves and indentured servants to be particularly illuminated. Jones also talks about the extensive systems of limiting the freedom of working people through contracts of indenture, peonage, and other forms that limited freedom of whites and black as well, as the continued manipulation of the image of what labor Blacks could accomplish to divide workers and deepen the exploitation of all.While I believe Jones' strength is her discussion of the colonial period and the AnteBellum North, her discussion of the selective urbanization and industrialization of African Americans since World War II is outstanding. She shows how the system of defacto segregation and continued discrimination is the based for African American poverty today.Most interestingly, she discusses the similarlity between the ways that current immigrants, with and without papers, are oppressed and colonial systems of binding labor.From this well-documented history, you understand that throughout its history, Capitalism in America has never allowed any real freedom to workers that wasn't taken in struggle, and how crucial racism is to both the past and present of this country."},{"Title":"American Work: Four Centuries of Black and White Labor","review":"BEST BOOK ever written, in my experienced opinion.

For the FIRST time I began to imagine the intellectual ferment that was resulting from the work of the likes of Erasmus Darwin (and the Lunar Society), let alone Charles Darwin. I understood that the Romantics were not simpering sentimentalists, but artists and thinkers who were responding imaginatively to the science of their time (think Mary Shelley and Galvani, John Keats and the study of medicine--etc., etc.). In their awareness of contemporary science, they have much in common with writers today. See also Verlyn Klinkenborg's Timothy; or Notes of an Abject Tortoise (Knopf 2006), a work of imaginative fiction told from the point of view of the tortoise that lived for many years in the garden of Gilbert White, whose journals and letters lead the entries in RNH. Ashton Nichols with his book has revolutionized my own understanding and respect for the Romantics, and has brought them decisively into the modern world. I do not see how schools can ever again teach them in isolation from the understandings are opened up for us here. This book needs to stay in print for a long, long time."},{"Title":"Symbols of the Church","review":"This is a wonderful little guide.

Reichenbach does a nice job of interacting with the historical proponents and critics of this form of argument, and clearly identifies and discusses many of the objections that have been given to it. I think that the last chapter, which is only 10 pages long, is worth reading for anyone who objects to this and the other classical theistic proofs that \\"The entity which this argument concludes exists is not necessarily God.\\"This would give a reader a solid foundation from which to go on and consider some of the more recent criticisms and defenses of this argument."},{"Title":"I Came Back from Bataan","review":"Sgt.

And yes, this book does have layers.To break things down more easily:Plot: Takes so many twists and turns, yet through it all, Last Burn stays focused.Characters: Definitely different than those in nearly every book I've read, shows that books of such a style can succeed with characters more often seen...in prison...or on the covers of the latest gossip magazines.Writing: If only all modern writers had styles as fresh...unfortunately, very few do.All in all, Last Burn in Hell is a must read for fans of bizarro, horror, science fiction, or even beat writers such as Ginsberg and Kerouac. Strangely, it seems to bring all of these together to form a bizarre adventure that also functions, perhaps even more poignantly, as a social satire.Biggest Complaint: I'm not a fan of the overall cover design, but that's as negative as I can get about this book."},{"Title":"LAST BURN IN HELL","review":"Kenrick Brimley (call him \\"Ken\\" or \\"Rick\\" but never \\"Kenrick\\" -- and he's no relation to that other Brimley who \\"eats the oatmeals\\") has a job you didn't hear about at the high school Job Fair. He works at the local women's prison as a sort of conjugal consultant, offering Death Row residents one final night of pleasure before the state kills them. The closest thing he has to a long-term relationship is with Leena, a convicted arsonist whom he has visited multiple times due to the various postponements of her execution.Last Burn in Hell: Director's Cut is a newly expanded edition of the first novel (and reportedly the first of a series) by John Edward Lawson -- publisher, editor, author, and Bram Stoker Award-nominated poet (for The Troublesome Amputee). Just like the special edition DVDs of your favorite films, this book offers deleted scenes, an alternate ending (that lets the reader choose between \\"into the sunset\\" and \\"final confrontation\\" styles), a soundtrack to assemble, promotional stills, and more features that make it a must-have even for those who already have the original edition of Last Burn in Hell.Lawson tells the story as a modern-day pulp-style adventure, with Brimley going from one implausible situation to another in rapid succession (see David Dodge's The Last Match for a good example of the style). We can only sit back and watch as Brimley goes from prison guard to Death Row gigolo, from pop star hanger-on to movie-set masseur, and from the inadvertent next big rap superstar to the inadvertent instigator of a rash of suicides.Brimley's strange adventure itself would be enough to make Last Burn in Hell: Director's Cut a fun read, but the author also satirizes the style and himself in the process: he's quite aware of how unbelievable the whole thing is (and especially how his character is going through all too familiar fictional situations), and embraces it with fervor. But instead of seeming cliched and trite, it all adds up to a skewed kind of originality.A few political statements worm their way into the story, but they're presented with a good deal of humor -- as if to say Don't take me too seriously ... but pay attention! -- that makes them go down easy. John Edward Lawson is very much a man of ideas (one need only read his poetry to understand that), and Last Burn in Hell: Director's Cut shows that not only is he constantly coming up with new ones, but he is also unlikely to run out of them anytime soon.[A final note: Though it would be easy to slap a label on it based on Lawson's prior work (especially his appearance in The Bizarro Starter Kit), don't call this book bizarro. Lawson has used the picaresque method, very familiar to the mainstream, to tell his story, and Last Burn in Hell: Director's Cut is really no stranger than, say, John Irving's early novels. In fact, it would very likely appeal to fans of The World According to Garp, and it deserves that large and diverse audience.]"},{"Title":"LAST BURN IN HELL","review":"Okay--forget for a second that John Edward Lawson is a fantastic writer. Forget that he's assisted in the pioneering of fringe and unusual literature. Forget, too, that his fiction is capable of making you physically recoil in horror one second and eliciting uncontrollable laughter from you the next. For a second, despite all that, let's focus on this book.The story of a gigilo in a women's prison--when it was originally published, it had everything you'd think such a story would have. Here, the \\"Director's Cut,\\" plays out like a special edition DVD, replete with bonus scenes, behind-the-scenes, alternate endings, and even a soundtrack (that probably WON'T play in your CD player). Lawson has taken creativity to a whole new level, insisting that the publishing industry as a whole stand up and take notice. The George Orwell of our time, John Lawson illuminates the new direction of fiction...then punches it square in the face."},{"Title":"LAST BURN IN HELL","review":"You know those crime movies you stumble upon late at night? The ones that were made (you assume) somewhere in the late 1990s? There's lots of action, backstabbing, double crossing, and sex? It's the movies that usually star some B actors you see everywhere but can't name. You know the type. The ones that aren't art films or heavy-handed attempts at making a \\"serious\\" film but rather fun crime romps through the desert, through Mexico, in and out of dangerous situations? Sexy women, strong men, strong women and action. Lots of action. Well... this is what LAST BURN IN HELL is like.. except the plot is warped with a keen sense of weirdness.The feel of the novel reminds me of those films (which I love). Like a cross between TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M., RED ROCK WEST, ... and other such neo-noir films.. except LAST BURN IN HELL (director's cut!) has a sense of humor.. and a sense of the bizarre that'll satisfy fans of the odd, the surreal, and the strange.I won't go into the director's cut angle. Actually, okay, I will. It's a gimmick but a good one. Deleted scenes, alternate ending, and even a soundtrack (well, no, you can't really LISTEN to it but still..).I'm fairly sure that this is John Edward Lawson's first novel. If it is, well, then pat yourself on the back for even considering reading this. It's exciting, funny, weird, and fast-paced. All good ingredients for an entertaining read.PROS:Humor. It's funny.. but not really absurd funny (well, not too much). It takes a lot of shots at pop culture and that makes for some good laughs.Organization. There are little chapters and blurbs here and there (like a top 10 US singles chart.. which ties in later with the story). They're clever and funny.Plot. The story moves along and the reader encounters many different characters in many places. If this was a movie, it'd be one where you wouldn't be bored for a minute.CONS:Confusion. Especially towards the end. I'm guessing that because the author writes a lot of poetry, he may be use to setting the stage using obscure imagery. That works in poetry but in fiction, it can sometimes make it difficult for the reader to figure out just what is really going on. I don't consider myself an unintelligent person but by the end, I wasn't too sure what exactly happened. I get the gist of it.. but there are just some details and events that confused me. Again, some people may not feel this way. Regardless, it shouldn't stop you from buying and reading this book.CONCLUSION:You should read this book. It's fun and entertaining as hell. The fact that it says \\"Director's Cut\\" should clue you in to the fact that it flows like a movie albeit one with some weird twists and turns. The set-up is original; the characters are original and/or humorously based on real-type people.This is a \\"bizarro\\" book that you shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"LAST BURN IN HELL","review":"an extremely original story, funny, sick at times, but ultimately enjoyable...its not great, but definitely worth reading"},{"Title":"LAST BURN IN HELL","review":"\\"John Edward Lawson plays a persona of a chemical=anthropoid's death.\\" - Kenji Siratori, author Blood Electric"},{"Title":"Taking Leave of God","review":"Have you come to a point in your life where you can no longer believe in God? Do you feel like you've wasted most of your life being a devout Christian, though you still believe in the Christian values of love, kindness, compassion and justice? If so, then this is the book for you.Don Cupitt argues that one can be a spiritual Christian without buying into the supernatural claims of the Christian faith. In his brand of Christianity, \\"God\\" is a metaphor, a literary personification that embodies the very best of humanitarian ideals. To say \\"I believe in God\\" is to say, \\"I believe in love, compassion, justice and wisdom\\" - which have always been the attributes of the Christian God anyway.Cupitt views these attributes of God as central to the Christian faith, rather than the actual existence of God himself. To be a devout Christian means to hold these values dear and to even attend church as a means of helping others.\\"Taking Leave of God\\" is not a light read, but worth pondering!Now for some objective criticism of \\"Taking Leave of God.\\" Cupitt's book needs an index. It would be enjoyable, after reading the book as a whole, to be able to go back and find Cupitt's own fascinating spin on various subjects.It also needs a glossary. For example, he repeatedly uses the phrase \\"religious requirement.\\" The reader will be lost if he misses the vital passage where that term is defined.Last, many will say that Cupitt fails to deal with a hallow victory. According to Cupitt, there is no God outside the human mind. Fine. God is the embodiment of human or humanitarian ideals. Fine. But what about the perennial human problem of existential angst? In other words, what about our fear of death? With no God \\"out there\\" to save us, how can we ever transcend the dread that accompanies our demise or of those we love?For most Christians throughout history, the central message of their faith has been that of a God who can reward with salvation because he does in fact exist. \\"He that comes to God must first believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek him.\\" (Hebrews 11:6).I will still give this book a 5 star rating because it is a valiant effort to balance treasured religious ideals with the starkness of contemporary unbelief."},{"Title":"It Happened in Texas (Harlequin Superromance, No. 812)","review":"This one is definitely a keeper. I've re-read it half a dozen times now and know I will continue to enjoy it again and again. It doesn't get old or tired. The hero is a real hunk with enough interesting complexity to keep you wondering. For a guy the heroine suspects of shady dealings, he keeps behaving very unexpectedly. Aside from being heartstoppingly hunky, he has nothing at all in common with the brutal, bodice-ripping, irresistable devils that are such a stereotype in a large segment of the romance genre. (If you are into ripped bodices and graphic sex, folks, look elsewhere!) The heroine is a bit off-puttingly perfect at first, but she grows on you. She's a recent widow struggling to raise her family and keep it together despite increasingly frightening circumstances. The peripheral characters are delightful.

When jet aircraft came on the scene, aircraft with propellers, whether turbine (turboprop) or reciprocating (piston) powered, were seen as aerial antiques, more to be pitied and scorned than admired. These aircraft were flown mostly by small airlines that could not afford jet aircraft, and most of these planes had long lost their once glamorous passenger interiors, their insides stripped clean to make room for whatever cargo could or would pass through their doors. Freight dogs, they were called, and they were relegated to the inaccessible peripheries of the airfields, that is assuming there was actually an airfield. These aeronautical geezers, those that were not either in a museum or on a scrapheap, were objects of curiosity and scorn. Surely, nobody still flies around in one of those....In the early and mid-1980s, however, this started to change. Those airplane enthusiasts who appreciated these stalwart survivors over the newest, shiniest jetliner, realized that their objects of admiration were starting to disappear; after all, these machines were built in the 1940s and 1950s (some were even World War II veterans!) and had already had lifespans twice that of the first generation of jetliners. Foremost among these people was Stephen Piercey, an Englishman who traveled the world to photograph and occasionally hitch a ride in one of these aerial steam trampers. In parts of Africa and South America, the airplane was the only way to transport goods to and from remote places, and those sturdy old propeller-driven aircraft were the only ones strong enough to land on short, unpaved airstrips in hot or high-altitude climates. Mr. Piercy, a true aircraft lover, held enormous respect for these battered old planes and the enterprising people who used tremendous ingenuity to keep them in the air. He documented his experiences and spectacular slides in Sky Truck and Sky Truck II (the latter volume having been published posthumously, after Mr. Piercey was killed in a plane crash). The books, though published in the 1980s and long out of print, have become cult items among a new breed of airliner hobbyist, the propliner enthusiast. The magazine he founded, Propliner, is still in print and is a highly respected aviation journal.Having died very young, Stephen Piercey inspired many other aviation writers and photographers. Austin Brown and Mark Wagner are among his most devoted disciples, and they continued the tradition in 1987 with \\"Big Props.\\" Though the authors did not make the arduous treks Piercey made, Brown and Wagner did travel to find their own propeller-driven aircraft, again focusing on those examples that managed to remain in service after so many years. The most enjoyable and historic section of this book is in the first chapter, \\"The Wings of the Dragon,\\" in which the authors traveled throughout mainland China to find and experience non-Western types. Now it is important to bear in mind the book's date of publication; we have a snapshot of part of the world behind the Iron Curtain, where Communism still reigned supreme. By far, the most interesting is the CAAC Ilyushin Il-14 and their Chinese military transport comrades; the machine pictured in this book had a military-style paratrooper seating arrangement along the aircraft walls, albeit with the luxury of carpeting and soundproofing. Particularly enjoyable are the scenes of the cabin and out the window. The twin-engine piston airliner, similar to the Convair 240/340/440, is long out of service, a mere handful surviving as museum pieces. The chapter on \\"The Great Dragon\\" is rounded out nicely by pictures of several Lisunov Li-2s (Soviet license-built DC-3s), an Antonov An-12 (a turboprop freighter analogous to the Lockheed Hercules) and an An-24 (the rough counterpart to a Fokker F-27 or Handley-Page Dart Herald), several Illyushin Il-18 turboprop airliners (the equivalent of the British Viscount or Vanguard, or the US Lockheed Electra), and newly imported Tupolev Tu-154 and Hawker-Siddeley Trident jetliners, not to mention the airport scenes whose shops catered to foreign tourists and privileged locals who were Communist Party members. It was very different and strange world, indeed, one that was to disappear only four years later, when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down.The next chapter moves into the more familiar territory of turboprop aircraft, where the reader can sample the likes of the Bristol Britannia, Vickers Viscount and Vanguard, Canadair Cl-44, and Lockheed Electra. Amazingly, some of these airplanes were still carrying passengers on scheduled routes in Europe and North America.Convair twins, the 240/340/440s, along with those airframes retrofitted with Allison or Rolls-Royce turboprops, are the subject of the third chapter. Again, many of these machines were flying passengers in the Western world, but not for much longer. The chapter that follows, \\"Heavy Recips,\\" is when we get into the area that Stephen Piercey brought to our attention. Some were still flying since Mr. Piercey's book, but their numbers were already dwindling. Most of these planes are now gone, at least having been documented in books such as this. The picture for the DC-3, however, is much brighter. This fifth chapter celebrates the 50th (plus) anniversary of the beloved Gooney Bird. Some people may say that this chapter is out of place in this book. Perhaps it is. Then again, who is to complain about color pictures of the beautiful DC-3?The final chapter, \\"Water World,\\" presents flying boats, those seaplanes whose fuselages are also hulls. Most flying boats were obsolete at the end of World War II, when the many new concrete runways built for land-based transports as part of the War effort made landplanes such as the DC-4 and Lockheed L-049/749 Constellation much more economical to operate. In fact, at the end of the war, Pan American had no interest in having its famed Boeing 314 Clippers back and sold the fleet to secondary carriers and the scrap man. None of these magnificent aircraft survive. Nevertheless, flying boats did find their niches, ranging from the large Short Sandringham/Sunderland in New Zealand and the Caribbean to the Convair Catalina and Grumman Albatross and Mallard flying short hops from Florida to the Bahamas and other Caribbean destinations. This short last chapter is a treat, as even these birds have been sold to museums or melted down into aluminum ingots.So, once again, we have a snapshot of the decline and, in some cases, extinction of piston and turboprop aircraft. Maybe those who prefer the latest technology could not care less, but for those of us who love and treasure these old airplanes, this book at least gives us some beautiful pictures to remember them by."},{"Title":"Indian boyhood","review":"This is a most excellent book because it is \\"AUTHENTIC\\" and not one that speaks of prejudice and the horrors of the Native American experience; instead, it allows you to catch a glimpse of what is now lost, a world of beauty and wonder.

But by the time he was a teenager, his father was released from jail, and he went to Canada to reclaim his son. The boy went to American jails and ultimately was graduated from Dartmouth College as a physician. He went through a period in his life in which he wrote a series of books about the Lakota way of life, in which he explains values, belief systems, and the lifestyle he experienced as a child. Today, unfortunately, due to government imposed boarding schools during the first part of the 20th Century, this became a lost way of life and thought.Ohiyesa's books are treasures for the soul. They are simple, spare, Spartan even, and beautiful. Above all, they are honest. And in their direct, one-to-one description of how humans lived so simply with nature, they are inspiring and spiritual.Ohiyesa's books should be required reading for students of literature, sociology, American history, philosophy, and psychology. They are not written to lament the plight of a people. But dignifying the elegant ways of a tribe -- simply by recording it as it was -- creates and understanding. And once you understand, you cannot help but mourn for the natural and simple ways that were."},{"Title":"Indian boyhood","review":"I love biographic styles from 1850 era on up to the 1900,s This is one of the best I ever read.Not only will it hold your interest ,but you do feel like you are there .I think the American Plains Indian was treated very badly because of a lack of understanding their ways & values.We can all learn from this book (especially today) how wrong we can be .Anyone interested in opening up there mind to things we can do better should read this book."},{"Title":"Indian boyhood","review":"Let me open up to a page in Indian Boyhood and let you sample some of this marvelous writing.\\"The boy came rushing into the lodge, followed by his dog Ohitika who was wagging his tail promiscuously, as if to say: \\"Master and I are really hunters!' \\"(102) From the chapter, \\"Hakadah's First Offering\\".

By the end I was just reading to finish the book; I cared not a whit what was happening, at least until the last two pages. (More on that later.)The thing that made it become boring for me was that Kitty became the lady Hugh and Susan tried to make her into. She lost what made her fun to read about: her lack of education in both proper behaviour and book-learning. Saint Kitty who helps all the poor children wouldn't have been so dull to read about if she still had a touch of the street in her when she set about bestowing schools upon her people. The Kitty who snatched away groceries to throw them to beggars is a far cry from the Kitty who ended child labor, and I mean that in a bad way.Then, as if boredom wasn't bad enough, there's the self-hatred that changed Kitty from someone who could marry an old fogey duke for money and title to a woman who believes she isn't good enough to marry a lord so instead becomes his mistress. The man would've married her but she decided she wasn't worthy, seeing as she was born a nobody. How sad. The spirit within her has died-- education complete.

The mother is trying to get all the animals to be quiet as her young child is sleeping. The fun part, though, is how the young child is awake and playing the whole time, an ongoing joke that children love. At the end of the book, the mother and all the animals are asleep while the child is happily (and safely) awake. A really fun read for both parent and child, colorfully illustrated. You'll have fun trying to make the animal sounds. Whenever I need to buy a baby book for a friend, this is my first choice."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"Love the story and most of all the rhythm of the story for night time. My 2 1/2 year old particularly loves it and loves saying... \\"Hush\\" with me. My 4 year old also enjoys. Good length for quick night time story that is on topical and unique. My sons love the way it ends too."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"I borrowed this book from the library and when we got to the Mother chiding the elephant for waking her baby my little girl cracked up laughing. Later when I went over the books we read that night while tucking her in, she laughed just at the mention of the mother and the animals and then she begged me to read it again tonight. It is fun to read because you can put a little method acting into the begging the mother does, please don't wake my child!"},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"This story is part of our Kindergarten curriculum. It's an adorable story about a mother trying to quiet the animals because she thinks her baby is napping. Young readers get such a kick from watching the baby crawl out of his bed and walk around in the background of the pictures. Momma never knows that her baby was awake the whole time. This story shows children that people in other countries live in different types of homes but that children, no matter where they live, behave the same. The text of this story is repetitive which allows young readers to \\"read\\" along."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"A Thai mother hushes all the noisy insects and animals so that they won't wake her baby. A mosquito, a lizard, a cat, a mouse, a frog, a pig, a duck, a monkey, an old water buffalo and a great big elephant all quiet down and go to sleep, until the only one awake is......Baby! This Caldecott Honor book is a lovely bedtime story."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"Beautiful illustrations, I got this book for a friend of mine from Thailand who just had a baby. She had so many memories that now she can share with her baby girl. My kids (4 yr. old B/G twins) love the book. They thought it was very funny."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"Got this for my nephew for Christmas. A really nice Caldecott book, worth getting in the sturdy library binding to last in little hands. Excellent for sharing Thai heritage."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"I enjoy exposing my children to different cultures. This book is a simple and wonderful way to show children life in a small village in Thailand. A mother is trying to put her baby to sleep. The indigenous animals make noise, and the mother hushes each of them.There is onomatopoeia as each animal makes its own unique sound. The rhymes flow soothingly, and the repetitive phrases let the kids participate in the \\"reading\\" of the book.My only criticism is that some of the animal noises are not very soothing if the book is being used as a bedtime story. As the book progresses (and the children get sleepier), the animals become progressively louder. The book does end on a calming note, but sometimes my kids get worked up by the animal sounds, and the bedtime story has the opposite affect."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"My 22 month old son loves many books, but this one has been a stand-out since the first read. He keeps asking for it \\"again\\" at the ending and has started to take it to bed with him. I was initially surprised, but now I also love the rhythmic pace and gentle story."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"My husband is from Thailand and we were having a hard time finding books that were for children with Thai themes. This was perfect. Our 1 year old son enjoys the colorful pages and the story is just the right length. I actually enjoy all childrens books by this author."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"The little ones I read this to absolutely delight in the gentle, rolling rhythms of Hush! It's become a pre-nap favorite in their house."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"I bought this book for my little grandbaby on his lst birthday .. I wanted to start building up his \\"library\\", and I found this title under a listing of Caldecott Award winners. The colors are wonderful, as are the graphics. The story is very sweet and something every parent can appreciate. I only wish this book was available in a more hard-bound format. I can see how little fingers can (and probably will) be too hard on the pages."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"Beautifully written and illustrated!The mother hushes the animals in a lilting rhyme, as my 18 month old son likes to point out the little boy in the background who isn't actually sleeping! He laughs every page, especially at the finale, when all is peaceful except for the wide-eyed baby!An added bonus is that my son now thinks it great to \\"Hush!\\" everyone when the situation calls for it! It keeps him quiet too! I will be purchasing her other book, \\"Peek...\\", as this one is my son's absolute favorite bedtime/naptime story!"},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"My 19 month old daughter loves this book, especially the beautiful illustrations. Although there are too many words per page for her age - or perhaps her attention span! - this is a book that will grow with your child."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"I have circle time with 24 four year olds. It is challenging to find books that can keep them all captivated and this definitely filled the bill. The illustrations are bold enough for a large group and the prose kept them hanging on each word. It was an interesting and gentle glimpse into another culture. The children could identify with the need to be quiet for the baby."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"Your children will love this story. It nicely introduces children to Thailand without boring them with facts, instead the story is wonderfully rhythmic and teaches animal sounds as it will lull your child into gentle sleep. It's Our Favorite!"},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"A nice, simple little book . . . but my almost-4 year old was bored the first time through because of the heavy repetition. It would have been great before he turned 3, but not afterwards."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"I don't think you can truly understand the undercurrent of panic that runs beneath, \\"Hush: A Thai Lullaby\\" unless you've taken care of a sleeping baby sometime in your past. There comes a time when that sweet moment of pure uninterrupted silence is so golden, so impermanent and yet perfect, that you would gladly have conversations with any number of mosquitoes, mice, or monkeys just to sustain it. Such is the slightly panicked and oh-so-slightly fevered current of feeling running beneath Minfong Ho's 1997 Caldecott Honor winner. We've all read our share of lullaby books. Now let's read one that brings a share of interesting animals, rhythmic lyrics, and beautiful illustrations as well as a cultural background based in Thailand. Sound lovely? It is.A Thai mother has just placed her sleeping child in a comfy hammock when she hears a mosquito crying in the wind. Softly, the mother whispers, \\"Mosquito, mosquito, don't come weeping. Can't you see that Baby's sleeping? Mosquito, mosquito, don't you cry, my baby's sleeping right nearby\\". Apparently this method of skeeter removal works, since we never hear from that bug again. But as soon as one critter quiets, another starts up a new racket. With the mosquito silent, a lizard pipes up. Then a cat, then a mouse, then a frog, then a pig, then a ... you get the picture. Each time someone new gives a cry, the mama sings her baby tune, unaware that her child has used her distraction to explore some parts of the house. By the end everyone is quiet and the mama is dozing as well. \\"Only Baby's wide awake, his eyes bright and round\\".There are a couple nice little details in this work. First of all, I loved the new interpretations of animal sounds. Schoolchildren are usually taught that pigs say, \\"oink oink\\". How much more interesting (and accurate), therefore, to have them say, \\"uut-uut, uut-uut\\". There's also the sense that the animals featured in this book are just your average everyday backyard creatures. This may be true in Thailand, where water buffalos and elephants aren't strangers, but for Western children such thoughts are intoxicating. Certainly there aren't that many Thai picture books out there, so it's nice to see such a rhythmic beauty as this gain a little spotlight. The words are actually the biggest draw to this tale. This isn't to say that artist Holly Meade has done a poor job. Her rambling toddler provides much of the fun in this book. It's just that if you're looking for cut-paper picture books you may be better off with the talents of David Wisniewski or Ed Young if you're hoping to be bowled over.Obviously if you're a fan of \\"Hush!\\" then you should probably find Minfong Ho's follow up picture book, \\"Peek!: A Thai Hide and Seek\\". For those amongst you willing to make this a regular bedtime tale, the story is a wonderful sleepyheaded affair. Definitely consider pairing it with fellow tiptoe picture book, \\"Bear Snores On\\", by Karma Wilson."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"Whenever we sit down in the nursery rocker, my daughter points emphatically at the bookshelf and says, \\"Huss! Huss!\\" This is her favorite book, at bedtime and during the day, and it has been for many months.The highly original artwork is colorful (in a warm restricted palette sort of way) and captivating, showing scenes from varying angles and, despite it's simplicity, captures the expressions on the mother's face perfectly. The rhythm of the text is almost hypnotic. The animal sounds and pictures are very educational for a toddler, and my little one laughs at the baby in the story as he climbs out of bed and does his antics in the background, the mother unawares. My girl loves to find all the animals in the picture near the end of the book after the mother has convinced them all to, \\"Hush!\\" And she kisses the pages with her favorite animals, like the cat and the mouse, and even the pig!The pictures convey the feel of the hot Thai evening and transport us to a world quite foreign to most, and are a whole lot of fun. The text is lulling or exciting, depending on how we read it. I absolutely recommend this book and so does my 16-month-old daughter."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"A small children's book about a Thai mother who goes around asking all of the animals to be quiet since her baby is sleeping. The book was illustrated by Holly Meade and it was a 1997 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. Children will enjoy the book because of the antics of the baby, at how familiar mothers are from culture to culture, and seeing the world of a remote village in Thailand."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"\\"Hush! Elephant, elephant, don't come shrieking, can't you see that baby's sleeping? Elephant, elephant, don't you cry, my baby's sleeping right near by.\\" And so the Thai mom refrains through an elephant, monkey, cat, mouse, lizard, water buffalo, duck, etc. Wonderful illustrations in earth tones. We enjoy having other cultures as primary characters in our books, so the combination of characters, simple story and beautiful illustrations makes this one of our favorites and a common gift to our friends' toddlers."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"This picture book has a vivid collage pictures which accents the wonderful story. It has a great story line that almost any child can relate to. Pre-school - 2nd grade could greatly benefit from this book, discussing everything from animals to Thai. The multiculture ideas run wild in this book and leave doors open for children to explore and discover."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"My kindergartener, who can read, loved this book. She loved the rhyme for each animal: \\"Hush! who's that peeping? can't you see that baby's sleeping? ... don't you cry, baby's sleeping right nearby\\" because she could join in. It was also easy enough for her to read. I heard her repeating it in the car for several days afterward. I enjoyed it too. Great for diverse classrooms and parents of children adopted from Asia."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"&quot;Hush! A Thai Lullaby&quot; is a collaboration between writer Minfong Ho and illustrator Holly Meade. In this book, a mother tells various animals (a mosquito, a lizard, a monkey, etc.) to be quiet so that her baby can sleep. The book has a funny surprise ending.This book is absolutely delightful. Meade's illustrations are created from cut paper and ink; these pictures are charming and colorful, and complement the text perfectly."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"My seven month old loves this story. It is beautifully illustrated, rhythmic, and thoroughly enjoyable. A nice addition to baby's library."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"This is a terrific little book. My son loves the repetition, and he searches for the baby on each page, and for all the animals on the final page. We have to read it to him at least once or twice a night, and he has also started turning the pages and \\"reading\\" it to us."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"I recently purchased this book for my 2 1/2 year old son. The repetition is wonderful for their absorbent memories. He reads along with me and even uses her ideas for animal sounds (ie..elephant says, 'hmmm-praaa'). I've heard him copying her animal sounds while playing. We begin this book in a very quite tone and by the time the mother has reached the elephant... she and we are shouting in exasperation for the elephant to be quiet. My son laughing the entire time that the baby ISN'T sleeping. We love this book... I wish I had found it sooner. I recommend this with no reservations."},{"Title":"Hush! A Thai Lullaby","review":"This is one of the few perfect books, perfect diction, few words as possible, using each word carefully and effectively to create a simple but strong story.Not a book that is nice to have, but an indispensable necessary book. It's so special!"},{"Title":"Freehand: The Art of Stanley Mouse","review":"This 118-page trade paperback is a fair introduction to the work of Stanley \\"Mouse\\" Miller, best-known for the series of rock posters he and collaborator Alton Kelley created for the San Francisco music hall scene between 1966 and 1968. Like similar books, this one has comments and reminiscences from famous names who worked with the artist, like Bill Graham, Chet Helms, and... Howard Hessman? plus a brief forward by Mickey Hart. Mouse himself provides a brief chatty reminiscence of his life from 1956 to about 1972. A longer (9 page) bio/art review is provided by Walter Medeiros, a San Francisco historian of the rock poster movement, but this too peters out sometime in the '70s. However there's a fair amount of art here, mainly from the '60s (48 posters, plus some early '60s hot rod t-shirts) but with a good bit of '70s album cover work (30 plus Grateful Dead portraits) plus some posters and gallery art from the 1980s and early '90s.I was disappointed by this book. IMHO the longer (127 page) book \\"Mouse and Kelley\\" did a better job by focussing on the entire collaborative period with Kelley from 1966 through 1980. This book presents much of that art but doesn't discuss it. In fact there's only really a little bit about Mouse's life here, almost entirely in the 1960s. Medeiros is only incidentally concerned with the album work, so the reader is left guessing vaguely that Mouse has been an artist in the Sante Fe art scene (he lives in Sonora) since sometime in the early '80s. I think that period deserves discussion. But the book, published in 1992 (before the deaths of Graham and Helms), neither addresses that, nor why Mouse left Marin County, nor why the collaboration with Kelley ended, nor why Monster Studios closed in 1976...I'd still recommend this book to anyone interested in the artist, but it's a long way from being a definitive catalogue!"},{"Title":"Freehand: The Art of Stanley Mouse","review":"This book reflects on Stanley's artwork both in the rock and roll arena as well as work he has performed in other areas. Some of his best unknown works are present here, and if you like Stanley's work, then this book is for you! A definitive catalog of greatness!"},{"Title":"Freehand: The Art of Stanley Mouse","review":"I bought this for my husband who grew up in the sixties. He loves the Dead, Airplane, Janis etc. He mentioned these guys' name, (I thought he made it up) so I did some research. I was amazed to find this book. My husband was so surprised!!! It was in great shape, &#34;signed&#34; and packaged very well. Very pleased."},{"Title":"Freehand: The Art of Stanley Mouse","review":"Mouse and keely helped define by late childhood when I lived in San Francisco and saw thweir posters all over the City. This book provides many engaging images and provides a glimpse at a magical time. Mouse draftsmanship and Kelley's taste helped create iconic images. Get this book used while you can.Another great book is \\"Mouse and Kelley\\" - both out of print, but you can buy used at Amazon.To see images of 1960s Mouse's posters go to [...]Peace."},{"Title":"The history of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia (Barron's educational series)","review":"May be a slow read, but I was amazed at each paragraph...

Very helpful information I would definately reccomend this book to others."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this book doesn't contain much instruction on how to become organized. It does, however, it lived up to what I've come to expect from Martha Stewart publications in the way of gorgeously photographed spaces.

If, on the other hand, you just need some good inspiration (which is something I'm always looking for), this is a great book."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Martha Stewart's cornered the market on organization.

Great book for brides!"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I don't know why but I don't feel comfortable with this woman and I don't have any background with her, since I come from France. I bought this book for $1 in a Japanese bookshop, just by curiosity, and I read it carefully.I must admit there are smart and simple ideas. The pictures are beautiful and it is well explained.I, of course, don't have such big houses as she has, but her ideas are useful even for small spaces. Nevertheless, she doesn't look more sympathetic to me now, because we don't really connect with her through her books, probably most of the ideas are found by a staff of very qualified people working for her, but it still remains interesting, neat, nice, smart, useful, elegant, convenient.I will keep this book for sure. I am surprised myself to love it, but I do."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"This book is great. It gives you so many practical ideas.

Many of the ideas are just common sense, but things I would not have thought of on my own. I had quite a few &quot;ah-ha&quot; moments while reading this book.I have used several of the ideas: for the broom closet, the office, the garage, and for folding those darn fitted sheets that always end up in a ball, it seems.I loved the picture wall, the fold-out windowsill, the armoire converted into an office, the herb &quot;pantry&quot;, and the spice drawers.Now if Martha would just send someone over to make all these things for me!"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Ingenious ways to organize just about every part of your house and inspiring photos of that oh-so-Martha style make this book a must have for any Martha fan or compulsive neat-nick. However, for those looking for a all-out guide to organizing, this book is more fluff than stuff. While you do get to see a lot of the ideas, the pictures limit the amount of space for instructions and tips. Most, if not all, of the ideas come from her magazine, so for those of us stock-piling issues and issues of it, this book provides a to-the-point compilation. Mostly useful for inspiration and as a visual guide, look elsewhere for much more. Not as lengthy as I might have liked--- I hope Martha comes out with a more comprehensive guide in the future. I'd recommend this to fans of the Martha style only."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"This is a wonderful book. Before this book, my life at home was out of order and everything was a mess. After reading this book, I had a host of ideas to help me organize my food pantry and bathroom, etc, etc. My life is now more orderly and much simpler at home. My home has become a more pleasant place to spend time. Keeping my home in order after all these changes requires virtually no maintenance. Martha's ideas were of VERY little cost if it cost me anything at all.I discovered that I could use things that I already had around my house. I found new and more practical uses for literally 100's of objects in my home. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a little organizing in their lives.WAY TO GO MARTHA!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"This book is a good resource/ inspiration for people who want to get organized with their living space. Each chapter shows examples of how to deal with a specific organizing problem. The solutions are effective as well as the charming looks.

I'm still scrambling to get my paperwork filed anywhere out of sight, a meal on the table on time and my laundry put away. I see the projects in this book as the icing on the cake of a very organized home inhabited by a type A personality (Martha).

I just wish it were a little more practical."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I like Martha's &quot;Good things&quot; series, and this book is worth its price. When mine arrived I put four or five ideas into practice immediately--that night. I have since looked to it for additional inspiration and will continue to do so for years to come. Martha is not everything to everybody, and you just pick what you like to use and leave the rest of the ideas for someone else to use. In my case, this book REALLY hit the spot, as did the first &quot;Good things,&quot; which I have also used repeatedly."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"This is a great organising reference. I was sceptical at first as I thought it may be a little dated however I was surprised - Martha provides timeless organisational ideas that inspire.In a world where we are constantly being shown modern, minimalist homes filled with nothing it was refreshing to see homes that actually had 'stuff' - all be it well organised stuff. The section on the Baby Armoire was a little dishartening, primarily because it seems impossible to have the time to make painted bins and cotton pique bags when you have a 6month-old. However, it was lovely to look at and inspiring all the same.If anything, this is a great book (more magazine-like in format and style) and reference and it has some nifty ideas for storage solutions and general organisation. The section on kitchens was of most use, the section on home office and photo storage perhaps the most 'dated'. It reads more like a collection of organisational solutions and styles from a Martha magazine rather than a purpose designed book.Only fault is that it is perhaps not long enough nor in-depth enough. But in saying this it is a great gift for those needing organisational inspiration.Oh ... how wonderful it would be to have MS come and organise my house!"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"First I have to say that I find this book very visually appealing and some of the solutions were great springboards to organize solutions in my home. Also the idea of organizing *as design* is very appealing...The problem I have is that, for me, not alot of the actual solutions are applicable in my home. Many solutions count on containers, cubbies and storage where things remain unseen and stored..for me..in an inaccessable manner.I like the idea that the items are unseen in a way but i find that unseen clutter does not get dealt with. And just breeds more clutter.There has to be a balance between visual asthetics and order for an organizing solution to work in my home. It can be beautifully attractive but if it doesn't *work* in the sense of a long term clutter solution ultimately it will not matter how lovely it is. I was able to look through this book, and continue to do so, to search for ideas that I can turn into reasonable solutions but the solutions themselves offered in this book wouldn't work for me."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"As most of Martha's books this one is useful, beautifully photographed and full of ideas! It is divided in sections relating to parts of the house (kitchen, bathroom, garage etc.). If you are an organised freak and love to see rooms where everything has its place and if you think that well folded blankets or a nice row of storage bottles are a beautiful sight then this book is for you! I love this book!"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I'm a self diagnosed magazine junkie. If you're like me, this book is for you. It's like a heavy duty well laid out magazine without the ads. Awesome!If you're more of a text-book reader then Martha's Housekeeping Handbook... which I also love... is right up your alley.Oh and by the way... I'm sort of lukewarm to Martha in general, so I don't give rave reviews based on my affection for her!"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Although nicely set out and photographed nicely ... i do believe i only saw about a dozen new ideas ... less that I can use ...in a book with 140 odd pages"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I enjoy this book as it is packed with crisp, self-explanatory photographs that fire my disorganization conquering imagination. Since my initial perusal, I've picked this book up dozens of times to spark more ideas for organizing my home. However, in my opinion, this is not a \\"D.I.Y. 101\\" book. If you do not already have at least a little D.I.Y. savvy, or if you prefer long, detailed instructions, then this is probably not the book for you. I think the purpose of this book is simply to give readers ideas to build on in a simple way. It is exactly what I was looking for. There are so many visual suggestions on how to handle those pesky, household clutter problems such as the linen closet, medicine cabinet and home-office desk. Thanks to Martha Stewart, I finally learned how to fold fitted sheets NEATLY and how to banish the seemingly endless tangle of computer wires on my desk (I was convinced they were ganging up and tangling themselves on purpose while I was not looking). It only cost me a buck to get the wires under control - I'm stoked! My only complaint about this book is that I want more of it but that's only because I always want more of a good thing. I think I made a pun. I wonder if anyone will notice?"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Although we can all aspire to Martha's level, few of us will ever get there. Dispite this fact the information in Good Things for Organising there are definately simple, easy suggestions to put in place in your home and work life almost immediately.Besides, if I never apply all of the suggestions in this book, it is still beautifully photographed and wonderful to dream about having a house as wonderfully organised as Martha.Although Martha's concepts are focussed on the American lifestyle, being in Australia it is still easy to adapt certain ideas so definately worth while."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Not a particular Martha Stewart fan, I nevertheless love this book which I purchased while living in Europe. I offers some great advice on basic organising such as ironing, folding and hanging clothes or sheets as well as some wonderful decorating and organising ideas at the same time. Thanks to the reference pages, I was actually able to contact several companies (in the US) and have items (seen in the book) delivered to Europe. Not many books offer such reference lists! I have now had the book for some a few years but whenever I look at it I get some new ideas. I would suggest it is for the organised person wanting to improve the looks and decorative side of organised life."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I bought this book and tried it but did not like it. There are better books. Try Conquering Chronic Disorganization by Judith Kolberg. I really liked that book and it solved many of my problems."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I found this book motivating and inspiring. Having been a home maker for 40 years some of the things outlined were familiar, however the clutter that accummulates over the years can sometimes get on top of you and the motivation to sort it out becomes too much. Once started on the process of organizing cupboards etc. and doing this methodically from room to room (only way to manage such a great task), I find that now I am in control of the situation and not overcome with wondering where I put a particular item. I have been able to discard many of the trappings that may be of some use at a later date and have never and will never be used again. I have now a fresh outlook and motivation to conquer the task at hand. This book has changed my home and I thank the Oprah show for featuring Martha Stewart along with this particular book."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"This is not your average 'get organized' book. While the pictures wow you, the text (unlike in many decor books) is incredibly helpful and a must read for any Martha fan. It should be noted that this is a compilation of the best of Martha's ideas from her \\"Living\\" magazine. Rather than clip pages, Martha has gathered the best of the best together in one beautiful book.I've utilized many of these storage and organization ideas in my own home with resounding success. It's often tempting to just toss everything in bins and stack it away, but the joy in this book comes from Martha's lack of fear in showing off your items while storing them. Not only does that make your goodies easier to find and snag when needed, but her solutions are stylish as well. The focus of this book is on tackling smaller storage and organization issues so the reader should bear that in mind.Homemaking is an art. It's a constant undertaking that must be embraced in order to achieve a comfortable, serene environment. This book is not for those that want a quick, unimaginative fix..but instead is geared towards those who embrace creativity in every possible form and would take what could be ordinary..and make it extraordinary. Those who aren't willing to put in the effort would do best to seek a blue-light special on plastic bins in Isle 5."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I love Martha and think she has some fabulous ideas on how to clean up the clutter in your life! However, I completely agree that the ideas in this book are almost entirely made of up of ideas from past Martha Stewart Living magazines. If you really feel like you need these Good Things in one place to organize yourself, then buy this book. Otherwise, just skim through your old issues."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"I got this book a while ago and I really love it. The suggestions are useful and very practical. Thanks to this book I now fold fitted sheets properly, which is a big drawer-space-saver. The photos are very helpful and the text is appropriate and addresses what is shown in the pictures/illustrations. I actually read the book from cover to cover, and found it very pleasant besides being informative. My mother-in-law is in the process of organizing her closets and she has asked to borrow this book again from me. I should probably get her her own copy...My final point is that this is a great buy and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Great book - inspired organizationat tips. Would buy again or give as a gift."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"My husband couldn't stop laughing when he saw me reading this book - I'm the most hopelessly untidy person he knows. \\"Aren't you trying to run before you can walk? Why don't you start by putting away the ironing?\\" he asked.Well, doh!How can he possibly expect me to put away the ironing until I have a beautiful Martha-style linen closet, complete with dividers, cross-referenced labels on both sheets and shelves, and two different paint effects?How can I possibly pay bills on time until I have a dedicated home office cunningly concealed inside an antique Dutch armoire?How can I possibly tidy my unsteady piles of magazines until I have covered my plywood Ikea magazine files in linen bookcloth and added a sashpull for ease of manoeuvrability?Laugh all you like, husband dear, but I am completely in love with this book. Whenever I feel overwhelmed by the chaos of my life, I open the pages of this book, catch a glimpse of Martha's superhuman home-making efforts, and know that, provided I follow her example, one day I too will have a bureau solely dedicated to giftwrapping and 23 towels in my guest bathroom.Okay, getting the tongue out of my cheek for a second, this book is a little too much for all but the most obsessive-compulsive, but sometimes it is really truly lovely to live vicariously through Martha Stewart.There are plenty of useful tips in this book, and lots of lovely - and cheap - decoration ideas (who knew a lick of eau-de-nil paint on an old wooden crate could have such a magical effect?) Under Martha's organisational influence, I have finally put away my ironing (now in little colour coded piles, get me); bought a Dymo label machine; and filed six years' worth of bank statements in date order (this last little habit of Martha's must have made the police's job considerably easier when they arrested her for fraud). Hell, I have even googled \\"bookcloth\\" and where to buy it (Falkiner Fine Papers in London's Charing Cross, if anyone's interested, and they do mail order).If you are chronically messy, this book isn't going to change everything, but it might just inspire you to tidy up, adopt a few good habits, and make your world a little bit nicer."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Martha has done it again. As a fellow lover of all things domestic, I am enamored by Martha Stewart's genius. She an asset to this great country of ours, an important figure and role model ranking up with Jackie Kennedy and Henry Ford. However, this book is one of the best. It deserves more than 5 stars.There is a slob in each of us, but in this book, Martha shows us how to tame this inner beast. Drawing on her previous endevors, she combines all of her best things in a wonderful book of Good Things. It is a godsend for any homeowner, large or small.A life without a cluttered mess, is a life that is lived best. Martha has given me the freedom to pursue success in all that I do. Thank you Martha for taming my inner beast.This is a book that will look nice on your neatly organized, refinished bookshelf."},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"My wife bought this book, so i decided to give it a shot. What I decided was that it was a waste of my time, and my wife's(my) money. Most of these ideas have been seen before. I think Martha is a very talented and gifted personality. I just think she's underachieving!"},{"Title":"Good Things for Organizing (Good Things With Martha Stewart Living)","review":"Nice but I wanted more flexible ways than just Martha's AND should I be disappointed?? NO, because Martha is what Martha is ... her way!!"},{"Title":"Mile 3: Happily Never After: Tangled Tales (Road to Writing)","review":"This is the book that got my eight year old daughter to write. She'd always hated any kind of school work involving creative writing -- until we got hooked on this series. With colorful illustrations, plenty of room to write and humourous prompts (such as &quot;write an ad for Rapunzel Shampoo&quot;), this book makes writing fun.My six year old son is starting at Mile 1, and he loves the series, too! I only wish they'd hurry up and publish more!"},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"I was a little wary when I bought this book, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Odd Man Out has to be one of the best books I've read in the last six months. It was heart-warming, and at times heartbreaking, but I couldn't put it down. The main character is likable, and relatable, and the secondary characters are well thought out. The romance aspects are subtle, but powerful all the same. I highly recommend it, just make sure you have a box of tissues handy."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"When you're single you do feel like the odd man amongst your coupled friends; and you feel as if the only reason they include you is because they feel sorry for you! What an awesome story, full of great characters. I read this story in 1 day!Dean really didn't know how to appreciate his friends. It was great that his friends continued to stand by him, even when he was being a complete fool. I wanted them to shake him and ask him why he was so darn thickheaded and willing to throw away a hot Italian man!! I wanted to shake him!!"},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"I was disappointed with this novel which is set in my hometown of Chicago. I had hoped that the author would have taken advantage of this setting, but it really seemed as if he had just read one of our gay newspapers and pulled out a few names to function as place names. The plot is trite as are most of the characters. Characters change their \\"stripes\\" at the drop of a hat. The book has a certain fairy tale, and they lived happily ever after quality that I found really disconcerting. I would have been more \\"satisfied\\" if Dean (the main character) had turned out to be an ax murderer! Just kidding of course or am I? If you can pick this book up used for a couple of bucks, okay but don't you pay a penny more!"},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"Imagine how much it must hurt to lose \\"THE ONE\\", the love of your life, your soul mate/life partner, the only man in your entire life who has shaken you to your very roots. Whether he dies or leaves you, how very much it must HURT. Unfortunately, our somewhat messed up hero, Dean, can't seem to avoid asking himself that question with every man he dates, leading him to fear desperately allowing himself to love someone. He lost his father as a boy, his mother while in college (to suicide, no less, imagine the guilt trip). Now his dearest friend in the world is dying of cancer (soon), and no boyfriend relationship has ever lasted very long. Poor Dean (actually, the pity party Dean kept heaping on himself got a bit tiresome after a while); he's had so many bad experiences with love that he has become \\"gun shy\\" about it. Then, bam, he meets the real love of his life: his true soul mate, THE ONE. and, sure enough, he eventually screws it all up in his race to run away from commitment.Add to that problem, his own insecurity/low self-esteem because he grew up in a trailer park (\\"trailer trash,\\" he called himself), and his envy/inadequacy (his word) that he feels toward even his best friends, and no wonder he believes his boyfriend could find someone better. Some people, having a low tolerance for self-pity and fear of commitment would probably agree with Dean on the last point. I actually did come to empathize with Dean, in part because I appreciated the fact that the author drew his major characters (including Dean, Tony, Lonny and Moose, and, to a lesser degree, the other characters) as adorable yet flawed and almost tragically human. Dean really did need to take his friends' advice at the end of the book and invest in some therapy sessions, even though he finally found the courage to admit his feelings for Tony at the end of the book. In all, it was a good read and the ending was actually satisfying. I'll look forward to Vince's future books."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"A really sweet love story. The two leads are both very realistic (the fact that one of them is a bit of a mess makes their falling in love that much cooler for those of us who are also messes!)I also loved all of the interplay between the various friends. Like a lot of gay friends they get on each others nerves and bug each other, but when the chips are down, they love each other more than family.A really great story."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"Now I know why I read books. Books tell stories, unlike movies, which tend to portray people larger than life or some freakish caricature. This book tells a story of Dean, who views himself as an outsider looking in. But in reality, he is afraid to include anyone in his life. Dean has a group of friends always giving him advice and looking out for him, but he doesn't lean on them in times of crisis. His new love, Tony, is just opposite, laid back, and grateful for life's expereinces. When they meet, sparks fly and they fall in lust (first), then love. A love that changes Dean, but he is slow in connecting the dots and resorts to his \\"old personna\\", breaking up with Tony. Don't fret, true love does win out, and it doesn't take chapters to get them there. In the end, Dean learns to recognize his self worth and trust the comfort he needs in someone else."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"Dean Davenport is a thirtysomething gay man who feels like the \\"odd man out\\" in many faucets of his life. Without a father most of his life, he grew up as \\"trailer trash\\" in Jacksonville FL, with his single mom who later committed suicide when Dean went off to the state university. He had moved to Chicago with his best friend, Lonny, who was recently diagnosed with terminal condition lung cancer and moved back to live with his parents in Florida. Dean's previous job had him traveling a lot, and, although he found no shortage of guys who wanted to have sex with him, he never had the time, motivation or (he thought) ability to cultivate an actual one-on-one lasting relationship with anyone. He spent most of his free time as the \\"odd man\\" socializing with friends who were all couples.When he first met Tony at a friend's party, Dean was instantly attracted to the man, and the feeling was mutual. As it became apparent that they were very compatible on many levels, Dean's insecurities about himself and his ability to sustain a long term relationship became the biggest obstacle for them, despite encouragement from his friends. On a visit to Florida, even Lonny could see that Tony was ideal for Dean, but knew Dean's self-defeatist attitude would be trouble. With his health deteriorating rapidly, Lonny knew he couldn't be there with encouragement much longer, and enlisted the help of Dean's friends back in Chicago to help Dean understand how he needed to trust Tony and the feelings he had for him.A simple, eloquent and compelling story about how one's childhood insecurities can become a factor in maintaining relationships in adult life. Anyone who has had doubts about entering a relationship with someone will likely see a little of themselves in Dean. It is also a touching story about gay friends serving as a loving family, despite occasional bickering and petty jealousy. I enjoyed it a great deal."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"I think it is sweet that this book is getting so many positive reviews for it is generally a love story and romance is truly a fine thing. But if this is the best we can do in gay literature then we are in a sad state.These characterss are all one dimensional and not real at all. If you step back and look at the story - Dean, the main character, is very difficult. Everyone says how he is the BEST GUY but has problems. He , in my opinion has very few standards and is very whiny.It was very sweet when he met the love interest but when the problems started love was still in the eyes of his amour. This was not believable. Romantic love after 3 months of dating is an amazing intro and then all the stuff Dean pulled was over the top to a level any sane person would have to leave - with regret granted, but he was messed up.Overall, I found this book to be written with good intentions but at the level any high school student could have written. And an F to the publisher. I have never read a book that was so poorly proof read. Using the spelling check on a computer would have caught half of the errors here.There were words entered twice, misplaced in a sentence and just very amateurish as a final project. I'm sure the publisher could have paid someone $50 to correct all these errors.I love literature and the quality of the books themselves. With all these written mistakes I feel the money spent was a waste.OK romance withouth depth. There is much better out there."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"it wasn't so bad, it was actually a little far reaching, but it panned out in the end...i'm neutral on recommending this book, buy it or not...i liked it..."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"This book was very disappointing. While I've read a lot of gay romance or love stories and have learned to have low expectations (which is kind of sad in itself), this book was really a disappointment. Dean, the main character is so annoying that I started to wonder why all his friends cared about him so much. He is always such a downer. He even needs to rely on his friend dying of cancer half the country away to help pick up his spirits. Because the main character was so one-dimensional, the rest of the characters just faded into the background."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"The novel explores a unique and interesting group of relationships among \\"friends.\\" Rarely has real life ever shown \\"friends\\" participating in Menages a trois so freely and with few complications. This fact, coupled with the atrocious editing, kept me from becoming engrossed in either the characters or the action. The constant repetition of prepositions in the same sentence was distracting and begs the publisher to hire a new editor."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"I loved this story and it's lead character Dean. Full of insecurities, angst, and sorrow stemming from childhood. Although he is trying to deal with relationships, impending death of his boyhood friend, his friends and trying to form new relationships, this book shows what is going on inside his head. He thinks he is acting normal - but his behaviour is nothing but abnormal! Loved all the supporting characters. Witty dialogue when needed. Dean is a most difficult person and it is a wonder that he has ANY friends! Wonderful story and very touching and poignant ending. Everything was not neatly tied up with a bow in the end - but it showed a process of starting to heal with Dean and Tony."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"Great story. Very believable characters and situations. Yeah, as another reviewer said, the lead character is kind of a mess, but as the stofy unfolds and you realize what has happened to him, you can see why he acts the way he acts. The way everything comes together is beautiful."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out","review":"I couldnt put this book down.....living in Australia and having a soft spot for Chicago - I bought this book not knowing the author etc. It has been one of the best reads for me. I felt I was actually there living the story and shed many tears and laughs...I could bump into the group of friends in this story and be a living part of it!! Thank you Vince Lawson as I will never forget the read."},{"Title":"The Challenge of the Sea","review":"The Challenge of The Sea is a long-forgotten and, indeed, criminally-overlooked book in Arthur C. Clarke's vast repetoire. Of course, this may surprise many, as the first thing that one generally thinks of when hearing the name &quot;Arthur C. Clarke&quot; are visions of space and black monoliths. Those familar with Clarke's life, though, know that he harbors, if you will pardon the pun, a long-time fascination for the seas of earth as well as his well-known love for the depths and mystery of space. An enthusiastic skin diver, Clarke went on several diving expeditions and even helped excavate a genuine sunken treasure ship (see his &quot;The Treasure of The Great Reef.&quot;) Though such writings declined after the coming of the 1970's, the early part of Clarke's career featured numerous articles as well as a handful of books, both fact and fiction, focusing on the sea. The Challenge of The Sea belongs to the non-fiction category, and is perhaps the best of the bunch. As always with Clarke's books of this type, it is an encyclopedic, comprehensive look at the entire subject: its history, accomplishments, inherent challenges, as well as prospects and projections for the future -- think along the lines of some of his more well-known space books of the same sort, i.e., The Promise of Space and The Challenge of the Spaceship. With Clarke, you know that you're never in store for a dry, boring read of the subject at hand, no matter what the subject may be: this book is in his usual well-written, highly poetic, more-than-occasionally funny, immensely readable and ever-interesting style. I found several of these articles to be particularly interesting, as the sea is a subject with which I am not overly familar with. The beauty of the book, though, is that Clarke shows what a fundamentally interesting (and almost wholly unknown) place the sea inherently is. By the time you are finished with this book, you, too, will find it an interesting and fascinating place, regardless of your prior views on the subject -- if you happened to have any at all. One problem with much of Clarke's non-fiction work is that it often suffers from a general sameness, and the same articles appear numerous times in various different books. As a long-time Clarke reader who has read upwards of 50 of the author's books, I was refreshingly surprised to not come across a single article in this delightful little book that I had previously read. Another good thing about it is that, unlike some of Clarke's more popular non-fiction works on space, the passage of time has dated it very little. Despite the fact that it was published in 1960, it is practically as applicable and fresh now as it was then. Consequently, this book is a worthy read for even the Clarke fan who has read almost everything the author has to offer. It is also one of his better and most oft-overlooked works of the kind, and deserves to be read by fanatics and more casual fans alike."},{"Title":"Able Seaman and Lifeboatman, Book 1","review":"If you want to test for your A.B. ticket, buy and read both of these books (1&amp;2). They are the best I've seen or heard about. Some old sailors told me about them, I used them and passed."},{"Title":"Violent Messiahs: The Book of Job","review":"What can I say about Violent Messiahs? If you've read comic books before, and you love the stuff that ISN'T happy, shiny superheros in spandex knocking the snot out of each other, you'll love this book. It takes the crime drama that other books like Sam and Twitch try to approach, mix in some dark superhero-like elements, and a tragic love story, and you get Violent Messiahs. A vigilante named Citizen Pain is cleaning up the crime on run-down Rankor Island, while another vigilante, the Family Man, is orphaning kids of drug dealers. Find out how these two vigilantes' past intertwine, as Detectives Cheri Major and Lieutenant Houston go after them while learning about each other.The action is electric, and artist Tone Rodriguez is clearly comfortable in his element. His characters come alive on the page, and the reader gets some excellent vantage points along the way. Writer Joshua Dysart jumps into the story and pulls you along with his kinetic, frenzied writing style that gets you excited, scared, and intrigued all at once. There are twists and turns that I did not see coming, and those surprises just added to the depth of the story.This book contains the first eight issues of the comic, containing their FULL story arc, with bonus sketches and material and a cover gallery of all of their comic book covers. Their photo/art montage covers are the perfect way to contain the excitement, drama, and mystery of this book.Buy this book, you won't be able to put it down until you're done!"},{"Title":"Violent Messiahs: The Book of Job","review":"I dug the Illuminati/ world conspiracy background to this exploration of free will and social control. It's clear what our vigilante protagonist is supposed to represent. Yet, his fall, or awakening, or redemption is not as dramatic as it should be, because the points of his epiphany are no suprise at all. He's a Punisher figure who looks like he's wearing Spiderman's Venom suit (as several jokes in the book remind you). Furthermore, does Pain really give up anything that he valued? If so, it wasn't developed as much of value before it was lost. The same critique applies to the female cop. She tells the secret of her past, and we see her spells of fear, but those are also undeveloped, pretty much. So, when the house of cards explodes at the end, I did not feel much of a revelation, awakening, or salvation on the emotional side coming off the page. The story is unique, but not so unique in that some the important parts were left untold or under-told."},{"Title":"Violent Messiahs: The Book of Job","review":"this book was visually stunning and written like a dream (or nightmare)! the story wasn't complicated and didn't drive me buggy with how all the characters were self absorbed in their own mysterious and unknown backgrounds. it was a straight forward, kick you in the ass at the end story. I feel that this writer was able to convey a very grizzly and dark story while also showing that he can write sympathy and heartache in the same breath. Being able to write various moods and themes and making them blend is a rare to come by talent in today's comic industry. I think anyone who's tired of the cookie cutter heroes and villans should pick up this book. Even if you LOVE cookie cutter heroes and villans, this book will ROCK YOUR WORLD! Of course this book wouldn't do so well if it wasn't for the art and color. There are a lot of shadows in the art, which I think is supposed to hint at something from the writer. The expressions the artist conveys on the characters are so realistic and screams volumes even if the character says nothing. I think perhaps this book wouldn't be so great if the writer didn't have the artist to flesh out the story. Anyone else and it would have looked too mainstream."},{"Title":"Violent Messiahs: The Book of Job","review":"Yes this is a graphically illustrated story but it you're thinking bah Superman or Donald Duck then think again.Ever thought some decadent weirdos are pulling societies strings?Genetic engineering, social destabilisation, loneliness, acceptance of others humanity and definitely some violence are what you will get from this book.The combination of pencils, inks and the most dark intense photo realistic colouring give this a &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; movie kind of feel.For those of you who know the works of Garth Ennis and Grant Morrison Joshua Dysart is another writer for you to watch."},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars: The story of archaelogy","review":"This book was first published in 1949 and then enlarged in 1967. Altogether it has been translated into 26 languages and read by many millions of people. It is easy to see why.This book traces the origins of Archaeology and those who were involved in the great discoveries. Commencing with the great statues of Pompeii, Troy, Mycenae and Crete, we then move on to the Pyramids - with sections about all those who became involved from Napoleon to Carter. Next we find the great Towers of Assyria, Babylon and Sumeria before concluding with the great Temples of the Aztecs, Mayas and Toltecs.This is a fascinating book which is able to give the layman an expert's insight into the greatest archaeological finds of history.NM"},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"Novacek's \\"attachment\\" for lithics and fossil evidence has led him to remote places. Raised in the urban sprawl of Los Angeles, he was introduced to the wild, quickly finding excuses to return. Paleontology is easily the best excuse available for travel and exploration. He invites us to join him as he tours the North American West - into mountains, canyons and plateaus where fossils have emerged before. From this familiar territory he goes on to more exotic sites. His explorations reach from Andean highlands through Arabia deserts to the mysterious Mongolian plateaus. It was the latter that gave Novacek the greatest rewards and kept him occupied for more than a decade. This autobiography of a professional paleontologist provides interesting insights into the researchers depicting the prehistoric realm.Before the rewards came the trials. The first was the decision to take up paleontology when a music career dangled enticing rewards. His father was a competent guitarist. A chance to learn field work offered new opportunities and challenges. Fresh creek water proved polluted leading to \\"highly volatile\\" digestive tracts. In the Andes, Novecek's horse bolted with one boot caught in a stirrup. Walking was impossible and riding little better. Desert scorpions and rattlesnakes were added threats. In Yemen, it was overzealous military staff. The hazards of scrambling over cliff faces seeking fossil or fording rain-swollen rivers recede as serious threats and become part of daily expedition fare.All these mishaps failed to quell his desire to travel. The travel wasn't entertainment, but his quest for fossils. The search wasn't always rewarding, but the promise or the need kept him going. His misadventure in the Andes was off-set by a string of rewarding finds. Glorious to behold and thrilling to experience, the Andes are now considered the fastest rising mountains in the world. Fossils that had no business being at the altitudes Novacek's team encountered show how rapidly the mountains have been constructed by plate tectonics.This mix of life experiences and scientific endeavour is richly enhanced by the graphics sprinkled through the text. Some of the most interesting are diagrams of fossil assemblages as found in situ. These provide a good indication of the complexities of retrieval and reassembly. His maps are a bit spare, but give the general location of campsites and fossil finds. Security, an issue of increasing concern in Mongolia, demands no more detail than necessary. Some photos of the campsites themselves might have personalised the account. His bibliography verges on the bizarre, being a mix of scholastic papers and general accounts. Some of these are worth pursuing. The knowledgeable will applaud his inclusion of John McPhee [although one volume is inexplicably omitted]. Novacek is forthright in his account of the tribulations of this career, but depicts as vividly the many rewards paleontology has to offer. As he concludes in this fine account: \\"there's still so much to know\\".

Exotic, grueling trips peopled with with bizarre foreigners propell this succint biography. Always the focus is bone. The search for the magic stuff that will open the time window on the past and, incidentally, fuel the not always well-funded careers of those who pursue. I've been to exotic places and had similar adventures but not in the pursuit of bone. Now, I want to go for bone. It's a great excuse for getting out into the middle of some beautiful nowhere. I've got the hammer, chisel and field guides. Now I just need maps. Thanks, Michael. See you out there."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"It's easy to see why Michael Novacek became a paleontologist. His enthusiasm for bits and pieces of animals that thrived millions of years ago -- not to mention his patience for scraping these out of rock and soil under often harsh conditions -- is contagious. This engaging and informative book follows the author on his adventures from the canyons and buttes of the American West to stormy Patagonia in Chile and far into the Gobi desert. Alternating between reminiscences of adventure (or misadventure) and descriptions of some of the wonderful and odd creatures of old, this book is a captivating account of one man's mission to explore the variety of life that once was."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"Michael Novacek's Time Traveler is an undeniably an excellent and informative survey of the scientific search for ancient mammal and dinosaur remains around the world. Chapters include plenty of paleontology but also capture the scientist author's excitement as he participates in digs which reveal new information about these early creatures."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"I had an extremely hard time getting through this book, which very much surprised me. I had read another book by Michael Novacek, which was quite good and a book I would recommend, \\"Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs.\\" His current book \\"Time Traveler\\" really misses the mark. I think the main problem, is that Mr. Novacek is a Paleontologist, and a quite good one I should add, but he's not a very exciting writer. He has chosen to write about all his experiences in the feild, from the very beginning of his career and sometimes that's just not very interesting. I was bored because even Mr. Novacek sounded like he was bored in describing some of his early field excursions. He writes much more about his dangerous run-ins with the locals, than he does about the fossils he is out to find. As a matter of fact, he seems to find very little in the way of significant fossil material throughout the whole book. Other than his trip to Mongolia, which he has already written about in his previous book, I found nothing I thought was worth writing about. I guess the bottom line for me is, I highly respect Mr. Novacek as a Paleontologist, I just think he wasn't very excited with the material when he wrote this book and it shows. I am therefore afraid I cannot recommend this book. I would like to recommend a book that I have recently read, that I think is very good. \\"Dragon Hunter\\" by Charles Gallenkamp. This is adventure and excitement at it's greatest. You won't fall asleep reading this book"},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"Time Traveler blends autobiography with adventure travel and science as it tells of the paleontologist's discoveries of dinosaur fossils and his enthusiasm for his profession. Novacek began his lifetime career at an early age unearthing fossils in his own Los Angeles back yard: eventually he traveled the world from Yemen to Chile in search of fossils. An exciting story of scientific discovery."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"After Michael Novacek wrote _Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs_, a very successful non-specialist account of his fossil-hunting expeditions in Mongolia, he found that readers told him that they especially enjoyed his descriptions of the expeditions and life in the field, perhaps even more than the substantial paleontology he included. With that in mind, he has now written _Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Ancient Mammals from Montana to Mongolia_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), which does not scrimp on scientific information, but still consists mostly of stories about how paleontologists do what they do. Interested in fossils even as a boy, in graduate school he got interested in extinct insectivores, which are now represented by hedgehogs, shrews, and moles, but which were much more diverse in the past. Novacek admits that these aren't the showiest of ancient animals: \\"they might be more aptly called vermin than beasts.\\" But in an evolutionary sense, they have vast importance; from such shrewlike creatures came rodents, bats, elephants, whales, and of course, humans. He shows us what sort of work he has done on the creatures, and why it has been important.The book's main attraction is his stories of field work all over the world. They are told with good humor, and occasionally with forgiveness. He starts as a novice, worried that the graduate students are going to play tricks on him, and eventually ends up leading expeditions himself, to Baja, Mongolia, the Andes, and Yemen. Reading these tales makes one realize that there truly must be a fantastically strong appeal for this sort of work, if Novacek still likes it after all the difficulties he experienced, from mildly irritating to potentially lethal. \\"Our hands were swollen and blistered from swinging sledges all day, and our backs were sore from cradling heavy plaster blocks as we climbed the steep slope back to the vehicles. The work was hard. But I liked the routine, I felt useful; we were a chain gang in the service of science.\\" There are a few tales worthy of Indiana Jones, like how his party is ominously detained by the militia in Yemen. In the Andes, he is tangled in the stirrup of a horse and dragged down painfully, temporarily ruining his legs. He is bitten in the groin by the world's most deadly scorpions in Baja. He discovers that a desert can bloom into swarms of insects denser than that in a rain forest because they are attracted to sweat. There are bar fights. Shrapnel from a colleague's hammer on a specimen severs one of his arteries. \\"As some of my college mates would say, \`It's a lot of trouble for a few old bones.'\\"Novacek's animated tales and explanations of how he has done his work give genuine insight into his passion. He has included lots of real science here about plate tectonics, evolution, and much more. For those who never graduated beyond childhood dinomania, it will tell them what they missed. Best of all, this book ought to be in the hands of young people who are in the thralls of such enthusiasm, for in its pages are revealed what it is really like to be a paleontologist."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"Michael Novacek must be a very interesting person, judging from \\"Time Traveller,\\" which he describes as \\"a book not about a life, but about a life in the field.\\" Starting from his childhood in California, he relates the story of his start as a young paleontologist (moving from a background as an indifferent student and an unsuccessful rock musician) working in the American West and Baja California. Most of the digs take place in unpleasant locations, fraught with heat, scorpions and dreadful food. As he moves up the academic ladder, the digs become much more exotic and he heads out to Patagonia (where it is cold and windy instead of hot and accidents with horses can happen, but the food is still of varying quality), then to Yemen (where there are not even any interesting fossils to make up for the sheer awfulness of the place), Mongolia and Argentina. It appears that extreme physical fitness is a prerequisite for those wishing to enter this profession.The major fault of the book is that it appears to be written backwards. The last chapters, focussing on the extremely important discoveries made in the 1990s in Mongolia, are fascinating and move quickly. They appear to come from another, and better, book. When he writes of the importance of palaeontology and the fossil record, his prose is powerful and almost poetic. But the earlier chapters seem to meander, a collection of anecdotes about his childhood, working in the field, a bit of this and a bit of that. One has the impression that Dr. Novacek is a bit of a scatterbrain, unable to focus his attention--Looky! Old rocks! Insectivore jaws! Bikini babes! Look! Fossil fish! Ancient teeth! Yemeni bandits! Look! Picturesque Chileans! That Roy Chapman Andrews-what a guy! Hey, look! We've been in Mongolia for ten years!The chapter on Yemen is particularly odd. It describes in great detail all the problems involved in working in this near-medieval country, the dangers and the heat, but the only scientific finding is that there is really not much there to interest a paleontologist. Nonetheless, in the next chapter he writes about possibly putting together another expedition to go back, until he is distracted by Mongolia. Is this a thirst for derring-do, in the style of Andrews?His attempt to write \\"popular science\\" often feels clumsy but cannot hide the fact that many of his discoveries are significant and have contributed to many serious scientific debates. I particularly liked his writing about how the Mongolian dinosaurs may have died. Originally accepting the idea that they were buried in soft sand, he carefully describes recent work by geologists that suggests instead that heavy rains resulted in mudslides that caught the animals in the gullies where they lived. It is clearly and elegantly expressed and ultimately helps make this book worth reading. It probably would be a better book with less rock-smashing and more such thoughtful analysis."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"And so does Novacek's book. So right away we know that TIME TRAVELER is not merely a recounting of paleontological studies. They certainly remain as one of the main topics of discussion and the trips to Mongolia, Yemen, and Chile read like adventures rather than scientific expeditions. Interwoven throughout is Novacek's personal story and recollections. There was nothing to indicate that the ten year old who was &quot;more of a Beaver Cleaver type than a young Indiana Jones&quot; would eventually go on to become one of our foremost paleontologists. Novacek recounts a fairly normal, middle-class life, growing up in suburban Los Angeles. His admission that he &quot;liked crawling around in the dirt and mud, turning over rocks, and looking at things through binoculars and microscopes&quot; is however insufficient evidence of a budding scientist. Didn't we all do the same? The difference perhaps is that when the opportunity arose to loose himself in the world of girls and music, Novacek remained enthused with the fossilized world.His enthusiasm is still there and it's captivating. The thrill he gets from discovery, the joy of the outdoors, and the sense of adventure are all reminiscent of our own simple childhood pleasures. Novacek's willingness to share these feelings with us and the writing style which enhances it, makes this a very refreshing reading experience. It's not all fun and enjoyment however. He tells of illness and infections, insect bites and stings, and injury. Deadly places and dangerous people provided their own challenges.Science remains the serious subject connecting all the personal stories and travel adventures. As such Novacek delves into current topics in paleontology such as extinctions and loss of biodiversity, continental drift, and dinosaur and mammalian evolution. In the debate about the origins of birds he comes down firmly on the side of a dinosaurian origin. He adds his own support to the view that dinosaurs are not extinct by saying &quot;the survivors were of course birds.&quot; On another subject where the majority of recent writers are in agreement (Bjorn Lomborg excepted), Novacek agrees that the loss of biodiversity is a critical issue. Near the end he offers a view that is far from cheerful and refreshing and as such jangles with the joie de vivre which characterized so much of the book. His statement that &quot;paleontology should not be the only biological science in the future - the science of a dead planet&quot; is no doubt informed by a life spent in realities of science."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"After reading Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs (Dr. Novacek's vivid account of his Mongolian expeditions), I was eager for more. Happily, Time Traveler does not disappoint and I devoured every page of this exuberant romp through the world of fossil hunting. Follow Novacek around the globe as he escapes a cave full of poisonous snakes, gets dragged over rugged mountains by a skittish horse, attends a rather curious party in the middle of Yemen, and, oh yeah, finds some incredible fossils along the way. His adventures as a paleontologist are sure to inspire anyone, young or old, to travel to the far corners of the globe in search of the past and the present. The illustrations and especially the maps are extremely useful, and always seem to pop up right when you need them. Although the book focuses primarily on Novacek's expeditions, he takes great care describing in layman's terms the scientific ideas behind his pursuits. I would recommend this to anyone with a taste for adventure - especially those who fear there is nothing left to discover on our planet. Time Traveler is sure to excite both armchair and professional explorers alike."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"My freshman year in college, I decided to indulge my interest in dinosaurs and earth history by taking a *rocks for jocks* geology class. It was fascinating. I learned (and sadly haven't really retained) all kinds of info on rock formations, evolution, and paleontology. When I read the excerpts of this book a few months ago, I noted the author and bought the book when it came out. Novacek is a world famous paleontologist who takes us on a journey of his past field work and interweaves that with info on the animals whose bones he uncovers along with the geology of the sites he's worked. He also throws in some hilarious stories of adventures in fossil hunting that make me quite happy to stay home and leave the actual travels to him.\\"Time Traveler illuminates some of the most exciting issues in current paleontology-- dinosaur and mammal evolution, continental drift, mass extinctions, and new methods for understanding ancient environments and the geologic time scale. By revisiting our planet's past and his own, Novacek teaches us how to understand the prospects for the future not only of paleontology but of our global ecosystem.\\"I will say that if you only have a glancing interest in this type of material, this book would probably bore you to tears but if it's something that intrigues you, you might find it as fascinating as I did."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"This book is a must-read for any aspiring paleontologist. Novacek's clarity is unparalled in science narrative. He tells his stories in the same lively manner that you would expect to hear from an old friend around a camp fire. You feel as if you are on expedition with Novacek himself.Unlike many accomplished scientists who are not professors (Novacek is with the American Museum of Natural History, not a university), he is able to pontificate in a relevant manner for the scientist and the lay-person alike.This book is less about dinosaurs and more about being a dinosaur hunter. If this perspective interests you, you can't beat this book.Most shocking, is the fluid and crisp prose with which you are engaged. Career writers and authors should envy Novacek's writing abilities. I recently finished _Prey_, a novel by Michael Crichton, and its writing was inferior to Novacek's. This alone should earn him a nomination for one of the yearly science-writing awards."},{"Title":"Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia","review":"I picked up Time Traveler completely on a whim the other day.

For the most part you'llfeel like you're reading a great novel, then you remember that all of the events really happened and the author is here to tell the tale... his brushes with death are numerous and never fail to get the heart pounding (a great workout in itself!!) Best of all, I came away with a basic scientific understanding of the expeditions themselves - how to pick a location and the reasons why certain fossils are (or aren't) found there (I can't wait to startsearching in my own backyard!) The geography of remote places like the Chilean Andes and Yemen is clarified by maps interspersed throughout the book. Dr. Novacek writes in a way that presents information to the novice and the professional alike - and the reader is left neither confused nor thirsting for more...

This book is great for a younger person considering going into paleontology to be aware of the highs and lows of the field. It is also interesting for those of us who are older and always dreamed about going into paleontology.The one warning I have is that the book is a bit long.

Mr. Lee is a masterful story teller and I found myself quickly falling into step with him as he explored the past, examined the present and contemplated the future of his beloved Buzzard's Bay. By the end of the book, I found that I was no longer on Mr. Lee's journey, but on my own journey of discovery.Being a non-fiction work, it is considerably more than a collection of vignettes and anecdotes; it is also an accurate and detailed depiction of the current state of the land, the water and the animals and fish who inhabit the area. The book does not preach -- so I won't either -- but just simply lays out the facts. The reader is left to draw his/her own conclusions of what the future might hold for the Bay and any land, for that matter, that the reader holds dear.I read the book beginning from Chapter 1 through to the end, but it lends itself to &quot;skipping around&quot; and reading chapters in the reader's order of interest.

Instead, it misses the mark.Let's start with the positives. The research is terrific and deep. Lee has found a number of interesting characters to help tell his story. And he's got true skill as a writer; he knows of what he writes, he's capable of wry observation and beautifully turned phrases. Lee is young, and there's exciting potential here; at times, you get the feeling that you may be reading John McPhee's heir to the crown of literary nonfiction.Okay, here's where the book falls short. Although presenting one's own views is a prerogative of writers, doing so requires care - particularly when presenting one's own side of a controversial issue. At times, Buzzards Bay has the feel of a manifesto rather than an exposition. Since I already noted him, McPhee generally presents a controversial opinion through his interviewees, scrupulously making his own views opaque on the matter. You still get the point, but you don't feel like it's being forcefed to you.Second, there's a real mechanical problem with the book. Paragraph breaks are double spaced. It severely interrupts the flow of the book. Minor quibble, you say? Trust me, it grows very annoying.The biggest problem, however, is that the book really needed a skilled book editor who could rein Lee in, cut bits that appear to be there only for style, force a little more clarity and a little less bias. A different title wouldn't have hurt the book, either - the title itself limits the book to regional interest, and in the right hands there'd have been more than enough to make this book one of national - even international - value.Reading Buzzards Bay is like holding a handful of 1/2 carat gems. Which is nice until you realize that you could have been holding the Hope Diamond. The raw material allowed either option.Here's hoping that Lee's next book finds its way into the hands of a truly gifted book editor. If he displays the research capability and raw talent that showed in Buzzards Bay, it'll be one to savor indeed."},{"Title":"Buzzards Bay (Paperback)","review":"I read Daniel's book while vacationing at Wood's Hole , Mass.

Are we headed for extinction or is 'quality survival' possible or even likely? Are the prospects for quality survival something that we can influence and, if so, what are the priority issues on which to maintain a continuing focus in order to optimize our prospects?Doug Cocks engages with these questions with obvious enthusiasm. His exploration is immensely wide-ranging and he brings together an extraordinary range of fact, theory and speculation in a way that is scholarly while remaining colloquial, and which carries the reader on a truly fascinating journey through - to quote one of the author's allegories - a series of dungeons in which Posterity finds herself having to slay a series of dragons, maturing and growing stronger as she succeeds in overcoming each more formidable dragon. Cocks' conclusions, at least about the possibility of long term quality survival, are modestly optimistic.He uses a methodology that contains elements of scenario building and preferred futuring to explore these questions, basing his enquiry around four priority issues. The issues are:* Nursing the world through endless change* Raising the quality of social learning* Confronting near-future threats and challenges* Anticipating deep-future challenges.These issues are selected as representative of the need to respond &quot;collectively and selectively to an ever-changing set of priority issues, meaning those judged at the time to have a particular bearing on whether the lineage can achieve quality survival.&quot;Both the content and the methodology will be of interest to anyone concerned with forward planning, as well as to the general reader.Anyone interested in the long- and shorter- term future of humanity will find this book a fascinating and extraordinarily rich source of material and ideas. It is a tour de force to have been able to assemble and make sense of so much information while maintaining a simple, undogmatic and eminently readable narrative.

The crime to be solved is made to seem convoluted but ultimately turns out to be relatively simple. But as with each book in this series it isn't really about the plot. It's about Easy's singular way of seeing and evaluating and dealing with the people he encounters along the way, his perspective on a period of time that seems both long ago and immediate. His character is further fleshed out with each novel, and going along for the ride with him on the particular case he's working on is always a pleasure. If you enjoy the writing of Raymond Chandler you'll probably enjoy that of Walter Mosley and vice versa, only with Mosley you get an added dose of social commentary, not to mention Easy's psychotically entertaining buddy, Mouse."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"This novel deals with racial issues and must be approached with an open mind. It is presented from the viewpoint of a black investigator, Easy Rawlins. The setting is the Los Angeles area in the early 1960s. Civil rights are just getting into motion.Easy is a wannabe real estate mogul who is short on cash. He needs to support himself and two children that he has taken in (unofficially adopted). He needs money, and has been approached to find Black Betty - the nickname of a woman whom he knew in Texas when he was a child. He has a reputation for being able to find people.It is a complex case. There are questions about just why people are looking for Black Betty. A number of people are killed along the way, and relationships are established as the story moves along. There are some very ugly people, including racist police officers. This was well before the time of Rodney King when events could be picked up on video.Things do not necessarily end well. You will get a good view of some of the underside of society and people's social attitudes. There are some side plots. Some guilty people are punished, sometimes in ways they would not have expected."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"This book was entertaining, however don't look for much depth in the Easy Rawlins novels. Mosley tend to talk too much about how hard it is to be a black man in 1950's LA but you never really feel the anguish. Easy's situations are too far fetched. It's simply not believable. These feeling may have come out because I've read a few too many Easy Rawlin's novels and frankly its hard to differentiate between them. Standard formula: woman in trouble in black part of town because she has messed around with someone outside of her race. Easy gets in trouble because he's black. Boring....I did enjoy the passages about his kids. It's a mystery novel and I am not a fan of the genre which could account for my lackluster appraisal. I did finish the book which means I must have found something worthwhile about it."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"&quot;Black Betty&quot; drew me into the setting and story, and I only began feeling disappointed in the last 75 pages. The title character has no real role in the book. We look for this lady for 200+ pages, but when we find her, there's nothing there. The setting, characters, and dialog are excellent. But the book spins out of control. The last 75 pages wind the plot so over-complex, I began losing track of who was who and what linked to what. I suspected a kind of &quot;set-up,&quot; also as I approached the conclusion. Betty, the title character, had been kept as a kind of slave for many years-- a sex slave, really. The oppressor was a wealthy white man, respected by the community. The author injected numerous comments to the effect, 'that's the way it always is, a black person enslaved by whitey.&quot; Was I reading an allegory, or watching the author spin out his own social resentments? I had mixed reactions. I've seen the film version of &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress.&quot; It was excellent. I am not sure &quot;Black Betty&quot; would make a good film without major editing."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"After I watched &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot; three times, when one of my students offered to loan me his cherished copy of &quot;Black Betty,&quot; I jumped at the chance. I found Mosley's grasp of street reality, his strong characters, his real-life situations, his fast-paced action, his emotional and intellectual depth, and his effective choice of details make him the a master of the mystery noire. Mosley is a master story-teller, a writer on the same plane as John D. MacDonald and Raymond Chandler."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"I could listen to Paul Winfield read all day long. His vocal variety is incredible. The plot is fine and there is a soft spot in my heart for this hard boiled detective who loves his children so much - but it is the reader Paul Winfield who makes this story come alive! I hope every Easy Rawlins mystery comes out on tape"},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"I read this book with my book club. We agreed that everyone just seems so mean to each other in the story. People kill each other left and right until you begin to wonder who will be left standing at the end. Speaking of the ending (don't worry, I won't give it away), I was distressed and disappointed that things did not work out the way that I hoped. Plus, the killer just seemed to come out of nowhere and have no real connection to the other characters. I'm amazed by how many answers to Easy's questions existed right under everyone's noses. I do enjoy mystery, but I prefer Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Gone Fishin' by the same author."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"A rich woman's father left the estate to Betty, worth millions of dollars.

Easy is hired to find the infamous, Black Betty, who certainly does not want to be found.The search takes Easy out of his comfort zone and right into the danger zone. Amidst liars, killers, and thieves, he must determine if the people who sent him on the wild goose chase aren't, in fact, the culprits trying to put him on the scent of other game.This novel will have you wondering if Black Betty even exists, or rather exits before Easy's entrance. You'll have to read the book to get that one."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"One of the best of the series because of the mystery surrounding Betty. Mosley uses language so well that characters and mood become paramount to plot. This is a quick, good read."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"Ezekiel (Easy) Rawlins lives in a world where you could be walking into a bullet anytime you knock on a door. The inhabitants of this world have strange names like Mofass, Mouse, LaMarque, Odell and Juice. It's the unsettled era of Kennedy, Khrushchev and Martin Luther King. And it's L.A., where black people thought twice before stepping into white neighborhoods.Easy is handling several problems at once in this novel. Someone hires him to find a woman known as Black Betty, and pain and death seem to follow him everywhere on his search. Meanwhile his best friend Mouse, in jail for murder, just got out and wants to kill the man who turned him in. And Easy's got financial troubles too, involving some property that's slipping through his fingers.The search for the missing Betty is particularly disturbing. When Easy was a boy, he was obsessed with Betty, who \\"had something about her that drove men wild.\\" She was generous with her charms, but when a man's pockets were empty, she was gone. When Easy was twelve years old she kissed him for fun, and after that he followed her everywhere, her faithful errand boy and admirer.By now he's lost track of Betty for years, but he likes the idea of finding her again, for his own sake, not just for the fee. At the same time he's conflicted, not wanting to bring any harm to Betty. The people looking for Black Betty won't tell why they want her.This is my second Easy Rawlins book, and I find myself reading it less for the story than for the atmosphere simmering with danger, the poetic cadence of the language of the streets - and Easy's complex humanity."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"I love the Easy Rawlins series and this is one of the best. The twists and turns are not predictable as in some books of this genre and Easy has ways of pulling things together that are amazing. I'm sorry that Mosely has discontinued the Easy Rawlins series, Easy and Moose are a great combination."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"This is a classic Walter Mosley tale of woe and bad luck with characters so well formed that you feel like you are watching them on a screen rather than reading about them. Ezekiel Rawlins was home minding his own business when a seedy looking PI showed up to offer him a job. An old friend from Texas went missing and her employers - a wealthy family from Beverly Hills - want to find her. It sounds simple enough, but nothing is ever simple in Rawlins' world, and he eventually finds Betty at the end of a corpse strewn trail all while trying to keep his psychotic friend Mouse from killing an innocent person. Mouse just got out of jail and wants to know who reported him to the police. Hotheaded and impatient, Mouse is determined that someone is going to die and doesn't much care who he kills.Along the way Easy is arrested, beaten, stabbed threatened and cheated in a real estate deal. Still he manages to solve the mystery of Betty's disappearance and stay alive.Mosley really excels in his character development even down to the way he describes their clothes. When he talks about Commander Styles, he mentions how his slacks may have been police-issued, but his shirt was fine-spun. He does the same when describing Gwen the housekeeper and notes that while she's wearing a uniform, it's an expensive fabric. It really gives you insight into the characters.This is a gritty tale about secrets and the fallout from one cruel man's actions."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"Good book took a lil while to get into, but the book turned out great. I am gonna continue to read Walter Mosley books."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"Easy Rawlins is a complex character. I enjoy getting to know him better in each of Mosley's books. But because Walter Mosley has such a wonderful talent for character development, I probably will never have Easy figured out completely. What amazes me about these books is that they read like a serial but any one of them can stand on it's own without any long, detailed introductions or explanations. Black Betty does not disappoint. Easy juggles several situations at once and manages to bring order and justice to his world by the end of the book. I think the most endearing quality of Easy's is the love and care he gives to his kids, Jesus and Feather. The time spent with his family gives a good balance to the darker side of his life on the streets. There are some big surprises in this story...some good and some sad and good at the same time. I bought this book a long time ago and saved it until the next Easy Rawlings book came out so I could read them both at the same time because when I finish a Walter Mosley book I always want more. I wish he could write \`em as fast as I can read \`em."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"Walter Mosley doesn't just write mysteries. He creates a historical landscape peopled with vibrant and authentic characters who like most of us are flawed and lacking in some way. \\"Black Betty\\" is Mosley at his best. The mystery is enthralling and many layered, the atmosphere electric, and the villains exquisitely evil.The time is 1961 the era of Martin Luther King, John Kennedy, and the beginning of The Civil rights movement. Easy Rawlings is raising two adopted children on his own, and his secret real-estate empire is sinking. He has no idea how to solve his financial problems until a sleazy private eye Saul Lynx approaches him with a job. Lynx offers Easy $200 to track down a former acquaintance of his, Elizabeth Eady, aka Black Betty. Betty a beautiful and sensual woman has vanished from her wealthy employer's home in Beverly Hills.Easy's search for Betty will uncover a trail of chaos and murder. To make matters worse, Easy's psychopathic best friend Mouse is also out of prison determined to find and execute the man who betrayed him. However, this book is much more than a murder mystery; it is a journey into the heart of racial bigotry and the paradox that is the human race. The language is vibrant and moving:On the bus there were mainly old people and young mothers and teenagers coming in late to school. Most of them were black people. Dark-skinned with generous features. Women with eyes so deep that most men can never know them. Women like Betty who'd lost too much to be silly or kind. And there were the children, like Spider and Terry T once were, with futures so bleak it could make you cry just to hear them laugh. Because behind the music of their laughing you knew there was the rattle of chains. Chains we wore for no crime; chains we wore for so long that they melded with our bones. We all carry them but nobody can see it-not even most of us. All the way home I thought about freedom coming for us at last. But what about all those centuries in chains? Where do they go when you get free?This is not merely a fast paced and gripping mystery but a powerful story of one of the saddest aspects of American life. Mosley does not preach nor condemn, he merely presents us with a historically accurate account of an era in which this mystery story unfolds. I highly recommend this story."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"Raymond Chandler made the definitive statement about L.A.'s Santa Ana Winds at the beginning of his short story \\"Red Wind.\\" In Easy Rawlins' L.A., the hot, dry winds that fill the lungs with cactus dust and make the skin peel around the fingernails never seem to stop.Easy is in search of an erotic dream woman from his childhood who is being sought by one of those rich white families who have more skeletons than clothes in their closets. Around the same time, the very dangerous Raymond \\"Mouse\\" Alexander is released from the pen; and Easy's attempt to make a killing in the real estate market run up against a brick wall.There are plot threads aplenty, and enough characters to fill a passenger liner. Mosley is too good a writer to leave any threads untied, but I do get lost at times with some of the characters. One bad dude is not heard from for a hundred pages when he commits a particularly heinous murder at the very end. \\"Oh, yeah, wasn't he the guy that ...?\\" Sometimes, I would have welcomed the list of characters, complete with nicknames, that occasionally accompanies an 800-page Russian novel.What makes this a minor complaint is that Mosley has such a great sense of place and so much feeling for his characters. We don't meet the character he calls \\"Black Betty\\" until the end of the novel, but we keep seeing vignettes from Easy's past that keep building up the suspense, and any expectations are more than fulfilled by an ending that is bloodier than the last act of Hamlet."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"I don't generally like crime fiction. There's a sentence to alienate most of the people reading this review! However for some writers - the great ones - the genre they write in is irrelevent. It cannot be denied that Mosley is a great writer, who has shown equal facility in tough but politically and socially literate crime writing and also in witty and wise post-modern science-fiction.Black Betty is a fine demonstration of his craft. His particular skill is in weaving the world into his tales. The mystery is well-constructed and satisfyingly tangled, featuring multiple murders, corruption and racial and class divisions. However the central plot is framed both by the atmosphere of early 1960s America with the rise of the civil rights movement confronting old prejudices, and by the dense web of family and social life within the families of ordinary, mainly (but not entirely) black, working class Americans.In theory Easy Rawlins' role in the investigations in which he is involved is limited to where white men fear to tread - the black community. However the networks of corruption and deceit he uncovers inevitably take him outside this world, in this case into the bizarre and emtionally-stunted world of white land-owners and their complicated relationships with their black and latino servants, as well as a corrupt and racist police force and legal system.Easy is also personally involved - Elizabeth Eady AKA Black Betty - the woman whose disappearance he is hired to investigate was a teenage crush of his, a woman who inspires obsession in many, which turns out to be her tragedy. At the same time, Easy has to contend with several other difficulties: the release of his psychotic - but often useful - friend, Mouse, from prison, bristling with anger and the need to revenge himself on the man who sent him down; the ongoing silence of his eldest adopted child Jesus, who has chosen not to speak as a result of the trauma and abuse from which Easy rescued him; the suspicious collapse of the real estate businesses in which he has invested his occasional earnings; and various other ongoing personal and social difficulties. Easy Rawlins has a well described and believable, if unconventional, family and a life beyond the crimes he is occasionally employed to solve. He is a fascinating character who has grown with successive novels; full of desire and anger but compassionate, wise and often painfully self-aware.I would rate Black Betty as the best of the Easy Rawlins tales. What is particularly great about it is Easy's story of personal survival and compromise in an unfair world where a black man cannot sit back and enjoy what he has without someone trying to destroy it. Easy does get to the bottom of things, but it is at immense cost to all those involved including himself, and in the case of Mouse - well, as those who know the character will be aware that there is very little in the world that will stop him doing what he has set his mind on.This is ultimately a tale cut about with sadness and rage, and a mighty fine and and jolting read it is too."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"Mosley's Easy Rawlins series of crime novels are collectively a great read. Novel by novel Mosley takes us from the optimistic, sunny post-war LA toward a bleaker, jaded experience - so by the time we get to Black Betty in the early 1960s, Rawlins has worked for 15 hard year trying to better his family, and yet still he keeps getting dragged back into his past - this time to earn a couple of hundred dollars to find the whereabouts of a housemaid whom he once knew as Black Betty.This time the tension is ratcheted up a notch because of the risk to Rawlins' family of adopted kids, and because of the return of his violent friend Mouse, just out of jail and eager to blow the heads off the people who put him there.But where Mosley scores is in his faithful recall of the events of the early 1960s - there is mounting Black Anger, the gap between the haves and have-nots is widening and the news bulletins feature a fiery Martin Luther King and...later in the novel, the death of JFK. I've seen many noverls where history is wheeled in to lend gravitas to the narrative, but nobody does it better than Mosley. Seen from the tired, indignant viewpoint of Ezekiel Rawlins, our modern history weighs heavily. I loved this novel and this next summer I'm going to re-read the Rawlins series once more. Five stars? Not enough. Mosley is a literary treasure and Black Betty rates as one of his finest."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"After reading (or rereading) many of the classic detective novels in the past few months, I have come to two conclusions. First, I read way too many detective novels. Secondly (and more importantly), in all truly great hardboiled detective stories, the actual mystery is secondary. Granted, a labyrinth plot that keeps one guessing is always a plus. But all the true greats of crime fiction (Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James Ellroy et al.) have realized early one what has taken me some time to understand: It is not the plot, it is the world the story occurs in that is important. The finest mystery plot in the world means nothing if the reader does not believe the world presented actually exists, at least on the page.I state this merely as a preamble to my main topic, the novel BLACK BETTY, by Walter Mosley. It is a good mystery. It has intrigue, deception, betrayal, racism, and murder. It is complex enough to demand a second visit. But, more important than the plot, Mosley has created the world of 1950's Los Angeles in such vivid and believable detail that you'd read the novel even if it were a mere travelogue.BLACK BETTY marks the fourth appearance of Ezekiel &quot;Easy&quot; Rawlins, an unwilling investigator who is more concerned with providing his children with a good home than he is with solving a case. It is to this end that he accepts an offer of two hundred dollars to track down Elizabeth Eady, a sultress from his past who has gone missing. As Easy once again delves into the lives of others, he visits worlds he wishes to escape from, and worlds he wishes to join. He also realizes that there is no real difference between them.Easy ranks up with Phillip Marlowe and Sam Spade as one of the finest literary detectives. He is tough, resourceful, intelligent, and oddly eloquent. It's also good to see the return of Mouse, Easy's childhood friend/nightmare. Mouse is a killer, and is all the more terrifying for his believability. Like all of Mosley's characters, you get the impression that they have lives beyond the page, that they do not exist merely as foils for Easy.But that is true of Easy's entire world. In a few simple, elegent sentences, Mosley can describe a character more vividly than most authors can do with pages of exposition. Their manners of speech, their beliefs, their dreams. Mosley can size up an individual like almost no one else can. Even minor characters, such as Ortiz and Jackson Blue, linger in the memory far longer than many lead characters of other novels.Mosley's Easy stories, despite their being lumped into the sometimes simpleminded detective genre, are always more than they appear. Mosley embues his writings with a palpable sense of rage. The common, almost routine racism that Easy encounters every day gives the stories a compelling weight that his literary predecessor's sometimes lacked. It is a viewpoint that could overwhelm the story, but Mosley is far too skilled to let it happen. Even as Easy muses about Martin Luther King and &quot;the young Irish president&quot;, he understands the difference between political rhetoric and day-to-day reality. Easy's world may be fictional on the surface, but it exists, and continues to exist all around us.BLACK BETTY is a tremendous detective novel that works on many levels. It is a fine example of the detective genre. It is a perfectly realized world unto itself. It is an indictment of how little we have advanced in the past fifty years."},{"Title":"Black Betty","review":"I enjoyed Black Betty as I do all of Walter Mosley's books. He has had me hooked for 6 years now. I first found him and read all that was avaliable, white Butterfly, Devil in a Blue Dress and Red Death.

I understand Mr. Mosley had recently lost a family member when he wrote this.It didn't have the author's normal existential optimism in the main character, Easy Rawlins, and I felt strangely empty and saddened by this work.

I was fortunate enough to find a copy with all three books in one so for me there was no space between the two. Written in the same style of the first novel, this story begins with the lives of three sons of Wang Lung: Wang the eldest (Landlord), Wang the second (Merchant) and particularly, Wang the third (The Tiger). By far the most important and interesting character in this book is Wang the Tiger, who became a powerful war lord. Much was written about his life and how he longed to live the life of a soldier, having nothing but disdain for the farmer's life his father wanted for him. It's an interesting irony, how none of the sons respected what Wang Lung, their father, had left for them. The eldest only interested in the faade of the rich life, the second only interested in money, and of course, the Tiger, whose main purpose was to be a strong and powerful leader.It's an exciting and sad novel. Reading the evolution of the Tiger's rise to power made the Merchant's and Landlord's lives pale in comparison. Wang the Tiger was a most fascinating character, always obsessed with control not only of others, but of his own inner feelings. It was as if he was driven to be more than human...strong and willful, void of any weakness, void of any softness of heart, setting impossible standards for himself.Once his son was born, he transferred all of his focus from warring, to raising his son as a warrior like himself. His love for his son, like his love for power, was unwavering, unbending, and suffocating. For example, this was evident in the times when the Tiger noticed that his little boy was so grave and quiet for one so young. Also, though his son did whatever he was told to do, he lacked any spirit or enjoyment in his tasks. Unfortunately, every time the Tiger saw this, he had a moment of clarity, but was quick to ignore or bury it, and thus never really attained the wisdom to forsee what would become of his only precious son.This was a wonderful and exciting novel to read, very different and lively feeling to that of &quot;The Good Earth.&quot; Yet it's absolutely necessary to read it as part of the trilogy. Once you finish, you'll be anxious to know what becomes of the Tiger's son, and how the coming revolution will change their relationship."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"After devouring \\"The Good Earth,\\" I was dying to read more and see where Pearl Buck would go next with this dynamic family. I found that \\"Sons\\" was a good read, but a little slower and not as exciting and thrilling. But true to the original, right as I starting losing just a little bit of interest she would introduce a new twist or turn which made me always come back for more. She is an amazing writer and her insights into the culture are always fascinating. If you really liked The Good Earth, Sons will probably be a fun, quick read, but I don't feel that it is as vital of a work as The Good Earth."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"SONS is the sequel to the famous (and thanks to Oprah - newly popular) THE GOOD EARTH. The story begins just where the previous book left off, with Wang Lung a dying old man, hoping his sons will handle his legacy wisely. Of course, they do not.The oldest son, Wang The Landlord, turns into fat, greedy man who sells off much of the land to pursue hedonistic pleasures. Wang the Merchant, the second son, sticks more to the letter of his father's wishes, but is an opportunistic skinflint who loves silver above all else. These two think always of their position in society and how to advance it, and care more about how they appear in others' eyes than the actual substance of their lives. Their children are spoiled and worthless, just as Wang Lung saw the old lord Hwang's sons become in THE GOOD EARTH. The reader gets the feeling Wang Lung would be disgusted.The majority of the novel follows the wild, rebellious third son, who becomes known as Wang the Tiger. He ran away from home as a teenager to be a soldier, and this book finds him a young man planning to escape his master and establish his own dynasty in the north. With his trusted companions, Wang the Tiger fights his way to becoming the controlling warlord of a region in the north, and he finally falls in love with a fierce robber girl. (These scenes painted vivid pictures in my mind reminiscent of the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.) Much to his bewilderment, the years go by and his life does not work out as he plans. He ends up with a son he does not understand, just as his father did not understand him.Pearl S. Buck's plodding, biblical phrasing is not so easy for the modern reader, and I confess that while it was a good story, every page seemed like two or three, and I found myself groaning aloud \\"Isn't it over YET?\\""},{"Title":"Sons","review":"The Good Earth follows the life of a farmer by the name of Wang Lung as he suffers life's trials and successes to build a dynasty that will span through many generations.Sons picks up where THE GOOD EARTH leaves off and opens on the end of Wang Lung's life as he prepares to die and his sons inherit his properties and possessions. As the story progresses Pearl Buck no longer refers to the sons by their names but instead begins to call them names based upon their character and occupation. The eldest son becomes known as Wang the landlord because he makes his living by renting out his father's lands. The second son becomes known as Wang the merchant because he makes his living as a merchant. The youngest son becomes known as Wang the Tiger as he becomes a soldier and War Lord. SONS contains aspects of all of their lives but in particular follows the life of Wang the Tiger.In THE GOOD EARTH Wang Lung made his living upon the land, and it was very important that his land be protected. He had seen the fall of the great house of Hwang as the family had ceased to value the land and the sons had become spoiled little princes who spent their money on Opium, women and gambling. Wang Lung wanted his sons to value the land but then gave his sons everything his newly acquired wealth and position could afford, and they too became spoiled little princes who did not know the value of the land. He charged them fervently never to sell the land. Upon his death in the book SONS Wang Lung's son's almost immediately begin to sell off the land and go through the inheritance that their father had left to them.As with most of Pearl Buck's books it is not so much what happens in the story as it is the development of the characters and their lives as they unfold that is of particular interest.Wang the landlord became a fat, glutenous, gambling, womanizer who struggles to keep the money from flowing out twice as fast as it flows in. Wang the merchant becomes a wise shrewd merchant and does quite well financially but does not value the land as his father did. Wang the Tiger sets forth to become a War Lord, using his father's land to finance his armies. The book follows his life as he conquers different lands and then tries to retain control of them. Wang the Tiger has a soft heart for a war lord and finds injustice difficult to stomach. He realizes that the one thing he is missing are sons as his brothers have, so he marries and finds great joy when he has a son of his own and watches his son's growth into manhood. He wishes his son to follow in his footsteps and become a Lord of War, but the boy, while he is obedient in his training, lacks the desire to be as his father. Just as Wang the Tiger did not desire to be as his father but instead chose another path, it is obvious that Wang the Tiger's son will also choose to follow a different path.While I am not sure of the exact time setting of this book, it is clear that it is a more recent time in history when China stands upon a threshold of change to the modern instead of the traditional. Pearl Buck does a wonderful job in this book as in all her books of showing us a picture of Chinese life and culture. The book doesn't have to 'move' quickly with lots of plot twists because her characters are so interesting and real that it holds the interest of the reader.Sons is worth reading if you have read THE GOOD EARTH because you find out what happens in the lives of the characters with whom you already have a connection. Compared with Pearl Buck's other works I was not as impressed with this book but did find it interesting."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"I was dismayed to come to the end of Good Earth, but I was delighted to find out that this was but the first installment in a trilogy! While I liked Good Earth better than this, this book was still a very good read as we discover the fate of Wang Lung's sons, and Wang Lung's land itself.4.5 out of 5 stars. Now I am more than ready to start 'A House Divided'!"},{"Title":"Sons","review":"I only found out recently that there were sequels to The Good Earth and so I was anxious to read them. I was really disappointed in this book, it just did not really go anywhere. This book did not draw you in as the first one did. I could not get involved with the characters and it seems as if Ms. Buck was just trying to move the story along. I do not plan on reading the last of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"Generational conflict in China as the country undergoes dramatic political and economic changes. As relevant today as yesterday in understanding the Chinese people."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"An absolute and thoroughly interesting saga and drama of the sons of Wan Lung. The book mostly follows the life of the departed son, Wang the Tiger. His mission is to have his own army and a son of his own. Pearl S. Buck skillfully details Wang the Tiger's desires, emotions and thoughts. Wang the Tiger removes his son from his sisters and mother to ensure the lad's education and guidance &amp; preparation to follow Wang the Tiger's footsteps. This book is as excellent reading as &quot;The Good Earth&quot; and completely to the end!"},{"Title":"Sons","review":"Sons is actually a book about the differences between the three generations. Wang Lung died peacefully in the beginning. The story continued with the three different kinds of life the three sons of Wang Lund led. All of the three sons were concisely portrayed, with a slight emphasis on the third, Wang the Tiger. He rose slowly to the position of a warlord. In order to pass his position to his son as he was growing old, he sent his son to a military school to learn western war techniques. However, his sons turned against him by joining the New Revolutionary Army which was against all old lords.The story is a little bit long, in a way. However, it wis certainly worthy to be read as it shows me how men, no matter how &quot;straight&quot; they are outside, have after all been self-centered. The book is also not in very difficult language. It needs a little bit patience, bit will make a difference in people's life. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Sons","review":"I find that most people do not realize that The Good Earth is actually the first book in a trilogy. Sons is the second book and it takes off exactly where The Good Earth leaves off; it also has exactly the same writing style. This book focuses on the three sons of Wang Lung, of course, but primarily the third son, Wang the Tiger, who passionately wishes to be a great War Lord and conquer a large territory, maybe even be a king, someday. Will he succeed? You'll have to read this book, to find out.Along the way, we learn more about the other two sons, Wang the Merchant, and Wang the Landlord, as well as what happens to Pear Blossom and Lotus. We also learn about Wong the Tiger's two wives, and his son, whom he wishes to raise as a soldier.This book, since it is mainly about Wang the Tiger, is focused on war and battle and soldiers, not normally my favorite topics. However, I love Pearl Buck's writing style so much that I still enjoyed this book very much. Now I am looking forward to reading the third book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"I had read The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck when I was very young.

Recommended."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"This was a good book & a nice continuation from The Good Earth. It seemed a little like I was wading through part of it; it didn't flow as easy for me as the first book. Still, the story was very good & I can understand it being maybe a little more difficult to write, since the story was of 3 sons, instead of mainly one character, like the first book. I am looking forward to reading the next one."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"I loved this book. Great follow up to The Good Earth. I am a new fan of Pearl S. Buck and am working my way thru everything she has written.I have a special interest in China as my son was born there. It's interesting to read about the way people lived in China at that time. Yes, I know it's fiction but she drew from her knowledge of living in China for many years. Looking forward to the last book of the series."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"Buck does an excellent job of providing a story of how men's inner desires and outer actions mold their lives and affect others. The sons begotten by Wang Lung the Farmer continue their lives giving us a window on this period in China, but the motives and events are universal."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"Book jacket says that this work, a follow on the moving and thoughtful The Good Earth, is written as a chinese novel, with its structure and approach. I found it very tedious, with constant repetition of events of daily lives, (how many feasts can one describe in a single book?). I think this is perhaps more of a scholars book now, i.e. one used to illustrate the chinese novel than one which holds interest, or illuminates human nature. Characters are quite formulaic and stylized."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"always realistic and warm in the sense that you are close to a family. The struggle of the grandson is very much like the inner battles wang lung had to contend with in the first book. love is always found and always conquers."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"Pearl Buck is my absolute favorite, and I quickly read through this novel after reading Good Earth again (I've read it nearly a dozen times, it is my favorite). Out of the trilogy, Sons is my least favorite, although it is still good and gives some really good biographical information on a Chinese man of the time. Focusing mostly on Wang the Tiger, I enjoyed the second half immensely. If you read Sons, be ready to get right into A House Divided (the last third of the trilogy), as this one leaves you hanging.A great work by a great author. My love of The Good Earth just overshadowed this book, which is why it only got 4 stars."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"Takes you back in time ... china like you have never hear of it.....could not put the book down till I finished it... now on to the final book in the series...."},{"Title":"Sons","review":"The continuation of the story of the house of Wang.

Despite the great changes that China has seen, I recognised these people. They are representative of Chinese people in the recent past and their struggles can still be seen in the modern lives of people in every area of China, both in the countryside and in the city. Her description of starvation, cannibalism and banditry were very accurate. However, the famine in the Good Earth could not be compared to the Mao&#8217;s man-made famine from 1958-62. During those years up to 50 million Chinese starved to death unnecessarily.

But in this particular audio I rate a Frenchman with an extraordinary sense of humor (Yves Coppens) and a linguistic/gene-pool orator (Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza) as writers-that-are-more-fascinating-than-even-Stephen Jay Gould. Yves Coppens happens to be a co-author of several other scientific tomes. He explains his theory about the separation of the apes and homonids in African geologic strata with the moniker, EAST SIDE STORY. More than just, &quot;what a hoot!&quot; this explanation makes all Americans proud, even though all of these events happen in Africa years and years ago! The intellectual stimulation of listening to the idea that language follows the speaker, particularly transient folks, may not captivate some--but when it follows lines that can be traced genetically with strong policical science connotations, that makes Cavalli-Sforza extraordinarily captivating reading/listening. I wonder if you can listen to this one just once?"},{"Title":"Human Evolution: Selections from Scientific American on Our Species Evolution","review":"Into the White House?In these days when proudly anti-scientific ignorance is growing more powerful, we need every child to learn from these tapes, PLEASE!The wonder and glory and tragedy of human evolution is too important, and these tapes brilliantly lay out some engaging questions.News to the wise, it did not all just happen one fine ten thousand years ago.After this read Chomsky's studies of universal grammar and phonemes and their development.

The English translation loses the effect that the Japanese novel possesses; the husband writes in the more modern characters of katakana, while the wife, Ikuko writes in the more traditional Hiragana. The fascinating part of the novel is how well it expresses sexual desires without having the characters directly relate their wants and needs to one another. This follows the more conservative traditions of the Japanese, and suggests that feelings and emotions are taboo and should be kept to oneself. But the overall sense of the novel implies a strong feeling of tension that is only alleviated by deception. The characters are forced to control their sexual instincts and lie to themselves by not opening up to their parter. Truth is also another skeptical idea that is toyed with and conventionalism is a factor as well. The reader is never aware if either Ikuko or her husband ever read the other's diary and this leaves an aura of mystery; a positive aspect the author creates in the story. Overall, an intensifying work of art in both English and Japanese."},{"Title":"The key","review":"I read this book in one sitting. Considering that the novel was first published in 1956, it was a courageous feat for the author to explore the theme of sexual ingratification especially in such a closed society like that of Japan. A passive people, the Japanese do not openly discuss their feelings, much less their sexual needs. Thus, the 2 main characters found themselves in the situation where they were- lack of communication, mismatch of expectation et al which drove one to find gratification outside of the marriage. The novel sharply explores the wifely duties expected of a Japanese woman and how the main characters preferred to communicate through their respective diaries as a medium- in the hope that their real thoughts could be known if the other party decides to have a glimpse- so typical of closed societal norms. The novel leaves many unanswered questions- what happened to the affair of the wife? what is the real motivation of the daughter? will a large age gap between a husband and wife affect the happiness of their marriage? Overall, a good read with gripping prose. Kudos to the translator:- Howard Hibbett."},{"Title":"The key","review":"This small novel in the form of two interweaving diaries is a mere 160 pages long. In fact, it is 320 pages long. You have to read it twice to enjoy it fully.The two diaries are written by a 55-year old professor and his wife who is 11 years his junior. To state the facts bluntly: He is oversexed and under-equipped; she is over-equipped and loathes him. In short, they are incompatible. They have been married for more than 20 years. As long as he sticks to his books and she to her traditional upbringing and old-fashioned morality the marriage works. Then, on New Year's Day, the husband starts to write in his diary about the sexual relations with his wife, knowing that she will read it. She, in turn, begins to write a diary in the knowledge that he will read it. A game of intricate manipulation begins during which he gains some momentary fulfillment of his desires and she finally finds a surprising solution to her marriage problem. It is an empty, ironic triumph, though. But I don't want to give away the plot.The title of the novel alludes to the key to the husband's diary. A key is an instrument to open something that is locked. The husband intended the key to open up the heart of his wife to his needs. This is not what happens. His diary sets in motion another process. The key opens up something unexpected in his wife, ironically and tragically.The novel can be read on several levels: as a mystery novel, a classic tragedy, an essay on marriage, a study in deception and self-deception, an exercise in the use of manipulation, a deliberation on sexual politics and obsession (even though this is the most un-erotic book about sex I have ever read), a story of female liberation, or a philosophical musing about the delusions of human beings.It is absolutely a five-star performance. Please note the fine craftsmanship of Tanizaki. How he manipulates the reader, and how he structures the diary entries to reflect the balance of power between husband and wife (with the husband's fading influence and health, his diary entries fade, too). Please note, too, the fine moral balance that Tanizaki strikes. You may despise and pity his characters at the same time. Tanizaki completely refrains from letting his own ethical inclinations show in his characters. It is the process set in motion by the husband's diary that gives each of the two main characters what they desire. Let yourself be surprised."},{"Title":"The key","review":"Kagi or The Key is a fascinating novel in which Tanizaki brilliantly creates a means of communication for a husband and wife whose sexual relations need a new level of passion.

The man is a 55 year-old academic who loves his wife and feels sexually inadequate. The woman is a 44 year-old traditional Japanese housewife, sexually both repressed and voracious. Their college-aged daughter is cool to the young man her parents present as a potential husband. The young man appears to be more interested in Mother than in daughter.Through the diaries one observes the internal workings of the marriage. The husband hides from himself everywhere except in his diary. His wife hides from herself even in the diary. Each expects the other to \\"snoop\\" so that they can communicate through their writing what they cannot speak openly. And they use their sexual relationship as the metaphor for their entire relationship.The author has done an excellent job of uncovering the ambiguity often present in relationships and the complexity of knowing even one's own motivations."},{"Title":"The key","review":"I could launch into a whole spiel about the nature of truth and all that junk philosophers have been making a living from for a millenium and then some, but I won't. The Key is a work that will leave you wondering what exactly truth \\"is\\" in the Clinton way of speaking.After more than 20 years of marriage, a husband and wife are finally becoming sick of each other. The husband sees his wife as sexually repressed and feels that he has to write his frustrations and fantasies in his diary. He's kinda torn over whether he wants her to read it or not.The wife on the other hand sees her decade older husband as disgusting and demanding. She doesn't desire him physically as such. She just uses him for the act of sex and even that leaves much to be desired.Enter a friend of their daughter named Kimura and things start to come to a head when he just happens to resemble the wive's favorite movie star. She uses her desire for him and her husband's jealousy to try to enliven their marriage. The problem is, like drugs and capitalism, you become acclimated to a certain dosage and then you have to escalate more and more. Then things become outlandish chaos.This book is another masterpiece by Tanazaki which is crammed into a little close to 200 pages. I'm in awe of the dude. He takes these situations that seem so cliched and makes them into something great. He is a true master. Here we have a meditation on marriage and sex. How do two people who find out they married someone incompatible with themselves and yet continue to exist in the falseness of it? Many couples find themselves in the same situation. Lots of times they end up destroying each other. If only these characters could be honest with each other and speak their minds. Even the fact that they could really only communicate their deepest thoughts through diaries shows their weakness. I recommend this book highly. If you like it, check out another of his novels entitled Quicksand."},{"Title":"The key","review":"This is something of a demented romance novel (which is not the description of a novel that I would have expected myself to enjoy). However, the plot is so deceptively complex, and turns back on itself so deftly, that it is impossible not to be caught up in the deceit of the characters themselves. The apparent simplicity of the characters motivations and actions lead the reader into the same state of confusion that the characters appear to be experiencing. The ambivalence and ambiguity (two things that smack of a lack of conviction on the author's part in most novels) work marvelously in getting the reader as lost as possible in this ostensibly banal domestic story. Bet it's pretty cool in Japanese."},{"Title":"The key","review":"I was delighted and intrigued to read this short story by a Japanese writer. The Italian movie \\"La chiave\\" (1983), based on the novel but taking place in Venice, did a great job in bringing to life the emotions displayed by the characters throughout the story. The novel is not about sex, nor about eroticism per se: I read it as a psychological skirmish between a husband and a wife; as a battle of opposite wills; and as an indirect validation of the Buddhist understanding of desire and the suffering that stems from it. The man is in love with his woman and experiences a powerful, uncontrollable physical attraction for her; in other words, he is not content to jut have sex with her, but wants to admire and enjoy the sight and feel of her body. The woman, on her part, is a dutiful wife raised with unbridgeable moral strictures and does not allow her husband to view her and touch her as he would like to, because she considers it immoral,not to mention that she is somewhat physically repulsed by her aging husband); however, her love making is vigorous (she is 11 years his junior) and usually culminates in orgasm. So, what do we have here? A situation where a man does NOT get what he wants, but the woman has her cake and eats it too: she can enjoy orgasms without delivering what her man needs. HOWEVER, as a result of the \\"psychological chess game\\" initiated by the husband, both characters begin to move towards fulfillment of their needs. The woman wants to experience passionate and vigorous love making, and she will, thanks to her husband manipulation of a third party, Mr. Kimura, who becomes by the book's end Ikuko's lover; the husband wants unbridled access to his wife's body and he will get that, thanks to his manipulation of his wife's propensity to get drunk with brandy.And yet, despite this partial \\"success\\", both characters will fail to crown their ultimate sexual dreams, remaining in a state of frustration and disappointment."},{"Title":"The key","review":"I was delighted and intrigued to read this short story by a Japanese writer.

Each then reveals all his forbidden wishes and transgressions against and for the other, which fuel mutual excitement and sex! The result is a masterpiece into the vicissitudes of love and aggression and how they blend in marriage. The partners play this like a chess game--My move...YOUR move! They tease, provoke, and then make love, fired up by the latest volleys. Their marriage undergoes a fascinating transformation as the game unfolds. She holds more cards, but HE will not be thwarted! She gives him a run for his money, but he gets to possess his posed and submissive, almost hypnotized (he plies her with liquor and she obliges him adding her acting skills)\\"love object\\" (psychoanalytic term which fits well here!). The communication via the diaries--with words, and in bed--often via mute theatrics, is a masterpiece of marital choreography!How this elaborate marital game plays out is culture bound to some extent by its setting in the Japan of almost a century ago, but for me, this does not affect the story's salience to marriage wherever it exists!This is a MUST read because of both uniqueness of plot, and the pleasure of exposure to the eloquent yet economic language of the literary master Junichiro Tanizaki!"},{"Title":"The key","review":"This is a superb story from Junichiro Tanizaki. Here he tells the story of a disintegrating marriage through separate diaries kept by a husband and wife. He (the husband) is a middle-aged professor seeking out new sexual highs with his wife. She is a reticent and repressed woman with desires of her own. They write about their adventures from the previous night in their diaries, but soon begin to suspect each other of reading the others' respective diary. This is an excellent work of literary art that will hold your attention. As readers, we gain insight into the behavioral patterns of these two people and really have the opportunity to see what motivates them to do the things they do. The entries of Ikuko (the wife) were particularly interesting. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The key","review":"The Key (Kagi) is an outstanding example of Tanizaki's diary-form novel. It carefully balances literary value and shock value to create a vivid, believeable exploration of repressed sexual bankruptcy. The use of the minds of both the husband and wife is very effective, and overall the novel evokes, like Quicksand, an odd feeling of Jane Austen(psychology of mutual deception) and Hemingway(brevity) as sexual deviants. The more graphic passages are essential and transcend mere titillation. Unlike An Almost Transparent Blue, whose explicit paragraphs almost seem inserted at intervals to keep one reading, the more difficult parts are the core of the story and its desperate tone. It is a very tight story that can be read in a single afternoon, but will be thought about many afternoons to come. It is an excellent choice, as is any Tanizaki, for a first look into Japanese literature."},{"Title":"The Oxford Dictionary of Dance","review":"At the risk of stating the obvious like a darn fool, it is a dictionary in every sense of the word.

From Alvin Ailey to the Zurich Ballet, it serves as a quick reference for seasoned followers of dance, while pure beginners might get lost in the mass of text.

In this, Malphurs was very successful. The author presents a six-step process to help pastors develop and implement a vision in the local churchBeing a small church pastor I appreciate his emphasis on the small church. The use of the fictional Pastor Bob was an excellent tool of identification. It allowed the author to bring in the human element of discouragement, frustration and antagonism in a way that every pastor can identify with. Malphurs dealt adequately with the idea of opposition. The Deacon Bill character is a man we call can identify with.His advice on how to obtain a vision was excellent, it was pragmatic and easy to use. This is in direct contrast with Barna's The Power of Vision (pgs. 81-1-84) that promulgated a process so tedious that only the most tenacious pastor would ever work his way through. His insight that vision will become a dividing rod in the congregation rings true- those who buy into it stay, those who do not, leave.This was a pretty powerful book, but it was not without some weaknesses. It assumed that some of Pastor Bobs board were visionary people. In far too many churches, the maintenance mind-set is firmly entrenched in the power structure and visionary people are excluded. It is not unusual to have no men of vision on a church board, what then? Although he did not neglect the opposition to vision within the church, I think he did underestimate it. Peter Drucker makes it very clear that the people who have the most to lose by vision are the people who have invested the most into the organization. Barna's insight into the nature of opposition in his excellent book Turn Around Churches was far more realistic.This book was packed full of helpful advice. I especially appreciated the distinction the author makes between leadership and management and that both are necessary in growing churches. Churches cannot grow without leadership and they cannot deal with the problems caused by growth without management. Thus the pastor must wear both hats.Yes, this is a must read dealing with issues concerning vision that are not adequately covered in other books on the subject."},{"Title":"Developing a Vision for Ministry in the 21st Century","review":"In a world of religion where many churches seem to simply &quot;exist&quot; without much understanding of their own purpose, the answer time and time again of &quot;Why?&quot; comes back to a people perishing because of no Vision. Aubrey Malphurs skillfully weaves together wisdom and experience with practical application of a much used and little understood term: Vision. With fresh, illuminating spiritual insight, he guides us upon a journey of discovery and awareness. This voyage exposes the snapshot which has been impressed upon the film of your spirit, and through the &quot;light-room&quot; of the Holy Spirit, brings forth a full blown picture of what God wants the ministry He has given you to look like, ready to battle, in the 21st Century. If you would not be ignorant of the wiles of the devil, this book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Developing a Vision for Ministry in the 21st Century","review":"Like most ministers, I have read several books on vision. Some titles were very inspiring, other titles were very confusing. The vast majority however, were not very enlightening. This book by Malphurs moves beyond establishing the need for vision and helps the reader grasp, communicate, and implement a vision.Malphurs follows an easy-to-understand process beginning with the definition of a ministry vision and ending with the preservation of that vision. I recommend this book highly to all ministry professionals, especially pastors."},{"Title":"Developing a Vision for Ministry in the 21st Century","review":"No other book has motivated me to plan ahead and strategize more than this one.

This book was exactly what I was looking for because it starts from the basics of two-handed fingerings, and takes the player all the way to chord playing, etc., which is what I will focus on as a worship leader and musician. While this book moves quickly through theory and does not hand-hold, it does still cover a lot of ground from the basics to more complex concepts in music. The complete novice will probably not feel comfortable with this, but I still have to say that I am pleased and impressed with the scope of this book. If you have some musical background and are looking to cross over into piano as a second (or third or more) instrument, you will most likely appreciate this book because it does not dwell on the elementary concepts you are already familiar with."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's You Can Teach Yourself Piano","review":"I started out in music by purchasing Mel Bay's Complete Method For Modern Guitar, which I rate 12 stars.

It has about 100 pages of text on every kind of food in every quantity and how to cook it in a microwave."},{"Title":"Microwave Gourmet","review":"I bought this book and learned a lot about techniques and tools. That alone was worth the price. But this also has an extensive, well-organized set of about 600 recipes, with variations for smaller or larger portions. Exact times are given for a 700 watt oven, and need to be adjusted based on the power of yours, and for larger or smaller portions as she describes.Some nits: The author recommends microwaving under a tight seal of plastic wrap to keep food moist and speed cooking, but I just use standard lids with no difference I can tell. The author decries the combination microwave convection oven, saying there is just more to fail in this more fancy gadget. Perhaps, but I love my microwave convection oven because I like to have my roasts and cakes browned without shifting things to another oven. She strongly prefers a particular size of roasting pan, 14 x 11, which is ideally sized and shaped for most microwave ovens with rotating carousel and smallest horizontal dimension 16 inches or more. But it is hard to find (older Corning Ware) so the common Pyrex 13 x 9 pan will have to do for most of us. I actually agree, looking for the Corning 14 x 11 roaster is a fiddly chore but worth the effort.But the recipes are great, adjusted for microwave cooking times and utensils. Very useful still. Overall it's a great bargain at today's used book prices."},{"Title":"Microwave Gourmet","review":"Someone \\"borrowed\\" my Microwave Gourmet cookbook by Barbara Kafka.

The tools, tips and techniques found on the pages herein are applicable to any car, though I am personally glad the author chose a popular muscle car. Also, a downright pleasant read for anyone who just admires vintage cars and good writing. Larry Lyles takes the reader along on his personal journey to restore an old Charger, originally rougher than a night in jail, to showroom condition and teaches the reader \\"how to\\", all while injecting some good downhome humor. This is not your typical \\"technical guide\\", it is much more personal and readable. The photos are in color, a pleasant and useful departure from the B&W you see in most auto repair guides. The writing style shows the author's experience as an auto enthusiast, professional paint and body man, and frequent contributing writer to publications in the business. I hope Mr. Lyles finds the time to write another book soon on restoration of another car. How about a 69 Dart GTS, Larry?

But for the MoPar restorer there are rare and specific instructions for things like adjusting the body panels, adjusting the windows for travel, angle, closure and how to check for wind noise without even driving.

Luckily, Project Charger isn't one of them. The author has intimate knowledge of all aspects of restoration, and you don't need to own a Mopar product to learn from him.Mr. Lyles takes you through the entire restoration process, and includes a lot of subjects glossed over in other restoration books. He explains how to stay organized by making lists and notes and taking photos. He covers home powdercoating techniques, and gives many tips on straightening and painting the little detail parts that separate great restorations from mediocre ones. He clearly explains how to align body panels and windows during assembly. His hands-on knowledge is evident because he recommends what grit of sandpaper to use for each step, and what paints, sealers, adhesives, etc. give best results. He is also brutally honest about how many hours and dollars go into a restoration.The book is not perfect. Mr. Lyles explains in detail how to remove the windshield and backlight, but he doesn't say one word on how to reinstall them - is there a chapter missing? He uses a rotisserie to work on the underside of the car, but doesn't include photos or drawings on how to build one. The photos are in color, which is good, but the color balance is inconsistant, so the car appears to be maroon, purple, or blue in different photos. I also wish he recommended books to find more information on different aspects of restoration - you just can't describe engine rebuilding in a six-page chapter.Overall, an excellent book for any restorer."},{"Title":"Project Charger: The Step-by-Step Restoration of a Popular Vintage Car","review":"What a great book.A colour book on restoring a car and its a step by step guide.Finally a book that deserves to be called a step by step guide.This book is an ideal restoration manual suitable for all cars so no matter what car you want to restore this book is the way to go.Colour photos show what to do.This book covers so much and each section is covered in great detail.Its great value for the price alone and for what it offers.This book states that the techniques within the book can be used to restore any car.Didnt waste my time trying to fault with this book.This book will please most people.If you are planning to restore your car,no matter what it is,I highly recommend this book and the author's book:\\"Revive your ride:secrets from a body and paint restorations pro\\".(ISBN:1-931933-66-1).I also recommend purchasing a workshop manual for specifically for your car."},{"Title":"Project Charger: The Step-by-Step Restoration of a Popular Vintage Car","review":"Really nice restoration book!

After purchasing this book and &quot;Speed Mechanics For Lead Guitar&quot; I put seven or eight hundred dollars worth of other instructional material on the shelf. The lower shelf. Troy Stetina is not only one of the finest guitar players around, he is also the best teacher I have found. He disproves the old saying &quot;Those who can't do, teach&quot;."},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"Once again, Troy Stetina has written an awsome guitar book. Metal Lead Guitar skips the small stuff that most guitarists already know and goes straight to the techniques you need! And, this is the first book that I have seen with a section for learning to use the wammy bar! This book is slightly challenging, so I do not reccommend this if you are new to guitar, but if you have the basics down and hopefully a little more, BUY THIS BOOK! You will fall in love with it!"},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"pros--------the book is in tabs-ALOT of exercises-work at your own pace-points you directly to rock and metal-cd that plays everything for you, including the six solos you'll learncons--------must have at least one year of guitar experience."},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"Great book to become an intermediate lead guitar player. It starts from the very beginning and covers scales (Minor pentatonic, blues, minor natural and dorian), speed exercises, intermediate techniques (natural harmonics, vibrato bar, tapping), timing up to sixteenth note triplets, basic theory and introduction to improvisation. It has good explanations, 171 exercises and 6 songs with full backing band to solo over that make you enjoy as you learn. Exercises and songs are demonstrated on the included CD.It uses TAB with standard rhythm notation to make learning easier.This book will be hard for absolute beginners because, although basic techniques (hammer-on & pull-off, bending, finger vibrato, palm muting, artificial harmonics) are explained clearly, the book includes only a few exercises for every basic technique and focuses on more advanced matters. They'd better start with a basic book asMetal Lead Guitar Primerto learn the basics.Remember Troy Stetina is acclaimed as one of the best instructors world wide."},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"This is the BEST! I held off starting my studies due to the title of this book. Being a ROCK player, not true &quot;metal&quot;, I let the label steer me wrong.

When you finish volume 1, you WILL be a lead player!Thanks, Troy!"},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"This book rules - no other way to put it . I've been playing guitar for 5 years - no other book I've seen provides this thorough grounding in fundamental technique as applicable to metal - after a mere 2 months of serious practise ( 1 hr per day ) my playing rose by SEVERAL levels - with regard to speed / control and just plain and simple playing stuff that sounds good.Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"I started with Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar, also by Stetina. I should point out that I just picked that up because of the title and the fact that I aspire to be a \\"shredding\\" guitarist when I'm fully accomplished. I learned the hard way, as it were, that I am nowhere near ready for that book, and decided to start from the beginning. I followed the recommendation on Stetina's website, and decided to forego the Primer book for Lead, as I have way more than a year of experience in guitar, and picked up Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 as well as Metal Lead Guitar Vol. 1. My fiancee and I both use these books and are learning very quickly from them. She has only recently begun guitar, and I have been playing as an amateur/hobbyist for well over 10 years. Both of us are learning a lot from these books, and they are extremely well written. They are perfect for any guitarist inspired by the Rock/Grunge/Alternative/Metal genres. A complete flip flop from the Hal Leonard books, which feel as though they have not been updated since the 1870s, these books start right in with power chords for rhythm, and flashy tricks for the lead book, enabling the most beginner of a guitarist to feel like s(he) is doing something useful from the very first note. Stetina is a brilliant guitarist and an even more accomplished teacher, and he cuts out the \\"crap\\" you don't need to know from the beginning. Some conservationists will whine that he does not teach music notation, but, show of hands, how many guitarists out there started out as a virtuoso in another instrument and actually USE that ability to read \\"notes\\" with their guitar studies? About 10% outside session musicians. Stetina has a brilliant method of combining the rhythm of standard notation with the logical layout of tabs, and using that notation I have seen increase in my rhythm abilities and knowledge of music theory from the start. I highly recommend any book in the Stetina series for any guitarist with an eye for metal, and at any level of proficiency. I look forward to the second volumes of these books, and eventually Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar, with relish."},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"Don't let the title of this book mislead you. This is more than just Metal guitar...a lot more! It's Metal plus any style of rock lead guitar from the late sixties to the present. Basically, if you have an electric guitar, an amp, some form of overdive/distortion and you want to play rock lead, then you need this book.Troy's method is unique in that he has developed a notation system that combines guitar TAB with rhythm notation, which makes it very easy to learn what is being shown. All of the material is presented in bite sized pieces along with some pretty cool licks to practice it with. Everything that is in the book is demonstrated on the CD. Each chapter concludes with a complete original song with full band backing. It's played on the CD first with the lead part and then without, so that you can hear how it should sound and then jam along with the band. So at the end of the first chapter you're already playing lead guitar! However, I would not recommend this book to someone who is just starting to learn how to play. If you're a newbie I'd recommend Troy's &quot;Metal Lead Guitar Primer&quot; to learn all of the basics first (written in the same format with licks and songs).Troy also mixes in a little bit of music theory, speed exercises and improvisational technique, thus helping you to develop your own sound and style.It's very simple: IF YOU WANT TO LEARN TO PLAY ROCK LEAD GUITAR BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"I have several of Troy's books and love them all. I found this book to be a step back for me in knowledge. I knew probably 85% of this material but it did show me a couple cool licks so it's worth keeping. This would be a great first step before moving on to his advanced books. I'd say a late 1st year or more likely a 2nd year guitarist may really benefit from these useful lessons. His books are easy to read and understand since he keeps it simple. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Metal Lead Guitar/Book and Cd (Vol. 1)","review":"The Troy Stetina series is definitely the best instruction books series you can find today.

The other reviews about needing about 1 year of is experience are wrong, I could have pulled this off easily right away, because the book moves at such a slow pace anyway.

Plenty, if you happen to be Laurie Keller, and envision the mouthful of human teeth as a &quot;school.&quot;Kids will recognize many elements of the classroom setting here, including familiar &quot;types&quot; of students -- both dilligent and smarmy. The teeth learn their oral hygiene lessons from Dr. Flossman, but not without many a well-aimed pun and off-the-cuff wisecrack. A good dose of factual material craftily sneaks its way into all the silly stuff. Keller has a sure sense of what holds the interest of kids.

The &quot;characters&quot; in the book are wacky. This gets across the hygiene message very well, if the student can get past the humour to see the message, and get past the book's funky layout to absorb any information. Older picture book fans, perhaps age 5 and 6, and young readers will love this book. SOME younger children will enjoy it also, but the layout and style will be a tad overwhelming and confusing for the very young.If you like _Dr. Dog_, by Babette Cole, you'll love _Open Wide, Tooth School Inside_. If the hilarious, chaotic, don't-mind-if-we-gross-you-out style appeals to you, I bet you'll like both _Dr. Dog_ and _Open Wide, Tooth School Inside_.Incidentally, adult fans of this style of humor will love it too.ken32"},{"Title":"Open Wide: Tooth School Inside","review":"My 4-year-old and I have really enjoyed Keller's book, \\"The Scrambled States of America\\".

Another lot was sold successively for $2,500, $7,800, $10,000, $17,500 and finally, $35,000- the last purchaser being the man who sold it for $2,500.

These books talk about bubbles and how in different times in history entire societies become delusional about prices of things from, tulips, stock shares to real estate. It's truly an enlightening book that I highly recommend!I believe there are many underlying themes at work in the appreciation of the real estate market and as often happens when a certain asset class heats up there are sectors that will become distorted. Thinking about Florida, I cant help pondering the 76 million baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964. This extrapolates into roughly 11,599 boomers hitting 60 a day starting in 2006. Put another way that's 8 a minute.I know plenty of people in their 20's, 30's and 40's that want to own a place in Florida to be able to get away and warm up during the winters, so as this wave of retirees starts to get their second wind in life and may be winding down a career they may very well head south in droves.My partner and I own a few hospitality properties in Hollywood Beach Florida and can assure you that it's not just the US boomers that are enjoying South Florida. The Canadians head south at full speed in the winter to avoid the freezing cold, the feet upon feet of snow and freezing wind they get bombarded with. Come summer it's the Europeans that enjoy South Florida as Europe just about closes down for summer vacations. Surprisingly enough they don't mind the heat and humidity, they actually enjoy it.Recently I drove South on A1A, Ocean Ave. from Hollywood Beach to South Beach Miami and counted the buildings going up on the ocean. This is about a 20 minute drive and I was amazed by the number of condominiums, many of them pre sold before construction, many even sold out. I counted 22 projects. Not even taking into account anything that was not directly on the ocean. We know the reason for the demand; low interest rates, people disgusted with the stock market, the baby boomers heading south and of course the simple fact that people follow momentum. Price moves beget further price moves. When people hear about a friend or colleague that put down $50,000 or $100,000 on a pre construction condo in Florida and as soon as the construction started sold it for a $100,000 profit, its hard not to take a shot and hope the move lasts just a bit more. Even if the price of the unit is $1,000,000 or more, many times you can tie up the unit for a small down payment. Sort of like what the binder boys were doing in the 1920's Florida land boom.It's similarities like this and comments like, \\"Its different this time\\" that make me shake my head and say, \\"Here we go again\\".By Kevin Kingston, author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real EstateMy Blog:The Real Estate Investors BlogAt Bloglines"},{"Title":"Earthly and Heavenly Journey of Simone Martini (Green Integer)","review":"Viaggio terrestre e celeste di Simone Martini (1994):there was perhaps no poet more deserving of the Nobel prize.

It is a no-nonsense book with a lively approach - well, as lively as an appoach can be when you are studying grammar! Not only do you get the explanations in an easy to use format but you also get regognition exercises for each point you are studying. In addition, I love the little tit-bits that are included from time to time. For example, one of the &quot;trivia quiz&quot; secions asks you to name a noun hat ends in -ly (-ly ususlly indicated an adverb). Can you name one? I can after reading &quot;Grammar Smart&quot;! I love to trot out a gem like that and look more intelligent than I am! I think that calling this a grammar &quot;review&quot; is an accurate description. I am university educated and I am just using the book to brush up on a couple of things and making sure I know which part of speech is which. I would not recommend it for someone who may, for some reason, have had a disadvantehged education and would have to start from the beginning. For example, in one section, you are told, &quot;your ear should be able to tell the difference&quot;. Well, it should, but if you have grown up in an area where you are habitually bombarded with ungrammatical English, then that is whet your &quot;ear&quot; will tend to think of as the norm. But I like the idea in &quot;Grammar Smart&quot; - no rules for rule's sake. I heartily recommend this book and I intend to buy more books in the &quot;--- Smart&quot; series.

This book serves the purposes of a specialist reader and an outsider as well with good bibliography. However the philological problem may not have been introduced at the beginning, on the contrary the section on &quot;Readers' Homer&quot; may have been the choice for the first section.

Powell gets right to the point every time.He also summarizes both epics in ways that make the sometimes elusive themes stand out clearly. Anyone reading either poem will benefit immensely from this book.In fact, if you've *never* read Homer, you might want to read Powell's \\"Homer\\" just because it's likely to whet your appetite for both the Iliad and the Odyssey.

He threads together a wide scope of metaphors-- corn, gloves, roses, lightning, streams, autobuses--as he searches through life for meaning and truth. Sounds like a worn-out, pretentious topic? Think again...Neruda doesn't indulge in philosophical navel-gazing, but delves into the most earthy, mundane, yet painful details of life in his quest. He encounters not a simple answer but the revelation of past tragedy, and a role for himself in bringing about the truth of justice. The poem's beauty may not hit like lightning at first--it must be absorbed bit by bit.Although I must have read Poem 10 (Antigua America, novia sumergida) fifty times, it always sends chills down my spine and sends me thousands of feet high into the Andes. The Heights of Macchu Picchu has comforted me when I felt lonely, helped me write my college essays, and helped me see my future plans as worthwhile instead of idealistic mush. Anyone concerned with the history of Latin America, social justice, nature, or the works of Neruda should read this poem."},{"Title":"The Heights of Macchu Picchu","review":"What is the deal here? One of the great works by one of the great poets of the modern era and there is one review here? Neruda is to poetry what Marquez is to fiction. Superb insight, irony, metaphor, symbolism, etc. etc. combined with mastery of language (a universal language that does not depend upon a translator's skill). By God, if anyone stumbles across this title by mistake (as apparently that's the only way it's going to make itself known) BUY THIS BOOK! It will change the way you read poetry. Is Neruda out of fashion? That's like saying Voltaire or Dostoevsky are out of fashion. If you love literature, shell out the money for this volume or go to your local library and hope they have it. All you Bukowski lovers and avante-garde wannabe's. This is the father of your sect. He had more command of imagery in the tip of his finger than any beat poet or other poseur that's come along in the past 50 years."},{"Title":"The Heights of Macchu Picchu","review":"When I first read Nathaniel Tarn's translation of Pablo Neruda's great poem &quot;The Heights of Macchu Picchu,&quot; I was literally stunned. My immediate thoughts were two: incredulity that I had never encountered this masterpiece before, and an overwhelming desire to share it with as many people as I could.Such is the power of this book. The poem, inspired by the great Chilean poet's visit to the ancient, abandoned city of Macchu Picchu, is presented in a bilingual format; Neruda's Spanish original faces Tarn's English on each two-page spread.&quot;The Heights of Macchu Picchu&quot; contains lines of poetic language that are both beautiful and thought-provoking. But equally intrinsic to this great work is the author's compassion for the human condition--a compassion which transcends the boundaries of time and culture. Neruda's passionate addresses to the men and women who shed their blood and their tears in the construction of this ancient stone city nearly had me in tears myself.This is one of those remarkable poems which is pregnant with the fire of prophecy; it reads like a sacred text for the modern age. Neruda's miniature epic is, I believe, one of those works which will abide as a monument of global literature. It is a gift for the entire human family."},{"Title":"The Heights of Macchu Picchu","review":"Pablo Neruda, born in Chile 1904, is one of the greatest Latin American Poets to have livedwas one of Latin America&#65533;s greatest poets.The Heights of Macchu Picchu (considered by some to be his finest poem) was inspired by his journey to this famed ruined Peruvian Inca city. These poems take on a progressive journey within both the past of Latin America and the roots of the poet himself.Lovers and devoted students of poetry will be caught up in Neruda's poetic power, hopefully capturing the quintessence of this great poets mind. Others, like myself, who are occasional readers of poetry, may need to reread his words, but, through the rereading, Neruda's own spirit will descend into you mind.Pablo Neruda speaks to the heart and struggle of us all, as he writes, \\"How many times in wintry streets, or in a bus, a boat a dusk,.... in the very lair of human pleasure, have I wanted to pause and look for the eternal, unfathomable truth's filament I'd fingered once in stone, or in the flash of a kiss released.\\" Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Heights of Macchu Picchu","review":"Every review here mentions the spectacular nature of Neruda's captivating poem. As he said himself, he follows the philosophy of Rimbaud and arms himself with a \\"burning patience\\" that allows him to \\"enter splendid cities.\\" However, the translation falls short of the quality of Neruda's words. Tarn inserts his own interpretations/images in his word choice which result in the creation of a new poem--ocassionally distant or discordant with the original. (quick example: in Canto XII, Neruda twice uses the word \\"r&iacute;o\\" in one of many instances of repetition in the poem. Tarn replaces the first use with \\"torrent\\" and the second with \\"Amazon.\\" He effectively removed Neruda's use of repetition and inserted a proper noun which carries with it connotations perhaps not intended by Neruda. This is merely one of many instances where Tarn's translation subtly, but importantly changes the poem's meaning). However, if you are a lover of Neruda poems and have a reasonable grasp of Spanish, this is an essential for your collection.6 stars for the poem, 2 for the translation = overall score of 4 stars"},{"Title":"The Heights of Macchu Picchu","review":"I don't really feel it is necessary to add my humble opinion about Neruda, his poetry, or this particular collection of poems. If you are even considering purchasing this book, then you are on the right track. I would, however, like to add a few comments about this particular edition.I was somewhat confused because one reviewer stated the book was only in English, although the book claims to be a bilingual edition. I purchased it anyway due to the difficutly in general of finding some Spanish language literature in this country, and even on this site, with the intention to return it if it was only in English. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find it was indeed a bilingual edition. The cover art is quite different on the copy I received - just an observation.If you are buying this book for the original Spanish version, then I can highly recommend this book. However, I must agree with several other reviewers as to the quality of the English translation. Honestly, and I hate to say it, but it is terrible. I realize that translating great poetry is a formidable task, and that certain license may need to be taken, but I have many other bilingual poetry editions (in several other languages as well) where the English versions are faithful to the original and yet beautiful in their own right, and where I have even felt occasionally that a reading of the English version can actually enhance the overall experience of the poem. This is definitely not the case with this translation. After reading the Spanish, I would find myself peeking over at the English, and thinking to myself, \\"What on earth was Tarn thinking?\\" Some of the liberties Tarn has taken... At one point, I seriously felt like taking a Sharpie to the English versions to obliterate them entirely. Realizing that this was probably a little extreme, and would certainly destroy the Spanish poetry on the other side of the paper, I have settled on making copies of the Spanish versions and putting them in a notebook so as to avoid the English versions entirely. I realize this may sound extreme, but only if you have not read the translations. Even if your Spanish is intermediate, you would probably be better off with this book (or a Spanish only version if you can find one) and a good dictionary.All of that having been said, the introduction is adequate. And, of course, Neruda is remarkable."},{"Title":"The Heights of Macchu Picchu","review":"I printed this book in 1986 in Bandon, Oregon using a Vandercook Universal #3 Press, Lutetia type from Harold Berliner's Typefoundry on Arches laid paper.There are several inaccurate assumptions in the reviews here. Most importantly, this is not a Tarn translation. It is by the poet David Young, editor of Field Magazine at Oberlin College. His translations of Rilke are equally stunning.This is an English only edition: Farrar, Straus & Giroux owns ALL English versions of Neruda published in English (or did so at that time) and the Neruda Estate owned the Spanish. It took 18 months to receive permission for 155 editions of the English and the Spanish permissions were far more daunting.The binding was done by Greg Campbell at Campbell-Logan Bindery in St. Paul, Minn. I used green Roma paper over boards with red cloth 1/4 bound spine.The full page line drawing of the condor was done by Jack Schroeder, a well known artist from the Eastern Shore of Maryland.

It is an expansion and development of his earlier themes, and considering the circumstances under which it was written (Peake was suffering from premature senility that eventually lead to his death, he could barely lift a pencil.) it is an extraordinary and painful novel. Leaving Gormenghast and its (surviving) inhabitants behind, the novel centres on the character of Titus, and crucially puts the earlier novels in context. Despite his mother's warnings at the end of Gormenghast, there is indeed a world beyond the walls, and a world which has progressed beyond the ritual and claustrophobia of the castle itself. There is technology here. And - most extraordinary of all - no one has ever heard of Gormenghast itself. Suddenly Titus is accused of insanity (among other things) and even begins to doubt the existence of his home himself. As disturbing and beautiful as anything that went before, Titus Alone was never meant to be the end of the series. Peake was planning to take Titus even further afield, but as merely a glimpse of the outside world, the novel is an essential part of an extraordinary work of literature."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"This is the third and last volume of the Gormenghast trilogy (after Titus Groan, and Gormenghast).In this book, we follow Titus, now almost twenty, as he escapes from the Castle, flees its oppressive Ritual, and becomes lost in a sandstorm. Helped by the owner of a travelling zoo, Muzzlehatch, and his ex-lover Juno, he ends up in a big city. Of course, no one there has ever heard of Gormenghast, and the general opinion is that the boy is deranged, and with no paper, he's soon arrested for vagrancy.Hopefully, there are a few people who believe in his story, or at least who are intrigued by it, and they try to help him. And now Titus, the deserter, the traitor, longs for his home, and looks for it all the time to prove, if only to himself, that Gormenghast is truly real.I don't know how closely Titus Alone actually follows Mervyn Peake's intentions before mental illness struck him, but this final volume is indeed chaotic. Its characters and style, its setting and atmosphere have little to do with both previous books. Or maybe it's just me who didn't understand anything, but nevertheless, all I felt was bitter frustration."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"I enjoyed this book very much but it IS rather different from the preceding novels (Titus Groan, Gormenghast), which are really complete as a pair. Though related it is not necessary to have read them in order to follow the action of this story.Young Titus Groan, Lord of Gormenghast after his Father's assassination and the death of the villainous Steerforth, decides to set out to see something of the world beyond the eccentric traditions of his decayed and moribund realm. He finds a decaying and eccentric city, where he makes some allies as he becomes a nine-days wonder.Peake excelled at depiction of a monstrous and decaying world filled with wierd eccentrics. If you like that kind of thing, you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"It is important to note that although Robert Whitfield does an excellent reading job on this and the other two Titus novels, the source material for this audiobook is NOT the current preferred text of \\"Titus Alone\\" that was restored by Langdon Jones. The source material for this audiobook is the Ballantine Books paperback edition, which included substantial alterations and cuts to Mervyn Peake's original manuscript. This version is substantially different (and not in a good way) from the \\"director's cut\\" (for lack of a better term) version of \\"Titus Alone\\" that was published later by Overlook Press, and which also appears in the deluxe Folio Society edition."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"On one level, it seems appropriate to compare the Gormenghast trilogy with the cinematic classic \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" If the first two books of the trilogy equate to Dorothy in Kansas- grey, classical, lacking in color yet not lacking in intensity- then \\"Titus Alone\\", the third book in the trilogy, is Dorothy in Oz- colorful, unpredictable, and, at times, quite chaotic.The book begins as the title suggests, with Titus, the heir to the Gormenghast throne, alone and on the run. Seeking to flee the responsibilities of being the head of the Groan dynasty, Titus escapes and soon finds himself in a world beyond his comprehension. Buildings, vehicles, people, laws, rituals- all that he observes is foreign, intriguing yet at the same time frightening. An outlaw on the run, and an obvious stranger in a stranger land, Titus finds himself entangled in the lives of several unique Peake characters: Juno, a voluptuous woman; Cheeta, a female hellcat; and Muzzlehatch, a giant sized loner, among others.\\"Titus Alone\\" is both a book of action (as Titus must escape from several dangerous situations) and psychology (as Titus must deal with the fact that he is escaping from a world that literally no one has heard of.) Titus begins to doubt his own sanity and several people in this new world (Cheeta most dramatically) attempt to further his psychological confusion and bring Titus to his metaphorical knees.While \\"Titus Alone\\" is generally not as critically acclaimed as the first two books in the series, it is nonetheless a great book. While it definitely has a different tone and pace than the beginning of the trilogy, it fits in and makes for a thrilling conclusion to an epic work of fiction.If you read \\"Titus Groan\\" and \\"Gormenghast\\", do not miss out on this one."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"Mervyn Peake's magnum opus began inTitus Groan, and continued inGormenghast, two brilliant (though door-stopping) books that explored the lives of those that exist in a self-contained, self-sufficient edifice known as Gormenghast: a labyrinthine world of towers, mansions, slums, and the corridors that connect them all. It is ruled by ancient and meaningless ritual, something that the titular character of Titus, Seventy-Seventh Earl of Gormenghast, has rejected. In the final passages of \\"Gormenghast,\\" Titus chooses to abandon his home and seek out the world that lies beyond his its borders.It was an exciting, rewarding finish to the colossal two-part novel, and its sequel opens with our protagonist alone for first time in his life, wandering in the world that he never knew existed. Having left his entire world behind, and carrying only a flint as a reminder of his home, Titus is on a quest for...what? He himself isn't sure, but it becomes clear enough to the reader that he's looking for self-knowledge and a sense of who he is outside his past, his home and his title as Earl of Gormenghast. The ritual and history that has informed his entire existence is now gone, and Titus struggles to understand himself and his place without it. The fact that no one in his travels has ever heard of Gormenghast and suspect Titus of insanity and vagrancy, only adds to his identity crisis.For Titus, the mere fact that a world exists outside of Gormenghast is astounding. Gormenghast was a world of its own that seemed to exist in some unspecified time period (it really could have been at any point from the Middle Ages to the Victorian Era), but outside the walls there are factories, cars, airplanes, helicopters and even what seem to be technologically advanced spy-crafts. The move from Gothic fantasy to science-fiction may be jarring for some readers, but one can't help but be fascinated at Titus's shock and exploration of this new city of glass and concrete.The story is, quite frankly, bizarre and erratic. Titus is washed up on a riverbank and taken in by the indescribable Muzzlehatch, the owner of an exotic menagerie of animals, and who seems to take an odd interest in Titus's wellbeing. Titus goes on to experience his sexual awakening with a beautiful, middle-aged woman, as well as its antithesis (lust and indifference) with a young woman his own age, who engineers an elaborate scheme against him once she realizes his lack of sincere feeling toward her. These are the most easily-described aspects of the story; it also includes two helmeted men that are tracking down Titus, a range of characters who live in the darkened world of Under-River, and an ominous factory that seemed to run on human lives. These portions of the story feel erratic and nonsensical, though this is only to be expected considering Peake's declining health at the time.Mervyn Peake was writing \\"Titus Alone\\" in the midst of the early stages of Parkinson's Disease (as well as a history of depression and nervous break-downs), and though it was published *before* his death, there were examples of careless editing and several inconsistencies that suggest it wasn't completed to his satisfaction. In 1970 Langdon Jones reconstructed several chapters of the novel, working from three separate versions of the manuscript as well as new material in Peake's notebooks in order to reach the edition that most readers will be familiar with. Yet even with this meticulous care, one cannot shake the sense of incoherency in \\"Titus Alone.\\" There is a lack of structure and continuity here: introduced characters that drop in and out of the story, plot devices that go nowhere, and several moments of sheer weirdness. Peake worked through his illness, and the language is as beautiful and rich as always, but it does seem as though this is a draft that still needs extensive polishing.It poses a problem when it comes to a recommendation. On the one hand, readers of the first two books will be somewhat uncomfortable at the change in tone and setting; on the other, this book will mean virtually nothing to newcomers. The first two novels form a complete story, with an open but satisfactory ending. For those pressed for time, or not particularly involved in this saga, \\"Titus Alone\\" is not strictly necessary, and \\"Titus Groan\\" and \\"Gormenghast\\" make up the best that Peake has to offer (in fact, the BBC's miniseries of the show adapts these two initial novels, but doesn't even touch \\"Titus Alone.\\")As other reviewers have mentioned, is not the third and final book in a \\"trilogy\\" - it is the latest installment in a series that sadly was cut short due to the author's death. Titus's story was originally designed as a series that would have followed Titus's life from infant to grown man (it shouldn't be too difficult to track down the opening segment of Peake's proposed forth novel: \\"Titus Awakes\\" on the internet) and it's heartbreaking that we'll never get Peake's complete vision. As it stands \\"Titus Alone\\" will appeal mostly to completists or fans; those who come into this novel knowing that it is, in a sense \\"incomplete.\\""},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"Peake's own unique style and gift with language are still present here, as are some interesting new characters. Titus is a young man now, seeking his identity while exploring a new world, previously unknown to him. It is amazing that Peake maintained such an original vision for all 3 of these books, and that his beautiful pictures with words are never diminished. Perhaps because of the consistent quality and style, the effect and freshness of the language and characters are somewhat diminished by this third book. It may have been approaching too much of a good thing. It's hard to find any fault with such an achievement as these books, however, which I have so far found nothing to compare to in the science fiction/fantasy genre. Like them or not, these books largely created their own genre, and are a rewarding reading experience."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"Mervyn Peake's vast Gormenghast series is often mischaracterized as a trilogy - a crucial inaccuracy that is seen in several of the reviews here. Actually Peake meant for the saga to be an open-ended series covering the life and times of the protagonist Titus. Also, this third installment was apparently incomplete at the time of Peake's death and was written under less-than-ideal conditions during an illness. Thus, this third installment is an abrupt and initially unpleasant departure from its two predecessors, the vast and moody gothic epics \\"Titus Groan\\" and \\"Gormenghast.\\" In \\"Titus Alone,\\" young Titus has escaped his claustrophobic and isolated existence in the dreary Gormenghast castle and has wandered into a bizarre dystopian sci-fi society where nobody has heard of his kingdom, thus throwing his entire self-image and even his sanity into doubt.Fans of the first two novels in the series might be disappointed, or just plain flabbergasted, by this installment's abrupt shift in mood and setting. The vaguely-defined science fiction setting and gadgets, especially, don't mix too well with the rest of the series. On the other side of the coin, this installment probably will make no sense as a stand-alone story, which is not necessarily the case with its two predecessors. However, readers with open minds will still find reasons to love this installment on its own merits, as it is really a unique coming-of-age story, with Titus questioning his very existence as he escapes a society in which he is a worshipped leader and ends up anonymous in a city of indifference and danger.So the problem with \\"Titus Alone\\" is that it is inextricably linked to its two predecessors but is a radical departure from them. That will cause trouble with many fans of the series, but other fans will be able to stomach the abrupt shift and appreciate this story's uniqueness. Fans will have to take their chances, but a good percentage of them will eventually feel rewarded. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"While this review isn't for this particular edition of the book, I thought it best belongs here, as a review of the third novel itself:Firstly, I was surprised that no one else had corrected the notion (that even the product review implies!) that this book is the final installment to a trilogy: it is not. It is simply the third book in a projected series about Titus, and the novel in which the focus shifts from the world of Titus's childhood (Gormenghast) into Peake's broader fantasy world. So, if you loved the first two books because of the world of Gormenghast, be warned that this book is different.This is the story of Titus going out into the wider word, a definite a coming of age story (closing line of the third-to-last paragraph: \\"He had grown up. What a boy had set out to find a man had found, found by the act of living.\\") and the story of what happens to someone when they leave a place like Gormenghast behind completely (even to the point of other people being thoroughly ignorant of its existence).It is not a particularly structured novel, but I think that its crazy meanderings, beautiful writing and marvelous characters (especially Muzzlehatch) are its greatest strengths. It reminds me of nothing so much as Petronius's Satyricon, and contains all at once a heart-breaking sadness, a horrifying picture of the dangers of the modern world and deliciously bizarre humor.It's not a book for everyone, especially people who are caught up in the neat story of Gormenghast in the first two novels, but I have a great respect and deep love for this book. A perhaps challenging read but one infinitely rewarding that will engage the imagination and the mind."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"I went into this novel knowing that it was reputedly the worst of the bunch due to the author's ailing health, and for the most part everyone is right. The story is a bit disjointed and reminded me a lot of the sort of random-occurrences shtick of The Phantom Tollbooth. Things seem to happen for little reason but the entire time you get the feeling that everything is very symbolic. If not accessibly symbolic to the rest of us then at the very least, personally symbolic for Mr. Peake.I tried to read the book quickly so that I could get that lasting-impression quality that one gets a few weeks after finishing a book. You know what I mean? That feeling when you don't really remember the exact details of what happened but you can recall the overall gist or point of the story? That's what I was aiming for. I attempted this mostly because I knew that it was an incomplete novel and wanted to see if I could grasp what Mervyn Peake might've been going for had he been of mind to bring it to life the way he envisioned. I didn't really read it piece-by-piece so much as letting my eyes fly over the paragraphs and dialogue searching for the big picture--and mostly I think I got there.The book seems to be the first of many adventures that follow Titus in his life outside of Gormenghast. There are a lot of new characters introduced, many of which I feel Mr. Peake would've done more with in subsequent books had he been able to continue. Nevertheless, there was definitely an insane sort of feel to the book which I find particularly potent considering the author's state during its formulation...indeed madness is the book's big question and the source of Titus' woes in this read.Still, things being so disjointed and unfleshed out (many chapters were, literally, half a page in length leaving one with the distinct impression that the author intended to go back and flesh out the idea of the section) makes it hard for me to give it above a 3. It is a novelty for any Gormenghast fan just to say they've read it, but I doubt I'll be perusing its pages again."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"If you like battle of good and evil in a fantasy setting this is for you. Dense plottimg, full characters, language intense."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"Titius Alone is the last, and admittedly weakest, of Peake*s great Gormenghast trilogy. In it, the self-exiled young Lord Titus Groan now confronts the world he desired to see. Before, the brooding pile of the Castle, a character in its own right, had influenced everyone, everything within it, even the spirited Titus. Its absence already throws this book out of kilter with the first two; it really is necessary to read the others first to uncerstand this one. The world Titus enters is still no less macabre, a city of spires and airships (it is never clear just when the era is). The people, animal lover Muzzlehatch, tragic Black Rose, no less compelling. Yet the story appears incomplete, there exists rebellion, fights, illness, Titus is bewitchingly betrayed by the girl who once loved him--but all throughout, whatever Titus, and the book, is seeking, still remains elusive. He had sought to be free of his dark home Gormenghast, yet carries his title nonetheless, a name mocked by nearly everyone he meets. I have not personally read this edition, but actively seek it, as it contains Peake*s notes and further ideas, that may have fleshed out Titus in adulthood. The ending of this book is abrupt--all but within site of the Castle, he yet turns and leaves once again--a scene rather disappointing, certainly puzzling. While it is too much to ask that someone take up a sequel (it is like trying to add on to CS Lewis), this reader yet wonders, *What happened after......* Not for everyone*s taste, or even for all who enjoyed the depth of the first two, but a thoughtful last look, a final postcard from a twisting, tangled journey."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"This is supposed to be part 3 of the trilogy, but it has VERY little to do with the first 2 books (both of which I loved, BTW). The only thing in common with the first books is the character of Titus (who was a baby in the first book, so was really only a character in the second book). The first 2 books spend much (most) of their time in a rather enchanting world that is confined to a castle and the immediate area around it, yet none of this book takes place there. Much more disturbing, however, is this volume takes place in a VERY different time period than the first two books. The first 2 take place in a castle that is lit by candles and has no visible technology (the only thing that is described that was invented in the last 800 years is a reference to \\"guns\\", but they are never used and it is unknown how primitive the \\"guns\\" would be). In this book they have cars, airplanes(!), and tiny self propelled spy devices that don't even exist today! (Not to mention helmets that give you superhuman strength, and other fantastic future things - it goes from medieval castle straight to comic-book future). It is not even internally consistant - one woman flys an airplane to visit a ruin she last saw during a failed expedition to explore the unknown in one direction, an expedition that had to quit because of an unpenatratable LINE OF TREES (were the trees so tall they could stop the airplanes?). At \\"plot\\" is barely in existance, and has lots of people doing things for no rational or decernable reason (really a stark contrast to the first 2 stories, which went to some length to give you insight into the characters).Read the first two, then skip this one - it is not only not in their league, it will actually diminish your remembered enjoyment of the first two."},{"Title":"TITUS ALONE","review":"To my knowlege, the only thing ever written in the English language that even comes close is Shakespeare's latter plays.

If you can imagine Dickens writing gothic fantasy with the linguistic range of a poet then you are close. After buying the Audiobook trilogy by Michael Williams I can't recommend it highly enough. His voice is as rich as the characters that he is required to give life to. By turns crackling, humorous, bitter, angry, pathetic, depressed, ludicrous: Michael Williams voice catches the many moods and characters of these world's inhabitants and manages to convey the spidery, rasping, cloistered, dark and gothic atmosphere.

The authors describe methods and activities that will help teachers encourage children to speak their mind and learn more about the world around them. It can be something as asking questions about a homeless person or as big as writing down their worries about crime in their neighborhood.The authors explain how it isn't our responsibility as adults to tell kids what to think, but rather to nurture and respect their thoughts and feelings on the issues in their lives that they have questions about. In fact, several anecdotes (like the Blue Angels story - which is used as an example of how one author wished she had involved parents in the project) serve as examples as to how the authors had to themselves learn how to help children stand up for what they think is right while not imposing their points-of-view upon them.I encourage anyone who works with young children to take a long look at this wonderful resource.

It's a rejection of the concept of reason & justice. For the authors of \\"Not Fair,\\" there is no difference between the liberty of the United States and the gas chambers of Nazi Germany. All are equal in value in their eyes. Like Reuters, their view is that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Thus one man's free country is another man's prison.I'm sure though, that if one suggested that one man's rapist is a another's feminist, these authors might have a bone to pick with you about that.What do they mean by fairness? They mean *feelings*.In the forward of this book they make that explicitly clear. What they term \\"fair\\" is what *feels* fair: A child's innate *feelings* that the unwillingness to share one's toys is wrong; kids' innate *feelings* of pity for bums; and children's *feelings* that litter in a park is bad.Clearly these authors are examples of exactly what they preach: minds out of focus lead by feelings. They are equating childish emotionalism -- you'd better share your toys with me (or else what?) -- with a sense of justice arrived at through reason.Reason & a sense of justice would force one to ask: How just -- how fair -- is it to *force* someone to share their property? And why is it \\"unfair\\" if I chose not to share my toys?How fair is it to be forced to support people who panhandle for a living? Am I responsible for their choices? (No one has any real choice, the authors would respond. We're all products of society. We're just trying to \\"reconstruct\\" society, starting with 3-year olds.)As for litter in a public park, perhaps we'd better ask the homeless about that. But bringing that up isn't \\"fair,\\" is it?This is a manual for raising a child to rely on his emotions when faced with any issue and eschew reason and objectivity, as well as rights, freedom and their foundation, justice.Don't like the prices companies ask for their products? -- organize international riots that destroy property, block public thoroughfares and promote looting; then self-righteously claim you are acting out of \\"fairness.\\"Don't like the final score of the football game? Get drunk and riot.Don't like people building homes where animals once lived? Burn the homes down.Don't like scientists doing research on animals to save humans? Blow up the labs.Don't like certain government laws? Blow up the federal building in OK City.Etc.The educational establishment -- of which these two authors are especially good examples -- is ruled by a pedagogy of whim worship. Their aim is to socialize, equalize, level and conform. Conform to what? To the notion that whatever \\"feels\\" fair is what *is* fair.They are biased against reason & justice & values of any kind. They are emotionalist absolutists who despise individual freedom.The only thing fair about \\"Not Fair\\" is that those who believe in its ideas and feed it to their children will, when their children grow up, get exactly what they deserve: little Hitlers.Now that's what I call fair."},{"Title":"That's Not Fair!: A Teacher's Guide to Activism with Young Children","review":"This now out-of-print book would have passed into the obscurity it show richly deserves, were it not for Bernard Goldberg's bestseller \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America.\\" \\"That's Not Fair\\" author Ann Pelo is No. 51 on the list, and her book is the reason why.

An English child is left an orphan in Palestine and is raised as a Muslim soldier in Egypt. The Mameluke Corps. that is the basis for this book was a real organization of slave soldiers derived from Christian and pagan boys from Russia, Circassia (now in southern Russia), as well as from Asia Minor, Greece, and sometimes Central Asia. These boys were raised as the Jannisaries were in the Ottoman armies. Strictly pious Muslims trained in all the arts of war. The Crusaders had some similar, and sometimes equally rambunctious, military weapon in the Military Orders such as the Templars and Hospitallers. Mostly of Franco-Belgian ancestry and fervent Catholic Christians, the Crusades were quickly forgotten in the Middle East until the return of Europeans in the form of the Israelis (the Ashkenazi) and the French and English administrators with troops derived from their vast domains stretching from Indo-China and North Africa to India and the Americas. This book was well researched and the character of Baybars is a menacing supersoldier, albeit somewhat heroically portrayed since the Mamelukes were ferocious fighters and were the only army to halt the Mongol advance. Some historians argue that this Mongol army that the Mamelukes defeated was not the same as the one Genghis Khan had led, but many in the Islamic world believe that if Egypt had fallen so too would have Islam. This unlikely viewpoint is conveyed in this book as we see things from the point of views of the participants including a French knight, an English-born Mameluke, and the woman they both love/lust. Romantized for effect, the history is interesting and vivid. The brutal military training that Daud has to endure matches closely the theories of many historians as to how the Mamelukes were trained. It's worth a look as something original and will entertain without a doubt."},{"Title":"The Saracen: Land of the Infidel","review":"Just picked this book up used; as a long-time fan of R.A.

Finding Her Voice is a seminal work of music history scholarship and a superb educational text and resource which is especially recommended for American Music History academic reference collections and to dedicated country music fans."},{"Title":"Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music, 1800-2000","review":"A female social historian and a male music journalist co-wrote this wide-ranging book, which traces the history of country music through its women. Well, nobody could write such a book without mentioning plenty of men along the way, but the story is definitely about the women. It begins in the nineteenth century and discusses every famous female country singer (and plenty of obscure ones) up to the year 2000, but there is far more to this book than that.Because this book is about social history as well as country music, it reminds us of life as it used to be without tap water and without electricity. While men spent all day working on the farm or in the factory, women spent all day doing the housework. This included fetching water in buckets from the nearest well, among other chores that are long since consigned to history in the developed world. So it was that the kind of songs that women sang were often very different from the kind of songs that men sang. Over time, technology, wars and other developments changed everybody's lives.Two world wars opened opportunities for women. In between, an economic depression, compounded by the dust bowl, caused mass-migration as people fled the impoverished southern states. All these developments and others became reflected in the music that women sang and recorded. The mass-migration that started in the thirties took country music all around America. Later, American troops took their music to wherever they served in he second world war including Europe, Australia and Japan. Social changes including women's liberation all made their mark on country music. In business generally, women had to fight hard to break down barriers, and country music reflects this. As women have penetrated male business bastions, they have attained important managerial and boardroom position in the country music business. The book suggests that Frances Preston is one of the most influential people in country music, or in any music. Maybe, but your average country music fan has probably never heard of her. Still, she deserves her place in this book.As far as the music itself is concerned, every aspect of country music seems to be covered, including women raised on country music but who became successful pop singers, as well as outsiders who achieved varying degrees of success within country music. In the forties, it seems that there was an abundance of female country singers performing live, most famously Rose Maddox, but the male-dominated country music industry didn't give them much of a chance on record. Yet some of the most successful female pop singers of the era were raised on country, including the Dinning sisters, Patti Page, Dinah Shore, Kay Starr and Jo Stafford. To varying degrees, their country heritage shows in their recorded music. Margaret Whiting was the first outsider to make a big impact on country music, when she teamed up with Jimmy Wakely for a series of duets. Those duets had an impact that lasted long after Margaret and Jimmy stopped recording together. It seems that country music fans happily accepted Margaret at the time, but other outsiders were controversial. Olivia Newton-John made a big impact on country music for a time in the mid-seventies, but while she had plenty of supporters, others were hostile to say the least. All of these singers are discussed, though of course the women that have made their career in country music get more coverage.All the big names that you would expect to find are discussed, but it is refreshing to read, however briefly, about some singers who I wouldn't necessarily have expected to get a mention, such as Sheila Andrews, Diana Trask, the Burch sisters and Dottsy. Female songwriters such as Cindy Walker, Susanna Clark and Rhonda Kye Fleming are also given due coverage, although Matraca Berg and Beth Neilsen Chapman only get a couple of brief mentions each in passing. The first edition of this book was published in 1993, when they were still establishing their reputations. The revisions for the second edition seem to focus mainly on the singers.With a substantial bibliography as well as an index to the 500+ main pages, this book is a veritable goldmine of information. Any quibbles I have are minor, as this will be one of my most-referenced books for years to come."},{"Title":"Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music, 1800-2000","review":"A wonderful book!

It is about working with and within the cycle of nature to produce optimum results. Composting, conserving and feeding the soil are primary principles in this partnership between man and nature. Pay Dirt expresses this eloquently, and provides the proof and know how behind the organic approach. Good dirt pays dividends in many ways, as Rodale makes clear. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Pay dirt;: Farming & gardening with composts,","review":"I bought this book on a whim when I took a Master Composter class, and it's a fascinating read. Rodale is largely credited with bringing organic practises to the United States, and he wrote this book apparently shortly after returning from Europe, where he'd been doing his research. His observations always are tied into his reasoning, and at the time there was very little science to back up what he saw regarding health (human, animal & plant) and organic food. Now the science is starting to prove his thoughts were right.The jist of this is that using compost transfers nutrients into plants, and that these nutrients are not simple. We are only just beginning to understand this, maybe we are only beginning to understand that we understand very little. Mr. Rodale grasps this concept, examines the science of his time, as well as organic practises from all over the planet, and comes up with some remarkable suggestions for the home gardner and the farmer alike. His writing is a lot of fun, too."},{"Title":"Denmark (Lonely Planet Denmark)","review":"I have used Lonely Planet guide books in many countries and find them to be the superior guide book for all destinations... in the third world.

Unfortunately, Kyra longs for compromising situations with Jesse. So she decides to assert her desires and kidnap Jesse at the Gasparilla event--Florida's equivalent of Mardi Gras. Dressed as a pirate/domoninatrix, she steals Jesse from his fashion model escort without apology.Jesse sucks at relationships and does not appreciated being wanted just for sex. After all, he thought Kyra was the one female in his life who saw him as something more than a sex object. Meanwhile, Kyra nurses a bruised heart because she is the only woman Jesse never seems to want. She announces that she intends to take advantage of his bad boy reputation and wield every trick of seduction she has witnessed him using. Nevertheless, despite his opportune rescue at Gasparilla and Kyra's wildly seductive offer, Jesse refuses Kyra's overt overtures.Crossing the boundaries between friends and lovers results in a richly sensual read in WILD AND WICKED. As Jesse and Kyra explore promising possibilities, this consummates bad boy finds traditional sexual roles reversed. Amidst rampant lust, Kyra exercises her unused feminine wiles in her determination to win her night with Jesse. But events do not follow either of their plans, resulting in a novel rich with emotional complexity. Author Joanne Rock's sleek, sensuous prose smolders with eroticism, building to a wildly provocative Blaze that belongs on the keeper shelf. WILD AND WICKED comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wild and Wicked (Harlequin Blaze, No 87)","review":"Kyra Stafford knows she loves her Crooked Branch Horse Farms business partner Jesse Chandler, but though he has hit on every other available female in Citrus County, he has never given her a smoldering look. After waiting for years for him to notice her beyond being a best pal since they first met when she was ten, Kyra decides she either must free her soul to love someone else or open his heart to what she really wants, a lifetime with him.During a pirate's festivity, Kyra abducts Jesse informing him that he will service her if he wants his freedom. Hesitant to destroy a friendship by seducing the one woman he actually cares about, bad boy Jesse cannot resist her lure. One night of sex and their roles reverse. While Kyra ignores her beloved except for ranching, Jesse desperately wants what he never sought before, commitment. Perhaps abduction is the way to go.Though conceptually abduction sends a bad message, Joanne Rock keeps her tale light, heated and romantic. The story line is fun, as Kyra and Jesse are warm ethical individuals who the audience will adore. The support cast enables the reader to understand the duo especially Jesse's motives to keep his roving hands off Kyra, who tries to change from quiet innocent to WILD AND WICKED temptress.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wild and Wicked (Harlequin Blaze, No 87)","review":"I'm not going to do the synopsis thing, because other reviewers do it better. I just want to add another viewpoint. I really thought that Jesse and Kyra had NO chemistry; they were just two people having sex. They were also supposed to have been best friends for years, but it seemed like they were just getting to know each other. I had a hard time with the relationship, and Kyra doesn't seem to be the sticking type. She changed her mind so many tmes, that I'm suprised poor Jesse could stand it.The really good aspect of this story was the side plot/romance between Kyra's equine psychologist, Clint, and Greta, an ex-lover of Jesse's who can't let go.

My thought is that the Shadow-line is a novel apart. The first world war is obliquely alluded in this novel, like a Kurt Vonnegut did for the second world war in his Slaughter's house five. This is not the easier of Conrad's novel to read, though it looks like a bildungsroman at first glance. Other oblique subjects lye behind the plot and the words. A must-have !"},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"I enjoyed reading about the main characters experience of crossing the line from youthfulness into true adulthood. Conrad's eloquent, descriptive, and almost surreal writing style allows the reader to almost experience the stagnation, heat, and frustration that envelop the characters in this book. Perhaps not Conrad's best book, but certainly a good read, and it is quite short and to the point. Especially if you have an affinity for sailing and the power and majesty of the sailing vessels of old. I have always felt that there is a certain amount of effort required to enjoy Conrad's books, but I also feel that this, in a sense, is directly proportional to effort in life. The more you put in, the more you get out."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"THE SHADOW-LINE is not one of Conrad's more obscure works, but neither is it among his most famous. It is short, beautiful and very accessible, and deserves to be read. It is about growing up, growing into ones self and conscience, with the understanding that sometimes external events come along to force the maturation process nearly overnight, and if you are lucky, you swim. As he states in the author's note that has accompanied the text since the second edition, his mind was on his son Borys and his comrades who were off fighting in World War I at the time. The landscape of his story, though, comes out of his own youthful experience at sea.The unnamed first person narrator of THE SHADOW-LINE has already distinguished himself at sea but is still a young man given to youthful emotion and brashness. He has decided that despite friendships, his love of the sea and his skills, that there is an absence of meaning to his career and he is emphatically throwing it off at a South Seas port with the intention of going home. But then he is made the one offer he cannot resist: his own command of a full-masted commercial barque that has come to port after the captain had gone mad with disease and was buried at sea. The narrator quickly pushes to get back out on the open seas despite the fact that the first mate seems to be growing increasingly sick. Suddenly stuck out where he had originally wanted to be, the narrator is faced with the spread of illness across the crew and the discovery that his deceased predecessor had destroyed the ship's pharmacy in his derangement. The responsibility of the situation would be terrible in any circumstances, much less a first command.The Penguin edition contains a lengthy critical introduction (ridden with spoilers, by the way), an annotated critical bibliography, and text notes. The latter define technical and arcane terms but also note where the story dovetails with facts of Conrad's own life. All of these are useful, but the novel itself is what is valuable here, with its memorable characters and honest descriptive passages of both exterior and interior worlds."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"One of Conrad's best novels, less profound than Heart of Darkness, certainly, but more economically written and featuring a narrator that more readers will identify with.The Shadow Line is a nice sequel of sorts to Conrad's great story \\"Youth.\\" In that, he showed how we often interpret events differently as youngsters and years later as adults. In The Shadow Line, the young protagonist has to improvise under stress to deal with the big world he's grown into.Like all Conrad's works, this is wordy and slow by current standards, but well worth the time and effort to read it. Great practice for high-school seniors and college freshmen who want to step up to real literature."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"This is a wonderful novela - it vividly articulates the anxiety of a young man moving into adulthood, frustrated by that transition's need to narrow the scope of one's life, leave behind the boundless possibility of youth and make choices that define a focused \\"adult\\" life. The problem is that this line of demarcation between youth and adulthood is shadowy, and maybe not even really there - we are ever evolving into it, perhaps never to finally or fully arrive. I first read the book when I was rather young and it resonated with me because it made adulthood more about recognizing or accepting one's limitations, rather than overcoming them through some individual \\"heroic\\" effort (re-understanding the idea of heroism)."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"I feel entirely unqualified to be critical of a master writer such as Conrad, but in my view this novel is not in the same league as his others. I'm more a fan of Lord Jim and Victory and was expecting something along those lines. This novel deals with the inner emotions and thoughts of a young sailor who suddenly becomes a ship captain. There is very little action, but the storyline is still somewhat interesting. I just don't think its one of Conrad's better works; possibly because I was expecting something entirely different."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"The shadow-line is a classic coming-of-age tale. The title is fitting - dramatic seafaring events push the narrator towards, and eventually over, that hazy line between youth and adulthood. Conrad's themes and lessons are timeless and he made it short and easily digestible. Recommended especially for teens and those studying the art of leadership."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"Conrad's first and last command as a captain provided material for 3 long stories of semi-autobiographical nature, all in a way variations on the same theme: growing up under pressure. The 3 are The Secret Sharer, Falk and then this one. Each is about leaving Bangkok as the new captain of a troubled ship, and about running into new trouble.The Shadow-Line was written quite a bit later than the other 2, in 1915. One reviewer called it a war story. There is some truth in this, in the sense that it was written during WW1, and it is dedicated to Conrad's son, who went to war for England. That's the ultimate enforcement of adulthood.The narrator has just abandoned a good job as mate on a ship under local flag, sailing the Malay Archipelago, for no good reason but out of youthful rashness. (That had been the time that gave us treasures like the Lingard trilogy and Lord Jim.)Surprisingly, he is offered a golden opportunity: a job as skipper of a sailing ship. The previous captain has died and a replacement is needed. The chief mate is apparently a bit off his rockers, that's why an outsider must be called in to fill the captain vacancy. The job is plagued with all sorts of threatening trouble: diseases, dead calm, madness, ghosts. Our freshman captain has to cross the shadow line from youth to adulthood, to become a responsible leader.Conrad tells us of his, presumably, own maturing process with surprising lightness. This is not pondering Marlow of the early phase, this is a different voice, this is somebody who can stand outside himself and watch and take himself less than dead serious.The ghost aspects: some claim that this is really a ghost story. Nonsense, this ghost is just the hallucination of a sick sailor, Conrad put no credibility into it at all. He was a rational person.If compared to Conrad's great stories, like Youth or Typhoon or the Secret Sharer, I would not put the Shadow-Line on the same level. But good enough for 5 stars it is any day."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"As a true Conrad lover I must say that this is a very ggod read though not among Conrads greatest (Nostromo, the secret agent). To focus on the good points: it is less wordy than lesser works like Victory and has the (expected) cast of strongly drawn characters. The story seems a bit slow (doesn't Conrad always?) and Conrad readers may have a sense of d&egrave;ja vu, but he lets the content develop out of the story and less from philosophical meanderings (cf. Victory again).The Shadowline is a good introduction to Conrad (either this or Heart of Darkness), but the master has given us better things"},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"The Shadow-Line is one of my favorite Conrad novels. It ranks with Lord Jim, Heart of Darkness, and Nigger of the Narcissus. For that matter it ranks among the great works of world literature. The Shadow-Line is shorter than Conrad's other great works and can be considered either a short novel or a long short story. I suppose it is a novella. In any case, it is a rather straight forward tale of a young man's maturing and struggling with adversity. The unnamed hero, having just resigned as an officer of a merchant ship, unexpectedly gets command of a sailing ship whose captain has died. Of course, our young hero is thrilled at this stunning and unexpected opportunity. He must take the ship from Bangkok to points beyond the Indian Ocean. Alas, as soon as he sails, or rather drifts from the harbor his troubles start. No wind, disease, troubled crew members. It is all harrowing and told with gripping tension and insight by Conrad. This book has less of the murky modernist Jamesian passages than some others of Conrad's. Frankly,I don't miss them at all.Virginia Woolf had Conrad right. I quote from a website on modernism:Woolf wrote \\"He must be lost indeed to the meaning of words who does not hear in that rather stiff and sombre music, with its reserve, its pride, its vast and implacable integrity, how it is better to be good than bad, how loyalty is good and honesty and courage...\\" Woolf believed that it was Conrad's celebration of these sailorly virtues - stoical pride in one's work, a connection to a deep and lasting tradition, action rather than cogitation - that would ensure the writer's legacy. Beyond his techniques of narrative mediation, beyond his modernist probing of epistemological uncertainty, we are left, Woolf claims, with maritime yarns that celebrate \\"fidelity, compassion, honour, service,\\" what Conrad himself describes in Some Reminisces as \\"a few very simple ideas.\\" Conrad the moralist and seaman trumps Conrad the modernist and explorer of the dark chasms of psychology.I couldn't agree more. The Shadow-Line is one of the best works of Conrad the moralist and seaman. It is a story of the sailorly virtues, of honesty and courage, and humanity. It is a celebration of \\"fidelity, compassion, honour, service\\" without being in any way sappy--just a few very simple ideas."},{"Title":"The Shadow Line","review":"Often called Joseph Conrad's last notable work, The Shadow-Line is not in his top tier but is a strong tale that fans will enjoy. Though it has many of his more famous and better works' obvious trappings, not least the Far East/ship setting, it is far more accessible; shorter, more tightly written, and less symbolic, it has a linear narrative and (for Conrad) very straight-forward prose. This may disappoint those who value his profound philosophical dramatization and narrative experimentation, but those who like him mainly for stirring adventure and basic human nature insight - especially if they think other elements hold him back - will like this especially. I would not advise anyone to start here, as strong early novels like Almayer's Folly and The...Narcissus (Amazon won't allow the full title) are more representative and higher quality introductions, but those intimidated by more ambitious novels may want to skip here, and all others should pick it up eventually.Most Conrad works can be appreciated on a very simple level as rousing sea adventures, this more than others. It lacks other novels' high pitch storm scenes, but its stark depiction of a ship in extreme condition is in many ways more affecting and certainly more relatable to most. We get a vivid idea of what it was like to be at sea in a true crisis. Like many Conrad stories, it is highly autobiographical, as one might have surmised from the wealth of realistic detail. Written in first-person from the captain's perspective, it vibrantly shows the great stress of overseeing a dire situation. Conrad is known for piercing psychological penetration, and though The Shadow-Line does not take the concept as abstractly far as other works, it is highly noteworthy in showing a representative mind - young, capable, and ambitious but inexperienced - under stress. Not least importantly, we get an unrelenting expression of self-doubt, hence the \\"A Confession\\" subtitle.As this suggests, the book is to a large degree a bildungsroman and may easily be seen as a companion to Conrad's \\"Youth,\\" another entry in the genre with further similar elements. Many will identify with the narrator's malaise, doubts, and lack of direction, not least because they come from an unknown source. At least as many will understand his elation at getting his first command. He quickly becomes a sympathetic character; we truly feel with and for him, at least as much because he is in so many ways an Everyman as because of his first-person narration. Fortunately, far fewer will be able to directly relate to his severely trying experiences, but the youth-to-adulthood passage that it symbolizes has universal significance. Like \\"Youth,\\" this laments the loss of illusions and ideals that are sadly inherent to aging, but in contrast to it, the advantages - such as they are - are also shown. The narrator loses much but gains a strong self understanding, not least just how far he can be pushed and how he can perform in such conditions. More importantly, he learns hard and bitter truths that only experience can teach and that he will later need to call on often.The narrator is not the only memorable character; this indeed has some of Conrad's most colorful and memorable, much to its advantage: the eccentric, deranged Mr. Burns; the calm, faithful Ransome; the deceptively intelligent Captain Giles; the quirky and lordly Captain Ellis; the comically hapless hotel steward; the contemptibly incompetent Hamilton; and not least, the startlingly malicious first captain who mercifully appears only in short flashbacks. If Conrad holds back in other areas - or if perhaps his talent had diminished -, he is at least as good as ever here.Despite the obvious lack of prior works' deep symbolism, some have seen the novel as a World War I allegory. There is significant biographical justification; the book was written during WWI, Conrad saying it was the only subject he could turn to, and his son, whom he says he thought of when writing, fought in the war. One can also make a good textual case; the story after all champions camaraderie as well as perseverance amid great danger including the machinations of a malevolent enemy springing from unknown malice. Perhaps above all, it holds out for a (relatively) satisfying end despite all, which would seem uncharacteristically optimistic but may well make sense in the context of Conrad's son. There is likely something in all this, but it has probably been pushed too far by those understandably if somewhat perversely determined to find strong symbolism because prior works had it. Some have also seen supernatural elements, but it seems obvious that they were meant to be taken as insanity portents; Conrad lacked belief in such things, and his Preface denounced the interpretation. None of this really matters in the end, because The Shadow-Line is strong regardless of whether it exists and would not be among his best work if it did; anyone interested in Conrad should read it in any case."},{"Title":"North Star;: A dog story of the Canadian Northwest,","review":"North Star is truly one of the all time unsung great dog hero portraits - that it's dedicated to Balto is very significant - there's no doubt in my mind that the author wrote this from his heart with a profound knowledge of dogs - very satisfying....."},{"Title":"Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"While I agree with everything the other reviewers said about the description of character classes and the easy-to-read maps with great descriptions of the areas and details of exactly what you will find there, this hint book has two very serious flaws I found.The first is that in all the &quot;walkthrough&quot; descriptions, in many of the places they tell you what to do to get through the area ONCE YOU GET INTO IT. But they do NOT say, for instance, &quot;before you can get into this area you have to complete such and such quest.&quot; I thought I was at a serious impasse early in the game because the book described in the main halls that the word of the dragon was required to open one of the doors, and you had to talk to some creatures there to get the right word. When i first went there, THERE WERE NO CREATURES THERE. They did not make any mention of the need to complete previous quests that would activate the creatures in the area. This is not the only section of the book with this flaw. You can't walk through the areas as they are presented in the book, step by step...there are still a lot of things to figure out and finding the right hint can get very confusing.The second bad flaw this book had was the incomplete index. For instance, I found something called a &quot;stronghold key&quot; that I could not figure out which door to get open. If you want to ask &quot;what is the stronghold key and which door does it open&quot; the &quot;stronghold key&quot; does not appear in the index, nor does &quot;key, stronghold&quot;. Again, this makes finding the right hint you want very difficult...unless you know exactly the area you are in and look up the hint IMMEDIATELY after you find something new, the book is just a pain to search through for the correct hint.If you just want a general overview of the game and area descriptions, and some good maps to follow, this is a good book to get. If you're looking for an answer to a specific problem, this book will only help you if you are willing to spend a bit of time searching through it...it can take time to find the right solution...very disorganized in that sense."},{"Title":"Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"This truly is one of the better guides I've seen in a long time. With Prima being the larget producer of such books, I generally approach these manuals with more than a little wariness, since the experience is generally hit-and-miss, but I have to say that the Prima guide for Pool of Radiance efficiently and effectively covers all the bases that a good guide should.The centerpiece of the guide is the walkthrough for the game, which is fairly well written. Of course, considering the fact that this is a Dungeons and Dragons game that they were writing a guide for, they probably didn't have much trouble ahead of them (random encounters are rare, and the guide itself is written like a book and paper adventure key). The maps they provide are well rendered and easy to follow in most cases, and the occasional side tips that they offer are helpful, for the most part.One thing that I would have liked to see is a little more focus on character creation and subjective advice from the book's editors. As is so often the case with these sorts of guides, the sections on gameplay are little more than reprints of the game documentation. A greater number of sample characters, some expanded elaboration on character design, or another fully illustrated sample party or two would have been a welcome aid. The point of these guides, after all, is to allow the player to more completely experience the game, and it seems as though a lot of potentially useful material in that regard has been cast off.On the whole, however, the guide is still exceptional, with complete coverage of every location or encounter in the game and, if not exceptional, a respectable amount of character creation advice and explanation on elements of the gameplay rules."},{"Title":"Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"This is a great companion to Pool of Radiance Ruins of Myth Drannor or the Collector's Edition version. The guide is organized very well by chapter and has exactly what POR fans need for getting started: an outline of each character class, the strengths and weaknesses of same, benefits and drawbacks of multiclass characters and suggestions for a good party. It doesn't lean too far subjectively on what the authors think players should use, giving the player the required information, giving a helpful nudge here and there giving the player plenty of options on assembling a good party of adventurers. Those new to POR will find the book helpful on reommendations if one isn't certain which party members to create. It provides a nicely done walkthrough for getting through the game and emphasizes saving before doing anything dangerous, ensuring the completion of an area before continuing, etc. and warning the player of \\"spoilers\\" in the story in case he or she doesn't want to spoil any surprise(s) the game has to offer. I would have liked to see a \\"level requirement\\", players given a recommended character level(s) before entering a new area, though.From a design point of view, the book is done nicely with graphic depictions of the NPCs you'll encounter, screen shots of character creation screens and some pertinent areas, and thoroughly outlined maps for the dungeons and mazes you'll explore. I would have liked this strategy guide designed in full color; it would make the dungeon maps much easier on the eyes and pleasing to look at, but the price would have been much higher. The black and white photos are sufficient and give you the information needed to navigate and satisfy. The only problems I've encountered are with errors; there aren't that many and can be corrected by pen but a couple are errors are more significant. An area where you make one decision, you get one item and if you make a different decision, you get a different item; instead the book says both items can be found in the area which can become confusing. this should have been corrected and I had to turn to another source to find the solution.

A student of Henry Miller, Castaneda, Gurdjieff, and Krishnmurti for over forty years, Mr. Daley has written, \\"Tasting the White Water\\" as both a biography as well as an inspirational story. Like many of us, Mr. Daley takes part in many of the same struggles that we face today. He has a family and the normal obligations that we are all charged with. However, Mr. Daley feels that something is missing and that he has not reached his full potential. He documents his dreams in this book and tries to attach some type of value to them during the course of his day. At times he is overcome by a feeling that he has lost control and that he is not prepared, as his dreams switch from one scene to another. There are so many parts of his inner-self that crave attention as well as outside factors that need to be addressed.He and his friend Alex take up white water rafting in this stage of his life as a means of recapturing their youth and they discover a natural and legal high. At first, they feel their way down the rapids with little skill and some success. However, as the book progresses Mr. Daley conquers his fears and insecurities as he battles fearlessly through the rapids, and he begins to awaken from his life and reach towards his true potential. It is as if the worries of his life have vanished to be replaced by a true appreciation of life itself. Time has stopped, material things began to sloth away as every beam of sunlight and every part of God's creation teaches Mr. Daley about his inner-self and how he has evolved based on his experiences and dreams.He acknowledges the fact that we are who we make ourselves to be. Nothing in life is totally out of control, as it is perceived. If you tackle a series of problems in the same manner that you tackle the powerful current as you navigate through vicious rapids, you can achieve success. Sometimes you have to \\"roll with the punches\\" and prepare yourself physically and mentally for the unpredictables that fate and destiny assign to us. Perhaps that was not his entire message, but Mr. Daley's inspiration has awakened a part of my psyche to believe that this is what it means to me. I had some trouble placing the genre primarily because this book can mean so many positive things in so many ways.The imagery is vivid and you may find yourself gasping or holding your breath as you ride the rapids with Mr. Daley. He is a true artist well verse in the use of words and descriptions to take you to the places that he has been and to travel down the river that he has conquered. \\"Tasting the White Water\\" is a remarkable piece of literature free from any \\"fluff\\" or unnecessaries. Every word in this book and every scenario offered ties into his central theme that man is still truly asleep in his potential. To awaken we must first realize that we are asleep and then we are prepared to take the next step."},{"Title":"Tasting the White Water","review":"One can relate to the main characters in this book.

I bought it and kept it in a safe place for nearly 12 years, until I first read it to my baby daughter. I keep it in her her room, in its box. After we read it, she cuddles it until she falls asleep. Every page is a delight, from the hollow tree the family lives in, to the teeny tiny fur animal who gets kissed on his little fur nose, to the wonderful supper and lullaby the fur child receives from his parents at the end of a day in the wild wood. I wish that this book (and Goodnight Moon) were issued to every child upon birth."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"Initially put off by the miniature edition I'd ordered by mistake, I now must recommend it. We have an older hardback that my daughters love, and this small, fur covered version is another hit. My 15 month old loves to hold a little book in her hands that feels 'all soft and all warm'."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"The calm and soothing nature of this book makes it a great one to read when sending your little ones off to sleep. When I was a little girl, my mother read this book to me often. Now that I'm a mother of two girls-ages 8 and 3-it's a great excuse for me to read one of my favorite childrens book. My girls especially love it when I sing the lullaby at the end of the book. Hopefully, this book has become a favorite of my girls, that they will take with them through life the way I have."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"Little Fur Family was originally published in 1946. It was written by Margaret Wise Brown (Goodnight Moon and The Runaway Bunny) and illustrated by Garth Williams. The book tells the story of a day in the life of a litle fur bear who lives in his little fur world. The text is told in a rhyming format adored by most young children. Its miniature size appeals to those who are miniature themselves! In addition, you should purchase the copy that has the faux fur cover. It makes the book as sweet and comforting in texture as it does in content. A great stocking stuffer and a wonderful present for any time of the year...Little Fur Family is a sure hit."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"The Little Fur Family is the best of childhood, remembered as wild sights and cozy feelings. To be able to boil the spiritual and emotional experience of raw child-ness down to the essential syrup is the perfection of Margaret Wise Brown. The best comparison would be having to condense a biographical novel to a haiku, and Brown does it in the same seductive style as the sea to draw the eyes, a river to the ears, and a blue sky to the deepest imagination. The story is told through the mind of a little fur child, who lives with his family in the wood. As he travels in his world that day, little wonder that it takes the reader, child or adult, to their own memories. Even though my bookshelves house books by Chomsky, Foucault, and Mahfouz, The Little Fur Family is always my heartfelt favorite. This book is a sweet story without having the backlash of crawling around in the muck of saccharine characters or the rabid commercialism of children's stories that have action figures or theme parks. If this story stimulates your appetite, I also recommend Goodnight Moon, another Margaret Wise Brown classic"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"I have an old old copy of this book at home. When I was a child, I got the version done in real rabbit fur. I'm now buying this one for my niece and another for my nephew. This book is just too cute!"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"My parents read this to me when I was a little girl. At 23 I still find myself quoting it, &quot;Bless you, my little fur child, everytime you sneeze.&quot; It would be difficult to find a sweeter, more darling children's book. I still enjoy reading my copy from time to time. A childhood without this book is not quite complete."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"This little book (and I do mean little!) is very cute. It has fur sticking out the front, so this really appealed to my 5 year old. The story itself is sweet and rhymes.

It is more fun than any other book for the child, parent, grandparent or great grandparent."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"This is a real cute story. Its just long enough to keep my two year olds interest before bed so that's a definite plus. Thanks."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"We received this book as a gift when my oldest was a baby. It is an amazing little, quirky kind of book - and the song at the end I made up our own little tune too. Even my older children gather around when I read it to the youngest.

It makes you all warm and fuzzy inside!"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"I really like Margaret Wise Brown's other books, so I was excited to receive this one as a gift. I'd never heard of it before, and now I kind of see why. The writing and story are quite different than Runaway Bunny or Goodnight Moon. Like another reviewer, I found the repetition of the \\"fur\\" theme to be a bit much. Also, the story is rather random and weird, with the child wandering \\"dark and sunny woods,\\" grabbing various creatures and examining them or \\"kissing them on their little fur nose.\\" I also find the illustrations, while well done, to be slightly sinister and creepy, with the forbidding-appearing woods, the red and wind-whipped depiction of evening, and the odd-looking \\"fur father.\\" I hate to rain on everyone's childhood memories, but there you have it. Our two-year-old daughter likes it okay, and it's slowly making its way into regular circulation in her library."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"We received this as a present for our daughter, and our first thought was \\"How adorable!\\" The box set is very cute, and the brown fur covered book is certainly attractive to a child's curious little fingers, but that is where it ends for us.Our daughter enjoys petting and pulling the fur, but the story and illustrations do not hold her attention. Even the sounds (kerchoo, thump, kerplunk, ssip, etc.) didn't catch her attention as they usually do. The illustrations are softer than most children's books and are not eye catching.Plus, my husband and I found the story to be a bit weird. The \\"fur child,\\" \\"fur world,\\" \\"fur mother,\\" \\"fur grandson\\" and other \\"fur\\" references were a little much. The fact that this \\"Fur Family\\" wears fur coats was also a tad unsettling.Does this mean the book isn't worth buying? For us it's not worth it since my daughter doesn't enjoy it and neither do we, but I'm sure others would appreciate the classic."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"My first problem with this book is that it's slightly over the size of a business card, so it really doesn't matter that there is some decent illustrations because you can barely see it. Second, I love cute, quirky, off-beat things, and this is off-beat, but it's really not very cute. I find it hard to believe that the story or the low key illustrations can grab any young child's attention. I read the other reviews posted here and was excited to get this book because I thought it was going to be refreshingly different, besides the fux fur cover I really don't think there is anything special about it. Yes, there are some lyrical lines in it \\"the dark and sunny woods\\" etc., but there are not enough to make this tiny book matter to children. I hate to say it, but I think that this is a book that adults buy for themselves, either so they can feel cool because they bought a book no one has ever heard of, or because they want to be able to remember thier childhood. If you are buying it because you want your child to see something you read, you should buy the book, but if you are just looking for an educational and out of the ordinary gift, find something else, this is destined to sit on a bookshelf, become a dog toy, or become a book the child doesn't appreciate until she is in her 30's."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"No where on the amazon page did it mention that this book is mini-sized. It is about 2\\" by 3\\" and as a result the quality is compromised."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"If you cherish Goodnight Moon, you will love this small book by the same author. Little hands love to hold the book with it's soft faux fur cover. My son always took this book to bed with him. If I had a dime for everyime we needed to hunt it down - I'd be a rich woman! All young children will love this cute story - a book just filled with LOVE!"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"I read this story to my niece and nephew and now I read it to my daughter. It's a sweet little story about a little fur family (duh!) but what makes this edition so special is the faux fur cover!

It really is a precious story. I didn't buy this particular edition, apparently, because the board book version I purchased was not as tiny as 2x3\\"! Mine is more like 5x7\\" or so, but it still has the furry tummy on the cover, so if you want a slightly larger version, it IS out there, just keep looking."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"I remember holding my furry copy of this book against my cheek after my mother tucked me in at night. Now my niece does the same with her (fake fur, as befits the times) copy.

The cover has a bear with a real fur belly which is fun for my 11 month to touch. The illustrations of delightful (same illustrator as the cover of the Little House books). The story is simple and cute (little bear explores the wild wood where he lives, meets a fish, a bug and the smallest fur animal in the world). Good buy for any young child."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"My husband introduced me to this book, which he had read (and sung) to his children all their lives. I don't know how it got missed when I was little! My favorite part is the fish who \\"didn't have any fur and it didn't have any feet and he looked at it for a long time.\\" What a perfect way to capture the sense of discovery that young children have about the simplest things! Now I think every little child needs one!"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"This is a little known gem from Margaret Wise Brown, of 'Goodnight Moon' fame. It is a small furry book that tells the story of a day in the life of a little fur child who lives in the wild wood with his mother and father and not too far from his grandpa. The little fur child explores his surroundings and the other animals that live in the wild wood, and then, as the darkness gets a little too dark, he heads for home to the warmth and safety of his parents. I love the melodic quality of the prose, and I often give it as a gift to new parents. The furry cover, the story and the wonderful lyric quality make it a perfect snuggle time reading choice!"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"I loved this book as a child. When I saw that it was again in print I immediately bought it for my children (4 and 2). I read it every night to my 2 year old and he loves it.

I was a bit surprised that the fur covered version is quite tiny - smaller than a deck of cards. but i soon realized that the size only adds to the sweetness of this book. My 3 year old loves it and so do I."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"We bought this for our little 'fuzzy things' lover, and discovered we were a bit mislead. When we used the 'Search Inside' function, the pictures looked beautiful and appeared larger and more colorful than they actually are. When you open the book, the pictures are so tiny, you cannot even enjoy them! Also, the picture that you can see for the front is actually the TEENY TINY box the book comes in. The \\"book\\" is lightweight cardboard, covered with what appears to us to be some cheap faux fur we could have bought at any fabric store. The pages are flimsy, glued on to the cardboard. Oh, and the book is, as previous reviewers mentioned, small; 3 1/2\\" tall by 2 3/4\\" wide.The story IS very sweet and simple, and I think this would be very comforting as a bedtime book. If you are considering purchasing this book, finding a larger version and gluing your own faux fur to the cover would be a better option. That way, the pictures could be more thoroughly enjoyed, and the book would not seem so flimsy."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"I was intrigued by the stellar reviews and by the idea of a furry book, so I got this for my little boy, who is currently two years old. He adores it, it's his favorite book by far. The furry cover is comforting, and the story is sweet and charming. The little fur child has interesting adventures, gently catching a bug, a fish, and a tiny fur animal, then letting them go. He visits his grandfather and learns about saying \\"bless you\\" after someone sneezes. At the end, the mother and father put their fur child to bed and sing him a song (you have to make up your own tune). Their mom-dad-son trio mirrors our own, and I'm sure that's part of why my little boy identifies with this story. My son always requests this at bedtime, and my husband and I never tire of reading it. It's both peaceful and wild. But the best part was when I heard my son quietly singing along to the little tune I'd made up to go with the song at the end. It was one of those perfect moments in a mom's life. I will happily recommend this to anyone with a young child. Mine knows it by heart!"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"This is the sweetest little childrens book I have ever seen. I have bought several of them for my grandchildren and friend's grandhildren.

It is nice. I am going to give it as a gift. But the little one is more special and I wish they had the size in the description. I ended up getting the correct size where I could see it... But this is wonderful story for little kids. They really like the furry cover (but so did my dog, so make sure you keep it out of reach if you have a dog that likes to chew) and the story is very calming. A good bedtime story."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"Although my son is now a college freshman, I remember so clearly reading this book to him EVERY night during our &quot;snuggle time.&quot; He kept the fur-covered book with him all night and put it in the headboard bookshelf during the day.

A true treasure!"},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"I am 40 years old now and can't remember when I couldn't read. I have been an avid book collector all my life. This is one of my favorites. I found this to have action and adventure, mixed with cuddly and cute. I have my original copy from the 60's as well as a new one ordered from Amazon.com. I think the illustrations are wonderful. I can close my eyes and be in the forest with the Little Fur Family any time. Wonderful for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Little fur family","review":"One of the greatest joys of my life was sitting at the dining room table watching my 7-year-old granddaughter reading The Little Fur Family to my 4-year-old grandson while the two older grandchildren joined in singing the little song. I shall never forget how much love they showed for each other as so beautifully depicted in Margaret Wise Brown's extraordinararily charming little book. There is no other children's book quite like it."},{"Title":"To Live Again","review":"I only wish this classic Catherine Marshall title was on Kindle! I read this book at different points in life when I wasn't sure I would make it because of some life crisis. In this true story, Catherine Marshall, author of the book Christy that became the basis for the TV series of the same name, tells how she dealt with being a young mother and wife of the chaplain to the US Senate, then how she dealt with his sudden death mid-life. It was the early 1950s; she had never held a job outside the home; she had a college degree but was unaware of any marketable skills she might have. It's the story of her journey to live again after her husband's death. I have given this book as a gift to several young widows; it always helps. It is also an intriguing glimpse into how this housewife became a bestselling author and saw her book about her husband become a mega-motion-picture sensation. It's the classic film 'A Man Called Peter' and makes for great viewing after you finish this book. This is also a book about a faith journey in trying times. You see someone grapple with life's challenges while viewing it all through a true faith in Jesus Christ and watch as that works out. There are several spiritual gems within. The last great benefit I received from this book was to watch as someone realized she was called to write books and then went through that process of becoming a published author. I read this book before I ever wrote or published any of my books; it encouraged me then and I have revisited it for more encouragement along the writer's journey.Connie Neal, author of many books at [...]"},{"Title":"Wall Street Wives","review":"...but had I read it when I originally bought it back in 1989 (it's now 2004)!, it would've taken my breath away!

Here's why I think so.First and foremost, it's clear that Stowell is a flight Instructor with a capital 'I.' The easier part of instructing is filling up a student's &quot;knowledge vacuum.&quot; That's as straightforward as painting a fresh bare wall, and any teacher who knows his subject can do it. The harder part is drilling and blasting out the student's wrong ideas, substituting correct notions (Power-Push-Roll) for faulty ones (the stick is the &quot;up&quot; constrol). That's no different in flying than it is in mathematics, and much different that simply pouring in facts. More like carefully fishing antique wiring out of old lath-and-plaster walls, gingerly pulling in new empowering cables. Not many instructors have the combination of knowledge, confidence, and commitment to tackle that second job. Rich Stowell does.When we finish our early training for the Private Pilots certificate, many of us take at least a few hours of instrument flying instruction. We do that as insurance against some day stumbling around a corner and finding ourselves in a cloud. Stowell makes a persuasive case that we should also make a planned foray into emergency maneuver training. While we don't like to think that we may someday find ourselves in an inadvertent spin, or inverted near the ground due to wake turbulence, or with a jammed rudder -- we might! And that's no time to improvise. We need to know what we're doing.I was raised in Alamogordo, New Mexico, during the second World War, near a bomber pilot training base. My dad was the town doctor and knew some of the pilot trainees. I remember his telling me about one of those new pilots getting drunk and telling him, &quot;Doc, I know how to fly that B-17 when everything's working well and going swell, but when things start going wrong I don't have a clue ...&quot; It's that sort of knowledge/performance gap, on the single-engine or twin-engine level, a copy of Rich Stowell's book will fill. Granted you'll need some expert dual instruction for portions of the full program, but this book (it contains a detailed syllabus of the three EMT modules) is the place to start. It will get you mentally prepared and pay for itself by saving time in your subsequent flight instruction.The book starts out with a detailed but non-mathematical introduction to how an airplane works. You can't go anywhere without THAT knowledge. Stowell's presentation is unusual in going far beyond the regime of steady flight and moderately banked turns. He'll show you how to roll your airplane -- and how NOT to -- the whole enchilada. He says (page 3), &quot;... normal flight experience ... represents a limited snapshot of a much larger, more dynamic picture.&quot; Amen.Next comes an analysis of stalls and how to deal with those, then spins (inverted as well as upright!) and how to get out of them. Stowell has an unusual ability to force us to keep the big picture in clear focus, to implement basic concepts, and to keep a few key ideas firmly towards the fronts of our minds. His exposition is masterful, clear and correct. The subtitle of his book is: Controlling Your Airplane During a Crisis. He obviously understands flying and the various emergency control issues. Those are his subject and he sticks with them. He tells you both why and how to do the right thing as well as why you shouldn't perform &quot;obvious&quot; but incorrect actions. Stowell directly stresses and repeats to emphasize major points; he knows these survival issues are too serious a subject to be satsified with only vague prescriptions.Overbanking emergencies are treated next, then control failures, and last engine out/off-airport landings finish up this 228-page large-format softbound book. There are many memorable details, and high impact exhortations such as: Rehearse! He is not afraid (not politically correct!) to delve into what might be going on in your mind during an emergency and how you can substitute proper thoughts and attitudes for dead ends. Stowell has been there, done that, and will convince you that you can too! New pilots who plan on surviving to be &quot;old&quot; pilots should buy Emergency Maneuver Training. Wouldn't hurt some of those &quot;old&quot; pilots to have it too.This book is a mental Leatherman tool for aviators. His ideas and techniques are sturdy and flexible; you only have to use ONE of them ONCE to make it all worth while. I highly recommend Rich Stowell's book Emergency Maneuver Training.John T. Lowry"},{"Title":"Emergency Maneuver Training : Controlling Your Airplane During a Crisis","review":"Emergency Maneuver Training falls between basic flying and full-bore aerobatics. The idea is simple: if something goes wrong, you will know enough to get out of it.Stowell does a great job of walking you through how an airplane flies. What was especially useful was the description of how one would design an airplane from the ground up. Where he excels, however, is presenting it in a clear fashion without boring the reader.The book includes descriptions on recovering from inversions (perhaps you got caught in wake turbulence) to control systems failures (split ailerons; stuck elevator). I would also encourage the video, which complements the material well."},{"Title":"Emergency Maneuver Training : Controlling Your Airplane During a Crisis","review":"I first read of Rich Stowell in AOPA's Flight Training August 2001 issue, ordered the book, then found his friend's [...] flight school, where I spent an intense five weeks of dual instruction toward my private certificate (winter 2004). As Wolfgang Langewiesche points out in his classic, \\"Stick and Rudder\\", airplanes depend more on airflow in whatever direction, and forget about the ground. Rich (and Tim) point this out in discussion of control inputs and outputs, which don't necessarily mesh with the book answers in ground school. Use the latter for the written test, and what is real for the flying. I flew about 26 spin recoveries, 180 landings, and who knows how many stalls and other maneuvers, to the point where I could fly a slip straight ahead, slowly feed in rudder and feel the airplane depart toward a spin, and bring it back from that edge. My Aeronca Champ feels like a completely different airplane after all that Super Decathlon training. Buy the book, but fly the training, too."},{"Title":"Emergency Maneuver Training : Controlling Your Airplane During a Crisis","review":"This IS a great book. I got the most out of it AFTER taking Module I with it's author. Several weeks later I took Module II and got even more out of the book! Every pilot should get this kind of training.

It was clear to our counselor that my stepdaughter was being programmed and brainwashed for the past 14 years by her mother and step-father of 14 years. (I've been in her life for the past 8 years).What I read was very disturbing in that it hit home in so many places. The process and definitions were clear and easily identifiable.The book helped me understand what's been going on and how it happened. In our case the history has been many many years and the programmers'/ brainwashers' support group includes the mother, stepfather, half and step-siblings and grand- parents (among others).I suspect that this behavior is very common in divorce situations (with children) in varying degrees.

This is the real deal!"},{"Title":"Children Held Hostage","review":"This American Bar Association (ABA) \\"Section of Family Law\\" book is the \\"jewel in the crown\\" of the currently limited - but rapidly expanding - literature about parents who alienate a child or children against another parent. Both parents are, typically, the child's birth parents.On its publication date (1991), this book's insights were based on research involving (1) the largest group of research subjects (700), selected from a research pool of 1,000; and (2) the greatest length of research time (up to 12 years); of of any research study ever conducted in this fledgling area. This authoritative research status, of research size and duration, probably continues to this day.When I first read CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE: DEALING WITH PROGRAMMED AND BRAINWASHED CHILDREN, I did not know this book's subject is popularly known by the label - and short-hand term - \\"parental alienation syndrome,\\" a term coined by Dr. Richard A. Garner. Dr. Garner, a child psychiatrist, who recognized this problem in his private practice, and became a prolific author in publicizing this \\"family\\" problem.Unfortunately, particularly for the psychological \\"best interests\\" of alienated children, the \\"syndrome\\" component of Dr. Garner's \\"parental alienation syndrome\\" label has become rallying point of certain feminist advocates, whose polemics attack application of \\"syndrome\\" to this child alienation problem, on the grounds that child alienation problems do not qualify as a medical \\"syndrome.\\" This ridiculously specious argument attempts to totally deflect attention from - and to completely discredit - the nature and existence of this extremely disturbing child alienation problem, which is harmful not only to children, but also to \\"targeted\\" or \\"rejected\\" parents.CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE: DEALING WITH PROGRAMMED AND BRAINWASHED CHILDREN is a powerful answer to feminist activists who seek to discredit the nature and existence of the \\"child alienation\\" problem. Feminist polemics can rant about utilizing the term \\"syndrome\\" to describe child alienation from a parent, but feminist polemics cannot legitimately attack the existence of the facts, or the powerful implications of those facts, regarding the nature and existence of this harmful problem.CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE: DEALING WITH PROGRAMMED AND BRAINWASHED CHILDREN not only identifies the compelling facts revealed by Dr. Clawar's and Ms. Rivlan's research, but also validly characterize (1) the CONDITIONS (child \\"brainwashing\\" and child \\"programming\\") revealed by these research facts, and (2) the alienating parents' MOTIVES (\\"holding children hostage\\") and alienation methodologies, which enable alienating parents to CONTROL alienated children for their own purposes - to the detriment of the \\"best interests\\" of alienated children.If feminist polemics did attempt to attack the facts about child alienation - e.g., child \\"brainwashing\\" and child \\"programming\\" - rather than attacking the label \\"syndrome,\\" feminist polemics would effectively draw attention to the very problem which these DISTRACTING feminist polemics attempt to DEFLECT and AVOID.CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE: DEALING WITH PROGRAMMED AND BRAINWASHED CHILDREN deftly avoids the reprehensible polemics of the \\"syndrome\\" issue. However, this avoidance may have an unfortunate consequence: restricting public awareness of this book. By not using Dr. Garner's term, \\"parental alienation syndrome,\\" Internet searches about the \\"parental alienation syndrome\\" will not disclose the existence of Dr. Clawar's and Ms. Rivlin's authoritative book.Parenthetically, Dr. Richard A. Garner's books about child alienation complement Dr. Clawar's and Ms. Rivlin's book. However, CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE: DEALING WITH PROGRAMMED AND BRAINWASHED CHILDREN, is not cited in Dr. Richard A. Garner's principal book, THE PARENTAL ALIENATION SYNDROME - a curious omission.AMAZON.com's website states that CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE: DEALING WITH PROGRAMMED AND BRAINWASHED CHILDREN has only been cited in two other books, indicating the lack of public awareness of this authoritative book.The research underlying Dr. Clawar's and Ms. Rivlin's book is focused entirely on child alienation which occurs in child custody cases. However, as a \\"rejected\\" parent, I know that the problems of child alienation can also arise long before these child alienation problems polarize into child custody litigation, which is typically brought by the CONTROLLING parent. Indeed, as in my case, child control and child alienation issues were the principal cause of marital discord.As a concluding observation, the research findings and implications of CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE: DEALING WITH PROGRAMMED AND BRAINWASHED CHILDREN are also of great value and potential utilization by professions engaged in marital counseling, as with conflicted families."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"I am eagerly awaiting the return of Rei Shimura. Again I've enjoyed reading about this incredible woman torn between two cultures. She gives a remarkable view into the lives and feelings of Japanese people that few Westerners know. The story was fantastic and reading about the places in Japan I have visited gave me back wonderful memories. Her characters are believable and likeable. Sujata Massey has obviously done her homework!"},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Sujata Massey's books never disappoint me! I have read them all, and she really knows how to tell a story. Her character of Rei Shimura is appealing because she is intelligent and appealing. The fact that Ms. Massey's books are set in Japan was the reason I first bought one, but the story convinced me to buy the others. I have written two romantic suspense novels set in Japan, and I am happy to see her novels be sos successful. It gives me hope!!!Deborah Kemp..."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Sujata Massey's books are entertaining but in this book she gave too much free reign to Angus, Hugh's vile brother. Of course, the audience isn't supposed to emphathise with Angus but his rantings against the Japanese, et al were tedious and racist. I almost expected him to declare his membership of the British National Front!"},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"I like all of Sujata Massey's books I have read (so far have read the first 3) - they are all quick moving and good escapist reading. She has quite a few improbable scenes and a plot line that stretches credibility, but the overall enjoyment she offers outweighs these difficulties. I was surprised by this one though that she has so many glaring errors. She states that in Japanese Buddhism women are not allowed to be priests - I personally have met 3 women Buddhist priests in Japan. One is the heir to the title of abbot of a family-run Buddhist temple. This means that one of the central devices of her plot is incorrect - that the young woman Akemi can't inherit the title of abbot of her family's temple.Other than that there are some basic flaws in her explanation of Buddhism (what a sutra is, what Pali is, etc..) These things should have been caught by the editors.Still I do recommend this as a fun read, if you don't believe it as actual Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"After discovering Sujata Massey with 'The Salaryman's Wife', and being captivated by it's shadow's edge world of traditional Japan and the fringe-culture inhabited by 'gaijins' and the other foreign born, I couldn't wait to get my hands on 'Zen Attitude'. Massey doesn't let the reader down. Rei Shimura remains as prickly-yet-likeable as in 'Salaryman' and swims through the same sea of proper Japanese and eclectic outsiders.While I enjoyed the mystery and found it compelling, the real treat for me was the semi-insider's peek of Japan and Japanese culture. Despite her attempts at traditional ettiquette Rei is a modern woman and her PG-13 exploits made a sensitive guy like me blush a few times.Sujata Massey is a writer with a real appreciation for the beauty and tradition that her characters experience. It's nice to see that those things can co-exist with a little attitude."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"I enjoyed Zen Attitude as much as the other books in the series. I've read Massey's Rei Shimura series books out of sequence, completely unnecessary to read them in order. Rei's boyfriends seem to be interchangeable anyway, as most boyfriends are. The wry humor works well (\\"Sleeping on a sofa is a particular kind of hell\\") and the descriptive passages perfectly reflect Tokyo and the people that live there without going overboard (\\"Riding on the train, Angus was sandwiched between two pretty college coeds practicing their English\\").If you are looking for a fun read and a light hearted mystery series that's not full of gloom and doom or splattering blood, the Rei Shimura series is for you."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"In this second novel in the Rei Shimura series, the heroine, struggling to establish her Japanese antiques business, is tricked into buying a doctored antique chest. When she tries to return it, the seller turns up dead. Meanwhile, Rei is sucked into the turbulent family relationships of the customer for whom she bought the chest, who is the wife of an abbot at a famous Japanese shrine. Rei's relationship with her live-in boyfriend, Hugh Glendinning, becomes turbulent as well when Hugh's renegade younger brother stays at their apartment for an extended visit. As in the first novel in the series, Rei is smart, sexy and basically sweet behind her tough facade. I particularly liked the way that several of the characters revealed new dimensions as the story proceeded, proving themselves to have more complex personalities than Rei, and the reader, initially perceived. The resolution of the mystery is very satisfying, tying the different strands of the story together in a humorous and action-packed climax. The book also provides a fascinating window into Japanese culture. This is a great series--I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Rei Shimura has moved up in the world, now she lives in luxury with her lover, Scottish Lawyer Hugh Glendenning, and she's selling antiques, her lifelong dream.

The right deal with Mihori can set Rei up for life, so when she finds a ceremonial chest of drawers worth millions of yen, she is overjoyed. She spends way too much on behalf of Mihori, has the priceless piece delivered to her apartment, then finds to her horror that it's a fake.Once again Sujata Massey takes us on a wild Japanese ride and along the way we meet a female judo champion, Hugh's spoiled brother Angus who will smoke anything in sight, a hip young car salesman who may or may not be a serial killer, a buddhist temple run by the Mihoris, and the very scary daughter of the Mihori clan and of course there's Rei Shimura herself, who seems so exasperating as she gets involved in murder.Rei Shimura is a character that you'll either love or hate as you flip though the pages as fast as you can read, because love her or hate her, you won't be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"It arrive in a timely fashion and the description of the condition was right on."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"I kept reading until the end, I didn't realize who the'bad guy' was. I enjoyed reading about the different characters and the different classes/castes that Japan has to offer. Massey's writing style continues to be descriptive and enveloping.

The plot bounces around too much and since you don't have too much attachment to the characters, you really don't care where they end up. Character dialogue is weak at times and jerky...I frequently felt like I had missed a sentence or two but it was just poor dialogue. It's been a long time since I've read a book that I thought it better to throw out than to possible burden another human being with a story of such lacking. You'd be better off to read some real Japanese mysteries by Miyuki Miyabe or Akimitsu Takagi than this Gaijin-lite stuff. ..."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"In ZEN ATTITUDE the action just goes and goes -- the book doesn't FEEL like it's over 300 pages. It has lots of satisfying twists and turns. And I can identify with the complex and frustrating relationships with the men in her life! This series is just the ticket for mystery buffs -- esp. those who like a bit of vicarious traveling thrown in. Want to live in Japan for a while?This is the second in the series that started with THE SALARYMAN'S WIFE. This time we get an interesting, albeit scanty, insight into the world of the Buddhist monastery in Japan. I am in LOVE with this series! I'm recommending it to all my fellow mystery lovers. Next up: THE FLOWER MASTER."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"The second in Massey's series is a disappointment. Her heroine, Rei, behaves erratically throughout, making for puzzling psychology. Things fall apart, the center cannot hold. It's hard to figure out why Rei does what she does, and while the mystery plot line holds together, the character does not."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"This was the first Mystery/Who-did-it story I have ever read. So I don't have any other books of this kind to base this review on. But that didn't stop me from liking this story. It's plot was compelling, and showed some views of Japanese life that I've never known about. The one down side to the story is that this is, once again, another book that stuck sex into it. I thought it would have been better if that was left out of the story. Yet, the plot reddemed it's self and turned out to be a good story."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"An entertaining read. My first Sujata Massey book, but I've already purchased two more. I'm going to be going &quot;backward&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; in Rei's life. It will be a fun ride, I'm sure. Thank you, Ms. Massey, for sharing your talents with us."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Rei Shimura's life is moving toward her own Zen Attitude -- calm, composed, happy in life and love - the perfect balance. But nothing can be simple for Rei - yet. This second novel from Sujata Massey follows her highly successful &quot;The Salaryman's Wife,&quot; which introduced readers to this young woman trying to make her own way in a culture that sees her almost as a failure - she's still single at age 27, and she's only half Japanese. That's why the success of her antiques business is so important, and why anything that threatens the success of this venture threatens her own stability - and as readers of the first book know, Rei tends to be rather volatile. So when that threat includes murder, well, Rei does whatever it takes to center her life again.Once again Ms. Massey's characterization is superb - we're treated to a female judo champion, the hierarchy of a Buddhist temple priesthood, other antique dealers, even Rei's boyfriend's wild Scottish brother. ! ! The subplots are intriguing, seamlessly tied together to create a denouement that is hinted at, yet should remain a surprise for most readers.The little touches are what make Ms. Massey's work so delightful. Scenes describing caged canaries in the police station, services at an ancient temple and a festival celebrating folk tales are interspersed with murder, high stakes antiques for sale and Rei's doubts about the future of her life in Japan. Indeed, Rei Shimura can be extremely exasperating - you may either love her or hate her. To Sujata Massey's credit, you will want to read more about her."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Sujata Massey has surpassed herself! Zen Attitude is a novel that contains all of the ingredients for a highly successful sequel to Massey's debut novel, the Salaryman's Wife. Rei Shimura comes bouncing back with all of the zest that one has come to expect, but with a slightly more mature approach to everyday life. She is still involved with Hugh Glendinning, but we can forgive her this slight indulgence when he is held up to the light against his brother Angus, who has less redeeming qualities than a nest of particularly antisocial vipers.This time, Rei battles to unravel the mystery concealed within an antique Japanese chest, and she does so with the same flair that she exhibited in The Salaryman's Wife. Character delineation is is not merely well done, it is excellently done. Massey's knowledge of Japan is also vividly apparent on every page. If you want to know exactly what it feels like to go shopping for antiques in Kamakura, the ancient capital of Japan, th! en throw away the guide books and make sure that Zen Attitude is close at hand.Rei Shimura has become a good friend. We have only met up twice over the course of the past year, but each meeting has been delightful and something to savor. I certainly hope that the third installment of this wonderful series is not long in coming out.Christopher Belton (author of Crime Sans Frontieres)"},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Japanese-American Rei Shimura is extremely pleased with her current lifestyle. She has opened up a Tokyo-based antique business and lives with her Scottish boyfriend Hugh Glendinning, an international lawyer. As her lover flies off to Thailand, Rei purchases Nana Mihori's tansu (ancient chest of drawers) for more than she could afford.However, the overpaying for the chest of drawers is not the end of Rei's bad luck. The person who sold her the tansu is found dead and the police suspect Rei is the killer. Soon other individuals linked to the tansu begin to die and attempts on Rei's life occurs too. Using her new found Zen for life, Rei begins to investigate the key to why someone is killing people associated with the tansu.ZEN ATTITUDE is a brilliantly written who-done-it that brings to life Japanese culture. Rei is one of the best amateur sleuths on the market today and her series is worth reading by anyone who enjoys a mystery with a touch of the orient. In a relatively short time, Sujata Massey demonstrates that she is one of the most talented new writers on the mystery scene.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":". . . very entertaining and the mystery comes together beautifully.The 2nd book in the Rei Shimura takes up a few months after the 1st book, \\"The Salaryman's Wife,\\" leaves off. Rei is living with her Scottish lawyer boyfriend, Hugh and trying to make a success of her antiques business, when, once again, her life gets mired down by murder & intrigue.As with the 1st book in the series the deft handling of the plot kept me interested and surprised until the end. Red herrings and secondary characters are woven into a story that is fast-paced and entertaining, while seamlessly including glimpses into modern and historical Japanese culture.The few quibbles I have with the book focus mainly on the main characters.I found Hugh's stated devotion to Rei suspect, especially after the introduction of his younger brother Angus. His vacillation between the two and his treatment of Rei in several scenes seemed to argue that there was no basis for their relationship other than his need to make a connection with someone Japanese and her physical attraction to him.And, although I find Rei intriguing, I still haven't solidified a bond with her. Like Nevada Barr's heroine Anna Pigeon, Rei takes a while to grow on you.But even when Rei's actions and feelings seem more random than reasonable, there is a depth and complexity to her that is refreshing. She, like the Japan she treasures, isn't easily understood or forgotten.I have just started reading the third book in the series - The Flower Master - and even though I'm only halfway through chapter one I'm intrigued and itching to read more.Sujata Massey has quickly joined a the list of mystery writers who seems to effortlessly draw you into the world they create. I look forward to enjoying many more of her books."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"The mystery reminded me of so much of Japan I had forgotten: the Kamiso, itinerant Buddhist monks; itadakimasu, the Japanese Grace before meals. The characters are well developed and of interesting variety: Angus, an annoying Scottish younger brother of Rei Shimura's lover; Wajin the surprising Buddhist priest; Ishida-san, the elderly antiques dealer who knew a &quot;nice&quot; thief who would selectively steal. All in all, a book that will enchant both mystery buffs and Japanophiles equally. And if you are fortunate enough to be both, you are in for a rare treat."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"This second in the utterly charming Rei Shimura series is even more delightful--and more addictive--than its wonderful predecessor, \\"The Salaryman's Wife.\\"In this story, Ms. Shimura has taken some giant strides. She now lives in luxury with her lover, Hugh Glendenning, the Scots lawyer--but as always, her simple Japanese side is at war with her American side over the opulence of their apartment. She has given up her lowly job, and is now selling antiques, her lifelong dream. Her Japanese side allows her entree into the most conservative of Japanese homes, while her American side allows her to bargan cannily for the best price.Such is the situation when we happily meet Ms. Shimura again in \\"Zen Attitude.\\" She has been hired on consignment by a major player in the antiques world, the formidable Nana Mihori. One antiquing coup with Mihori can set Shimura up for life. Therefore, when she finds the quintessential \\"tansu,\\" a ceremonial chest of drawers worth millions of yen, Ms. Shimura is overjoyed. She spends way too much on behalf of her client, has the priceless piece delivered to her own apartment--and then finds out to her horror that it is a fake.And that's just the beginning. Throw in Hugh's majorly cool but spoiled rotten brother Angus, who will smoke anything and everything in sight; a hip young car salesman who may or may not be a serial killer; a buddhist temple run by the Mihoris but seemingly fraught with evil; and the overly macho, very scary daughter of the Mihori clan, and you have but a taste of the adventures to come. All I will say here is...all is NOT what it seems.This series is a find. An absolute treasure. I cannot wait to ready the next, and recommend Ms. Massey's unique, deceptively zenlike series to anybody who likes the truly different."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Rei Shimura is a wonderful character--someone you feel you know in person, rather than from the pages of a book. She's vulnerable and innocent, yet street-smart, with an appealing ironic vision of herself--and completely believable. Rei has set herself loose in Japan, a culture she's heir to--sort of. As a Japanese-American she wants to understand this enigmatic and ancient society, but her misreading of too many things leads her into very dangerous terrain. The plot is complex, and while I found the ending slightly disappointing, I had a great time getting there."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"A very nice sequel, and to me somewhat different, even more complex than her her first book, The Salaryman's Wife. Where the Salaryman's Wife had an almost traditional small set of suspects in an out of the way Japanese Inn, but then moves to the urban setting of the city; Zen Attitude tends to sprawl all over Tokyo, until it becomes focused on the intrigues of a specific Japanese temple. Rei Shimura is running her small antiques business and purchases an old japanese chest. Unfortunately, everyone associated with the chest seems to be in danger or dead. Almost as interesting as the mystery itself are several personal complications with her boyfriend and his brother. The deft handling of what could easily be clich&eacute; romantic complications, was one of the books highlights; especially when the personal circumstances begin to parallel with the circumstances of the murder."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"Massey's goal is to explore and teach about culture. Born in England to Indian and German parents, she's fascinated by Japan, so she sets her novels in that country and makes her main character Japanese-American. (I understand the strategy completely; I'm Italian-American, but my protagonists are Hispanic or Greek.) Zen Attitude is a worthy contribution to her series. It's an amiable mystery that allows Rei Shimura to continue her Japanese odyssey. Shimura's identity makes her a logical, trustworthy narrator. I like the anitquities angle. Since I know nothing about Japanese furniture, it's easy enough for Massey to plant clues I miss, yet I don't feel cheated that I missed them. I enjoyed reading about Shimura's boyfriend problems, especially when the problematic kid brother arrives, since this is the kind of familiar mess we all dread. The end of the book is a little too dramatic to be completely effective, but it doesn't mar the overall experience."},{"Title":"Zen Attitude","review":"I really love a book which not only entertain you while you read it, but also teach you new things. Zen attitude was like that; it made me look up pictures and information on the Japanese places, antiques etc., which were so beautifully described throughout the book. Furthermore did it have an intriguing plot that made me take the book with me everywhere until I was finished. It was my second Sujata Massey novel and I must say that I'm thrilled that I still have two more on my shelf.

The premise is incredible-an SAS trooper and an IRA member falling in love. As I've thought over all the information in this book, it does seem plausible to me that it's the real deal. As an SAS trooper, Graham is incredibly sympathetic to the Irish. But, at the same time, he pulls no punches when describing the methodology of the IRA. At the same time, the information I've found on Mairead Farrell isn't contradicted by his novel, and given the amount of information the IRA puts on the web, there would definitely be some rebuttle if Graham was full of it. Graham gives a pained account of the Gibraltar incident-which gives the book more credence. An SAS trooper simply toeing the line (i.e. writing propagnda) wouldn't have cast doubt on the integrity of that operation.So. What do we have? Probably the most intense pair of star crossed lovers since Romeo and Juliet. Also, we have a small slice of the war between the Brits and the IRA.Personally, I haven't read anything this powerful in God knows how long. (If you suspend disbelief). I recommend this to everyone."},{"Title":"Violent Delights","review":"This is one of the most sad and unusual love storys I have ever read. For an SAS soldier to fall madly in love with an IRA killer is so unlikely but here is the true story of such an event.

I just wish there could have been a follow up to the story but that was not to be...... to find out why you'll have to read the book and I guarantee you, you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Violent Delights","review":"This book may not be the most well-written, but it gives the reader plenty of insight as to how the troubles of Northern Ireland escalated in the 1970's. It is also gives a detailed and painfully honest account of a love affair that should never have been between a naive, romantic, Irish nationalist, and a deceptive British SAS soldier (the author). Though the author portrays his lover as a would-be killer, in the end he reveals the British government's role in the tragic events of that time. For those with an interest in politics and romance, go for this one."},{"Title":"Violent Delights","review":"If you are looking for a book about a SAS commando with stories of intrigue then this is not the book for you.

Probably would have been a great Mills & Boon had it not been so gratuitously violent. The contrived violence is a mask used in an attempt to validate what is most obviously fiction. There is no credibility. Nothing is delivered in this novel that cannot be garnered in the public domain or with a little research. It sits on my shelf alongside another book that defies all reality, i.e. OPJB, a work of complete and utter nonsense. A total waste of time for anyone interested in the real world. It is a fantasy probably perfect for lower end television grist-mill."},{"Title":"Violent Delights","review":"The writing is fairly pedestrian and the author fails to really capture the reader. The book deals more with the number of times the two characters got together than with the politics of N.

It purports to be a true story about a British commando's grand passion for an IRA woman.I could go for great lengths about this, but I won't. Violent Delights is just not believable.

His Billy the Kid helped establish once and for all the legendary status of the Kid. Wyatt Earp reported Burn's first visit to his friend, movie star, Wm. S. Hart, saying he was happily convinced Wyatt would allow him to do his story.Unfortunately, for both Burns and Earp, Wyatt's friend John H. Flood Jr. had just written Wyatt's story, which was being circulated to publishers with the help of Wm. S. Hart. More unfortunately was that Earp loyally declined Burn's offer out of regard for Flood. The rub there turned out to be that Flood obviously couldn't write for beans. (Ask me. I found, bought and published his work after historians had sought for years this rare document, all copies of which had dropped out of sight.) As one editor said of Flood's work, it was \\"stilted and florid and diffuse.\\" That may have been an understatement.In any case, shifty Burns, despite what others have more kindly said about the sequel, tricked Wyatt into thinking he would instead do a book on Wyatt's intimate, Doc Holliday. And under that pretext he got a lot out of Wyatt, and used it to do a book that Wyatt finally concluded, was more about him than Doc. In fact when it occurred to him that he'd been tricked out of what amounted to the most interesting part of his life story he considered suing Burns. His friend Hart encouraged him, and thought he'd probably win big time. But suits cost time and money just as they do today. Moreover, Wyatt was old and tired. So Burns got away with his trickery, and brought out one of the most interesting, and accurate, books on what had gone on during what could be called the Earp, Behan, Clanton, McLaury, Cowboy Gang Feud. Behan was the crooked sheriff in spades. Burns did not learn that beneath much of the violence at Tombstone lay the fact that Wyatt had swiped the sheriff's cute, young, gal, Josephine Sarah Marcus. (Who later became his third and last wife, at least by common-law.) SEE THE STORY OF HER LIFE WITH WYATT ON AMAZON: \\"I MARRIED WYATT EARP.\\"Burns success in portraying things as they were was based on the fact that he found many of the participants still living, just as he had in the case of Billy the Kid. Burns was, however, basically a tenderfoot. For example, while researching Wyatt, an idea for another book occurred to him to cover the shenanigans of the many colorful old timers out in Cochise County, and he proposed to have the father of my old friend Ben Sanders act as his oracle and guide in seeking out old scoundrels. Bill Sanders reaction was: \\"You must be joking. These people are my neighbors!\\" If the implication isn't obvious to law professors from back East and that sort, he meant he'd have to move out if he blew the whistle.In any case, this is a book well worth reading. It's author ended a colorful career shortly after the book came out, by dying quite young. Pity.There is less fiction here than modern writers, who are shot in the pants with debunking, would like us to believe. Burns knew the foremost guide to writing such books was \\"stick to the facts, till you run out of them, and only make up as much as you have to in order to eat regularly.\\" Editorial ethics then and now were much the same. In any case, Burns was not \\"stilted and florid and diffuse.\\"Since Flood's Ms. was not saleable, when Stuart Lake came along a few years later he took it over and made it that way. And Lake's so-called biography of Wyatt is a lot more truth than fiction. Read it, too: WYATT EARP: FRONTIER MARSHAL.Burns was the first of the big name writers that started Wyatt Earp on the trail to fame and eventualy six-shooter Sainthood. I have a notion Wyatt would have liked the money in it, but not necessarily the fuss and bother of meeting celebrity seekers."},{"Title":"Tombstone: An Iliad of the Southwest (A Signet giant)","review":"I read somewhere that more movies have been made about Wyatt Earp than all the U.S. presidents combined! There's something about the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that touches the mainspring of American imagination. Tombstone is the book that made Wyatt Earp famous and shaped forever our perception of him. I read Tombstone first when I was in high school back in the 1950s and I've since dipped into it countless times. Some might object to the author's purple prose and made-up dialogue and newer scholarly studies of the Earps and Tombstone may be more accurate and balanced. But Burns drew his material from interviews with old-timers and Tombstone newspapers and I'm confident that he comes about as close to fact as you can get. This is a magical tale and nobody could tell it any better than Burns.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Tombstone: An Iliad of the Southwest (A Signet giant)","review":"tombstone the Iliad of the Southwest was a very informative book that keep me entertained as well as learning about the history of the people that shaped the southwest.I was very impressed how the author was able to interview many of the characters or speak to people that lived through that era.The book being writted in 1927 really brought out alot of history that would otherwise be lost."},{"Title":"Tombstone: An Iliad of the Southwest (A Signet giant)","review":"One of the editorial reviews above says that this book is \\"a mixture of fact and fiction.\\" It seems to me that it is no more so than modern works on the topic and perhaps may be more accurate.Written less than 50 years after the primary events that made the town famous, and while some of the people who participated in them were still alive, Burns crafts a portrait not just of those seminal events but a general history of the town from its inception to what had become of it in the 1920's.Many other works about the Earps and their opponents tend either to lionize or demonize Wyatt Earp. Burns takes a more balanced view of both sides in the conflict, exploring their shortcomings and their qualities.

I got an urge to do some research on the OK corral shootout, and this book has a snazzy cover and was well reviewed.I wanted a scholarly type thing, that went into details about the personailties and dynamics of that event. I was delightfully surprized that style of this book is more like the pulp fictionstories popular when it was first publish.The period is covers in detail is sometime shortly after the civil war to the begining of the 1900's. It made me pause and reflect on the conditions of that time, and how a generation that survived our countrys bloodiest and most deadly war adjusted to civilian life. While PTSD has only recently been recongized, I suspect its effects where influencial in the lawlessness and genocide this period is known for.Its not all about Wyatt Earp and Ike Clanton, although they are there, and does endorse this work, but the history of the entire region. It tell hows Tombstone was founded, the men who ran it, and lastly its decline into tourism. Its a story of shoot outs and desperados, boom towns and dance halls, lost treasure and broken dreams.Sorry, I got caught up in it there...its really entertaining.The only real issue I have is that the information is not referanced, so its hard to tell fact from fiction. The sources are readily, from newspaper accounts, court records and first person interviews, but its just not always clearly stated where the facts end and the speculation begins.So yes, its a fun and informative.

As far as a lot of information on Wyatt Earp, no it doesn't nor was the book ever intended to just focus in on Wyatt Earp. It does cover many of the colorful characters that interacted with Wyatt Earp but this is more of a general look at Tombstone in the late 1800's and what life was like there.I highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in get a taste for what life was really like in the Ol' West.

It is a non-academic treatment of early western civilization that looks at the development of ideas, rather than simply facts, political movements, wars, and maps.It starts with early hunter societies in the near east, has a good discussion of the rise of theocratic civilizations, a brief but clear section on the Axial Age, and then three long sections each on Judaism, Hellenism, and early Christianity.Some Quotes:\\"This epoch [Axial Age] saw also the creation of new values and new views of life that affirmed man's capacity to transcend natural forces and to master and control his own biological drives instead of mystically submitting to them. Making a decisive break with the neolithic and paleolithic past, they represented a new turning-point in human thought. ... Two products of the Axial Period, the ethical monotheism of the Jewish prophets and the rationalism of the Greek philosophers, have largely shaped the attitudes of the Western mind, while a third, the ethical dualism of Zoroaster, contributed indirectly to the Western Tradition through its later influence on Judaism and Christianity.\\" -- Pg. 78\\"Whereas Epicurus represented the pole of complete individualism, Zeno and the Stoics preached an absolute universalism. Equally insistent on self-control and the renunciation of desire, they derived their ethical doctrines from man's sense of moral obligation rather than from a rationalistic calculation of pains and pleasures. Judged by intellectual standards, much of their teaching appears naive, confused, and contradictory, possibly because none of their writings have survived and we know them only from secondhand accounts. The core of their doctrine was an intuition about the oneness of the universe, religious rather than philosophical in quality, which they never wholly succeeded in rationalizing.\\" -- Pg 301As I think these quotes demonstrate, the writing holds up well for being 50 year old, and aside from the use of dated gender language (Man's rather than Human's) the topics are curiously relevant.This is not an in depth work, and does not provide exhaustive discussions of the various subsections, but it is an excellent overview of each. For example, the section on the Hellenists would take less than an hour to read and would give a fairly comprehensive overview of the main ideas of Hellenistic culture.The flyleaf describes the book as a \\"sweeping view of history in the light of its ruling ideas, their applications, and their results.\\" and I think that is a pretty fair assessment.489 pages with 16 pages of good quality black and white plates and a 7 page index."},{"Title":"Children of the Dawn","review":"What impressed me most about this work was the masterly and elegant prose style.

Thankfully, the books in this series come out much more quickly than the ones from J. K. Rowling , so I didn't have long to wait for \\"The Last of the Sky Pirates\\", the best in the series so far.Set fifty years after \\"Midnight Over Sanctaphrax\\" (book 3), it doesn't continue from book 4, the first chronologically in the series, which sounds awfully confusing, but actually isn't. The Edge is a totally different place, with the mighty sky ships unable to fly, and New Sanctaphrax barely teetering on wooden supports after the dreaded stone sickness destroys the buoyant floating rocks. The Librarian Academics have been driven underground into the sewers, where they have constructed a vast library of scientific studies, and are forced to send worthy young scholars on covert and perilous missions for training, before they complete their life's quest by studying and documenting their chosen field of nature study.In this book we follow the trail of young Rook Barkwater, a clever young under-librarian who is destined to become a Librarian Knight, doing research on the secret gatherings of banderbears, to whom he feels an unexplainable connection. His mission is dangerous and exciting, filled with wonderfully named, described and illustrated creatures that would otherwise defy the imagination.During his thrilling adventures, he meets Captain Twig, who was thought to have perished with his crew in book 3, and begins a whole new adventure to rescue Twig's friend Cowlquape from the prisons of the Most High Guardian of Night, the villainous scoundrel of this episode.Just as dark as the other books, but with a lot more action and adventure, I recommend this one heartily to fans of the series, but would advise newcomers to read at least books 1 to 3 first.Amanda Richards, August 8, 2005"},{"Title":"Last of the Sky Pirates","review":"I have to disagree with the editorial review that \\"There's not a lot of substance here\\".

But in recent years the rocks that allow sky flight have ceased to work, evil has taken over the main city, and librarians and scholars have taken to underground caverns to survive and protect the years of learning and scholarship that have been accumulated.Rook is a young under-librarian that sneaks off to read treatises that he is forbidden to read. He has a thirst for knowledge and adventure and hopes that one day he will be able to leave the confines of the underground for the vast excitement of the Deepwoods. When Rook is surprised by an appointment to travel far into the Deepwoods to continue his training, he is elated. Soon he is in the midst of an adventure more exciting and frightening than he ever dreamed. Rook must rely on his brains, skills, and trust in others in order to survive the trials before him and live to write a treatise that will one day be stored in the hallowed libraries in which he once thrived.The Edge Chronicles is a fun and somewhat entertaining fantasy series.

I cannot recommend this work highly enough. I rank this among the very best of Luther's works (and that is really saying something). If an inexpensive copy were still in publication I would buy every copy to give as gifts to friends and family. The power, discernment, brevity and readability of this work make a true gem among Reformation writings (and Christian writings in general). Here you will find the essence of the spirit of the Reformation distilled into a guide for practical, biblical living.With the clarity and bold authority of a true prophet, Luther sets forth the whole of the Christian life in two theses: \\"A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.\\" We are free from sin and the law (subject to none) but slaves to Christ in love (subject to all). As Paul writes in Romans 6:22, \\"But now...you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God.\\"Luther writes as a shepherd of the common people and the tone and content differ greatly from his better-known debate-oriented works (ie. Bondage of the Will, 95 Theses). The doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone is the heart and soul of Luther's message, founded upon a firm conviction in the authority of scripture alone.He writes, \\"One thing, and only one thing, is necessary for Christian life, righteousness, and freedom. That one thing is the most holy Word of God, the gospel of Christ.\\"And again, \\"It ought to be the first concern of every Christian to lay aside all confidence in works and increasingly to strengthen faith alone and through faith to grow in the knowledge, not of works, but of Christ Jesus, who suffered and rose for him.... No other work makes a Christian.... 'This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent' (John 6:29).\\"And regarding our service to God, \\"...In this way the stronger member may serve the weaker, and we may be sons of God, each caring for and working for the other, bearing one another's burdens and so fulfilling the law of Christ. This is a truly Christian life. Here faith is truly active through love. That is, it finds expression in works of the freest service, cheerfully and lovingly done, with which a man willingly serves another without hope of reward; and for himself he is satisfied with the fullness and wealth of his faith.\\"This volume is currently out-of-print, but this treatise has been published in a number of other individual volumes and in at least one very worthy compilation entitled \\"Martin Luther's Basic Theological Writings\\" (ed. Timothy F. Lull, 1989) which also contains a number of other infinitely worthy works such as Luther's \\"Small Catechism,\\" the stirring \\"Meditation of Christ's Passion,\\" and the thesis chapters of the foundational \\"Bondage of the Will.\\" I cannot vouch for any other volume than this one and the one detailed above, but any version of this monumental treatise is bound to bless you. It is the fire and the hammer of the Word of God to consume the adversaries and break apart the stone hearts of impenitant men."},{"Title":"Christian liberty","review":"Concise and easy to read.

All the hearsay finally dies with this book, since you hear Luther's own words on the matter.He asserts that Christian Liberty is paradoxical, that the Christian is a perfectly free lord to all, but also a perfectly dutiful servant, subject to all. This paradox comes because of man dual nature: spirit and element. His main point is that by the Atonement, we all become free, but because of the atonement, we have an obligation to serve other people in chaity.I like this edition. The translation is actually a translation, and Mr. Grimm block the text into paragraphs for easier reading. Moreover, he provides the scriptural references that Luther merely alludes to. Thus, the book becomes lecture notes for our review and pondering.The cover illustration is eye-catching. It shows Luther taking his stand before some potentate.

Clarke* In square brackets: the year of first publication, usually in a magazine.=======================================This is Arthur Clarke's third short story collection - and certainly the most unusual one he ever published. It is important to establish immediately that this is the only case where Clarke deliberately wrote fantasy, or scientific \\"tall tales\\" as he charmingly calls them. Naturally, too, the prime purpose of such tales is pure and uninhibited entertainment.The ''White Hart\\" must be one of the most famous pubs in fiction, a most amazing place where scientists, publishers and science fiction writers (what a combination!) get together every Wednesday evening. Then, in between chess games and cryptic publishing deals, enormous amounts of beer change barrels and fantastic (literally, remember) stories are told - at least until the barman Drew announces that it's time to close and kicks everybody out in the \\"cold hard world\\" . By far the most remarkable raconteur in the ''White Hart\\" is one Harry Purvis, by way of being scientist himself, with endless list of acquaintances and relatives, one crazier than the other, and having the most annoying habit of pausing to \\"refuel\\" his glass exactly when the climax of a story is swiftly approaching. Nobody really believes him, but everybody enjoys his meticulously crafted, and even better researched, tales (surely no one can have the cheek to make that up?) and everybody is genuinely sorry when one day he suddenly disappears from the pub.It might be worth noting that among the regular clients of the \\"White Hart\\" are subjects like John Wyndam and Charlie Willies, the former is in need of no introduction but the latter is \\"the most promising author I know (he has been promising for more than twenty-five years)\\". Quite the most charming self-pun I have ever seen that, for \\"Charlie Willis\\" is the pseudonym under which Clarke published some of his early short stories. It is probably significant that Charlie is also \\"one of Harry's most implacable critics\\". Well, in fact, Harry is such a colourful character himself, that all other die-hard White-Hart aficionados make only very occasional appearances. He is such a masterful story-teller, however, that the only tale (\\"Big Game Hunt\\") which is not told by him, or is not based on his bizarre adventures, is by far the weakest in the book. Together with the mysterious pub, Mr Purvis is introduced in the first story and bids his farewell, figuratively speaking, in the last one, but otherwise the pieces are completely independent from another, few mild cross-references notwithstanding. Now let's try to have a more serious look - a very difficult thing when discussing such decidedly and deliberately flippant fiction - at the strengths and weaknesses of this marvellous collection.As a matter of fact, most of these stories are surprisingly serious. The fact that they are pretty improbable does not prevent Clarke from putting most of them on very firm scientific foundations. Just by the way, as a special bonus, you can learn a lot about interference (\\"Silence, Please\\"), the mysterious and so elusive force called antigravity (\\"What Goes Up\\") or the stupendous source of metals and minerals that sea water may prove to be in the future (\\"The Man Who Ploughed the Sea\\"). Most of these matters Clarke has discussed thoroughly in his non-fiction writings (see Profiles of the Future, for instance) but his adroitness to turn them into highly amusing fiction in which there is nothing dry or academic is something to marvel at. Indeed, sometimes it is quite a challenge to find out where is the end of the scientific fact and the beginning of the science fiction. So my labelling all of these pieces as fantasy in the beginning is a trifle wide of the mark.Even more fascinating is the fact that many stories, though definitely tongue-in-cheek in tone, actually have quite a few serious overtones. For instance, \\"Armaments Race\\" is a thinly veiled satire of the ridiculous space operas (isn't that a little prescient for the mid-1950s?) and \\"Patent Pending\\" has some shrewd remarks that may not be enjoyed by publishers and reviewers. And sometimes these tales can be very serious indeed. \\"The Ultimate Melody\\" is positively heart-rending and it does give me a pause to reflect upon the utterly mysterious - perhaps scientifically unknowable - phenomenon of the influence of music upon many people. The story also has a haunting opening:Have you ever noticed that, when there are twenty or thirty people talking together in a room, there are occasional moments when everybody becomes suddenly silent, so that for a second there's a sudden, vibrating emptiness that seem to swallow up all sound? I don't know how it affects other people, but when it happens it makes me feel cold all over. Of course, the whole thing's merely caused by the laws of probability, but somehow it seems more than mere coinciding of conversational pauses. It's almost as if everybody is listening to something - they don't know what.Of the stories with a strong streak of seriousness, my personal favourite is \\"The Next Tenants\\". In this extraordinary tale some wild extrapolations about a human-guided evolution of termites make a rather chilling read. Decades later, using ants instead, Bernard Werber would write some of the most shattering works I have ever encountered. There is no better way to teach oneself some humility and to better appreciate the miracle of life in all of its multitudinous forms than asking the not-so-easy-as-it-seems question \\"Are we really masters of this world?\\" Going down in scale, but going up in numbers and collective intelligence, while reading \\"The Next Tenants\\" might give you some startlingly disturbing notions to consider. Similarly serious, though in a very different field, is \\"The Man Who Ploughed the Sea\\". Here the monstrous question that looms large is \\"What kind of job are we doing as masters of this world?\\" Just imagine, for the sake of the argument, what would happen if the technology for \\"mining the sea\\" described in the story really did become reality in the future. Overfishing and using the sea as a garbage container would seem trivial in comparison.But dwelling too much on the serious sides of these stories is definitely missing the point. Most of these tales are unabashed fun, deliberately and deliciously ridiculous. Perhaps my personal winner here is \\"Moving Spirit\\", a perfectly wacky tale about one of Harry's more eccentric relatives who tried to make whiskey illegally but discovered something quite different. \\"Cold War\\" is a hilarious story about some very unexpected side effects of the rivalry between California and Florida which is the sunniest state in the States. I don't think anybody could read \\"The Reluctant Orchid\\", a parody of horror and crime fiction if there ever was one, keeping straight face,either. The bizarrely titled \\"The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch\\" and the ludicrous \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" are other memorable examples, the former having a poignant reference to Harry himself which feminists would surely love - indeed, the latter would probably appeal to this aberration of the female psyche even more. We will do Arthur Clarke a great injustice if we neglect to mention that, in such light stories, the insight into his characters is as sharp as ever. If you think I am making this up, here are some examples taken from here and there:[Here is another candy for the feminists; from \\"Sleeping Beauty\\".]''Henrietta, rightly despising men as the weaker sex, had never married. However, for some reason she took an avuncular (yes, that is definitely the right word) interest in Hercules, and called to see him almost every weekend. It was a curious kind of relationship: probably Henrietta found that Hercules bolstered up her feelings of superiority. If he was a good example of the male sex, then they were certainly a pretty sorry lot. Yet, if this was Henrietta's motivation, she was unconscious of it and seemed genuinely fond of her nephew. She was patronizing, but never unkind.''[Very perceptive observation about the unequal distribution of wealth and its effects on human beings.]''It is rather amusing, Harry told us, to notice the subtle social distinctions which differences of wealth can produce even in the most democratic country. By Harry's standards, George was a very rich man [...] But Dr Romano was in another price range altogether, and had to be treated accordingly with a kind of friendly respect which had nothing to do with obsequiousness. On his side, the Doctor was perfectly free and easy; there was nothing about him that gave any impression of wealth, if one ignored such trivia as hundred-and-fifty-foot ocean-going yachts.''[Last but not least, Clarke's penetrating gaze can sum up surroundings as well, particularly the \\"White Hart\\" itself.]''A great deal of business also goes on in the obscurer corners of the pub. Copies of antique books and magazines frequently change hands at astronomical prices, and on almost any Wednesday at least three well-known dealers may be seen smoking large cigars as they lean over the bar, swapping stories with Drew. From time to time, a vast guffaw announces the denouement of some anecdote and provokes a flood of anxious enquiries from patrons who are afraid they may have missed something. But, alas, delicacy forbids that I should repeat any of these interesting tales here. Unlike most things in this island, they are not for export....''So why only four stars? As a light and fantastic entertainment - all this collection was intended to be - Tales from the White Hart delivers the goods splendidly; besides, there are more than enough poignancy and pathos just below the surface. It is true that the collection does lack any of Clarke's trademark themes (space exploration, the first contact, etc.), but the great number and variety of mad scientists (some out to conquer the world, others not) more than compensates for this. The fact of catching Clarke in so unusual a field for him is refreshing in itself.The main drawback of the collection is the usual one for Clarke: rather uneven quality. \\"Big Game Hunt\\", which might have been spared publication, was mentioned, and here I may add \\"Armaments Race\\", \\"Patent Pending\\" and \\"The Pacifist\\" to those stories which do entertain, but certainly lack the wry humour and perfect completeness so typical for Clarke. Many of the endings are open, which in itself is a fine method, but most of these, including the three stories just mentioned, are rather anti-climactic and thus unsatisfactory. And there is at least one case (\\"Critical Mass\\") where a fine twist in the end cannot compensate for rather dull story otherwise. All these tales fall rather short of the standards set by the other pieces in the same collection.There is one other thing, too, that detracts from Tales from the White Hart as a whole. This is a certain kind of monotony. With one unfortunate and already mentioned exception, all stories are either told by Harry Purvis himself or based on his experiences but paraphrased by the narrator (called \\"Arthur\\" by Harry in \\"What Goes Up\\") who is even more amusing than his colleague. Yet the usual variety of narrative techniques, characters and locales so characteristic for Clarke's collections is missing here; indeed, the ''mad scientist'' concept is a little too often encountered. But the exchange between \\"Harry\\" and \\"Arthur\\" is worth quoting:''Harry turned to me and said: 'There's an analogy I'd like to borrow from one of your books, Arthur, that puts across the point I'm trying to make. You know - comparing the fight against Earth's gravity to climbing out of a deep pit.''You're welcome,' I said. 'I pinched it from Doc Richardson, anyway.''Oh,' replied Harry. 'I thought it was too good to be original.'''The book in question is Clarke's first published one, the technical yet absorbing Interplanetary Flight (1950), and the analogy does occur there, even though \\"Doc Richardson\\" remains elusive. Was he given indirect credit in fiction? Perhaps. One of the many charming nuances of the collection are the numerous references to real people, works of art or historical events - from Wells to Wilde and from Sibelius' Second Symphony to the battle of Gettysburg - which both demonstrate Clarke's impressive erudition and stimulate in the reader the game \\"find out the facts behind the fiction\\", or the better one \\"learn more history about your favourite fiction\\". As any great writer, pretty much everything Clarke wrote was firmly based on reality. So, indeed, was the \\"White Hart\\" as acknowledged in the preface. Who was the prototype of Harry Purvis, and how much of him was fact and how much fiction, is anybody's guess.At any rate, Tales from the White Hart is a most entertaining collection of short stories, adroitly mixing the serious and the scientific with the flippant and the ludicrous. Uneven and monotonous as it may be, it demonstrates Clarke's considerable powers to have fun, even though in his other collections there are many more memorable examples such as \\"Trouble with the Natives\\", \\"Loophole\\" and \\"No Morning After\\".The book is essential reading for Clarke aficionados, of course, but due to its limited scope, it is not a really good introduction for Clarke neophytes."},{"Title":"Tales From The \\"White Hart","review":"In a similar setup to the Gavagan's Bar stories, but, as Clarke says, set in the UK, not the USA.His bar actually features John Christopher, John Wyndham and 'George Whitley' in small cameos in the tall tales recounted by Harry Purvis.

Although it's been almost 30 years since I read this book, I can still vividly recall most of the stories, and the pleasure I had first reading them. The story revolves around a British scientist who frequents a local tavern and who can spin some of the most outlandish yarns of wayward science and technology over a pint that anyone has ever heard. But he's obviously so well-informed and convincing about the science and the details of the stories that nobody quite knows whether the stories are apocryphal or not. But the fun is in the believing. This book is one of the most light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek classics in the annals of science-fiction, and Clarke's deft touch with these funny tales is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Tales From The \\"White Hart","review":"Readers of some of my other reviews know that I am partial to science fictional tavern or club stories. There are basically two ways of relating fantastic events in such settings. The first is to have the events occur in the tavern itself (as in the Gavagan's Bar stories or the Callahan's Crosstime Saloon tales). The second method is to have a \\"tall tale\\" spun out by a plausible narrator (as in the Jorkens stories or the Brigadier Ffelllows tales).Arthur C. Clarke's _Tales From the White Hart_ (1957) belongs to the second tradition-- the science fictional tall tale. Clarke writes of the White Hart: \\"not only have some remarkable stories been told there, but remarkable things have _happened_ there\\" (2). But this is just window dressing. The happenings are alluded to rather than sharply dramatized. The pub is primarily a place where stories are told.There are fifteen outrageous stories in all, most of them narrated by the nimble-witted Harry Purvis. I like the Harry Purvis stories better than Sterling Lanier's Donald Ffellows stories, because Clarke makes Purvis less respectable or trustworthy than the Brigadier. You can't _quite_ catch Purvis or trip him up-- he slips out the door just before somebody spots a flaw in his story-- but you don't _quite_ trust him, either. He is more interesting to watch in action than Ffellows.Purvis, a \\"small, neatly dressed man in the late thirties\\" who is \\"smoking one of those carved German pipes that almost always make me think of cuckoo clocks and the Black Forest\\" (3) bows quietly in with \\"Silence Please\\" and comes to an ignonomous end in \\"The Defenestration of Erminitrude Inch\\".\\"Big Game Hunt\\" is the one story not told by Harry Purvis-- the _raconteur_ is a fast-talking American scientist who steals Purvis's thunder. \\"What Goes Up\\" is the one story that Purvis never meant to be taken seriously (and the one story that was).Some of the stories feature Harry Purvis himself. \\"Critical Mass\\" recounts how Harry saved the English countryside from evacuation (but not for the reason you might think). \\"The Next Tenants\\" is an account of Harry's encounter with a mad scientist who is inclined to let mankind go down the tubes. \\"Moving Spirit\\" concerns Harry's role as a witness in an explosive legal trial: \\"The Court went into recess with a speed never matched in the annals of British law\\" (83).But most of the stories are about other people. My favorites are the one about the computer that makes monkeys of the Army brass (\\"The Pacifist\\"); the account of oranges, icebergs, and Russian submarines (\\"Cold War\\"); the sad tale of the zap guns for the Captain Zoom television show (\\"Armaments Race\\"); and the tale of Hercules, Aunt Henrietta, and the carnivorous flower (\\"The Reluctant Orchid\\").Perhaps some attention should be given to the White Hart itself. It is a \\"little microcosm\\" (2) that is in, but not precisely a part of London. For the first dozen visits \\"a guide is essential\\" (1). Few newcomers who _try_ to find the pub will succeed. And this suits the patrons. They do not want to see flying saucer nuts or various other tiresome oddballs:Peculiar people with new theories of the universe, characters who have been \\"cleared\\" by Dianetics (God knows what they were like before), intense ladies who are likely to go all clairvoyant after the fourth gin-- these are the less exotic specimens. (120-121)Well, who are the regulars at the White Hart? There is Drew the Bartender. There are writers, editors, scientists, and intelligent laypeople. Arthur C. Clarke narrates the tales of Harry Purvis. But John Cristopher, John Beynon, William Temple, Charles Eric Maine, and other British science fiction writers keep popping up in guest roles. Clarke claims to be a bit afraid that one of these other writers will get the jump on him in recounting the Purvis tales. The decor of the pub is old fashioned. There is no television. There is a jukebox that has long since been disconnected. I wish to God more bars were like that today.The White Hart stories are funny. I have read them over a dozen times, and I still laugh at them. But you should understand. The humor is not a slapstick American humor. It is a dry British humor.

The central story-teller is one Henry Purvis, an obnoxious fellow with a trick of pausing at the climax for a new draught beer, whom no one has yet managed to prove a liar. He tells almost believable tales of science and wouldn't-it-be-nice science. One learns of a silencer that silences more than guns, a carnivorous orchid with a secret, a ballistic computer with a sense of humour. Much of the delight in the tales arises from the fact that they were written in the 1950's, and it is amazing how much Clarke could see of the future. I suspect Clarke may have felt he'd written himself into a corner, because the series of tales and the book end rather suddenly, with a hint for the future but no real hope that Purvis will be back. A delghtful find, to be read by all who enjoy Clarke, bar stories, science fiction, and humour."},{"Title":"Tales From The \\"White Hart","review":"If you can think of one set of SF short stories involving tall tales told in bars, it's probably Spider Robinson's 'Callahan's' series. But if you can think of two, this is probably the second.Although never as big a Clarke fan as I've been of Asimov and Heinlein, I still have fond memories of several of Clarke's books. _Rendezvous with Rama_ is probably his best novel and it's been one of my favorites of his since it was first published. His short stories, too, are generally of high quality (remember e.g. 'The Nine Billion Names of God'?).The series of tales collected herein is a bit different (for Clarke). For one thing, they're _funny_ -- Arthur C. Clarke funny, that is, not Douglas Adams funny, but funny all the same.They're on the light side and they're deftly executed. But don't expect guffaws; in order to appreciate Harry Purvis and his stories, you pretty much have to be the sort of person who thinks 'The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch' is a funny title.If you've read Clarke but you haven't read this book, grab a copy and see what you think.

This is one of the most entertaining collections of stories in the sci-fi genre. At the White Hart, a British pub, are an odd assortment of patrons from the literary and scientific fields, as well as laymen interested in the discussions going on around them. One Harry Purvis inevitably manages to dominate the talk with his incredible tales of wondrous scientific romance, which he insists are true. He will often find a good reason for leaving just as a flaw in his story starts to become obvious to one or more of his listeners, and they wax suspicious that the tale truly is incredible. The way Clarke weaves real science with interesting and hilarious short fiction makes this one of my favorites of all his works. I would especially recommend it to readers who are new to science-fiction. Unlike a lot of such works, this one only gets better with age."},{"Title":"Tales From The \\"White Hart","review":"Welcome to the White Hart, where every Wednesday night features a gathering of scientists, writers, and interested on-lookers who come to drink tepid beer and be regaled by the Tall Tales of one Harry Purvis, a man of uncertain origins, profession, and education, who claims to know so much about so many subjects of scientific interest. These tales were originally published individually, but together they are 'bookended' by &quot;Silence Please&quot; and &quot;The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch&quot; to create a kind of frame story. Purvis' deadpan declamations of yarns that range from all-too-believable to patently absurd, combined with the fictional Clarke's own pointed comments about the White Hart, its clientele, and Purvis' overall credibility, make this perhaps the funniest science fiction book ever written. Using analogy in place of logic, Purvis posits wildly improbable advances in a number of different directions that in some cases have paralleled actual scientific developments that have taken place in the decades since these stories were written.More serious-minded fans should take pleasure in the not-always-easy task of finding the precise flaws in Purvis' stories, which usually include just enough hard science to be credible to the casual layman. &quot;The Next Tenants&quot; is the only story in this collection that has any really serious message to it, and while the story is chillingly effective despite its absurdities, this book is really about laughs. From that standpoint, &quot;Moving Spirit&quot; is probably the best, featuring an eccentric millionaire, his illegal distillery, and a hilarious courtroom scene in which Purvis testifies as an expert witness with devastating results.Despite the occasional slapstick moments, Clarke's humor is generally on the dry side, so this book may not please everyone. There isn't a lot of action in the traditional action/adventure sense, and female characters are usually absent or antagonistic. Still, if you're comfortable in a males-only, scientific atmosphere, there's plenty of good clean fun to be had at the White Hart."},{"Title":"Tales From The \\"White Hart","review":"Belly up to the bar lads and take a listen to the tales to be told at the White Hart Pub.

That's all well and good - were it not for the book's title. Tis NOT a book about poetry (as the editor acknowledges on page 1). Nor is its scope well described as &quot;Renaissance&quot; [ In fact its collection &quot;was intended to clafiry why the conventional image of the 'Renaissance' in England has LOST ITS EXPLANATORY VALUE for many scholars&quot; (also on page 1) (emphasis added).]The ten papers ARE important reading in literary criticism, including Alpers, Greenblatt, Patricia Parker, Nancy Vickers, Ferguson, and Richard Halpern - valuable for a student's study and repeated reference. But more extensive collections are available for much less money than Longman wants.In fact, I would regard the best value in this present volume's form to be the one original piece - the 20-page introduction by Malcolmson - whose summary of the chapters is a fine aid to the literary student. Observing the clarity of her writing and the even-handedness of her summaries, I would hope she will participate in a future full-volume survey of the field by some publisher.Other than for the fine introduction, I suggest you get the book (inexpensive used copies seem readily available) only if this PARTICULAR reprint collection meets your needs:CONTENTS:PART I: The Bower of Bliss: Formalism, New Historicism, Feminism.1.

It is a remarkable picture of the growing conflicts between the big capitalist powers--the US, Europe, and Japan--and the economic crises, colonial wars, and other problems that have issued from those conflicts since then. Moreover, there is a program, just as relevant then and today for workers, youth, farmers, racial and national minorities to fight their way out of that to socialism. Not prophecy, but scientific socialist answers about where we have been and where we are going."},{"Title":"New International no. 10: Imperialism's March Toward Fascism and War","review":"I reread this book last year in the midst of the unfolding economic crisis and was stunned to see how accurate the assessment presented was. All the main points are spot on. I went and verified the economic data that was referred to in the articles - again all very accurate.The book is full of hope for the future for working people. If the lessons of history are learned and acted upon.Well worth a read from anyone trying to make sense of the world today."},{"Title":"New International no. 10: Imperialism's March Toward Fascism and War","review":"This book explains the meaning of the 1987 New York stock market crash and its repercussions; the &quot;Special Period&quot; (term used in Cuba for the economic crisis caused by the collapse in trade with the former USSR and Eastern Bloc, the tightening of the U.S. trade embargo, and the revolution's own admitted errors); the struggle against Stalinism and the &quot;pockets of capitalism&quot; in Cuba, led by the Cuban Communist Party and the revolutionary government; and why the Cuban revolution is still an inspiration for working people all over the world. The march led by Yanqui-U.S. imperialism, in the first place, toward fascism and world war, against its allies/imperialist rivals, against the post-capitalist economic foundations which survive in the workers states ( ex-USSR, Eastern Europe, China, etc.) and against the workers and farmers the world over, including those in the imperialist countries, is explained as well. Finally, this book points out that there is only one road forward for the resistance to this barbarous future: to follow the example of the Bolshevik revolution and the example of the Cuban revolution, applied to the specific conditions of each country, which is both possible and necessary even in the imperialist countries, the U.S. included. Above all, this book is a message of hope and scientific confidence in the workers and farmers of the whole world, based on the experience of the militants who are building the beginnings of a revolutionary workers party in the belly of the Imperial Beast."},{"Title":"New International no. 10: Imperialism's March Toward Fascism and War","review":"This 1994 volume takes up the long-term economic crisis of capitalism and how it drives the U.S. rulers toward more severe conflicts with their international rivals, and toward a showdown with workers and farmers at home. It explains the rise of fascist perspectives, such as those of Patrick Buchanan and Jean-Marie Le Pen, as the inevitable product of the social crisis that is unfolding. And it describes the increasing use of military force to defend the interests of U.S. capitalism as the result of the needs of a declining empire, not just as the choice of certain politicians."},{"Title":"New International no. 10: Imperialism's March Toward Fascism and War","review":"&quot;OCTOBER 1987: a near-meltdown of stock exchanges world wide lays bare capitalism's new vulnerability and increaing instability. 1989-91: counterrevolutionary Stalinist police apparatuses in Eastern Europe and Soviet Union come tumbling down. 1991: a war against Iraq that Washington seeks to portray as victory of a new world order results instead in increasing conflicts among NATO powers themselves, and between them and others in the 'victorious coalition,' from Moscow to Riyadh.1991-1992: in Gulf War's aftermath, it becomes clear that world capitalism has sunk into depression conditions for the first time in half a century; polarization between wealth and poverty grows, insecurity deepens, and ultrarightist forces gain new ground. 1994: despite most difficult conditions in 35 years, Cuba's working people fight to maintain proletarian social relations conquered through their revolution, giving the lie to expectations of 'friend' and foe alike.&quot;These are just a few of the events analyzed in this issue of New International that have transformed world politics and frame the growing class conflicts and military confrontations before us today. How the working class and its allies respond to the accelerated capitalist disorder will determine whether or not imperialism's march toward fascism and war can be stopped....And whether a road to the communist future of humanity will be opened&quot; (from the back cover)."},{"Title":"New International no. 10: Imperialism's March Toward Fascism and War","review":"This set of articles, written in the early 1990s, is even more relevant today than when they were first written. In contrast to the George Bush the elder's boast that the US was leading us all into a \\"New World Order\\" of peace and prosperity, the perspective here is a sober and realistic one: the US is leading the world toward economic depression, a renewal of fascist movements, and if the working class does not take power, World War III. This assessment was based on a series of events, including the gigantic stock market crash of 1987. Preventing World War III, and all that would accompany it, is the challenge facing working people around the world and we need to organize NOW to make sure this is not our future. In light of this, this issue of New International includes an extremely informative article on Cuba, which shows that despite the \\"Special Period\\" they were living through, without aid from the Soviet Union, the Cubans were still fighting for a socialist society and because they refused to bow down to capitalist America, they continued to be a thorn in the side of the US. All of this is even more true today, as the stock market bubble of the 1990s has now decisively burst. And what is most striking today is how the jockeying for position heading into the war with Iraq is showing just what this article said: that competition between \\"allies\\" within NATO would sharpen. Just look at all the anti-French and German propaganda going around right now and you'll see just how accurate this set of articles was and still is today."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Girls (Plume)","review":"This book is so terribly funny and right on the mark.

That is why Adler is still in print. He understood the conflict between feelings of inferiority and striving for superiority. Even more importantly, he explained how fashioning a healthy synthesis of individuality (the creative self) and social interest (energy directed outside, beyond one's self) is the solution to feeling unhappy. Adler avoided the extremes of unrealistic optimism (as in humanistic and positive psychology) and of hopeless pessimism (as seen in Freud and some evolutionary psychology). His vision of psychological health is realistic, very human, and humane. Why read contemporary pop psych when Adler is still in print?"},{"Title":"What life should mean to you, (Capricorn books)","review":"Adler offers few fresh insights in this sequel to &quot;Understanding Human Nature&quot; as it mostly repeats his concepts of inferiority feelings and social feeling. In fact, one of the later chapters lifts sections of the first book word for word. Moreover, Adler veers into prejudice in his ardent promotion of social cooperation by suggesting single people or those without children are failing to meet their obligations to contribute to society. He also misattributes homosexuality to attachment issues. His first book is a classic - among the best I've ever read on psychology. This one is better left in the 1930s."},{"Title":"What life should mean to you, (Capricorn books)","review":"i dont agree with everything that the author has written here but the book is well structured and offers a point of view."},{"Title":"San Diego Activity And Coloring Book For All Ages","review":"I ordered this book for my two sons.

There need to be more books out there like this."},{"Title":"Ensemble, C'Est Tout (Litterature Generale) (French Edition)","review":"I'm 3/4 of the way through this delightfully engrossing 500+ page novel.Very hip and current. Lots of French slang. This author can writepages of quippy dialog that tell you huge amounts about the two characters engaged in conversation. She can also write pages of description and monologue that move the plot forward cleverly. The next time I'm in Paris, I'll be looking for these lovable characters at every turn. I just expect to run into them, hurrying by on a moto, waiting at the metro. They're that real. Whenever Camille refers to a specific artist who has inspired her - Vuillard, Albrecht Durer - I run to theInternet to look them up."},{"Title":"Ensemble, C'Est Tout (Litterature Generale) (French Edition)","review":"I really wanted to like this book and thought I would after seeing the good reviews on Amazon. However, the characters were just too uninteresting. After the big build up about what could have led the main female character, Camille, to turn out the way she did in her adult life, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. I found her character really uninteresting and unsympathetic. Her constant battles with the \\"cool cretin\\" seemed staged just to make me roll my eyes. One of the other main characters, Philibert, could have been interesting, but as soon as the author decided to turn her attention to the love story between the two other battling main characters, she seemed to forget about him. The Senegalese character seems so over the top and drawn from every silly stereotype the author could possibly find. Then there's the nice and tidy, cheesy ending where all of the pieces (very) suddenly come together nicely and everyone's problems are resolved. I made it to the end of the book, but I found it tedious, predictable, and cheesy. Another reviewer (wish I'd seen this review before I got the book), accurately described the characters and the storyline as cartoonish."},{"Title":"Ensemble, C'Est Tout (Litterature Generale) (French Edition)","review":"As a student of French for several years now, I took this book on at the suggestion of a French friend. The language is often colloquial and at times takes some deciphering but I found the character rendering clever yet convincing and the narrative delightful and unpredictable - there are no cliches here. After reading for an hour or two I tend to reflect on just how well this book is written and am most impressed with the author's skill and perception. I admit I'm only half way through it so cannot judge it overall but am glad of the experience so far. I wish there were an English translation so that my wife could share my pleasure."},{"Title":"Ensemble, C'Est Tout (Litterature Generale) (French Edition)","review":"I haven't looked at it yet. but it arrived within a week, and the cover looks so fine.it looks very nice!"},{"Title":"Rand McNally Virginia Peninsula Williamsburg","review":"Despite the fact that \\"Williamsburg\\" is in the name of this map, the Williamsburg portion of the map is relegated to a small box in the corner of one side. Instead, it's primarily a map of Newport News and surrounding areas. And the part that is of Williamsburg isn't even comprehensive - it cuts off the outlet-mall/Pottery area and the I-64/199 intersection, and there's no close-up of the Colonial Williamsburg attractions. Unless you need street-level detail for the residential areas of W'burg, you're better off with the free map they hand out in the historic area - it's not to scale, but everything is clearly marked and it covers the entire W'burg/James City County area."},{"Title":"Creative Walking for Physical Fitness","review":"Written in 1970, Creative Walking for Physical Fitness still holds up somewhat today. The best part about the book is that it's short and sweet. Yet it's not backed up by enough of evidence why walking is essential to sustenance of lifelong health. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it because I had nothing better to do while crapping in the toilet. I haven't really taken anything out of the book for my walks because walking is neither scientific nor advanced. Walking is walking. That's the beauty of it: the simplicity. I walk a lot because I have leg injuries due to laziness, so I am trying to get my body in shape to see if I can try to run or bike. Regardless how long it takes, walking remains the most impact-less form of exercise, and it always brings results. The biggest con of walking is that it takes a while because, for me, to walk a mile is 17 minutes versus 7 for a jog. So when the miles are added up, the longer it takes to walk. Of course, the results are worth it because when I don't walk for an extended period of time, my daily heart rate is about 60 to 65 BPM compared to 50 to 60 when I do. That's a big difference in terms of how much longer my age can be extended in the future. Anyway, the book is a good read because it is (1) simple, (2) motivating, and (3) never a chore. To improve the book, more evidence why walking is the key to long life would help plus a bit better and more reasonable mileage chart. All in all, if you happen to find it in some book sale and the title catches your eye, go ahead and pick it up by all means. Otherwise, don't worry about it and keep on walking everyday."},{"Title":"Stephen Morris","review":"STEPHEN MORRIS (inc. PILOTAGE) is both a compelling work of fiction and a very fine and thinly disguished memoir/history of the early days of British aviation immediately after the First World War. It is so good, in fact, that one wonders why he chose not to publish it: it did not appear until after his death. In its graceful and arresting writing, it anticipates his later aviation-theme novels, and in its glimpse of the proto-British aircraft industry, it calls to mind his autobiography SLIDE RULE. Shute, of course, made his living as a professional aeronautical engineer and stress calculator (as Nevil S. Norway), working for de Havilland on early biplane transport development, then the Vickers concern during the great days of British airship development, and then as a founder of the Airspeed company, a firm noted for the production of small, very high quality executive aircraft and trainers. As a novel, STEPHEN MORRIS and PILOTAGE (the two works are linked) anticipate those great novels of Saint-Exupery, SOUTHERN MAIL and NIGHT FLIGHT. As well, they call to mind Ernest Gann's best fiction, particularly his book BLAZE OF NOON. Shute understands the world of the airman (he was an accomplished light aircraft pilot), and, given his participation in the industry at the time, naturally understands the course of the field as well. This, too, echoes Saint-Ex and Gann. I would recommend that readers read all of these works to gain their own perspective on Shute, Saint-Ex, and Gann, as novelist-airmen and (in the case of Shute) as a designer and entrepreneur as well. In sum, STEPHEN MORRIS and PILOTAGE need to be read far more widely than they have been, and considered as major contributions to the early popular understanding of flight."},{"Title":"Stephen Morris","review":"Two novels/novellas published post-humously from the earliest writing period of Nevil Shute. The plots are standard and the aeronautical and nautical details are what will come to be expected from Shute's writing. It is of great interest to read two Shute love stories and glimpse how he will treat his heroines in the novels to come."},{"Title":"The Brontes: Charlotte Bronte & Her Family","review":"What a wonderful biography--it was as much of a page-turner as novel, because the Brontes were such an unusual, strange set of people. I learned a lot about the Brontes that I hadn't known, and the book illuminated C.B.'s novels for me. C.B. herself became much clearer to me as a person and I felt almost overwhelmed with sympathy for her. I'm awed by the immense courage she showed in everything she did--in leaving Haworth to go to Brussels, in going out as a governess, in getting her and her sisters' works out to the public, in visiting London as a famous author, and in just continuing to live and have hope after the crushing blows of her siblings' deaths one after another. Emily, too, is fascinating, both shy and wild, like an animal. The sense of tragedy hangs over the whole book because they all, except for the father, died so young. Charlotte outlived her mother and all her siblings, but she was only 39 when she died. I heartily recommend this biography."},{"Title":"The Brontes: Charlotte Bronte & Her Family","review":"This is probably one of the best biographies of Charlotte Bronte. A heartbreaking story."},{"Title":"The Brontes: Charlotte Bronte & Her Family","review":"Charlotte Bronte offended gravely against the standards of her day. Her portrayal of female charcters was realistic. She was a clergyman's daughter and a clergyman's wife. The countryside of Haworth was bleak and appealed to Charlotte Bronte's austere father, Patrick Bronte. He was vocal in support of the Evangelical movement. He was naturally gregarious and volatile. In 1820 Patrick was appointed perpetual curate at Haworth. The Brontes were isolated, socially.Readers of JANE EYRE have wondered whether the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge attended by Charlotte and her sisters resembled the Lowood School in the novel. Charlotte and her brother Branwell had read all of Byron by age twelve or thirteen. There was a volcanic quality to Charlotte's writing. Branwell had charm and brilliance. He was precocious.At Roe Head School Charlotte met Mary Taylor. Ellen Nussey became another dear friend at the school. The two girls described Charlotte as tired and old. Mary Taylor's family was argumentative and intellectual. Mr. Taylor, Mary's father, introduced Charlotte to the world of George Sand and Eugene Sue. Miss Wooler, the school head, emphasized orderliness and method. School distanced Charlotte from Branwell. Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher. Emily's period of being a student lasted only three months, whereupon she was replaced by Anne. Away from home, Charlotte missed writing Byronic tales.Branwell moved to Bradford seeking employment as a portrait painter. It was a competitive market and Branwell could not survive financially. By 1839 Branwell was becoming an embarassing problem to the family. He lost a job as tutor but started another job as a booking clerk for the railway. Charlotte was encouraged by Mary Taylor to go to Brussels. The Pensionnat Heger was recommended by the British Chaplain and his wife. Madame Heger welcomed Charlotte and Emily. Charlotte and Emily, ages twenty-five and twenty-three, were boarding with fifteen year olds.M. Heger, who taught some classes at his wife's school, understood contemporary literature. The following year, January 1843, Charlotte returned to Belgium. Emily remained at Haworth and Branwell and Anne were tutor and governess at Thorp Green. Subsequently Charlotte's correspondance with M. Heger was to cease and she began to write of love and betrayal in her poetry. She was to suffer from isolation adn a lack of employment. Her early novel, THE PROFESSOR, was published last.The sisters had poems published and then moved on to the publication OF AGNES GREY and THE TENANT AT WILDFELL HALL, (Anne), WUTHERING HEIGHTS, (Emily), and JANE EYRE, SHIRLEY, VILLETTE. Charlotte practiced self-abnegation. She sought in her writing to be guided by nature and truth. In one year Branwell, Emily, and Anne died. Charlotte was to marry. Her widower cared for Patrick Bronte at the end of his life.Rebecca Fraser does a wonderful job relating the Bronte story. The sense of place is expert, the parsonage at Haworth being very much present."},{"Title":"The Brontes: Charlotte Bronte & Her Family","review":"The book arrived on time and was in very good condition.

Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: a poetic tribute to warriors)"},{"Title":"212: The Extra Degree","review":"212: THE EXTRA DEGREE by Sam Parker is a short book--make that,a very short one--that has a lot of meat in its relatively few pages.You may have seen its basic premise; e.g., in an email that'sbeen widely circulated on the Internet (without giving propercredit to Parker):* At 211 degrees, water is hot.At 212 degrees, it boils.And with boiling water, comes steam.And with steam, you can power a train.One degree.Applying one extra degree of temperature to water means the differencebetween something that is simply very hot and something that generatesenough force to power a machine--a beautifully uncomplicated metaphorthat ideally should feed our every endeavor--consistently pushing us tomake the extra effort in every task, action and effort we undertake.Two-twelve serves as a forceful drill sergeant with its motivating andfocused message while adhering to a scientific law--a natural law. Itreminds us that seemingly small things can make tremendousdifferences. So simple is the analogy, that you can stop reading rightnow, walk away with the opening thought firmly planted in your mindand benefit from it for the rest of your life.I like how Parker then expands this premise through a seriesof thought-provoking facts, including this one:* Two of auto racing's premier events are The Daytona 500(stock car) and the Indianapolis 500 (formula one). Each takesroughly three to three and half hours to complete. In the 10-yearperiod between 1997 and 2006, combining all 20 races, the winnertook the checkered flag by an average margin of 1.71 seconds andtook home $1,426,003 in first place prize money. The averageprize for the second place finisher was $716,464--a difference of$709,539 - roughly half of the amount banked by the winner.The author also offers a series of action steps you can take, such as:* Eliminate one half hour of television watching each day and get182.5 hours each year to allocate elsewhere (equivalent to four andhalf weeks at work).And he concludes with several reflections that will get youthinking about life . . . I particularly liked the following:* Complaining once less a day chokes off 365 seeds of negativitya year.As the holidays approach, methinks 212 would be the perfectstocking stuffer for almost anybody on your list--including yourchildren and grandchildren, as well as nieces and nephews, whocould all gain from Parker's valuable insights."},{"Title":"212: The Extra Degree","review":"212 The Extra Degree by Sam Parker and Mac Anderson is a small book with some big ideas and a great way of simplifying the notion of taking action and achieving more.The premise is:\\"At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water comes steam. And steam can power a locomotive.\\"So, it's about the power of one degree, or that tiny bit of extra effort that can make all the difference in our lives.It's about raising your awareness and understanding that one extra bit of effort, one additional bit of action, can totally change your results. To that end, they have included some quite interesting stories, statistics and quotes throughout the book.Some of these you will be familiar with, particularly if you are a student of motivational literature. But, some, you might find worth learning about.One of these is that the average margin of victory in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 over the last ten years has been 1.54 seconds (how quick is that?) and that the winner--the driver who got there 1.54 seconds faster than the one behind him won more than double the prize money. That's an expensive couple of seconds.The book is divided into five sections/chapters.1--Introduction - What 212 degrees is all about.2--Thoughts and Facts--quotes and examples that illustrate the concept.3--Stories about Success, Attitude, Leadership, Kindness, Commitment, Belief, Focus and Perseverance.4--Actions. Sample action steps which will help you heat things up to 212.5--Reflections. Information about using the 212 information to improve your life--with examples on such ideas as practicing kindness, stopping complaining, and more.Maintaining motivation can be difficult. Inertia overtakes us and we dig ourselves a rut and hunker down in it, or we burn ourselves out trying to do and be everything and dig ourselves a hole and crawl in. Having resources like this book on hand can help you climb back out and get back to work on what you are supposed to be doing. Then, you'll find yourself climbing mountains and raising the bar.

I look forward to many sequels."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"Picking up nearly two decades after the television show, Armageddon continues the story of the Galactica and her quest for Earth. Having eluded the Cylon threat for six yahren, Apollo and Starbuck are on patrol - Starbuck in his old ship, Apollo in his new Scarlet Viper - when they discover a planet about to be destroyed because of its helix orbit. The planet also turns out to house a Cylon base, leading to the supposed death of Starbuck as Apollo escapes to warn the fleet.The scenario introduces the first bit of revisionist history in the book - holographic flight displays inside warrior helmets and shipboard computers that talk back a l&aacute; Star Trek (C.O.R.A. not included). But a bigger (and harder to swallow) previously unknown fact is Apollo's telepathic abilities, and those of his family, being of pure Kobollian blood. (Even his adopted son Troy, nee Boxey, is lucky enough to be of Kobollian parentage and will, presumably, be able to talk head-to-head with dad.) Apollo uses his mind powers to have visions of Starbuck still alive, of the destruction of the fleet, and, in a near-useless scene, to communicate with an injured alien that does nothing in this story, but will probably figure in stories to come.Returning to the Galactica, Apollo arrives in time for the death of Adama and to be named the new commander. Then he leaves to search for Starbuck, as the fleet goes into turmoil - different factions wanting to put someone other than Adama's children in charge, Borellian Nomen taking over the prison ship, Troy and Dalton trapped in the Pit, and Boomer under attack from pesky Quorum blackshirts. The story jumps from sub-plot to sub-plot, and the good guys manage to get out of all the jams, although not always to the degree of detail or believability I would have liked. Little golden lightbulbs that work because you just know where to put them? Cylon computers that can be made to speak Kobollian? Human DNA part of the Cylon genetic code? Phased ships that can land on Base Stars, but pass throu! gh Battlestars? As the Church Lady says, &quot;Isn't that conveeeeniant?&quot;Another point that sticks out in these multi-cultural times: &quot;Most Leonids had dark skin, an evolutionary change in pigmentation due to their proximity to the sun.&quot; (pg. 43) The fact that every black person (so far there are two, Boomer and Tigh) is from Leonis seems a bit too racial to me.Also, eighteen years of searching for Earth have made tempers a bit short among the fleet's populace - broadcasts of the sedition and insurrection Apollo's family and Boomer have to deal with, and a large number of deaths during the upheaval show that humanity doesn't much care if it survives or not. Not exactly what you'd expect from a group that represents the last hope for the race.It's easy to see from the writing that both Hatch and Golden are familiar with scripting comic books - a medium that relies on visuals as well as words - and their words aren't quite powerful enough to make Armageddon the kind of story it could and should have been. Yet somehow the book is true to Battlestar Galactica - the events that take place are exactly the type of things that happened in the television show. But that was twenty years ago. Galactica's audience has grown up; they deserve to have the world of Battlestar Galactica grow up too."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"I've been a Battlestar Galactica fan from the beginning, and I have to say I have read a lot of fan fiction (including a lot of bad fan fiction!) that's actually better and more consistent to the series than this.

He isn't some number-crunching executive who sits at a desk wondering the best way to make a particular bottom-line longer. Instead he worries about what the fans WANT. He understands everything that made the original \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" great, and what's more he didn't turn into a hate monger against the New Series, but instead choose to reach out and embrace it's fanbase as well. It was a campy joyride, that, much like \\"Star Wars,\\" drew on archetypes that were universal and represented the paragon of humanity.Beyond simply that, he makes them grow, but within their archetypes. Apollo goes from simply a hero to a man bordering between the Earthly and the devine. Adama goes on to join the Lords of Kobol. Starbuck is still Starbuck. Tigh takes on new responsibility, and we truly feel for him. Boomer remains a brave warrior. And, most importantly ZAC'S BACK! You have no idea how much it always bugged me that his death didn't tie into the series very well (unless I missed an episode). What's more, he helps to reveal a great deal of information about the Lords of Kobol.To be honest if any continuation is made that does not follow this storyline I will be furious.

I then began reading my husbands collection of Battlestar Galactica books by Richard Hatch.

The book does a great job in bringing you up to speed, and filling in many blanks they plagued T.V. viewers so many years ago. I liked the origin explanation of the Cylons.Also, you can see where many themes of the old testament are relevant here as they are also mixed in with Greek mythos. Those that are familar with the bible will appreciate many of the parallel's drwan here in the book.Decent plot, begs for a sequel. The only reason this did not rate 5 stars was the lack of action in space battles. Though the battles were there, I felt as if I were missing the feel of sitting in a Viper and blasting Cylons.Kudos to Richard Hatch and Christopher Golden."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"NB: This review is in two parts.Armageddon is not the best battlestar galactica book I have read, I feel that accolade should go to Robert Thurston/Glen Larson's original BSG novel. The reason, beside's that it is brilliantly written, is that it is the story of BSG at it's most raw. The novel was written directly from the original script as the first episode (Saga of a Starworld!) of BSG was being filmed, hence the reason why there are pre-production paintings of the battlestar and it's vipers displayed within the novel as opposed to actual FX shots from the episode. The story reflected how Larson originally envisioned the BSG saga to be, with the Cylons being scripted as a sort of cybernetic reptillian hybrid, plus Serina (Apollo's love interest) survives at the end of the novel as it was originally scripted. Though for the TV episode, at Jane Seymour's request, the death of her character was written into the final shooting script and filmed, only to have her death then edited out again of the episode when test audiences found it too upsetting. So I would recommend the Thurston/ Larson original novel to any fan of BSG who wanted to see how the story was originally envisioned.The reason why I mentioned that novel in this review is because Hatch's Armageddon returns the BSG saga to this standard. I have read some of the unfair complaints here about how Hatch is only glorifying his character of Apollo at the expense of the others. This is untrue, actually the plot revolves around quite a lot of the original characters (some of whom merely served as window dressing in the TV series) as well as the new ones. Hatch actually creates an intriguing character out of Athena, turning her into a thoughtful but discplinarian individual who finds herself promoted to battlestar commander.Hatch not only ressurrects the BSG saga but also adds a touch of much-needed revisionism to it's studio-induced faults. For instance Hatch completely ignores the final TV episode \\"The Hand of God\\" in his continuation (which I welcome because I always found the idea of Adama releasing Baltar just because he aides them in destroying a Cylon base ship absolutely ridiculous - I mean the presence of the base ship threatened Baltar's life as much as the Colonials, there was no need to make any bargains with the traitor!). Hatch most probably ignored this episode because at the end of the it the Colonials receive a transmission of the Apollo moon landing from earth which led way to the whole awful Galactica 80 concept.The Cylons themselves also undergo some revisionism as Hatch reverts them back to their reptillian/cyborg origins. I think this is the most welcome change! I hated the way the studio execs interferred and had the Cylons rewritten as being robots (explained to us through an awful piece of exposition between Apollo and boxey which was added at the last minute to episode 1 befored it aired on TV. Thankfully the cinema version had no such interference!). Another character who gets a bit of a rewrite is Lucifer, the annoying \\"fem-bot\\" who was obviously modelled on C3PO and who spent most of the series involved in a \\"queenie\\" power struggle with Baltar. In Armageddon Lucifer becomes an evil and physically strong cyborg who lusts for the death of Baltar and the human race. He comes off as quite a scary character in the novel. Thanks to Hatch, he finally becomes a villain worthy of the name of \\"Lucifer\\".Hatch also tries to explain some of the plot holes in the TV series that were caused by studio-interference. Hatch, for instance, explains why Baltar was promoted to Cylon commander in the TV series whereas in the movie/ original novel he was killed by the Cylons (according to Hatch the Cylons were secretly studying the logic traits of Baltar so they could create a Human Logic Function chip for their cyborg warriors. They planned to kill Baltar once it was completed!). It turns out the Cylons were only using Baltar after all, he never really was in charge of a Cylon base ship. Anyway I never liked that absured studio-induced plot device in the TV series which saw baltar being the main villain who leads the Cylon task force against the Galactica. I much preferred the poetic justice of him being killed off by his Cylon collaborators. I do like the way that Hatch has Baltar being a scheming prisoner (like some sort of Dr Smith from Lost in Space) of the colonials. I feel that this concept suits the Baltar character much better than the \\"primary villain\\" he became in the TV series.As for villains, Hatch does reveal the origins of the Cylons :****SPOILERS******!!! In the novel it is explained that the natives of the planet Cylon were a reptillian race who were visited by Count Iblis who gave them the technology to evolve themselves into cyborg warriors and conquer the universe. ******* END OF SPOILERS!!!!Now although the above explanation for the Cylons is not exactly one that I would have preferred, it is however far better than the awful one conjured up by the studio-execs in that exposition delivered by Apollo in episode 1 (That the Cylons are actually meglomanical robotic servants of some long-exctinct alien race, who hate humans for getting involved in their affairs).Continues in part 2...."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"For the first Galactica book in a decade that is not a novelization of a previous teleplay, this book will likely be a disappointment to loyal fanswho have waited with anticipation for its arrival. I know that I, for one, checked out the bookstore each day until it came in, then quickly purchased it when it was available. It was worth the $20 to satisfy my burning curiosity, but that was about it. If Battlestar Galactica is ever to enjoy a comeback (as I really, really would like to see), writers such as Hatch and Golden will have to take a long, very serious look at how creative and tightly written the competition is these days. This book wouldn't make it to Michael Piller's desk for even a cursory perusal.After reading the first chapter, I thought to myself, &quot;this writing is terrible.&quot; The book is far too dependent on dialogue to convey the story line. When narrative is introduced, far too often it is third-person description of what a character is thinking. After a while, I got to feeling that I really didn't care what Starbuck, Apollo, Athena, or anyone else thought about something they were witnessing or reflecting upon. The reader is told everything, and as such the reader is disengaged as an active participant in the plot and character development.The reason being that the characters themselves are transparent as cellophane. Compared to the novelization of the original Battlestar Galactica, they only have meaning by what they do in the book, and through what they have done, as relayed awkwardly through brief descriptions of moments from the past, where the authors slip out of style and begin writing in parenthetical statements without the parentheses.The writing itself is nothing short of pedestrian. There are instances where certain words are used over and over again: words that should be used sparingly. The one that comes to mind is the word &quot;irised&quot; as a verb for &quot;opened.&quot; On two consecutive pages, I think the door &quot;irised&quot; open about five times. It got really old after thesecond time.As for the timeline, the authors try to stick to references from the original series to explain some history. In some places, once again, this third-person omnipotent storytelling is awkwardly inserted into the middle of the thoughtprocess of a character. However, despite the authors' attempt to &quot;remind&quot; readers of what happened during the series, there are obvious errors and inconsistencies. For example, the authors never explain how Baltar got back aboard a Base Star; we would assume that, indeed, he was set free as Adama promised he would do in exchange for information regarding the internal structure of the Base Star that Apollo and Starbuck sabotaged in &quot;The Hand Of God,&quot; the very last episode of the series. Similarly, as Apollo and Starbuck are making their way around a Base Star in this book, there is no mention made of them ever having been on one before.In addition, the fact that Starbuck discovers what's under all that plating on a centurion doesn't conform with the series either. In the episode &quot;Baltar's Escape,&quot; Dr. Wilker is charged with the task of piecing together one of the centurions who co-piloted Baltar's Cylon Raider when he surrendered to the Galactica in &quot;War of the Gods.&quot; Dr. Wilker had been studying the centurions and, as far as I recall, found them to be all wires and electronics. After all, if they had been organic life forms, wouldn't Dr. Salik have been studying them?As much as the authors try to stick to Colonial time units, they missed a bunch of places where they use &quot;year&quot; for &quot;yahren&quot; and &quot;day&quot; for &quot;cycle.&quot; Furthermore, I had always thought the spelling of one of their expletives was &quot;felgercarb;&quot; in fact, if you listen toStarbuck on any of the episodes (he's the only one that ever says it), you can clearly hear the &quot;c&quot; in &quot;...carb&quot;. Anyway, in the book it has become &quot;feldergarb.&quot;Another problem that I have is the fact that every one of the familiar characters is now a very high-ranking military officer (Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel) yet they are still just pilots, not serving any other function other than that which they have always filled. Yes, while I will admit that after 18 years, Starbuck and Boomer shouldn't be Lieutenants anymore, the Colonial military looks a little top heavy. Of course, I've never understood the use ofarmy ranks on Galactica, when every other ship I've ever seen on a screen follows navy ranks. After all, they are on a ship, not in the Cavalry.As for the story line itself, there is a lot crammed into this 12-point type on 16-point leading, 309-page book (there's lots of blank pages). Too much, I think. The synopsis: Apollo and Starbuck are on patrol; they run into Cylons whom they haven't seen in six years (it says &quot;years&quot; at one point); Starbuck's ship is clobbered and he crashes on a planet and is presumed by Apollo to be dead. Apollo returns to the fleet just as Adama dies; Apollo is named &quot;acting&quot; commander until the Quorum can assess other candidates for the position; a power struggle ensues, with Ambassador Puck leading the way; Apollo finds a secret room in Adama's chambers and finds out secrets about the Lords of Kobol, and the origins of the colonies and of his own family; he has a vision that Starbuck is still alive; he puts Athena in charge of the fleet and leaves to rescue Starbuck; there is a murder onone of the Agro ships, but no one can identify the remains; insurrections begin on several ships regarding leadership of the fleet, with most of malcontents favoring Puck; on route to the planet where Starbuck crashed (yes, he is alive), Apollo runs into &quot;new&quot; Cylons with a cloaking device; he is saved at the last minute by one of the lightships from &quot;War of the Gods;&quot; he meets his dead brother Zak on the lightship, who gives him more details about the Lords of Kobol and about Count Iblis, who it appears is behind the trouble in the fleet; Apollo rescues Starbuck; there is major rebellion on a number of ships in the fleet; Starbuck and Apollo have discovered the Cylons' plan to attack the Galactica and the fleet; they decide to go after Baltar to get the last piece of the Kobol-Earth puzzle; Baltar helps them to escape after escaping execution himself; they return to the Galactica; Apollo and Starbuckplay some heroics and win the day despite overwhelming Cylon odds; Iblis is defeated.There's plenty of loose ends for the next book.There's lots of cutesy going on as well: Sheba and Apollo are going to get married; Starbuck still can't decide on Athena or Cassiopeia; Troy (Boxey) and Dalton (Starbuck and Cassiopeia's daughter) have the hots for each other. It's not exciting nor is it in the least bit dramatic. The tension between any one of the main characters is totally diffused by their allegiance to the Galactica and whomever's in charge. The hardest pill to swallow is the 180-degree turn-around in the relationship between Athena and Apollo, which is described early in the book as cautious, but which becomes as comfortable as a pair of old Chuck Taylors by the time Apollo returns from rescuing Starbuck.Not to sound totally negative, there are some things that are interesting, even compelling. But I'll leave that to the die-hards out there to find out for themselves. The book will only be for them in the end; I doubt if such mediocre writing and thin character development will ever appeal to the general reading public."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"I thought this book wouldn't be that good because of the reviews on the site.

However, this book needed another going over to make it more professional. Not to upset the man as he is a likable person and I admire him greatly, but the writing style needs to be honed just a bit more. He will move the characters through a situation in chapter 4 and in chapter 5 recap what had happened. I found examples like this very distracting and it took away from the flow of an otherwise good story. Altho, the beginning seemed a bit too padded for me. Too much mourning over the passing of Adama and worry over who's to be commander. Isn't the Galactica under martial law? Are elections for Commanders really an issue? Why not just promote Apollo? Why whould his own sister turn against him? And so forth. the infighting was annoying, but the continuation of the story and Baltar's story was fascinating (altho, I feel that if he were really no longer needed, the Cylons would just kill him. Always wondered why Baltar WANTED to catch the humans. That would spell his end anyway...). Ah well, Warhawk is probably better...(I hope)"},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"Much has been written about Battlestar Galactica, the story of a mammoth warship guarding the last survivors of Twelve Worlds seeking the final outpost of humanity - Earth. It began as a television series in 1978, one that lasted but one season due to the show's expense and to network indifference. A spinoff series ran briefly in 1980 but was unsatisfying at most levels.Battlestar Galactica has often been condemned as poorly conceived and abysmally written. True, it was made into a weekly series when it should have been a series of bi-monthly movies (the original concept creator-producer Glen Larson had in mind) and as a result scripts had a very uneven quality to them. That they nonetheless turned out quite well says a great deal about the concept.It wasn't until Rob Liefeld and Robert Napton came out with a Battlestar Galactica comic book series in 1995 that the concept truly came into its own. The comic was beautifully written and created, able to explore c! haracters and ideas the show was unable to explore at the time of its initial run, and remains among the finest graphic novels ever put to print.Richard Hatch, the show's star as Captain Apollo, contributed one of the comic's stories, &quot;Apollo's Journey,&quot; a story that served as a rough draft for the novel he has coauthored with Chris Golden. Hatch expands on the basic &quot;Apollo's Journey&quot; storyline and co-fashions a gripping read.The Galactica and the fleet of refugee ships under her protection are caught in the grip of political turmoil, as Commander Adama, the fleet's leader since the Final Destruction of the Twelve Colonies, dies. The turmoil, it turns out, is the machinations of Count Iblis, a mystical being with a stunning tie to the scourge of the fleet, the Cylons.The plot and its branches are too extensive to detail here, but they are grippingly laid out, with superb exploration of the huge cast of characters created for Galactica.Th! ere are minor nits to pick - the novel lists the Galactica ! as only carrying 75 fightercraft, yet the ship's vast size - well over 2,000 feet in length - allows the fielding of nearly 200 fightercraft. But such quibbles don't greatly injure what is an immensely enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"I DID NOT HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR THESE GALACTICA BOOKS. I'M A BIG TIME BSG FAN FROM WAY BACK AND DIDN'T EXPECT ARMAGEDDON TO CAPTURE THE SPIRIT AND FUN OF THE SERIES... BUT IT DID! THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL IS ALIVE IN THIS NOVEL AND THEY'VE UPDATED THINGS TOO. THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS HAVE GROWN OVER THE YEARS AND THERE'S NEW BLOOD ADDED WITH THE ADDITION OF NEW AND YOUNGER CHARACTERS. VERY IMPRESSIVE! ARMAGEDDON GIVE US THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"Overall, I very much enjoyed my reunion with the Battlestar Galctica universe. Contrary to some other editorials about the writing quality, I found no problems with it. I highly recommend it. I do not wish to dwell on the negative or to suggest with negative comments that this book is not worthwhile. However, I think my comments could help the formation of the new BG universe, with all humility of course.I do not like the facts presented that a battlestar holds only 75 vipers nor that the whole of the colonies only had twelve battlestars. Very unrealistic! The US Air Force has thousands of fighter planes and nearly a dozen aircraft carriers. And this is in peace time! Direct comparisons are difficult of course. But, think this this point is quite reasonable. BTW, with billions of people and 12 times 75 vipers, 900 pilots plus back-ups only. The planets must have had thousands of vipers and pilots. We can improve the BG universe by incorporating these points within the resources constraints of the fleet.Spoiler spaceThe kamikazee flight of the lone scarlet viper packed with solenite into one of the base ships bothered me. One, if it were so easy to destroy a base ship...well!!! I would amend the story by saying that the lone viper phased back into the base ship's reality inside of it and in a vulnerable spot just prior to exploding.The ramming of the freighter into the second baseship also bothered me. In the series we learned that the base ship outguns a battlestar. So it is reasonable to assume that it could destroy that freighter. The book stresses that the Cylons would fail to accept mass suicide on the part of a crew of an entire freighter. I think this is overly relied upon. Instead, I would have had Starbuck in his commandered raider straffing the baseships flank missile batteries, phasing in and out of the base ship's reality. Then, the freighter could ram the base ship.The last major thing that bothered me was all of the mystery or unknown about the make-u! p of a typical centurion. After a thousand yahren of warefare with them, including many victories, it is ABSOLUTELY inconceivable that the colonies would not have captured and disassembled/disected thousands of centurions. The history of warfare is replete with the examination of the enemies armaments and soliders while war still wages. I can't fix this one except to say that these lizard cylons could be a different flavor (I am not confusing these with the dark, ebon soldiers introduced to Baltar as his children by Lucifer.) of Centurions recently introduced enmass for some reason.In closing, despite these amendable flaws, this book lays the foundation for a re-birth of the storyline. I would like to see it return to the screen but would be happy to just read many books centrally controlled by Richard Hatch."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"I had read some of the other reviews of this book before I bought it, but I don't generally follow other's opinions when it comes to criticism of art forms. I found Battlestar Galactica: Armaggedon a really enjoying book which faithfully takes us back to the universe we know and loved from the TV series 20 &quot;yahren&quot; ago. The writing is a bit lacking in creativity, and sometimes the dialogue is a bit canned. I found myself thinking, especially when Dalton or Troy were speaking, are they really saying this or what? Their dialogue seems the least bit inspiring and it seems they say things just to fill the page. Anger and other emotions fall flat when they talk to one another. The only other problems I found was the philosophical viewpoint of setting the timeframe so far into the future. Why 18 yahren? Granted, it opens up the growth of the Troy and Dalton, but other than that, everything else is still the same. Sheba, Boomer, et. al. just have higher ranks. They are still searching and still fighting the Cylon empire. The other tidbit is the fact of what is inside the Cylon Centurion armor. I always thought that the Cylons were all robotic. The book now says that the Cylons were a blend of human and reptile DNA (humanoid reptiles). This in not consistent with the series. Beyond these few critiques, it was definitely entertaining and kept me at the edge of my seat quite a few times. Short chapters also help if you read chapter to chapter. 309 pages is also manageable for those on time constraints. The final analysis: I can't wait for volume 2!!!!"},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"i've read three books in this series: armageddon, warhawk, and destiny. i've enjoyed all three. i would love to see these as t.v. movies or films."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"Battlestar Galactica:Armageddon is to sci-fi reading what Indiana Jones was to movies; non-stop excitement and action.

It did not surprise me that the book seemed to center around Apollo, after all, it was written by the actor that played Apollo. However, Apollo WAS one of the major characters in the series, so this is not too much of a distraction. Unfortunately, the book was plagued by inconsistencies, such as the Cylon Centurions being reptilian-cyborg hybrids (which matches the original novel, but not the television series - remember that they captured Baltar, and disassembled his pilots.) and the mis-spelling of the word &quot;felgercarb&quot; all through the book (but the glossary at least got it right.)

Don't forget Adama was alive thirty years after the Galactica and fleet left the colonies for Earth. Apollo had died at the hands of the Cylons, Starbuck crashed on a planet only to help deliver Dr.Zee to the fleet and Boomer was a full colonel during Galactica 1980. One story element holds true and that is the character of Troy. Obviously the writers did not consult the short-lived Galactica 1980 series for their book because the first chapter of this new book is totally inconsistent with the actual series. Too bad because had the series survived before Galactica 1980 I'm sure it would have gone in the direction Richard Hatch has forseen. But sorry guys, your timeline of events and the death of Adama is inconsistent with what has been written before and televised before. Next time check your background information first. Side note, the character of Rigel was a woman played by actress Sarah Rush, check your end credits of each Original Series episode. Way too many inconsistencies!"},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"I have to admit being stunned at the plethora of 4 and 5 star reviews for this cretinous mess of a novel. Have any of you ever WATCHED Battlestar Galactica? To paraphrase a line from Lloyd Bentsen, I've watched Battlestar Galactica, and this is NOT Battlestar Galactica. Hatch has produced a book that aggrandizes his character at the expense of all the others, and in addition is riddled with stupid mistakes of fact (Rigel a man, Omega elderly, etc etc etc), spelling errors (he can't even spell &quot;felgercarb,&quot; for sagan's sake!), and various irritants including his horrible racist &quot;only the pure blood of Kobol can rule&quot; concept.

I definitely want to read the sequels."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"(Continued)Revisionism aside, the story of Armageddon is a very good one, better than any episode of the TV series. There are many plot strands which are woven together very aptly. The novel is actually quite well written (for a TV series tie-in novel) and Hatch includes a glossary at the back of the novel for all the Colonial measurements and expressions. The plot of Armageddon revolves around a power struggle for the control of the Galactica in the wake of commander Adama's death. Both Apollo and Athena, along with various others are all fighting each other for the seat of command. This in-fighting soon leads to mutiny while Apollo finds he is developing new \\"extra-sensory perception\\" (ESP) powers which enables him to come face to face with Count Iblis, who in turn is trying to destroy the fleet. The story resolves itself quite nicely and sets itself up for the next novel.On the negative side I did find that the novel \\"began\\" rather suddenly without any kind of prologue to explain the gap of nearly 20 years between where the series left off and where this novel starts. I also felt that the Cylons were introduced rather too quickly into the plot (given that they had not encountered the colonials for over 6 years). But I suppose we can put this down to the novel being written in the style of a TV episode of the BSG series, where everything develops rather quickly so as not to bog the story down. Although I would have preferred if there was a stronger buildup to the big battle in the novel, I felt that the battle came about rather too quickly.Another fault that I did find jarring was the odd remark made by Hatch in the novel to the Cylons being awful, almost mindless warriors who are bad shots!. I felt that Hatch, who was doing good with his revisonism regarding the Cylons!, should not have made the Cylons appear so inept. I felt that Hatch had a wonderful opportunity to complete rewrite the studio-maligned concept of the Cylons so that they would reflect what they were originally scripted to be. The only reason why the Cylons were made to appear so slow and easy to kill in the TV series was due to studio pressure (the studio execs wanted human casualties to be kept to a minimum, and so Cylons became laser fodder to the colonials!). Hatch should have pushed his revisionism further to make the Cylons appear more like the \\"alien race who managed to wage war with humanity for 1,000 years before annihilating most of them in a cunning trap, and not to mention that they managed to create a powerful galactic alliance amongst other alien races, as well as successfully destroying any alien race who appeared to oppose them\\".Despite this I still award the Armageddon novel 5 stars for the tremendous effort Hatch has put into trying to revive the series (which he actually does not own any rights to) via this novel and the subsequent trailer for the BSG: THE SECOND COMING. By the way if you have not seen Hatch's trailer for his proposed revival of BSG, then you would be pleased to learn that this novel is the blueprint for that trailer !.Phew! well this review was almost as long as the wait which we fans had to endure for this great epic to be continued!! I definitely recommend Armageddon to either the casual or die-hard BSG fan. It is maturely written, has plenty of action and is quite violent as well. To put it bluntly, if this novel had been made into an episode of BSG back in 1978, it would simply be considered the best BSG episode ever aired!By the way I would recommend to every BSG fan to stay clear of the proposed re-imagining of BSG by the \\"sigh!\\"-fi channel when it crashes to our screens this december. Just read these continuation novels by Richard Hatch and let your imagination create the SFX that will easily outshine the low-budget CGI that the remake will use."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"The Galactica and its fleet are still out there looking for earth. Adama has died and the people of the fleet are greatly divided as to who they want to take command causing the pitting of brother against sister.

I wondered how Richard was going to tie these pieces together, but, having faith in Mr. Hatch's knowledge of the world of BSG, I was sure he'd find a way, and he did. The story flows and all pieces fall into place. I greatly enjoyed this story.

It is a hard exhistance trying to live in old hulls and cast iron compartments no larger than a mop closet, but they had to survive the hollocaust that wiped out their worlds, and everything the held dear. They took to the stars... those who could walk or crawl to a ship before it departed from the bleeding planets. They followed Commander Adama, who was a great and very wise man. They believed in him, and wanted - NO - they needed a leader for them to feel safe. Commander Adama stepped forward out of the shadows of the deaths of his son, his wife, and lastly, his daughter-in-law, who wed Adams' eldest son, Captain Apollo shortly after they began their trek in space.Now, twenty years have past. Twenty years still on a course for Earth, but never finding it. The future is precarious for these people, tragically, Commander Adama is gone. He would not live to see the planet he longed so to bring his people to. Earth was out there, but Commander Adama was not meant to walk its sacred pathways. Instead, there is the need of new and capible Supreme Commander and their are plenty of choices bitting for the vaccancy. This is a troubling time for the Colonial Fleet.

Tormented and saddened, Apollo must keep faith not with Athena, or President Tigh, but with beings of a heigher order. He must find the courage to discover the voice that wants to be free. It is something as much of Apollo as air. Without that voice, the fleet is doomed and the missing warrior will never be found alive. Will Commander Apollo abandon the Galactica and her crew to chance after someting President Tigh and Athena cannon possibly understand, or will Apollo be willing to give his life to keep the fleet save from the Cylons?Read Battlestar Galactica: Armegeddon.

And even more excited to find it on Amazon.com after fruitless searches in local book retailers.The story itself is an excellent continuations of the &quot;Galactica&quot; saga and it's obvious that Richard Hatch has a deep and profound love and understanding for the concept. Some might have a problem with the novel's stripped-down, bare bones narrative style which does the job of getting the reader from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot; but doesn't allow for a lot of in-depth characterization.However, some people (like myself) with a visual mind can picture the action as they read along, as if it were a new episode of this series. Hopefully the fact that it doesn't read like Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; series (with explanations of explanations and so forth) will not be a turn-off to potential new fans.Overall, I would say that this novel is a definite must for any &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; fan, and an enjoyable, easy read for anyone just interested in a good, escapist yarn."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"I enjoyed watching BG on TV. When I first learned that this trilogy was being written by Richard Hatch, I must admit that I snickered at the thought of the man who played Apollo trying to get published! Knowing of infamous on the set battling between the two major stars, I expected Starbuck to be killed off immediately. Boy was I wrong! I couldn't resist the tempation to check back in with these characters, so I picked up the first book and was pleasantly surprised by the content!Richard Hatch has done an excellent job in maturing the characters without losing any of their charm. Taking place seventeen years from the TV timeline, Adama dies and leaves his son and daughter to take over most of his responsibilities. This puts Athena in as a central and important character.The author adds some interesting back story such as more information on Kobol and the council, and places most of the emphasis on Starbuck and Apollo's relationship. By the end of the trilogy, we are reunited with our favorite guest characters such as Cain, Baltar, Tigh, Count Iblis, and the Noman, and we are introduced to the mature Troy (aka Boxey) and Dalton (daughter of Cassi and Starbuck). I loved it. Okay, there were some annoying typos and unique backstories used to explain things, but at the end of the book, you will be intrigued by the plot and fascinated at the things you never got to see played out on the show.

I was not expecting elegant prose, but it would have been nice had the writing and sentence structure been geared at the very least toward someone of the high school age group; there were many bothersome incomplete sentences, while many others provided very little detail that was not absolutely essential to the story.I had been hoping for something on the caliber of the first two Larson/Thurston novels (let's face it - the other 12 books in the original series did not compare to the first two). Alas, I was disappointed.Storywise, however, it was nice to see the women in the Galactica universe having something to do other than play doorbell and &quot;nurse Nancy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon","review":"Having watched the show during it's original run, at the age of 14, and being a long-term fan I was skeptical that anyone could do the show justice in a book-form revival.

When the bear is not included with Boysie's many presents, he comes up with a plan to get the bear on his own. Boysie coaxes his little friend K-fer the kitten onto the table, hoping that a scuffle will ensue between K-fer and a large bully cat in the house. The scheme works; the bully cat pushes K-fer off the table along with the bear.It's likely the author was trying to illustrate self-reliance and ingenuity. Instead, the story makes it clear that it is acceptable to deliberately put a friend in harm's way to get what you covet. I find this to be a disturbing message, and I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"La Scala West: The Dallas Opera under Kelly and Rescigno","review":"This history of the early years of the Dallas Opera covers the period from 1957, when the Dallas Civic Opera was inaugurated by Lawrence Kelly and Nicola Rescigno, to 1976, two years after Kelly's death. If nothing else, the profusion of production photographs, many rarely seen, would make this book worth perusal. Ronald L. Davis is a professor of history who has written about opera before. His workmanlike writing style cannot entirely avoid the occasional feeling of simply plodding through descriptions of the productions, with these singers, that producer, that director, et al. Still, overall, he manages to convey the excitement of these years, when the Dallas company brought stars of the caliber of Callas, Sutherland and Zeffirelli, in operas that the Met and other mainstream companies wouldn't touch, such as Alcina, Medea and L'Italiana in Algeri. The brashness and charm of Lawrence Kelly, whose vision started the company and whose charm and persuasiveness often kept it going through financial crises that would have sunk other organizations, emerges clearly as well."},{"Title":"La Scala West: The Dallas Opera under Kelly and Rescigno","review":"La Scala West provides a detailed and much needed look into the work of two persons who have been long neglected in the operatic canon. Though it favors the entepreneur Kelly it doesn't neglect to give credit to Nicola Rescigno as most reviews of his work do. Both men, it seems, were instrumental in changing the face of Opera in America in the 1950's and 1960's and have even been posthumously been slighted by the establishments of the great Opera companies, some of which they helped create.Though Mr. Davis doesn't delve too much here into the blame game, he is the one soul brave enough to speak out for these sorely missed men and their art."},{"Title":"Adventure Travel Activity and Coloring Book","review":"This is a wonderful book for kids to learn about different areas of the world.

This off balanced emphasis in the prophetic opens the Body of Christ to deception, which over and over again (throughout the scriptures) we are warned to take heed against, and which is often ignored today. We to often err on leniency in the name of grace instead of despising the false prophecies, as we should.This is a controversial issue that John Bevere does not skirt. It is a book written with a pastor's heart of protecting the flock. As John Bevere said so well in this book, \\"teaching establishes, but warnings protect us.\\" This book is both a teaching and a warning for us today.It is a must read for everyone. For those not sure of the prophetic, there is comfort in knowing that there is someone who agrees with the need to clean up what is false, as well as teaching us what is truly prophetic. For those in contact with, or involved in the prophetic, there are much needed warnings. Acts 20:31 \\"Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.\\"Sure to offend both believers and skeptics of the prophetic ministry God has declared for this day, this teaching is also what could be needed to bring the prophetic movement of the last half a century to the maturity it has struggled to attain. Brought to us in the same spirit of encouragement that John the Baptist prophesied over those who sought out his ministry(Luke3:18).John Bevere is not out to scratch itchy ears. \\"Telling the people what they want to hear at the expense of what they need to hear weakens the church.\\" Read this book if you prefer your ears to be whacked rather than scratched."},{"Title":"Thus Saith The Lord: How to know when God is speaking to you through another (Inner Strength)","review":"I read a friend's copy of this book and intend to buy one for myself for regular reference. The author has courageously dealt with an issue that many will rather leave untouched - false prophecies and false prophets. We all need to read it, the Bible encourages us to test all things, and that's what John Bevere tries with this book to equip us to do. And more than anything set believers free to know that they don't have to receive every 'word' that comes for fear of 'grieving' the Holy Spirit. As he rightly points out, accuracy is not enough, does the Spirit of God witness to it? Is the presence of God there? I come from a country where even the heathen and spirit worshippers give accurate predictions, but we know they are not of God. Christians must read this book, because many are living under the bondage brought upon their lives by false prophecies. It's time we woke up, and honour the gifts of the Father instead of distorting and misusing them. The responsibility lies with the believer to test what he receives and to learn to hear the voice of the Lord for himself. Thank you John Bevere for this book, it was a timely read for me as I am sure it will be for many who read it."},{"Title":"Thus Saith The Lord: How to know when God is speaking to you through another (Inner Strength)","review":"Do you know that Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, is a God that speaks? Do you know that He is passionate to speak to us today? So how do you hear the voice of God? There are many ways God speaks to us, and one way is through the prophetic calling on the life of another.The problem we face today is that there are many false prophets that are trying to draw a following to themselves, rather than drawing them to the heart of God. In this book John Bevere defines the work of a true prophet, the signs of a false prophet, and how to protect yourself from being led astray by false prophets and false prophetic words.I do not know why some have reviewed the book and said that it lacks scriptural foundation. All of Bevere's works are loaded with scripture, and this book is no exception. John does use examples from his life and the lives of others that he has witnessed, but in each instance these examples are anchored by a scriptural basis. All of John's works have a personal element to them. He uses the trials and situations he has faced or that he has seen others face to explain how he came to the understanding that he is putting on paper or in his message. It is through the trials and afflictions the Christian faces in daily life that we learn more about ourselves and more about God.It was only after Abraham put Isaac on the alter that he came to know God as Jehovah Jireh! It is when we are pressed on all sides, as Paul said, yet remain obedient that we come to a deeper knowledge of God. It is precisely this process that John uses to explain his understanding of the word.Biblical concepts can sometimes be difficult to understand, but a good minister can take examples from lives he has witnessed and use them to illustrate a point made in the Word. This is nothing new, as preachers as far back as Enoch have been doing this very thing. The truth of God's Word is eternal, but it is most powerful when demonstrated in the lives of people. This is why the Word of God includes so many historical accounts of men like David and Saul, Samson, Abraham, etc. It is to show the revelation of God's glory and the truth of His Word through their lives.It is written in Hosea &quot;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge&quot;. This book will help you to understand why people are led astray and how to avoid being led astray yourself. The book should also inspire in you a desire to intimately know God! It is when we are close to Him and obedient to His will that we find true joy and happiness, and divine protection from error!"},{"Title":"Thus Saith The Lord: How to know when God is speaking to you through another (Inner Strength)","review":"In his latest release, John Bevere gives a balanced teaching in the area of personal prophecy. How do we discern the true word of God from the words of man? He shows many examples of the prophets in the scriptures, the words which were given and the results. It is too easy and tempting to hear the word of one who claims to be a prophet and accept them as God's word to us, even if it is accurate. We must guard our hearts against the counterfeit and learn to receive the true words then act as God leads us. John Bevere gives many examples of lives that have been shipwrecked with the wrong word. He also shares examples of individual triumphs through the spoken word of God. This is a balanced perspective for a controversial topic."},{"Title":"Thus Saith The Lord: How to know when God is speaking to you through another (Inner Strength)","review":"This is an excellent and balanced practical treatment of modern day prophecy in the church. Those who would disagree should take a close look at the prophetic ministries that have shipwrecked through considering themselves somehow above accountability and the scriptures (due to possessing higher revelation).It is normal and natural for the christian to desire to see the working and power of God in our lives. The problem comes from desiring the power without pursuing the godly character that would allow us to walk as Paul walked.A ministry that purports to overflow with power and gifts of the Spirit that doesn't also overflow with the fruit of the Spirit (peace, love, joy, humility etc.) should be viewed with caution. Add to that a flamboyant and conspicuous lifestyle and the alarm bells should start to ring.Paul warned us of false christs, prophets and ministers, John warned us, even our Lord Jesus warned us--why waste the space and time in scripture if it wasn't really a concern to the church?BOTTOMLINE questions to ask concerning a ministry/minister: 1) Who are they serving, God or mammon (wealth)? and 2) What kind of fruit are they producing (character, not works)."},{"Title":"Thus Saith The Lord: How to know when God is speaking to you through another (Inner Strength)","review":"This is a wonderful work by a modern day church prophet, John Bevere.

If the reader is unfamiliar with the fact that God still speaks today, he/she is most likely to never want to be a part of the prophetic ministry after reading this book. The book does a fair though sometimes un-biblical job of explaining when God isn't speaking through someone, but really doesn't explain positive examples of prophecy. Bevere does a wonderful job of explaining how Idolatry in the heart can taint words from God as well as other flags that prophetic people should be watching for in their lives. But over all he paints a negative picture of the ministry today, and many people will pick this book up and throw the baby out with the bath water. If you are looking for a good book on how God speaks today through his Church and through people, I would suggest that you pick up Jack Deere's Surprised By The Voice of God. It is much more scholarly and more scriptural centered. I believe that Deere is also releasing another book in early 2001 titled A Beginners Guide To Prophecy, though I haven't read this book, it will most likely have the same sound biblical context that this ex-Dallas Theological Seminary professor brings to all his books.John Bevere is an incredible author/speaker/minister, but this isn't one of his better books.

However, \\"prophecies\\" are spoken too commonly, and more importantly, they are claimed to have been inspired by God when in fact a lot of them are mere flesh-inspired words. This is problematic, because some of these false prophecies can dramatically alter the course of someone's life for the worse. John Bevere equips Christ followers to aptly differentiate true from false prophecies and to properly reject the false.I recommend this book to anyone who believes in gifting of prophecy yet has been confused about how prophetic ministry should function biblically. This book is not about proving the legitimacy of prophetic ministry in today's church, but is assumed, and thus, if you are looking for scriptural evidence for such ministry, you will be disappointed.Only thing I did not like about this book is that he doesn't adequately expound upon what a true prophetic ministry should look like. Vast majority of his examples are about false prophecies and their destructive fruits in different people's lives."},{"Title":"Thus Saith The Lord: How to know when God is speaking to you through another (Inner Strength)","review":"I would suggest to all those reading this book to be cautious.

Words from the Lord are to be chewed through-thoroughly....they are always to be confirmed by the Word of God....the Logos.....and then the Holy Spirit, by those to whom they are given. Often, immature believers jump on a prophetic word.....and try to make it come to pass.....or allow it to override, what the Lord is presently doing in their lives. Rather than waiting for the Lord to bring it to pass. This is a book to be weeded through carefully.....I had many red-flags while reading it. It does not correlate with the Teachings of Paul....while teaching the church at Corinth....that was moving in all the gifts of the Spirit...wildly......Paul did not caution the church to stop prophesying....to stop moving in the gifts.......instead, he exhorted them to desire them even more.

While I appreciated his folksy humor and wry observations, the book failed to be an absorbing adventure. The turtle he is after doesn't turn up until the last two chapters of the book. In fact, the last two chapters were the most interesting for me. I did enjoy Mr. Carr's interactions with the local natives in his wanderings. They carried the knowledge of where to find turtles in their community. Overall I tired of reading about Carr watching native people dig up turtle eggs from their clutch, Carr witnessing the bludgeoning of captured turtles, going on hunts to harpoon turtles and Carr being served up various turtle delicacies. I realize the book was written 50 years ago and sentiments about animals were very different. To that point, it is probably important to read something like this to understand some early turtle nesting areas and how the turtle sustained a native people."},{"Title":"The goblin market (A Morrow mystery)","review":"Plot Overview:It's 1943, and down-on-his-luck American ex-patriot Philip Stark is in the Caribbean island nation of Santa Teresa. The pre-war destination playground is deserted now except for diplomats and oil refinery workers, who often see their efforts sunk by German U-boats that attack departing tankers. When one of the local wire services correspondents dies, Stark sees a chance to make some money. Having worked for the same company in the past, Stark offers his services and is hired to replace the dead man. But, unlike the police, Stark doesn't think his predecessor died by accident. As he looks further into the mystery, he encounters a rival correspondent, an enigmatic police officer, the mistress of the dead man, and other local residents who all seem to have a stake in the dead man's activities.Review:Not as much fun to read as some of McCloy's other stories, this mystery does hold your attention, although the ending felt a bit rushed and anti-climatic. The title comes from a poem of the same name by Christina Rossetti: \\"We must not look at Goblin men, We must not buy their fruits, Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry, thirsty roots?\\" It's great title, and sort of fits the plot at least.

The island is very small, but strategically important for getting oil shipped to American troops in North Africa. And the Caribbean sea is full of German U-Boats. Somehow, the Nazis are finding out when the convoys leave the island and what route they are taking and too many ships are being lost.A mysterious American ex-patriate - describing himself as a former news correspondent, down on his luck and penniless, manages to land the job of chief of station for the Occidental News Agency on this island.

But the best aprt of this book is the story leading up to the climax - it contains some very enjkoyable characters, an insight into what life is like for a group of Americans living abroad in wartime, and an atmospheric and puzzling storyline.However, the twist at the end, after the spy is identified, will make sense only to readers who are familiar with McCloy's other books and her usual hero, Dr. Willing."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for my philosophy class. I did not have previous experience in this subject (philosophy of science). This book was the first book I read in this subject field.

Sir Popper is truly one of the 20th century's greatest minds."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"This book is a collection of twenty papers and speeches that Popper has written throughout his life. The connection between these papers is that they are all loosely related to Popper's famous thesis that science progresses as a series of conjectures and refutations. Scientists build tentative theories (conjectures) to explain what they observe. Since no scientific theory can actually be proven, all a scientist can do is trying to refute it. If a theory withstands severe attempts to refute it, the conjecture becomes more credible (but not more probable, and not more true). A successful refutation of a conjecture is a breakthrough: it leads to new insights, and it can eventually lead to better conjectures. Science is a systematic way of learning from your errors, and criticism is an essential part of it.Some of the papers in this book make a good introduction to Popper's ideas, but technical discussions of this kind are never easy to read. For instance, if you are unfamiliar with the ideas of Rudolph Carnap, you might want to skip the chapter devoted to him. I had a hard time reading it. Nevertheless, this is probably a better starting point than &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;, a very difficult book.The format of the book as a collection of papers is both a strength and a weakness. Some of the papers are a joy to read, especially when Popper writes about the presocratic philosophers and the birth of science. Popper is very good at introducing his subject, almost as if he were telling a tale. On the other hand, the many repetitions of the same theme become cumbersome after some time. This book is over 400 pages! BIG pages! Apparently, when Popper published this book, he was so famous that publishers uncritically printed anything he wrote, no matter how long-winded. Somehow, this is an ironical illustration of Popper's own thesis."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"It is rare these days to read a proper treatment of science. Bookshelves in the \\"science\\" sections are filled with astronomy, biology, chemistry and such. Not to suggest their is anything wrong with these disciplines; it's just that science is a way of thinking, or if you will, a method- not a collection of beliefs.Karl Popper has been largely misunderstood, being labeled a relativist and destroyer of objective science. To be sure, he did believe, as the reader will find in this enjoyable collection, that all theories- even well corroborated, are tentative. To give his critics more ammo, Popper considers science \\"reasoned myth-making.\\" Neither of these extend to relativism. If theories are tentative- always subject to new and different tests- a theory can never be fully proved but CAN be fully falsified. This is the essence of the books essays. Whether Popper is discussing the pre-socratic philosophers, social science or demarcation, his falsification theory is the common theme here. As for the \\"reasoned myth-making,\\" Popper has a bone to pick with those who think that science is purely based on observation. Any theory, by necessity, is a generality and there are no generalities in nature. Theories are made by observation + induction and induction, as Popper will add, is never logically - only psychologically - justified This is another common thread of the essays.Two suggestions for reading this book. First, if you are a Popper critic, you NEED to read this book as he goes a long way in explaining many beliefs of his that critics get wrong. Second, do not read the book front to back. As all of these 500+ pages are on the falsification theory applied to different situations, it will get extremely repetitive. Read a few essays at a time and come back later."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"The book is a collection of articles by Popper. It is easier to understand than his classic Logik der Forshung, and is much richer in content, for Popper embarks in some of these lectures on the history of philosophy and the history of science. There is also a delicious paper on self-reference and meaning in ordinary language.I especially recommend the paper on &quot;Scientific problems and their roots in metaphysics&quot;. Popper's conception of scientific dinamics as a sequence of big problems and answers to them makes him see continuity where experts on some particular philospher usually don't. Thus Popper sees a direct relation between Pythagoras, Plato and Euclid based on some fundamental cosmological problems. Euclid's Elements, Popper claims, were conceived by its author not as an excercise in pure geometry but as an organon of a theory of the world, designed to solve the problems of Plato's cosmology. Plato realized that Pythagoras' &quot;arithmetical&quot; theory of the world was in ruins after the discovery of irrational numbers, and that a new method was needed to understand the world. That is why he initiated the &quot;gemoetrical&quot; programme, which found its culmination in platonic Euclid's work. This way of seeing things is a bit unrealistic, a kind of free &quot;rational reconstruction&quot;, but I think it is nevertheless a valuable view.The fundamental lecture on philosophy of science in this collection is chapter 10, &quot;Truth, rationality &amp; the growth of scientific knowledge&quot;, where Popper presents his philosophy of science quite clearly and in detail. There has been a lot of water under the bridge since this paper was first published. His theory of &quot;verisimilitude&quot;, for instance, was shown to be unmistakably wrong in the 1970s.His approach to Tarski's theory of truth in that chapter is rather awkward: he pretends that Tarski's work showed what is meant by correspondence with the facts. To prove this, he appeals to instances of convention (T) and replacement of &quot;is true&quot; by &quot;corresponds to the facts&quot;. Thus &quot;snow is white&quot; corresponds to the facts if and only if snow is white. But this might explain what it is for &quot;snow is white&quot; to correspond to the facts, but not what &quot;correspondence with the facts&quot; is. We cannot ascertain what that single property consists of, and surely Tarski's definiens for &quot;truth&quot; (i.e. &quot;satisfaction by every infinite sequence&quot;) won't do the job.Also, Popper's answer to the challenge that Duhem's problem posed on his philosophy is disappointing, the answer being something like &quot;there exists a logical method of proving independence from axioms, so we might hopefully see from which axiomS the falied prediction depended; and even so, I admit that this method is usually difficult to apply; therefore holism is an untenable dogma.&quot;The thesis of the book, says Popper, can be put like this: we can learn from our mistakes. This is held together with this other thesis: there is no ground for believeing any empirical statement to be true. The reader might wonder how Popper managed to believe in these two thesis at one and the same time. In Popper's view, science is this: conjecturing a theory to be true; subjecting this theory to criticism (empirical testing); this testing is done after experiment, but experiments are not reliable, we have no warrant that our perceptual apparatus is not deceiving us; if the theory fails the test, we reject it; but &quot;it&quot; is a whole system of related theories, even observational theories (even logic and mathematics, says Quine); and then we have to guess which of these we have to reject. The risk of taking a true theory to be false is certainly very high, as high as that of taking a false theory to be true. So I don't see how Popper can be so confident that we can learn from mistakes. Perhaps if we purged Popper's methodology of things like truth (not to mention verisimilitude), we could get a methodology of science conceived as a canon of critical procedure, with no claims as to what we are achieving when we abide by it.The article on hegelian Dialectics is amusing. It tries the impossible task of explaining dialectics in a simple language, and then to refute it. The dialectician's typical reply to this kind of criticism is: you used clear language, so that is NOT Hegel's diatectics.As I said, this is a highly stimulating and clearly written book, which deserves to be read even if many things in it must to be corrected or complemented."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"This book is divided into two sections - \\"Conjectures\\" and \\"Refutations\\".

The first division consists of Popper's own conjectures about the nature of scientific method, human knowledge, the nature of metaphysics, a theory of tradition, etc. The latter section: refutations of commonly held theories on the mind-body problem, the demarcation between science and metaphysics, language, and social philosophy. In this Routledge Classics edition there is a third section of addenda pertaining to just a few of the individual essays in the text.For those who are unfamiliar Popper Conjectures and Refutations is probably one of the best ways to get to know him. Being a collection of essays originally published elsewhere, they are on varied themes. These themes are often inspired by a conference or publication, but despite the occasional aspect of these writings they all generally further the the falsifiability thesis of scientific theories. For Popper, this means that all theories, though they can not be \\"proved\\" by \\"experience\\" or \\"observation\\", that is empirically, they can be falsified by empirical means. This is the truly empirical nature of scientific thought and the scientific method. This empirical-ness of theories (or statements) is what makes them scientific. Unlike the early positivists argued, the empirical nature of the scientific method is not its ability to establish universal laws by the appeal to experience and the use of inductive reasoning. The appeal to observation and experience work to corroborate theoretical claims, but can never \\"prove\\" a theory once and for all.Along the same lines, Popper's demarcation between science and metaphysics figures heavily in these essays. While science consists of testable theories/statements to be corroborated or falsified by experience, metaphysics is constituted by un-testable, non-falsifiable theories/statements. The un-testable, un-observable nature of metaphysical statements does not make them meaningless as Wittgenstein, Ayer, and others have argued - a universal claim about the nature of gravity is no way more meaningful - it simply makes them untestable, unfalsifiable, and unscientific.The philosophy of science and scientific method are not all that is important to Popper. They do not even exhaust the topics discussed in this book. I could write (and have written elsewhere) pages and pages on Popper's polical philosophy, his critiques of historicism and scienticism, and his epistemology. If you want a proper introduction buy Conjectures and Refutations. You might want to consider his Poverty of Historicism as well."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"We guess. We make up a story that explains the phenomena we observe. Why is there night and day? Because the sun rises from the east and sets itself down in the west. Aha! Let's check that. Let's go east. After a while we realize that we're living on a sphere and so we know our story is wrong. The sun does not rise up and set. So what does it do? We're on a ball and the sun is above and it moves around us! Great! Problem solved. But wait! Let's check that. The stars also move. Let's plot their course, and then... and so on and so forth.For Popper, this is how we've built up our picture of the world. We make bold conjectures to explain what we see see and then we check, or rather we establish a failure test. If the test is true, then our guess is false. But if we only test to see if a guess is false, rather than to try and prove that it's true, then how do we know our guess is true? Popper answers that we do not and cannot ever know that. Knowledge lies beyond our grasp, we can only seek knowledge without ever hoping to attain it.This is the central theme of Conjectures and Refutations, which itself is a comprehensive overview of Popper's epistemological thought. The book is divided in two parts titled, you guessed it, I-Conjectures and II-Refutations.Part I, Conjectures, comprises the first ten chapters. Popper begins with an overview of his thesis, then explores the nature of the problems that face people who think about the world and who act in it (chapter 2), he presents three other views of what we mean by knowledge (ch. 3), he describes tradition and the history of thought (chapters 4 to 6) and then turns to a critique of Kant, and of the effect that Newton's astonishingly successful theory of gravity, unrefuted for over 200 years, had on the development of western science (chapter 7). Popper then closes part I with discussions on what the difference is between science and metaphysics, on why mathematics works so well in describing the world, and finally on the nature of scientific knowledge, i.e. what do we mean by \\"knowledge\\".In part II, Refutations, Popper does not present anything, he destroys existing theories which he feels are wrong. He returns to metaphysics and because it deals in existential statements that are irrefutable (e.g. you can't prove the Devil's existence or non-existence) he seeks to separate its pursuits from that of science. Science deals only in refutable statements.Then Popper attacks other theories and problems. He gives a succinct summary of his attack on historicism, his name for the belief that History follows laws (e.g. Marxism) and that historians should be able to predict the future course of mankind.In short, Conjectures and Refutations is a complete introduction to Popper's thinking. It sketches out all his thoughts on the social sciences and describes in fair detail his thinking on the development of science. He ends on a positive note. It may seem depressing that we can never obtain true knowledge, but we can certainly find sufficiently rich rewards in the pursuit of it."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"Nothing is the same for a student after this book.

It includes a number of seminal papers which were delivered as talks to bodies such as the British Rationalist (Humanist) Association and the Mont Pelerin Society. There is also Popper's first paper written in English \\"What is Dialectic\\", delivered at a seminar in 1937 soon after he arrived in New Zealand.Possibly the most important offering is the Introduction \\"On the Sources of Knowledge and of Ignorance\\" which explored the common roots of authoritarian thinking in western epistemology and politics. In each case the fundamental issues have been skewed by asking the wrong questions: \\"What is the authority for our beliefs?\\" And \\"Who should rule?\\" Thus attention has focused on unanswerable questions in both epistemology and politics, diverting attention from the real and practical issues of criticism in epistemology and the limitation and control of power in politics and public administration. This paper also prompted William W Bartley's seminal thinking on rationality and the limits of criticism.\\"The Nature of Philosophical Problems and their Roots in Science\\" suggested that the prima facie method of teaching philosophy denied access to the roots of philosophical problems and produced students who are either narrowly specialized in technical fields or are trained to reproduce material recycled form their teachers. He suggested that philosophy would die if its extra-philosophical roots decayed and he backed his case with a sketch of Plato's response to the crisis in early Greek atomism and the more modern example of Kant's response to Newton. This essay produced an echo in the form of Agassi's subsequent paper on the roots of scientific problems in metaphysics.On the topic of metaphysics, this collection contains Popper's \\"coming out\\" as a metaphysician in \\"On the Status of Science and of Metaphysics\\", heralding a development that culminated in the Metaphysical Epilogue to \\"The Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery\\".\\"Back to the Presocratics\\" was delivered to the Aristotelian Society in 1958, an occasion that has been immortalised by Byran Magee in his memoires. He described the paper as a fundamental challenge to the ruling doctrines of empiricism but the assembled multitude missed this point and devoted the discussion time to fine points of disagreement with Popper's reading of his Greek sources."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"From the late 1960's to the mid 1970's I was a young person grappling with the question of what constituted truth. On the one hand, the conservative religious outlook of my rural upbringing was clearly ill-equipped to address the modern world. On the other hand, the Marxist views espoused by many of my peers were ridiculous. This book, however, and other books written by Karl Popper, cut though both of these views like so much paper. This book goes way beyond the high school notion of the scientific method. It exposes the intellectual poverty of approaches like astrology, Marxism, and Freudian Psychology, which offer an explanation for anything--but shrink from really putting themselves out there and daring to make a prediction whose failure will expose their shortcomings. Painful as it was at the time for me to realize that Christianity also fell into the same category as these other untestable conjectures, it showed me the way to a world view that respected no authority other than ideas that could be rigorously tested."},{"Title":"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge","review":"Today when science dominates so much of our lives either directly or indirectly it is good to be made to examine the nature of the scientific method..

Great plot, great character development and very well laid out."},{"Title":"Story of the Treasure Seekers, The","review":"A word about me--I am the mother of four children ages 7-17 and have always loved to read. My favorite books as a child are still a pleasure for me today, although I read them more critically now: the Narnia books (where I first read about the Bastables on the first page of &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot;); &quot;A Little Princess,&quot; &quot;The Secret Garden,&quot; &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy,&quot; and &quot;Toinette's Philip;&quot; &quot;Little Women,&quot; &quot;Ivanhoe,&quot; &quot;Tom Sawyer,&quot; &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; &quot;Hans Brinker,&quot; &quot;Tales of King Arthur,&quot; &quot;Scottish Chiefs,&quot; etc. After my children were born I discovered new classics: Edward Eager, &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth,&quot; Philip Pullman, Diana Wynne Jones, Lloyd Alexander, and of course Harry Potter.The Bastable books were written for literate children of 8-14 almost a hundred years ago, and may be a little difficult for the easy-reader child of today, who thinks Harry Potter is full of hard words! It also has an &quot;I&quot; narrator, which many children do not like. But E. Nesbit was one of the first great children's writers, and in my opinion this is the best of all her books.Although E. Nesbit is rightly well-known known for fantasies like &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet,&quot; &quot;The Enchanted Castle,&quot; or &quot;Five Children and It,&quot; this book is not a fantasy. The Bastables are six lively children who live in a dreary London suburb in a row house. Their mother is dead, their discouraged, rather milquetoast father has lost all his money. The children are left to their own devices, since they can no longer afford to go to school (this is the turn of the 19th century). They decide to go about seeking their fortune, and do so in the most imaginative and amusing ways. They often get into trouble, bicker, pout, and basically act like real children; but their emphasis on old-fashioned honor and bravery is a welcome change from modern books. Many of the scenes are very funny, especially to older readers who can figure out what is really happening, versus what the children think is happening. It is also fascinating to see how creative the children have to be to entertain themselves-- which they are very good at! and to marvel at how much more freedom of movement children had in those days. No one is worrying about their safety as they travel around London alone all day long. The narration itself is clever, both because the narrator, who is one of the children, tries to write in a literary style (with funny results), and because the narrator is trying to fool the reader.The children accidentally bury alive a neighbor boy who &quot;doesn't know how to play,&quot; ruin a fishing contest, kill a pudding, play with a real princess, meet a famous politician and a poet, and set out to catch a burglar. They quarrel over lost balls, who should pay for treats, and who has to take care of the youngest brother, whom they have nicknamed after a cereal ad, and who always insists on tagging along. You find yourself laughing and realize that these could be children you know today. There is almost no Victorian/Edwardian sentimentality (some may have been required to be publishable in those days, just as political correctness is now), and only a few convenient happy endings.This book brings the past to life more vividly than almost any I have ever read. I find myself thinking of it whenever I read about that period of history. It's odd to think the boys would have been just the age to fight and perhaps die in the First World War. The Bastables are a children's classic."},{"Title":"Story of the Treasure Seekers, The","review":"Some of the cultural references in the book are obscure, but finding what they mean can be a lot of fun. Here is the context of \\"Let dogs delight...\\" It is from an old hymn to encourage children to get along with each other. Here is the text:Song 16. Against quarrelling and fighting. (8,6,8,6)Let dogs delight to bark and bite,For God has made them so:Let bears and lions growl and fight,For \`tis their nature, too.But, children, you should never letSuch angry passions rise:Your little hands were never madeTo tear each other's eyes.Let love through all your actions run,And all your words be mild:Live like the blessed Virgin's Son,That sweet and lovely child.His soul was gentle as a lamb;And as his stature grew,He grew in favour both with man,And God his Father, too.Now, Lord of all, he reigns above;And from his heavenly throneHe sees what children dwell in love,And marks them for his own."},{"Title":"Story of the Treasure Seekers, The","review":"I find it odd that a book should be faulted because a reader doesn't understand all the references. For me as a child, puzzling out what phrases like \\"Let dogs delight\\" meant was fun -- even when I never did figure it out, or didn't figure it out until years later when I came upon the source. That was fun, too: to be reading something else or traveling in England and suddenly get the reference -- and think \\"So THAT's what she meant!\\"But the references are a minor detail.This was one of my favorite books as a child and I now think it is one of the greatest books ever written for children: funny, insightful, well-written, inspiring -- and unexpectedly moving in places, too. I still laugh out loud when I read it, and I still admire the children enormously: for their imaginations, resourcefulness, kindness to each other, loyalty, and, perhaps most of all, for their very English courage -- the way they deal with what drearier people would complain about.Philosophically, I very much object to the idea that everything in a book should be easy to understand and known already to the readers. Surely one of the joys of reading is to be exposed to new ideas, people, places -- to learn?Another great writer for children, PL Travers, the author of MARY POPPINS, writes about the enormous pleasure and stimulation she (as a child) derived from trying to puzzle out the meanings of phrases in adults' conversation, such as \\"she lived on her capital.\\" (She phrases it better than I do here -- but she as a child imagined this aunt as a sort of ogress, nibbling on her own fingers and toes during an afternoon nap.)It's probably true that E.Nesbit's writing is not for everyone-- but what is? I for one think it's great that children still love her -- and despite all the efforts that have been made to dumb their books and everything else down,that they still enjoy puzzling out (or simply accept and move on from) what they don't understand at a first glance.Many authors -- Noel Streatfield and CS Lewis to name two more - have paid tribute to E.Nesbit. Noel Coward kept copies of her books by her bed. She still makes me laugh out loud, and very few authors from any era can do that."},{"Title":"Story of the Treasure Seekers, The","review":"The Treasure Seekers is written from the point of view of a young British boy trying along with his siblings to recover \\"the lost treasures of the house of Bastable.\\"The book is crammed with hilarity.

They do not know exactly what it was that made their fortunes \\"fall\\" but it had something to do with mother dying, father being sick and his business partner running away. This depressing information is brought about casually and is merely the background for what is about to follow - a (very funny) treasure hunt practiced upon in different ways. Dora, Oswald, Dicky, Alice, Noel and H.O. all have different plans to get to their goal, ranging from helping an elderly gentlemen in distress (absence of apparent distress is a small obstacle) to answering a newspaper ad promising 2 pounds a week earned in your spare time - and are about to systematically try out all of them.The story is told by one of the Bastable children, one that does not wish to reveal his identity. It is a great wonder therefore that Oswald gets such a favorable description...\\"Oswald put lumps of coal on the fire with his fingers, so as not to make a noise.

The Bastable children do not feel miserable unless reminded and the book is a great, very amusing read. The language (which can sometimes be quite difficult for the modern reader) is, as Oswald explains, sometimes taken out of books and especially the \\"Jungle Book\\" (\\"Good Hunting\\" they wish each other). Contrary to other reviewers, I enjoyed the \\"air of another time\\" even if I did not always understand all the expressions.This is a story of children in another era, trying to entertain themselves when they cannot afford school and need to struggle alone without the presence and explanations of adults (their self made explanations to unclear expressions, such as \\"seven times removed from the queen\\" are hilarious). The story is very cosmopolite in the sense that these are really stories of human kindness and nobility in all its forms. This is something adults and children alike can share, each according to his perceptions.

But listening to the Librivox recording of The Story of the Treasure-Seekers makes it very, very clear that the magnificent Ms. Nesbit had very firmly in mind the parents who would be reading the books aloud at bedtime. One beautiful example is a scene in which an adult abruptly rises from his seat and walks away to stand at the window with his back to the children in his office. The narrator says he believes the man was trying to conceal his emotions. Which is very true; the emotions, however, were not what the narrator thought. But the narrator, and any child reading or listening who has utter faith that all is just as the narrator perceives it, may believe one thing; the beautiful layer of comedy in the moment is reserved for the grown-ups.Thank goodness we get something; in almost everything else the children are the fortunate ones.The Bastable children possess an innocence which I'm very much afraid is impossible for even a twelve-year-old today. I've seen comments out there amongst the reviews about \\"imperialist overtones\\" and casual racism. Thing is, though, this was first published in 1899, and like it or not the world was a very different place then, and as I read it even what could be considered racist has an innocence that keeps it from being offensive. The children are given to understand that a visitor is an Indian, and - fed on adventure novels - assume Amerind, and ask him about beavers. He's India Indian, though, and has no information on such creatures. I honestly don't see how the children's honest excitement about and sympathy for someone from far away who describes himself as a poor broken-down fellow (which they also take literally) can be translated as racist, especially in 1899, and the one extremely unfortunate exclamation that can be (the same as is found in L.M. Montgomery's A Tangled Web) was, sadly, a much more common epithet a hundred years ago.These are the sort of fictional children that make me despair over today's kids: imaginative, well-read, well-spoken, thoughtful under the childish self-centeredness, and self-sufficient; they make today's kids (American, at least) look like Neanderthals. They're not perfect little angels - E. Nesbit was never stupid. But they do set a ludicrously high standard.Dora, the eldest (at 13 or 14?), comes off as a bit of a prig (though this is dealt with in a later chapter in such a way that it made me cry), desperately trying to maintain some moral high ground in a horde of siblings who think it would be absolutely smashing if there were still highwaymen on the heath - or, even better, if they could be highwaymen on the heath. Her objection is that it's \\"wrong\\" - as in illegal and people hang for such things, not so much as in the victims of the highwaymen didn't think it was quite so smashing. The again-innocent bloodthirstiness of the kids is remarkable, and just fun.Oswald, the oldest boy at 12 and (you might guess, or you might not!) the narrator of the story, is very nearly as brave and honourable as he wants to appear, and very straightforward. It's rather lovely to see him reluctantly, realistically doing the right thing throughout the book, proceeding quietly and alone when practical - the older ones all do that, shouldering responsibility and striving to make things right when they go wrong. The fierce affection and loyalty among the siblings is, like their father's poverty and worries, never explicitly stated: it doesn't have to be. It is shown, not told.The four younger children - Noel and Alice and H.O. and Dickie, ranging down to I believe six years old - are every one expected by their elder siblings to be just as sharp and responsible and willing and able to contribute as Oswald and Dora. Some allowances are made for their extreme youth, but for the most part they are equal partners in the treasure-seeking, receiving an equal share in any profits - though sometimes excused by protective siblings from punishments.I don't remember E. Nesbit reducing me to tears in the past. This did. And, yes, I laughed out loud. I missed the magic element of some of the other books - but only at first. It didn't take long to realize that most of the magic of E. Nesbit's writing is actually in E. Nesbit's writing.To that point: \\"No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.\\" ~ C.S. Lewis.

Nesbit when I'm fifty, and beyond."},{"Title":"Story of the Treasure Seekers, The","review":"When I started to read this book for the first time, I thought it was somewhat depressing.

That accounts for some of the references being undecipherable. Also, she wrote about 100 years ago. That accounts for more of the references being undecipherable.

That accounts for some of the references being undecipherable.I was rereading this the other night and idly decided to make a note of every reference that I didn't understand. Through a 242-page book, I found 24 references. My husband is English, so I checked some of these with him on the off chance that some of them were still going concerns in the UK today...most of them weren't.

Enchanted Castle, Five Children and It, Phoenix and the Carpet are better, since they also incorporate magic.

Their mother died several years earlier, and the business of their father is not good. They each concoct a way in which they believe that they will be able to restore the lost fortunes. Chapter by chapter they each try their ways at encountering treasure. Their full imaginations carry the reader through a world in their minds which is perhaps much more real than the world which I have chosen to see.Sources: An imagination alive with the fire of youth.Agreement: The imagination is not a hindrance, or a childish bane. It is the lens through which we see our world, the interpretive grid by which we understand what is beyond.Personal App: Some of the bravest people in this world are under the age of 10. Those who act nobly upon what they believe, not necessarily what has been proved to be true, are those with real courage.

The language of the book is extreamly dated. Sayings and wordings are very hard for a child to understand, because there is not enough understanding of the time period in this day and age. Kids would realy enjoy this book if it was rewritten in more modern wording. I can clearly see why it was an acclaimed book for many years after it wes first published.

However, it is disturbing yet another self help book reads more on being the right type of Christian then being a better you, regardless of your faith!I am a Christian. A person of faith with an open mind. I believe that the diversity amoung people are to be celebrated rather than feared and I won't tell people what God wants them to believe.I do belive that it is rare indeed when one person can tell another what God thinks about any controversial issue.This book would have saved me a lot of \\"here we go again\\", er, time, if Ms. Myers could have written it with out all the Christian Right B--- S---!"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"Positives: Points out that you must trust what Jesus for your works to be worth anything in God's eyes (something that many false Christians and agnostics don't realize.)Negatives (She makes many errors):She confuses the difference between God's will and his desire, saying that it's Gods will for everyone to be \\"secure\\" (actually it's God's DESIRE for everyone to turn to him, not just to have a right outlook. But it's his WILL that only a few do). That may not seem like a big deal but it is for various reasons I won't get into.Moving on:She forgets that we should be ashamed of our shameful flesh, saying:\\"I made a decision that I had no reason to be ashamed (of herself)\\". But what's Scripture say to this female pastor?:Ezra, a Jewish Christian, prayed: \\"O my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.\\"Even though Scripture says \\"if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed\\" - 1 Peter 4:16, how many Christians suffer for doing right but more so for doing wrong? Joyce knows most Christians sin often so she should be teaching that most Christians should be ashamed. But of course we all know what happens to the church's donations when you start complaining about sin and we all know what happened to the prophets when they prophesied against the rebellious.I'm not saying her book should say, \\"Your all sinners, we'll be punished if we don't stop sinning,\\" but that to say we shouldn't focus on sin at all is wrong. If you don't focus on it, or aren't aware of it, you'll keep on sinning. A correct message would have been, \\"Though we sin, remember to pray to God to restrain us from doing so, and to allow us to obey him perfectly so that we can have constant joy.\\"She also thinks that getting rid of anxiety involves not \\"concentrat(ing)\\" on our sin: \\"we can concentrate on our sin and be miserable...\\" but Scripture does not say not to ever concentrate or focus on our sin, but rather not to mourn over sin we've already mourned over and instead to \\"think about that which is lovely\\" and to go on doing good works with joy. Why does it matter? Because to NOT concentrate on our sin would be to ignore something which the bible says is serious and to stop doing, but if you ignore what it is you are diong how can you stop it? It isn't some \\"oh well / whatever\\" matter.She also claims that it isn't the job of Christians to achieve but to believe, (achieve, meaning to strive to do good!) but rather to trust in Christ knowing that we won't be perfect. Yet another stupid charismatic quip to confuse people! Hello, knowing that Christ does not expect us to be perfect does not mean to disobey his command to \\"BE PERFECT AS YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS PERFECT\\".I also thought it would have been better if she included an explanation as to why people with a pure heart sin, which by not explaining, can confuse a lot of people contemplating becoming a Christian and might see it as a contradiction and then reject Christianity based on that.On top of all that, this book shouldn't be bought or read because Joyce is in violation of Scripture's command that married women not speak when the church is congregated (at the very least on Sundays) and for not covering her hair. That has everything to do with whether or not you should buy this book because God commands to shun any Christian who after justly being rebuked over the same matter three times does not heed those rebukes."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"You can't please all the people all the time, and this Christianity-based book will help you realize that truth."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"you really can't go wrong with a book or CD from Joyce Meyer ministries.

I think it is because the Apostle contradicts much of what she believes. My prime example, is pg. 5 in Meyer's book; All emphasis is hers.\\"We believe and God works. Our work--the work of the believer--is simply to believe. Remember we are accepted because of our faith, not our good works. Christians are referred to as believers. If our job were to achieve, we would be called achievers, not believers. We often want to place an emphasis on we do, but our focus should be on what God has done for us in Jesus Christ. We can concentrate on our sin and be miserable, or we can concentrate on God's forgiveness and mercy and be happy.\\"Unfortunately James Chapter 2, verse 20 says \\"..that faith without works is dead\\".Allot of what the Approval Addiction is nice, and Ms Meyer does do a good job of explaining scripture well but this severe oversight really bothered me and tarnished my appreciation for what she had to say.

She is a fan of Joyce, and said this was one of her favorite books so far."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I originally saw the advertisements for this book on the NYC Subway. It is marketed as a 'self-improvement' book. What I expected was a semi-clinical, psychological guide to research, define, and offer solutions for the obsessive need to please others. The Amazon webpage gives some insight into its spiritual tangent. I admit I never utilized the 'Search Inside' feature (please do before buying.).This book instantly goes into the scriptures and becomes more of a tool to become a good Christian rather than solving one's problems. I'd like to emphasize that I do believe in God and am moderately religious. But, this book is so far off that It could never be used in psychology classes, except perhaps at the Christian Science Reading Room. Obviously, the popularity of this book is through the urging of the 'Religious Right'. At one point I thought I was reading a Dana Carvey 'Church Lady' skit when the book alludes to doubt being caused by...Satan. The book basically combines passages from the Bible combined with 'Chicken Soup for the Soul' type stories. This type of writing is great if you're quabbling over a pound of nails at the General Store...but for a reader from New York City (formerly Sodom and Gomorrah)where the weak are killed and eaten, it doesn't carry a lot of weight. Ms. Meyer does bring up some useful points, but it's hard to shave off two-thirds of the book to get to it. Instead, I will save you all the money I spent and give you Joyce Meyer's premise: \\"Take stock in yourself, find God and/or Jesus, don't worry about pleasing others, only worry about pleasing God and/or Jesus.\\" The End.What's more, if you need more of the same information, you can just wait until the next Jehovah's Witness comes to YOU.Well, I guess the book has worked for me. I have now annoyed every bible-thumper reading this. They don't approve and I don't care. What's more,I have pleased God. You see I have been honest and straightforward...Now isn't that special?"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I feel sorry for all the silly people who bought Joyce Meyer's book without using the Search Inside tool provided by Amazon or those who went to the book store with out browsing the book. Caveat Emptor! Don't blame Joyce Meyer.Joyce Meyer has combined a kind of pop-quasi-Christian psychology book that could probably compete with Joel Osteen's \\"Your Best Life Now\\" if it were marketed as well. Joyce Meyer is a stern-faced woman who has severe convictions about her biblical beliefs. She is on television daily and has written many books and booklets.Far too many Christian authors keep churning out book after book that lead Christians to believe that by purchasing a \\"how to\\" manual written by a Christian author, teacher, minister, etcetera, they will find paradise on earth. Learning to please God is a lifelong process for true believers. Someone who has a true personality disorder that is based in a self image based on the approval of others will probably recieve minimal help from Meyer's book. It contains quick answers with nice stories to inspire and uplift. Such content makes for a \\"feel good book\\" butnot a scholarly attempt at healing a mind that is wounded."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"to an eternity in misery; and eternity in hell. This quote is from Enjoying Everyday Living with Joyce Meyer. I am puzzled why people like her or her books. She stands up onstage looking like a bulldog-rarely smiling, and delivers this kind of garbage. She even takes her cameras to the streets to ask other people what it means to believe in God or be a Christian, and then cuts back to her show to tell every one how wrong they are-how doctrinally incorrect they are.I wonder if people like Meyer ever truly think. I mean deep down think. I wonder if they ever feel a true emotion, besides the 'Lord told me...\\" or \\"God spoke to my heart and said....\\" Or the Holy Spirit was ministering to my spirit yesterday and...\\" These types of people brain you with the Bible before you see it coming. No matter how laid back they seem-no matter how ultra modern and stylish they appear, they have to keep an element of fear involved. Hell has to be dangling in front of you.God made you with free will but damns you for using it.

And it spells out that you don't need to nor is it \\"in the stars\\" that this attitude will make everyone be nice to you. That's the whole point! The religious content of this book is ironically more likely to offend religious people who believe that God punishes the guilty (which he should, but does not, at least in this life) than it is atheists like me who can easily ignore her case for who Jesus was and just substitute the idea that all the approval I need is between me and my conscience, not from others."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"This too is a book that will reveal to us certain behavior patterns that really are obstacles to our personal growth.

Most of us spend our thinking hours absorbed in worldly pursuits - fulfillment of immediate or, when it comes to loved ones, longer range concerns. Yet, few of us actually practice absorption in thinking about our relationship with God - actively feeling God's presence in our lives continually. Perhaps, many of us feel that we lack the courage of faith to believe that God is more than an idea, and act on that conviction.When we think of God - when we attend church - or generally when things fail to go as we wish - when we find ourselves in distress, trouble, or experiencing loss - we think in terms of salvation - our object is to get to 'dry ground' - to be delivered - to find Heaven - but we never really give complete preference to devotion - and when you think about it - as Joyce Meyer has - deeply - devotion really is the way to salvation. As Jesus has informed us - every hair on our head is numbered - and we ought to focus on that - how we present ourselves before the Lord - at every moment - giving deference to God - rather than people who happen to have something that we want.An observation of particular merit, I feel, is that most of our negative behaviors - dishonesty, violence and the like - arise from our obsession with gaining the approval and esteem of our fellow humans. Is this insight not true - and truth of the highest order? Meyer claims that God makes Himself absolutely accessible to us at every moment we chose to seek Him. Then, what reason is there to prioritize imagined approval from any of His creations when God's approval alone would seem to be the most important criteria for living this life, or any future one?"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I love Joyce's lastest book, \\"Approval Addiction\\", dealing with the need to please everyone.

On page 55 Joyce writes that \\"Mary Magdalene was a woman with a past. She had sold her love by the hour, she was a prostitute.\\" This is not true and it was a mistake to include such an inaccuracy, one I was very surprised that Joyce had made. She apparently has never read the bookMary, Called Magdalenenor does she know the history behind this great woman. As noted in an issue of U.S. News and World Report: \\"Few characters in the New Testament have been so sorely miscast as Mary Magdalene, whose reputation as a fallen woman originated not in the Bible but in a sixth-century sermon by Pope Gregory the Great. Not only is she misidentified as the repentant fallen prostitute of legend, meditating and levitating in a cave, but she was not necessarily even a notable sinner. Being possessed by \\"seven demons\\" that were exorcised by Jesus, she was arguably more victim than sinner.\\"Otherwise there is much that is helpful in this book that should not be overlooked. For instance in the Introduction Joyce begins this book by explaining: \\"Many people are insecure and feel bad about themselves, which steals their joy and causes major problems in their relationships...Those who have been hurt badly through abuse or severe rejection...often seek the approval of others to try to overcome the feelings of rejection and low self esteem.....and use the addiction of approval to try to remove the pain. They are miserable if anyone seems to not approve of them in any way for any reason and they are anxious about the disapproval until they feel they are once again accepted...They need someone to reaffirm them and assure them everything is all right and they are acceptable....if a person is an approval addict, he or she will have an abnormal concern and an abundance of thought about what people think of them.\\"Finishing this book just prior to readingThe Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Lifeauthored by a Catholic priest, I saw important similarities reinforcing the fact that \\"The devil likes to remind us of what we are not, but God delights in affirming and reminding us of who we are and what we can do through Jesus....We are to look to Jesus,not ourselves....Insecurity stems from looking at our weaknesses, our flaws, and inabilities. Freedom from insecurity comes when we .... look away from all that distracts us to Jesus....Our faults will certainly distract us if we pay too much attention to them. We should confess our faults to God and trust Him to change us in His own way and timing.\\"InApproval Addiction : Overcoming Your Need to Please EveryoneI particularly liked Chapters 4 (Changing Your Self Image), 5 (Loving Yourself), 6 (Overcoming Approval Addiction) and 8 (Pressing Past Guilt and Shame). Joyce is right on the mark when she states that \\"the root cause of an approval addiction is usually an emotional wound.\\" She is also correct in concluding that \\"until we accept and approve of ourselves, no amount of approval from others will keep us permanently secure.\\"Some may criticize Joyce in stating that in the end she only substituted her addiction to God for an addiction to other people's approval. In Chapter 2, for instance, she states: \\"If we are addicted to people's approval, we will always experience pain when that approval is withdrawn--as it always is, at one time or another. However, if we look to God for our approval, we will never experience the pain of withdrawal because we have a constant, steady flow of His love and acceptance....We suffer much agony because we try to get from people what only God can give us, which is a sense of worth and value. Look to God for what you need, not to people.\\" I personally do not think this way of thinking is so bad. People, being imperfect beings, can and will let you down. God never does.Joyce in Chapter 4 also spoke of people who \\"derive their sense of worth and value from what they do rather than from who they are.\\" She further tells us that \\"True freedom never comes until we fully realize that we don't need to struggle to get from man what God freely gives us: love, acceptance, approval, security, worth and value.\\" He knows that we are so much more than what we do in life. As Joyce herself concluded: \\"what I needed to know was that I was valuable to God as a person totally apart from my position in life.\\" Now those are words to live by..."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I really like to listen to and read Joyce Meyer.

I keep hearing good things about her new book Power Thinking or something like that. I will probably get that next. So overall, I would say that Approval Addiction is good but not necessarily great. Joyce on the other hand is great!"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"The book was in great condition and arrived within just a few days. I am very happy with the product and seller."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"A wonderfully written book that explores a significant problem in the Body of Christ - seeking approval from man. Practical book with sound biblical principles."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"Perfect for those who experience what the title describes. Clearly Ms. Meyer loves the Lord as she weaves scripture throughout. Definitely biblically based."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"This book is a revelation as we discover the connection with our fears and our approval. the only one that needs to approve us is GOD.We are distracted from that easily. What an eye opener as always Joyce is teaching the body of Christ what we need today.[...]. I have more to offer on personal development"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I wish I had known this was a book for Christians. I don't see how spouting God platitudes is supposed to help someone earnestly seeking to overcome being a People Pleaser. If the Bible has all of the answers why do Christian self help books abound? And if the authors are truely Christians shouldn't they be giving their advice away for free?"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I was so disappointed when I started the tapes and heard that this is not Joyce Meyer's voice reading her own work, especially during parts about her personal history. It is really jarring to hear her elevator-recording voice saying \\"I felt like x\\" and \\"I thought y\\" when it is so clearly not herself she is talking about. The woman who did the reading aloud of this book has a mild, monotone, and impersonal tone that is in sharp contrast to Joyce Meyer's style. If you want this product, buy it in book form. Then you will still feel you're connecting to the author, which is I think why we read these type of books at all. The tapes are just not engaging to listen to at all."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"In Approval Addiction Joyce Meyer encourages and implores readers to overcome the need to please. The need to please is something that runs very rampant in our society (minus those who have a need to be selfish). Whether it's at work, at home, at church or relationships with family and friends, the need to be please is a silent killer.Meyer guides and coaches readers to realize how potentialy damaging APPROVAL ADDICTION is, not just for the individual but for those they are trying so hard to please. In addition, Meyer helps readers find and eliminate their root cause of APPROVAL ADDICTION and how to rely on the Lord completely instead of the approval of others. When readers realize that they are 1) fearfully and wonderfully made and 2) that God loves them unconditionally and 3)they are rooted in righteousness, they will wonder why they spent so much time seeking or needing the approval of others when liberty in Christ was on the other side.APPROVAL ADDITICTION IS LIFE CHANGING, EMPOWERING AND WORTH EVERY PENNY. Whether you are a seeker, a believer (or not) grab a copy today, read it and watch how much happier and freer you are as a result. Perfect for everyone!Happy Reading!Marina Woods The GOOD GIRL Book Club www.goodgirlbookclubonline.com"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"Can you take criticism? Is there someone you fear to upset? Do you find it more important to be liked than anything else? Do you worry about upsetting the boss? Joyce Meyer says this is all traced to approval addiction. And according to Meyer, the only approval you truly need is that of Jesus Christ. She offers detailed scripture references as well as biblical quotes as evidence. The solid advice here is definitely aimed at Christians or those who are willing to believe. While a bit repetitious at times, the lessons are worth repeating. Those who recognize themselves in her words, and are willing to pray about it, will find great encouragement."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I am reading this now and am loving it and seeing some of myself mirrored in this book. I had gifted it to my mom in Spanish and she loves it and she is learning alot about herself and has already begun to put into practice what she is learning. She said to me, \\"I don't want to just read this, I want to learn and live it.\\" Powerful to experience and I am sure it will do the same for me and you should you decide to read and challenge yourself in this New Year."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I have read a few of Joyce Meyers books and have loved all of them. My favorite being Help Me! I'm Married. This book I bought for my wife. When she didn't read it, I did. One thing I was not prepared for was God hitting me with a brick to let me know I needed to trust Him with my problem.You see, I was having a lot of anger towards a family member. It was stressing me out, causing loss of sleep, and putting a kink in my relationship with them. I had finally gotten to the point of really disliking this person. I hadn't read this book in months and when I opened it up, I had last left off on Chapter 9. (This chapter was on how we hold onto anger and resentment) As I was reading, God's Spirit convicted me of my sin. I fell to my knees in prayer and wept for God's forgiveness for being disobedient.This book has references to God's word because we are to lean on God's word and not our own understanding. We are to rely solely on Him to help us with our anger, hatred, and stress. Immediately my anger was taken away when I gave it to God.I thank Joyce Meyer for writing a book that has changed a part of my life. It is because God has used her to teach his word and share it with the world. I love this book and I still have a chapter and a half till I finish it. If anyone has any type of approval addiction, which we all do, then this is a wonderful possibly life changing book.I am a Christian and know that anything we have we can go to God. He is there ALWAYS and FOREVER!"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"Joyce Meyer did a great job on writing this bestseller. Approval Addiction is another one of Joyce's masterpieces. I saw a lot of me in this book, and she stepped on all of my toes....(even though I didn't want to hear it). The good thing is that she uses references (via scriptures from the Holy Bible) to explain how approval addiction can be harmful not only to you, but to other relationships. NOW, I understand that I need to change my behavior. Thank you, Lord, for having people like Joyce Meyer for keeping it real."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"....For anyone who thinks \\"people-pleasing\\" will do anything for your social-life or personal self-esteem except leave you feeling frustrated and feeling unappreciated...this book is for you.... Great practical Christian teaching on following your own destiny, being the authentic you and trusting God to bring the people to you that are suportive and the rest, well....like Joyce Meyer implies, and the old words of wisdom state \\"You can't please all the people, all the time.\\""},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"Joyc Meyer always has a way of making matter of fact out of the mysteries of Heaven and most importantly God's heart. For those who want out of the rut of feeling unworthy, unsuccessful or unaccepted in life, this book will redefine acceptance and love through God's eyes, which is always there no matter what, and help take our eyes off ourselves or our circumstances. We need look no futher for those attributes from people. Once we know we are loved and accepted always by God our true Heavenly father, we no longer need to base who we are off of people's thoughts of us. They make no difference. To live for God alone is all that should matter, not to be so stifled by what other people think about us."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"In APPROVAL ADDICTION, Joyce Meyer explains that we have an epidemic of insecurity in our society. She believes that many people suffer from an unhealthy need for constant affirmation. Those who are insecure experience problems in their relations with friends and loved ones. For some, looking for approval becomes a real addiction as they have to seek self-worth from the world because they can't find it within themselves or around those they love.Ms. Meyer has personal experience with feeling insecure. She searched for approval from others herself and understands rejection and low self-esteem. Eventually, Ms. Meyer learned that true security comes from God.APPROVAL ADDICTION has chapters addressing:. Facing fear and finding freedom. Knowing who you are. Loving yourself. Pressing past anger and unforgivenessPlus much moreAPPROVAL ADDICTION addresses a much needed issue in today's world. You meet insecure people everywhere you go, and the way they relate to you--or you react to them--can make or break a relationship. I have met people I've been terrified of simply because of who they are--like school teachers, editors, or others in positions of control. By reading this book, I hope that I will be able to face these people as my equals and not as someone to be scared of.My husband, a pastor, has asked to read this book when I finish, because he feels that it will be essential reading for him as he counsels others who may feel insecure. I recommend APPROVAL ADDICTION to anyone who feels even a little insecure (as I do), to those who can't function without constant affirmation, as well as counselors who try to help people. $22.95 (hard cover). 240 pages."},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"This book is an absolute eye opener! Joyce Meyer is an amazing woman with powerful wisedom from God that applys to everday life. She's a perfect example of how God works in your life and with a relationship and faith and trust he'll do amazing things. PLEASE DON'T BOTHER AND READ the 1-2 star reviews, it'll just make you angry. There are some people that are hurt and want to blame god for their problems and are hateful towards Christians and look for ways to try and hurt us. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do. It'll be one of those books that I'll always reread from time to time. Just see what God can do in your life too! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Approval Addiction: Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone","review":"I dont know what the author was talking about when he/she said that this particular book had poor-wording in it...I think not!!! Joyce Meyer writes books and gives lectures from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Many individual's lives are changed and transformed by knowing God more intimately. I think that Joyce Meyer helps many people, in particular women to have confidence in God and most importantly, within themselves. Each time a person is being used by God in a powerful way, Satan comes in to try to destroy that person God is using. Many people, particularly hurting people can be free from intimidation, and low-self-esteem through Joyce's book. This is a must-read!

Over the years I have come across many books on this subject. I have to admit that this book is one of the best introductory material written on DTA.

Once I was told that this cancer was most probably the result of exposure to some toxin, organic living became the goal at our house. I have been collecting books on organic living ever since. This is one of the first books that I found. This book focuses on helping the readers to make smart and safe choices in every aspect of everyday life. The topics are food, health, beauty products, clothing and home design and decoration.The book is subdivided as follows:1. Introduction2. The Natural Environment3. We are What We Eat4. From the Inside Out5. The Organic Home6. The Organic GardenThe book is written by a naturopath and osteopath based in England. He has a very informative website that will give you an understanding of his believes and attitudes toward health. (http://www.michaelvanstraten.com)The section on nutrition is especially good. I like the fact that he gives different advice based on the age of the individual. If you have been studying nutrition, you will find that his nutrition advice coincides with conventional wisdom.The organic gardening section is helpful, but you will probably need to supplement with more information depending on the scale of your gardening.Overall, I found this book to be very enlightening and well written. If you are looking for a book that is a comprehensive introduction to why you should be considering moving toward organic living this is a good book to pick up."},{"Title":"The Music Behind the Magic Boxed Set with Book","review":"This boxed set is INDISPENSABLE for any fan of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's work together, not to mention admirers of their Disney music and films in particular (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin). To hear the composer and lyricist developing what would become some of this generation's most beloved and widely known melodies sends chills down the spine (as does the demo track where Menken works through various iterations of the tune for the title song of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" before finally coming to the best version - you can hear him make the breakthrough on tape.) The discs are inspiring for fans of the duo's work, and a terrific insight into how a great musical number for film or stage is crafted.Ashman passed away long before his time, and with Little Shop of Horrors and these Disney films as his popular legacy collaborating with Menken, listeners are fortunate to find such a wealth of material here (for a similar \\"behind the scenes look on Little Shop of Horrors, check out the 2003 Broadway cast edition which features demo recordings as bonus tracks -Little Shop of Horrors (2003 Broadway Revival Cast))Note that while Tim Rice is given equal billing, this set really is all about Ashman and Menken (Rice contributed to a handful of songs out of the four disc collection). This is an example of a Disney music collection done right, with four full discs to provide hours of listening (the Aladdin score disc isn't as long as the others, but the main discs are jam-packed).Amazon does not generally carry this set in stock, so be sure to check their marketplace sellers for new copies; also note that Amazon has this collection listed at least three times on their site under different titles and each has different marketplace sellers (and pricing!) - aside from this listing, here are at least two of the alternate listings:The Music Behind the Magic, the Musical Artistry of Alan Menken, Howard Ashman & Tim RiceWALT DISNEY RECORDS PRESENTS: THE MUSIC BEHIND THE MAGIC THE MUSICAL ARTISTRY OF ALAN MENKEN, HOWARD ASHMAN AND TIM RICE"},{"Title":"The Music Behind the Magic Boxed Set with Book","review":"Work tapes, demos...don't be deceived, Alan Menken and Howard Ashman produce nothing but pure magic.

Obviously if you are reading this then you like/love Disney music, and this will only increase your appreciation of the beautiful, timeless lyrics and melodies .

I got this for my 2.5 year old daughter to inspire even more reading sessions between her and my husband (a hockey fan, of course). I think he enjoys the book even more than she does! Not only does the alphabet come alive in this book, but the lengthy descriptions of each letter's subject is an amazing teaching tool to bring new words and concepts to your child.

It is an absolute joy to read. I originally bought it as an afterthought to add to a display of Canadian themed books for my students to read in their spare time, but once I actually picked it up and read it, I realized its full potential. This is a great book to add to all collections regardless of age or gender. While hockey buffs will immediately be drawn to this book, others will fall in love with it, too. Also, it would make a great gift for so many people I know.

She just loves the illustrations, and likes to read along. I think she almost has it memorized!!! A great gift for any child."},{"Title":"Z is for Zamboni: A Hockey Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Press Sports & Hobbies)","review":"I am always curious to learn just what letter will be used in the title of an alphabet book. \\"Z is for Zamboni\\" is perfect! Why? Because what I know about hockey is contained in the title: a zamboni (to quote the book) is \\"a machine that cleans the ice, ensuring for tomorrow's game/ a surface smooth and nice.\\"I looked at all the hockey books in the children's division of Amazon, seeking just one representative, informative book about hockey. I had a request from one of my younger patrons/students for a book on hockey. Being familiar with the alphabet books, I knew this one would not disappoint. In fact, I am sure it will delight.But back to that zamboni. \\"The ice of the hockey arena becomes rough and chopped-up after the players skate on it for awhile.\\" Repairing it was difficult until Frank Zamboni, in 1949, \\"invented a motorized ice-resurfacing machine\\" which \\"scrapes off a thin layer of ice and lay(s) down an even amount of water\\" at the beginning of each period and each game.Does the above wording seem written for ages 4-8, the intended audience? The way all these alphabet books works is this: the little rhyming quatrains and illustrations are for kids and the more detailed information on the sides of each double-paged spread is for older audiences, making this book one for all ages. That is pretty much true for all the alphabet books.The history of hockey, players, terms, sporting events, and participation in the sport are items included in the book. And, wow, I learned quite a bit in my read-through. Young readers will have a field day with this book. No, make that: Young readers will have a hockey game with this book. No, that means hitting and shoving and perhaps a P: penalty for two, five, or ten minutes. Do you know that, unlike other sports, when a player is sent to the penalty box, there is no replacement player? That's the double-edged penalty: against the player AND the team. Interesting item: P is for puck, \\"black rubber to the core.\\" Obviously, puck represents the P, not penalty, because the word \\"puck\\" is lesser known than \\"penalty.\\"K is for King Clancy: \\"How much can one man do?/ Not only did he play and coach,/ he was a manger, too.\\" And a referee. In fact, he is such a legend that an award was set in his name and presented annually to the player that \\"best displays leadership skills on and off the ice.\\"Oh yes, I forgot. I know Gretzky, in addition to zamboni. Wayne Gretzky \\"is considered by many to be the greatest player to ever play the game of hockey...and holds over 60 NHL records for scoring and playmaking.\\" Indeed!Other letters: E is for equipment (Jacques Plante was the first goalie to wear a mask--1959)--the illustration shows two boys, age 8 or so, sitting on a bench in the locker room, intently putting on their uniforms with their equipment next to them (my favorite illustration!), S and T are for penalties--Slash and Trip, H is for the Hall of Fame, which opened in Toronto in 1961, U is for Team USA, \\"Who, to everyone's surprise,/ at Lake Placid won Olympic Gold/,\\" and O is for the \\"Original Six,/ the first teams in the NHL:/ Boston, Toronto, New York, Montreal, Detroit, and Chicago, as well.\\"This review began with the last alphabet letter and will close with the first: A is for Arena, but also All-Star game. An interesting factoid: \\"The fans often pick the team starters.\\"It is widely known in educational circles that a good test is also a teaching tool. I hope this review serves the same purpose, not only to enlighten about the book's contents, but also to offer a few hockey facts for brain storage.Although intended for audiences 4-8 (I want to extend that to 12), \\"Z is for Zamboni\\" is the kind of directly presented information with excellent illustrations that entice adults to appreciate it along with their children. Highly recommended to those seeking background knowledge of the game."},{"Title":"Z is for Zamboni: A Hockey Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Press Sports & Hobbies)","review":"We are a hockey family, so we've enjoyed this book since the little guy was a year old.

Sometimes board books are edited to keep the main story and essence of the book intact. Sometimes they are not. Not only does this board book understandably leave out all the interesting facts on each of the pages to save space, it also less understandably contains only 2 lines of the 4 line rhyme for each letter. With only 2 lines, guess what? it doesn't even rhyme. At first my spouse thought maybe it didn't rhyme because it was originally a Canadian book and was translated from French. (lol!) Here's an example, for the letter F, the board book has only \\"F is for the Forward who likes to skate quite fast\\". The full book continues with \\"He loves to pass as well as shoot to score a goal at last.\\" The book is so much richer with the all four lines for each letter. The board book has the same beautiful pictures as the original, but without only 2 of the four main lines for each letter, it really misses something including the rhyme. We are now happily the owners of the full book, which has let us know how much we were missing, and the board book will be moving on to the discard pile."},{"Title":"Z is for Zamboni: A Hockey Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Press Sports & Hobbies)","review":"This book is a great way to work with the ABC's when you have a classful of sports-minded boys. Being a primary teacher, I am always looking for different approaches to the alphabet. What a great way to interest boys. I first heard this book from the Philadelphia Flyers/Phantoms Organization. They came to our school for an assembly. Since it was a little over our children's heads, they read this book to them instead. The children were enthralled.

What is bad, and why I will NEVER buy books from Amazon again was the condition of the book. I bought it as a gift, and ended up having to give it away and get a different gift instead because the book looked used. This was more than a slightly bent cover. The cover (a hardcover) was dented, scratched, and there was a large chunk of the back part ripped away. I was incredulous that anyone would have thought to ship this. It looked as though a toddler had already used the book for several years, and had not taken particularly good care of it.

Illustrator Melanie Rose has created rich, beautiful images showing many different aspects of the game of hockey. This book is a joy to look at. I also appreciate the inclusion of a female player in the text (\\"W is for Wickenheiser...\\")However, the writing in this book is rather weak in some places. Unlike most alphabet books, this book lacks a consistent sentence structure, making it difficult to establish a rhythm when reading aloud. Additionally, some of the phrasing is sloppy, like \\"Equipment is the word which we shall choose for E\\", and grammatically incorrect in places, for example \\"Tripping begins with the letter T using a stick to cause a stumble.\\"I'm not at all sorry I bought this book though... my two year old would give it five stars!"},{"Title":"Z is for Zamboni: A Hockey Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Press Sports & Hobbies)","review":"Wonderful book. My three year old grandson loves it. We haven't even read ALL the hockey info yet."},{"Title":"Z is for Zamboni: A Hockey Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Press Sports & Hobbies)","review":"This board book goes through the entire alphabet, giving each letter it's own page and it's own hockey term or reference. The terms touch on the game of hockey itself and the history of the sport. However, I was a little disappointed in a few of the references.There are some that are so old, obscure, or nonsensical that parents may not even know what it means or who the person is (e.g. \\"Y is for two glorious Canadian Years-- the Summit Series and the Salt Lake Games\\"; huh?) More than a few are just plain unimaginative. And there are plenty of terms I would like to have seen in the book but didn't. There's no Playoffs, no Faceoff, no Net. It refers to the Stanley Cup as \\"Lord Stanley's Cup\\" (putting it under the letter L) which is technically correct but isn't how it's really referred to.Also, the writing is iffy at best. Nothing rhymes or has any sort of rhythm whatsoever, and at times really isn't even grammatically structured very well.Overall, though, even though it doesn't sound like it, I do like the book. Most of my dislikes are nitpicky. It's a cute book, especially for the hockey fan who wants to get their kid into it the sport as well. It's a fun and educational read."},{"Title":"Z is for Zamboni: A Hockey Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Press Sports & Hobbies)","review":"This is an awesome book for a 2 or 3-year-old how is fascinated with hockey.

Many of Citron's facts are erroneous (beginning with Lloyd Webber's last name which is NOT hyphenated, but appears hyphenated in every instance throughout this book). His approach to this material is very condescending. For example, he implies that A Little Night Music and Passion only won Tony Awards because there were no other decent shows that opened those years, thereby dismissing other good shows and offering backhanded compliments to Sondheim. Rumors are that the Really Useful Group is extremely embarrassed by the Lloyd Webber sections. Wait for the forthcoming Yale series on Broadway composers."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber: The New Musical (Great Songwriters Series)","review":"What a terrible book this is. As with Citron's other books, this is LOADED with factual errors and misunderstandings of the shows he discusses. The first big clue is that he misspells Andrew Lloyd Webber's name throughout the entire book -- where were his editors? And he says that the period between the 1920s and 1960s was &quot;a time when plot was secondary&quot; in musicals. Oh really? Like in Carousel, West Side Story, Show Boat, Pal Joey, South Pacific, My Fair Lady, Camelot, Gypsy, The King and I...? I feel sorry for anyone who wastes their money on this the way I did. Stay away from books by this guy -- there are so many GOOD books on muiscal theatre out there..."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber: The New Musical (Great Songwriters Series)","review":"This could have been a really interesting comparison, and there are some nice touches in this book, but ultimately the author skirts the most interesting questions in favor of some tired cliches.Other reviewers on this page have carped about Lloyd Webber's name. If they're referring to the hyphen, they should have read a little more carefully. He explains his use of the hyphen in a footnote on the bottom of page 49.On the positive side, Citron solves the task of the dual biography pretty well. One of the big problems in writing a book comparing two composers born 18 years apart is the use of time. Obviously, you have to tell the stories chronologically, you can't spend too much time on one of them without switching to the other, and then at some point, the issue of what each of them is working on simultaneously becomes interesting, so a constant 18 year delay would be off-putting. Somehow Citron manages to bring their narratives together around Harold Prince, and chronologically ties the two stories around the time when Prince went from Sondheim's Sweeney to Lloyd Webber's Evita. Before that, we're hearing about the shows on a weird time warp, and after that, it's fairly chronological. This is a neat touch, and Hal Prince is actually the main thing the two have in common.I found a pretty egregious example of plagiarism in the book, around a topic that gets short shrift in the book; musical analysis. On page 360, Citron cribs an 88 word passage from Joseph Swain's book The Broadway Musical, A Critical And Musical Survey (Oxford, 1990) Incredibly, even though the book he's borrowing from is by the same publisher, Citron doesn't credit the idea to its originator, nor does Swain's book even appear in the Bibliography. It's an unlikely and original idea he's stealing; comparing Lloyd Webber's dramatically random repeats of melody to Renaissance Contrafacta, which he wrongly pluralizes contrafactums later in the chapter. It doesn't call into question Citron's research, which appears to be fairly exhaustive, but it makes one wonder whether the book isn't just a collection of anecdotes, ideas and stories from other sources, hepfully cobbled into a collection for the curious.Theatre fans have often put these two giants of music theatre against one another, a position neither has publicly taken. The conventional wisdom about the two is that Lloyd Webber is the consummate melodist, and that his detractors really only envy his popularity from the comfort of their ivory towers, and that Sondheim is an abstruse intellectual whose music is mired in boring repetitive structures that are incomprehensible to the public, but which are feted and admired by pointy heads who want to feel smart. Citron falls into these old cliches time and time again, missing the far more interesting issues to be probed.For example, the portrait Citron paints of Lloyd Webber is one of a man utterly at the mercy of his lyricists and librettists for what happens on the stage, and there are a number of swipes (deservedly) taken at Sir Andrew's compositional technique, his supposed plagiarism (which is ironic, considering the source), and his orchestrational deficiencies. Any examination of Lloyd Webber's work must ask questions of how these qualities play into his work as a whole. The best Citron can come up with is to compare him to Richard Rodgers, which is an attractive thought until one remembers that Rodgers was not at the mercy of any lyricist or librettist, although he could usually command the best. In fact, Rodgers wrote music and lyrics for No Strings. And Rodgers knew harmony, melody, and the power of a reprise to do dramatic work, not just to sell a tune. It would be foolish to say that Lloyd Webber doesn't know what he's doing, but a full picture needs to address his foibles as craft issues, not merely as the carping of the intellectuals. Can you be a great musical theatre composer without caring which lyrics your tune gets assigned to? Maybe so.Sondheim doesn't fare much better. Citron says at the end of the book that Sondheim started in the Hammerstein \\"heart-on-the-sleeve tradition\\", then abandoned it for the \\"honesty of ambivalence\\" I'm not sure what he means by \\"heart-on-the-sleeve\\" Is he referring to West Side? or Gypsy? or Saturday Night? None of those seem sentimental. (except for lyrics that Lenny probably wrote) What Sondheim got from Hammerstein was not treacly Americana, but the integration of material and story, and he learned it so well that he wrote what the story and his methodology demanded, whether the audience liked it or not. This question of whether the structural and dramatic integrity is enough to make a masterpiece without popularity is an important issue Citron isn't bothering with.This reader would like to see somebody tackle the Sondheim/Lloyd Webber duality along more serious lines, because the answer to the questions these men pose writes the next 25 years of musical theatre. Sadly, we won't find it here."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber: The New Musical (Great Songwriters Series)","review":"I found the book fascinating, as it is filled with interesting details and tidbits about these two men and their shows. It is especially useful because it focuses on the music, often showing musical examples and shedding light on things like melodic teeming and form. The other two reviews stated that Lloyd Webber's name was misspelled. Apparently, they didn't read carefully enough because it explains the reasoning for this deliberate decision is because when Lloyd Webber was knighted he chose to hyphenate his name. The book tends to favor Sondheim, but is full of interesting information about both of them and each of their shows. I can't promise that is 100% free of factual errors, but it is still a must have for anyone looking for in-depth information on these two great men."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber: The New Musical (Great Songwriters Series)","review":"The book helped me greatly with a paper I had to write.

He skillfully leads the reader on a journey through the biblical narrative. Along the way, he insightfully point us to oft-neglected theological mile markers (an organic view of the church, a recovery of biblical eschatology) related to the subject of biblical worship. I found his recurring reflections on \\"false worship\\" (idolatry) as helpful as his encouragement towards \\"true worship.\\" He thinks clearly and writes insightfully, lifting our discussion and the practice of worship above issues of style and form. Dr. Noe is to be commended for articulating the essential, more eternal issues surrounding worship and for calling us all to higher ground in this fine work."},{"Title":"Created For Worship: From Genesis to Revelation","review":"Absolutely, hands down, the best book on worship I have ever read. Due has done an incredible job with book - and it's something every pastor (worship pastor, senior pastor, anything-pastor) should go through. It's not always the easiest read - but the material is amazing.I think, among other things, I loved his explorations of how the biblical concept of rest plays into worship most. And his concept of idolatry and how it's related to worship is amazing as well.But note that, as I state above, this is not the easiest read. Don't bite off too much at a time - Due's concepts and understandings are best mulled over and chewed upon for a time. This work, though not exhaustively comprehensive, is very nearly so. And I think he's done an amazing job of focusing in on most all major passages dealing with worship in the Bible. With that understood, it's hard to comprehend how he fit what he did into the 238 pages he has written.I know I said this is a must for all pastors (and in my mind it is!), but it's also for every worship leader out there. This helps you begin to wrestle with deeper theological concepts of worship. And it's for anyone who just truly wants to dig underneath the hood of biblically and theologically sound worship."},{"Title":"Created For Worship: From Genesis to Revelation","review":"So, have any of you had a very hard time finishing David Peterson's \\"Engaging with God\\"? This book is for you. A great Biblical theology of worship, with manages to remain readable and quite interesting at that. Highly suggested for music ministers or anyone interested in worship in general."},{"Title":"Created For Worship: From Genesis to Revelation","review":"Have you ever wondered why Christian's worship God? Are we following traditions, religious mores? Or are there deeper meanings revealed in God's Word that can help us know what worship is?This book was recommended to me by my pastor along with Peterson's bookEngaging With God: A Biblical Theology of Worship. Both have been very helpful in explaining the biblical history of worship, the fulfillment of the Law by Jesus Christ, the worship of the early church, as well as worship in the future described in the book of Revelations.Noel Due takes his readers beyond the animal sacrifices of the Jewish Law to the daily personal offerings in recognition of Christ's work on the cross and a believer's response to this offering in loving God by serving others. By not going into liturgy and structure, this book reveals the main reason for worship, we were created to worship Jesus Christ.Both these books are well written and understandable for the layman."},{"Title":"Created For Worship: From Genesis to Revelation","review":"Mr. Due has written a very good book. You won't find the \\"worship wars\\" in these pages in the way you may think or heard about the \\"worship wars.\\" The worship wars fought in this book are those found within the reader. You will find a comprehensive Biblical study on worship, from Genesis to Revelation, which is neither all-encompassing nor exhaustive. But, it is solid, and rich enough to make the reader slow down and savor several passages.Only two quibbles:1. A few (very few) proof texts push the limits of credibility, but not far enough to demand an edit in a later edition,2. At the very end of the book, there is a minor egalitarian issue - Mr. Due wishes that all worship leaders are elders. I don't see the importance of this, and don't find it Biblical. Throughout the book, Mr. Due constantly reinforces the priesthood of all believers, and that access to God is NOT limited by any human agency. It surprised me that the elder-deal made it into Mr. Due's thinking.What Mr. Due does really well is continually reminds his reader that everyone worships something all the time. I found myself humming Dylan's 1977 song \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" several times while reading.Despite the four stars, I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Friends Are Friends Forever","review":"Michael does a great job of choosing bible verses that can be applied to real life situations.

They not only need to have the book they need to share it with their entire church, study group, home cell, etc.As a pastor, this is the book I should have been given first in my studies.I praise the Lord for bringing it to us through David. Many Christians become so disheartened when they become effective for the LORD because of the onslaught of attacks it brings that it drives them out of the Church, and as statistics show it drives Effective Pastors out of the Pulpits.This book it an easy read and written in such a manner than anyone can grasp its meaning from 10 years old up. David is funny and insightful in his approach of this very serious subject.After beginning the process outlined in this book I started to see breakthroughs in areas I thought were impossible.God is not a man that he should lie this book helps the believer to see that ALL not some but ALL of scripture is true and can be realized.Do not pass up this book, It should be on the top of anyone's list to read.Rev. Betty Hanson"},{"Title":"The Warrior's Agenda (Combat Study Guide)","review":"This book has been one of the greatest blessings I've ever received. I thank God for placing it on the heart of David Humphrey, Sr. to write The Warrior's Agenda Combat Study Guide. It provides insight into spiritual warfare that is invaluable to the spiritual warrior. It shows us what the enemy attacks, when the enemy attacks, where the enemy attacks, how the enemy attacks, and why the enemy attacks.This guide helped me to see the things that I needed to correct to be even more effective in my warfare. It outlines the tactics of the enemy and provides strategies for combat that will ultimately empower us against the works of the enemy.This book is educational, informative, and at times humorous. Once I began reading it, I couldn't put it down until I had read the last page. I thoroughly appreciate the time, attention, and effort that Brother Humphrey put into this work.I recommend that every Christian purchase this book for their spiritual arsenal. I also recommend that they use it as a reference guide, along with their bible, on a regular basis.The Warrior's Agenda Combat Study Guide rejuvenated, refreshed, and empowered me. It helped me to understand my God-given authority and how to exercise it successfully. I believe that it will do the same thing for every reader who takes the time to read, study, and absorb the information.Brother Humphrey substantiates all of the information he uses in the guide with scripture. He also uses military and martial arts lingo and scenarios to help the individual better understand how spiritual warfare works and relates to real life situations.There is no way to do this guide justice in a review. You need to purchase it and find out for yourself. You won't regret that you did."},{"Title":"The Warrior's Agenda (Combat Study Guide)","review":"I have been going through a lot in my life for so many years.

In his early medical career he practiced in family practice, tribal medicine, and sports medicine. He writes with a conversational style which will draw you in to the story of Michele and her family and will rivet your attention from the first page to the last.In the process you'll learn a great deal about the symptoms, treatment and hope for patients with clinical depression whose own doctors (or primary care physicians in HMO-speak)may know little or nothing about the devastating effects of an imbalance of chemicals in the brain."},{"Title":"Jonathan Wild","review":"Henry Fielding's novel Jonathan Wild - out of print since 1982? Bummer. Jonathan Wild was a real organizer of a group of thieves (i.e., prigs), but Fielding invented considerable portions of this novel. Enraged by the acclaim given to dishones but &quot;great&quot; men (that is, men who had achieved success for their benefit, while often doing harm to others), Fielding set out to chronicle, in the most flowery and euphemistic terms possible, the life and times of Jonathan Wild, Esq. As a foil, Thomas Heartfree, who is nearly ruined by Wild, is introduced. As characters, they are stick figures, but that is intentional. Fielding sets to battle ridiculous extremes of good and evil, with good emerging triumphant in the end.It might emerge as a tedious harangue on the virtues of a good life, but Fielding's skill as a writer makes this impossible. His elaborate sentences demand close attention, and their rewards are great. Intricate and well thought-out, they are fascinating in and of themselves. The story is witty, well-balanced, and constantly amusing. The morality and writing of the story have aged well, the former largely because of the latter, and Jonathan Wild is a quite good, though most likely minor, narrative of infamy and saintliness."},{"Title":"Jonathan Wild","review":"On perusing a bookshelf in a Boston shop some 15 years past, my eye was taken by a paperback by one Henry Fielding and I was persuaded that though I had reached a fair age, I had not yet read anything by that august personage who had graced the curricula of so many English courses in my university days, which had been sadly terminated by the fact of the necessity of earning a living. Though I purchased this object of my fascination, it was not till recently that I actually did retrieve the volume from its dusty repose on an attic bookshelf and had recourse to reading it. Much to my surprise, it resembled such drab writings as \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" not in the least---those writings redolent of optimism and Pollyanna-like characters who insist on giving lectures on the goodness of Man while undergoing the tortures of the d--ned----but was admirably cynical and indeed not at all uneasy in the presence of sex, crime, and malfeasance in general, with which the book's \\"hero\\", Jonathan Wild, is blessed with an inordinate ability to partake of. The main character's rise and fall may be considered the main topic of the novel. While the reader is still forced to suffer a large portion of lecture and soliloquy thanks to the 18th century tendency to partake of such in every writing, big or small, the story itself is quite humorous and the reader may encounter there more than a diminutive speck of enjoyment, reaching the last page having observed that life, whether then or now in our less-insalubrious 21st century, is indeed much the same, the only difference being that debtors of those more abrupt times went to prison and the malfeasants of that era tended to end their short life spans at the end of a rope, while today, they serve but a short time in government rest homes and then return to their previous status of \`honored citizen'. The characters in Fielding's novel, written two hundred years before my entrance onto the world stage, emerge vividly, endowed with such amusing names as Heartfree, Tishy Snap, Bagshot, Fireblood, and Miss Straddle, and while some of their adventures and conversations may seem to modern readers somewhat contrived and relying perhaps overmuch on deus ex machina, they are not far removed from many a Hollywood production, whose very existence could not be imagined in the author's time. Keeping in mind the tribulations of modern readers, not used to such peregrinations of oratory during the course of novels, I would say that a devotion to English literature would better lead to enjoyment of such a work than a preference for modern style in which dialogue might be deemed more natural. Nevertheless I will end my overlong diatribe on JONATHAN WILD by saying that it was meant as a satire of a Robert Walpole, a corrupt \\"great man\\" in politics of the time, and of all such men who aspire to greatness, and I beg my readers' pardon for attempting to write a review in a style not my own, but wish to remind them that if they found it tedious they may also find the said novel a bit too much, but if, on the other hand, they found it amusing, they may very well find more than a small amount of pleasure in Fielding's work itself and join me in suggesting that for this novel, though I have kept the interests of the general reader in mind as I awarded the prize, three stars are not quite sufficient."},{"Title":"The Believers' Church: The History and Character of Radical Protestantism","review":"I can't begin to tell you how bad this book was for me...but I guess I'll try. The Believers' Church is a history book on the character of radical protestantism. And if that subtitle doesn't put you to sleep, then the first 20 pages will surely accomplish that.Durnbaugh wants to inform his readers about how the protestant church came about and the branches thereof. John Yoder calls this book, \\"A classic\\" and I guess I would agree with him if by classic he means a book that is not enjoyable to read.This book is divided into 3 parts: The Concept of the Believers' Church, The History of the Believers' Church, and The Character of the Believers' Church.The last part would have to be the most enjoyable for me (and that really isn't saying a lot). In The Character of the Believers' Church, Durnbaugh dives into Mission, Evangelism, Church & State and other areas of minor interest.The rest of the book is an entire bore."},{"Title":"Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Psychological Issues","review":"McGraw Hill has a whole series of paperbacks like this, \\"Taking Sides: Clashing Views on X,\\" where X is Psychology, the law, the environment, you name it. Search Amazon on the first two words of the title. I use the psychology one in my college level course in Critical Thinking but it is so effective I may also assign it to seniors writing their final thesis. Each of 18 chapters presents two short excerpts (6 pp) from published essays on hot topics such as genetic testing, race and intelligence, mental illnesses, children's television, and so on. The two persuasive articles take opposing views. The editor's contribution is to summarize each of the articles' main arguments in 5 or 6 bullet points, although I'd rather that weren't included, since that is exactly what I want the students to learn how to do. There is no analysis of the arguments, such as pointing out logical or structural fallacies in the arguments, and not all arguments are equally strong. The editors' \\"Challenge Questions\\" at the end of each pair of articles seem to miss the point: they focus on the content of the arguments rather than their logical structure. The articles are so abbreviated that it is inappropriate to treat them as reviews of the topic, except perhaps in a high school course designed only to introduce these topics and encourage discussion. It is amazingly difficult to teach critical thinking, and this book is an invaluable aid."},{"Title":"The Western Reserve;: The Story of New Connecticut in Ohio,","review":"Harlan Hatcher's intricate history of northern Ohio, encompasing the early days of the Connecticut Land Company in the closing decade of the eighteenth century to the industrial growth period of the early twentieth century, uses a combination of first person narrative and biographical anecdotes, as well as other primary documents, to support and enhance a story that is both informative and enjoyable. In his remarks in the foreward to this revised edition, George Knepper describes Hatcher as having &quot;the novelist's touch,&quot; an ability to infuse the story &quot;with the human interest that brings life and meaning to the factual account&quot;. Beginning with a piece of western wilderness territory just south of Lake Erie, reserved by Connecticut for itself out of the lands deeded to the federal government in 1786, the surveying, settling and growth of &quot;New Connecticut,&quot; the state of Ohio, is a fascinating story of vision and optimism by men of courage and resourcefulness.The real strength of Hatcher's work is that demographics and dates, while important and recognized, take second place to the words of the people who shaped Ohio, lived in and loved it. He has managed to breathe life into Ohio's story and make what could have been a dusty narrative come to life in the accounts, letters, and journals he quotes. Hatcher's obvious respect for this, his native state, permeates the text and only adds to his credibility. In his closing remarks he summarizes this viewpoint, saying: &quot;. . . the Western Reserve, aware of its background and of its strategic position at the heart of America's industries, rich in education, drama and the fine arts, rooted in the past but with its head erect, faces with equanimity the destiny which persistantly unfolds before it.&quot; This is a must read for every student of Ohio history."},{"Title":"The Western Reserve;: The Story of New Connecticut in Ohio,","review":"This is a very informative book, giving all kinds of details on the origins of Warren, Ohio, and its role within the old Western Reserve Territory.

He has expressed no remorse and still maintains his innocence, but no one -- including his own children -- now believe him.The book was published before a second trial put him away for good after his initial trial ended with a hung jury.Neulander is exhibit number one of how a patently evil man can be attracted to the clergy as a way of satisfying his overwhelming ambition and ego.A better choice might be to read Arthur J.

Having read several of Fletcher's novels to date I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of the Fletcher style and consider this one of his better mysteries. What is the Fletcher style then? To me it starts with a fast pace and moves forward at near break neck speed. There is just enough detail to keep you informed, no more information than is needed, lots of twists and turns, and, of course, the surprise ending. Fletcher has the knack for developing plots as the story unfolds, adding layers onto the mystery with lots of plot twists and red herrings, all wrapped up in solid character development and supported by a wonderful gift for the English language. I consider J. S. Fletcher to be one of the best of the now lesser known mystery novel writers of the early 20th century. From my experience Fletcher never fails to satisfy my hunger for a good read. This is a very good read."},{"Title":"The Rayner-Slade Amalgamation","review":"Written in beautifully \\"period\\" English, this mystery has many threads to solve.

This information is even more important today when so much information is gathered about each of us. This book shows how even the must seemingly unimportant detail about a person can be used as a tool to manipulate that person's opinions and buying habits."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written. It is a book about how psychological research, motivational research was being employed at the time to sell Americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want, or weren't necessarily very good for them. Sounds very much like Reality as we now know it. This selling also extended to Politicians, and Packard foresaw the way the Image would become in many instances more important than the Message in choice of political candidates.As I said the book is filled with information. I am embarassed to say that I have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned Packard's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth. Brush after you eat, he advises, as I now recall many dentists have told me through the years.In any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that Advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Such a great book and such shocking proofreading. The ebook is full of typos. Considering all the publishers have had to do is turn it into electronic text (once) then sit back and take the money, they should be ashamed of the job they've done.

It created my interest in communication."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"What is perhaps most interesting about the early market researchers is the amount of attention paid to class: they imagine, for instance, that the subtle gradations in difference between Buick and cadillac is a telling sympton of American class differences. That is one reason that the Edsel failed, because it was based on the idea that families would &quot;trade-up&quot; to an Edsel if it was positioned as slightly higher-class than a Ford. You can also learn a good deal about life in the 50s: before flouride, people brushed their teeth in the morning, and not for hygiene but for cosmetics. It is a testament to the power of the advertising (and the research) that we now all brush our teeth at night. Packard is long on examples and short on analysis, and he waffles between being golly-gee-willickers impressed with the &quot;scientists&quot; and their methods or repulsed by the cynicism and naked manipulation of their backers. Their definitely is the sense, which is so unfamiliar today, that these guys in lab coats are really strange birds, but surely they must represent progress. After all, isn't it a good thing that people brush at night? Packard is not your standard culture curmudgeon like Galbraith or, much worse, Adorno. Class, of course, is much less important today than then, but it is still important. Packard relates the fascinating story of why people went to loan sharks instead of the wood-panelled banks (and just think of how wood-panelled station wagons have been replaced with the plastic wheel-rims of SUVs): because the borrowers could feel superior to the loan sharks, even if they had to pay higher rates. I suggest that the publisher reissue Packard."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"If you have an interest in what it was like to be in 1950's America, this book is like a time travel excursion taking you there. It's very dated, but an interesting look into life in that time, very much like being there. If you know a little about the 50's, this rounds out a lot of what you think you know. I'm just old enough to have missed the 50's (born 1962) but still recall much of the effects of those years on society. Growing up in Maine, it took awhile for the 50's to actually leave. Much of what I remember as a child relates to that era. If that's you too - you'll enjoy this quick, easy read."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I rarely put a book down, even if I find its not what I expected. I feel a book at least deserves the chance to be heard out -- but not this one.I heard about Hidden Persuaders on NPR when they talked about consumer buying habits. Thinking it would be an intriguing look into the way things are marketed to us, I bought the book. Vance and his publisher want you to believe that this is a shocking expose of the advertising industry but I doubt even he believes his assertion. Perhaps these were revolutionary techniques in the 50s but they certainly aren't relevant now. Does it require a psychologist to tell us that we all want a convertible and leave with a sedan? That you'd rather have a cake mix that requires eggs and milk instead of just water? That you want to indulge in a guilty pleasure but need to be reassured first? That sex sells? It's armchair psychology and nothing in the book is shocking or surprising.Even the publisher doesn't take this release seriously -- it clearly skipped the editor's desk and went straight to press typo's and all. The cover teases you in with promises of scandalous marketing tactics, but it fails to deliver any more than wasted print."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"The intentions of the author can be judged well enough. But the bottomline is that the book no longer belongs to the present time and generation. It is sad but true that this insightful writing needs a relook in present context."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book is extremely relevant even its release has been thrown fifty years ago.If you go back to the real origen of the problem , you will find this clever definition of the advertising : It is the art the money of your pocket comes to mine .You may disagree or not with this statement but you must to understand the world has been composed for the consumer and the producer . That means the timeless principle of the Yin and Yan; the force and the reaction; the muscle and the mind; the innovation vs tradition .I love the advertising just for it overthrows the unhealthy paradigm of the last discover; and in the same way that the archeology does , you must to accept the truth always under a veil of relativity . In the market as in the life there is no anything secure and definitive .And that circumstance allows to keep us in continous movement.Packard analyzes the origins of the underworld of the different devices about how to persuade the consumer to acquire things that not necesarily are useful .That is why a whole universe of new disciplines have been created to induce the population to follow certain patterns of induced behavior.I think if you are a centered human being , you can face your inner dragons and win the challenge ; but if you are not a well positioned person , you will be forced to turn around the suggested roads about how to build and rebuild over and over your way of thinking and living.This last option may be well appropriate for this important segment who lives in the first level of Maslow pyramid . And please do not forget this clever statement of Pascal : The mankind looks like as child who always is reborn . That is the real and timeless effective target .Recommended for marketing designers , market research, motivational human sciences and for all those people really interested in that passionate discipline ."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book was a great eye opener for me! it mad eme aware of what was really going on in the advertising world!

I did not know those were opposite leadership styles.This is one of the original classic marketing books. It was copyrighted in 1957 so it is fairly amusing to read when you see the examples used, like the \\"cancer scare\\", \\"Today's modern housewife\\", and \\"for people entering the second half of this century\\"Much of what he talks about is still true today, although because the book is so dated, it is difficult to pull out all of the lessons. If you want to read it, read it for fun, not for the marketing lessons.It seems whenever I read an older book, the writer thinks that the times were changing more then than ever before and even with the current books, that seems to be the tone. Even back then Packard talked about information overload and overload of marketing. I think the bottom line is everyone always think the times they are in is uncertain, changing etc.To this I say \\"Change is opportunity\\". Find the opportunity for you in change."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Written at the cusp of the 'consumer revolution', this book is both a quaint historical piece and a prophesy of what was to come. The tangential thesis of the book is that by the mid-fifties, the standard problems in capitalism -- those of production and distribution of goods -- were solved, but that this introduced another problem: all of these goods must be consumed. So, it became necessary to step up the techniques used to market these goods.Advertising was nothing new, but the psychological intricacy and sophistication in it was ratcheted up significantly. Using Freud, Jung, and whatever other foundation proved workable, social scientists and psychoanalysts honed their skills to develop an ever-growing repertoire of tricks that would induce us all to spend and consume at ever-higher levels.Two things make the book relevant today: 1) nothing has changed either in the economic situation or in the techniques, except that both have become even more intense (two thirds of the 2002 U.S. GNP depends on consumer spending); and 2) no other book has yet come forward to do a better job at showing, in great anecdotal detail and for a broad audience, what depth marketing is all about."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"The Hidden Persuaders explores the dark world of advertising and the effects it has upon our minds. Even though it was written originally in 1957, most of its material is still relevant today. At first, one may be lead to the conclusion Vance Packard has gone off the far end with his accusations of subliminal mind control, but he provides so much factual data you finally come to realize this isn't any joking matter. Everyone should read this book, at least to become familiar with its theme, and to increase personal awareness of the underlying messages our minds are exposed to every day. Packard will help you understand virtually hundreds of ways corporations get you to give away your hard earned money readily. He explains not only how companies make you tick, but why they make you tick. After reading the book, you will never watch another commercial or listen to another advertisement the same."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS by Vance Packard stands as one of the more eye-opening accounts of the development of the motivational sciences in the 20th Century. What is being described by Packard is the evolution of a systematic relationship between merchandisers of America's then-booming manufacturing industries who teemed up with Madison Avenue-style advertising firms, who themselves were backed by a network of behavioral scientists. As described by Packard, this network not only developed novel and creative ways of reaching into the psyche of its intended target audiance to tap into hidden motivations; but in the process of turning us all into more compliant consumers, so shifted the values of the entire society that they changed American society for all time. Today many of us have virtually succumbed our natural &quot;reality&quot; to a phony existance based upon presenting an image of ourselves to our peers that is actually based upon media and market-generated values. Once we understand the process that created this vast consumer culture, with all it's attendant neuroses, we can then begin to fashion for ourselves a strategy for recovering our basic humanity. What is being described in THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS, is the origins of a system to manipulate us out of that humanity."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Vance Packard is a man ahead of his times. Although this book was published forty years ago, it is not dated at all. Packard shows us in a witty way how producers hire motivation researchers to determine why consumers buy the products they do. This is the first book I have read on this subject, and it is very interesting to read how people actually have a job in which they determine what motivates a person to buy a product. I knew that a product's appearance had some weight on its probability of selling, but I had no idea as to what extent this occurs in. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It is very easy to understand and straightforward."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Most of us realize that we are being influenced all the time. What most of us don't realize is just how much we are controlled and influenced. The Hidden Persuaders will describe to you the early efforts made to understand, control and influence people in the name of consumerism and control. This book should scare you, especially when you stop and think about how much more refined the methods are today.A key point made by the book is the primary difference between manipulation and persuasion is intent. Even the most cursory look at history will tell you that when the tools exist, someone will use them to dominate and control others. In fact, they are being used right now and everyday to control us. The Matrix is alive and well and real.Read this book."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"It is hard to believe that one of the most perceptive and important books on the shaping of modern society is out of print. This book shows how the workings of our minds have been scientifically evaluated, and this knowledged used to manipulate them. Not in any 'X-Files' manner, just straight out appealing to our basic desires and needs. Read this book, and then as yourself what every ad and salesperson is doing to you when you see them. It's all there, so they aren't hard to work out."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"What's really interesting about this book is how old the information is. The ideas Packard described are being presented to us today as relatively novel, as though our culture is just now waking up to the idea that consumerism is about hidden motivations, hypnosis, rationalization and social striving.Take the example about how people want big cars but feel ashamed of buying them, and how you can help them justify it to themselves by talking about safety. This kind of information is being presented to us in the present as though it were news, but there it was, in 1959.As for it being dated, well, in some ways it is. Still, a lot of the psychological information still represents our best information about human nature. It's interesting to see theories devised for healing psychological pathology employed for monetary gain, especially if you don't have a background in advertising and marketing.If you are already an expert in those areas, it might make a fun history lesson."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"A really insightful and illuminating book about the introduction of psychological conditioning methods into product marketing and politics which I consider to be essential reading for anyone who would be aware at this time. What's all the more remarkable is the fact that this book was written at the advent of this development, and the author well understood what it portended. Time to wake up, Neo."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I met Vance Packard's (1914-1996) work with his The Pyramid Climbers, a pioneer study on American enterprise management developement. The Hidden Persuaders is about a very different subject, and it was also one of the first true considerations on how propaganda, or media manipulation, changes the way America behaves toward franchises, merchandising and, in the end, how it shapes the way we structure our goals and, to use Focualt's title, the order of things. It, of course, shows its age since it was first published in the 1950's. However it is in no way obsolete and thanks to Packard's excellent pen it is a breeze to read, and an excellent example of the so called Pop Sociology."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"We have been programmed by marketing strategies, tv commercials, billboards and anything else that marketing strategists can possibly conceive of! The human mind is weak and malleable, some more than others, but read this book to find out how long this has been going on...you won't believe what you find out!"},{"Title":"15-Minute Cook","review":"The pictures are lovely. The directions are easy to follow. The results are great. I have not had a flop when using this cookbook. There are few recipes that have some exotic ingredients, but overall, most of the recipes require normal kitchen staples. This is an excellent book.IT is NOT 15 minutes cooking time. It is NOT 15 minutes AFTER everything is put together. It is just about 15 minutes from start to finish (provided you are not dwadling as you cook).The only thing I don't like is that everything is given in weights and grams and other measurements. This makes it a bit mroe difficult for a slow math person such as myself since I have to convert it all to typical measurements. Just a small matter really.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Could Fly","review":"\\"The Boy Who Could Fly\\" is a remarkable work of juvenile fiction about a boy who has the telepathic ability to read minds. Narrated in the second person point of view by the boy's older brother, the book is compassionate and moving and psychologically complex and made all the more vivid by haunting and innovative charcoal illustrations by Paul Sagsoorian. The older brother's attempts to shelter his gifted younger brother after the death of their parents is the thrust of the plot which evolves into a mysterious and profound character study. First published in 1967 and long out of print, the book deserves to be recognized as a classic in the field of juvenile fiction. Its psychological themes are a great introduction to young readers to a more complex fiction, yet it can be read as a thoroughly engaging story in itself. The 1986 movie of the same name seems to be very loosely based on the story."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Could Fly","review":"Yes, this book is thoughtful and philosophical in nature, as others reviewers have so eloquently stated. It's also the story of two young brothers, newly orphaned, coming to live with their uncle and aunt, to live in the house their father grew up in. Mark, the older brother, has a special connection to six-year-old Joey, who can read minds and answer people without sound.He wants others to like Joey and when another little boy decides to pick on him, it gets the parents involved, ultimately leading to the bully's father putting Joey (who does indeed learned to fly, or at least hover) on a stage in front of the whole town to demonstrate how 'special' he is.Mark is beside himself with anxiety-will Joey blow his cover? Or will he realize that marking himself so different from others is the wrong way to truly connect with other people?This book will be treasured by anyone who loves the original 1968Escape to Witch Mountain, and The Forgotten Door by Alexander Key,Children of Morrow (Puffin Classics),This Time of Darkness(you want the original version-the newer version edits the story and dumbs it down!) and Orvis, by H. M. Hoover,Christopher, new titleChristopher and His Magic Powersby Richard M. Koff. A deeply touching story that every parent (especially parents of troublemakers) need to read/give to their child.A young, careless boy is given 'lessons' by a mysterious professor--lessons in invisibility, telekinesis, and other truly original mental abilities--but the true lessons are mainly in compassion and caring, in how it feels--literally--to be in another persons's head.Empathy. It's not something easily taught--or learned--by the lesson, once learned, is unforgettable.The Dark is Rising series by Susan Cooper,Fourth World: Book One in the Missing Link Trilogyby Kate Thompson,the Tomorrow's Sphinx and the five Named (Ratha) booksRatha's Creature: The First Book of the Namedby Clare Bell,The Wrinkle in Time series by Madeline L'Engle,The Rats of Nimh, and The Silver Crown by Robert C.

Karl."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Could Fly","review":"A haunting short novel, really no more than a novella, \\"The Boy Who Could Fly\\" ostensibly falls somewhere between children's & young adult fiction. But while sensitive young readers will certainly appreciate this gentle yet probing tale of being different, adult readers will find much in its pages to ponder as well.The story is told from the viewpoint of the gifted boy's older brother, who loves & protects his younger brother as best he can. For the world can be cruel to someone who's different, who doesn't quite fit in, who seems wiser than most adults in many ways. In fact, the pettiness & sheer meannness exhibited by some of the adults is all too recognizable to any of us, who see it in the office, on the news, and even within families.And in this case, being different not only means being telepathic, it means possessing a deeper, more empathic sensitivity to the world. A telling note is when the narrator realizes where he's seen an expression like that on his younger brother's face -- on statues of the Buddha. The implication is that he'll grow to be a great spiritual leader, a teacher, someone who can see past human greed & anger ... if he lives.Here we get to the psychological & philosophical depths of this story, as it makes each reader ask why we so easily yield to & enjoy cruelty, and why we're driven to fear & often destroy those who seem beyond it -- the very ones who ought to be models for us, inspiring us to better & richer lives. Why DO we let ourselves be ruled by fear?Undoubtedly this story resonated all the more when it was first published in 1967. But its message is needed all the more today, I'd say, when crassness & ignorance have such a grip on popular culture. And that message is presented with subtle power, without mawkish & cheap sentiment. A book definitely in need of reprinting!"},{"Title":"Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry","review":"This is a great reference for anyone designing or using FTIR instruments. This book is really intended for the advanced users and is worth the price. The only major drawback is that it is getting a little dated.The book is really geared to the chemist, however, additional material on alignment techniques and a more complete and jointed discussion on design trade-offs and instrument characterization would make it much more useful to other users.Bottom line: It is still a great reference"},{"Title":"Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry","review":"This book is the Bible of FTIR, written by the twin gods of FTIR, Griffiths and DeHaseth. It contains as complete an introduction to the theory and practice of this field as is available. Anyone who wants a detailed understanding of this field, and in particular how FTIRs work, should own this book. However...there are 2 reasons why I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5.1. The book is written at a rather advanced level, and is full of mathematics. For doctorate level scientists and engineers this is fine, but it blows away anyone without the appropriate math and science background. As a result, beginners to the field are often times frustrated with this book. The book is more approriate for instrument designers and lab managers than it is for the average technician running spectra.2. The book was written in 1986, and parts of it are terribly outdated. Not surprisingly, discussions of specific computers, software, and instruments were outdated years ago. Things that the book predicts will happen, have long ago come to pass.

I upgraded to the second edition because my first edition was falling apart after 20 years. I bought the print edition because I didn't like the way the Kindle edition displayed the diagrams, spectra, and other figures.The authors are highly-regarded practitioners and professors of applied spectroscopy, and they present a wide and deep enough scope of applicable technique to provide a great deal of useful reference material.

In fact, I'm guessing he may have come with the puns first and then fitted the stories to them.Normally in his novels, character development is one of this author's great strengths. In these stories, he sometimes uses less effective short-cuts to show us his antagonists and protagonists. Adverbs are used with greater frequency---people pace nervously, glance cautiously, and nod soberly. There is a fair amount of caricature. Americans are always filthy rich and/or eccentric and they talk funny. Innes also lapses into veddy British upper-class snobbery, to let readers know that there is something not quite right about a criminal suspect.However, even short-hand Innes is fun to read. His snobbery is delicious. His Americans are amusing. Assistant Commissioner of New Scotland Yard, Sir John Appleby is his usual ironic, witty, dangerously intelligent self. Art and literature are richly mined, as they are in this author's longer novels. A Pieter Breughel landscape is at the heart of one story. A speech from Hamlet forms an important clue in another.I wouldn't start with this short story collection if you are new to Michael Innes, but &quot;Appleby Talks Again&quot; (1956) is a rich confectionary for his long-term fans--eighteen delicious morsels of mystery:A Matter of GoblinsWas he Morton?Dangerfield's DiaryGrey's GhostFalse ColoursThe RibbonThe ExileEnigma JonesThe Heritage PortraitMurder on the 7.16A Very Odd CaseThe Four SeasonsHere is the NewsThe ReprisalBear's boxTom, Dick and HarryThe Lombard booksThe Mouse-Trap"},{"Title":"Appleby talks again (Red badge detective)","review":"Sir John Appleby, Innes' sleuth, is very satisfying a detective, both before and after his retirement, and these stories were interesting and fun"},{"Title":"Christian Dogmatics","review":"This book is essentially a condensation of Francis Pieper's four volume set. However, it is easier to read and contains an extra section (on the Millennial Kingdom). It is also not cumbersome to use since it is a single volume containing about 665 pages. Mueller's secton on prolegomena (pp. 1-89) is one of the best you will ever read from an orthodox evangelical perspective. He upholds the orthodox understanding of the inspiration of Scripture and promotes an uncompromising evangelical theological methodology. This section is one of the jewels of Mueller's work. The rest of the book is a treatment of the standard subjects of systematic theology from a confessional Lutheran perspective (LCMS). Even if you're a non-Lutheran it is worth the time to read Mueller's treatment of the various subjects just to get a good understanding of what confessional Lutherans believe. I heartedly recommend this readable volume."},{"Title":"Christian Dogmatics","review":"A fine one volume Confessional Lutheran systematics text. Mueller successfully brings together Francis Pieper's three volume dogmatics into one volume with a complete index."},{"Title":"Christian Dogmatics","review":"I am a Lutheran pastor. We were to use Pieper's four volume set in seminary classes. I already had Mueller. My copy of Pieper was the German edition. I had picked it up at a library cast off sale for ninety cents for the complete four volume set. My German was not sufficient at the time to do my reading assignments from Pieper. I was able to use Mueller for all but one worksheet question. I have used Mueller often over the years. My copy is littered with underlinings and notes, as well as clippings I have pasted into it. Sometimes the proof passages he cites are not always the best and I have made notes on some I think make the point better than those he cites. It is, as other reviewers have noted, a condensed version of Pieper's four volumes. Mueller does use Latin, German, Greek, and Hebrew phrases; but usually follows them immediately with an English translation of the phrases. Still, this may be disconcerting to users who cannot read those languages."},{"Title":"Christian Dogmatics","review":"If you ever want to read theology from a different, evangelical perspective, this is the book! I am not Lutheran but this book is as good a theology as you'd ever want to read. I use Wayne Grudem's \\"Systematic Theology\\" in my college doctrine classes, which is pretty standard Reformed Theology, but nothing holds a candle to Mueller's profound volume. It's easy to understand, black and white in it's analysis of heresy and legalism, and excellent in its Scripture quotations. We non-Lutherans have missed out on profound insights into Scripture and truth by focusing the debate on Calvin and Arminius and missing Martin Luther--the greatest theologian since the Apostle John finished penning the book of Revelation. Mueller does a great job of reducing Lutheran's theology to a single volume.Get it!"},{"Title":"Christian Dogmatics","review":"This book is an excellent summary of the extensive multi volume treatise, \\"Christian Dogmatics\\" by Francis Pieper. Anyone interested in obtaining a well written single volume summarizing the primary aspects of the Christian faith would be pleased with this treatise.

At the very least it is fair to say that David Pines was all about plasmons. It was said that at University of Illinois every course he taught ended up being about plasmons. This was true to such an extent that one of my friends who was a grad student studying high-energy physics at Illinois claimed (in jest!) that he chose his field over solid state physics because \\"I took the introductory solid state physics course from Professor Pines and discovered that solids state physics was only about plasmons--a topic which I did not find all that interesting\\".

Although the subjects vary, from an elite officers' dinner party during the Boer War to a quarry workers' strike in Wales, Davies is consistent throughout with his insightfulness and a wonderful sense of humor. More specifically, the stories are not written in any atypical or outrageous manner; rather, Davies simply tells his stories in voices that are confident and direct, and each is perfectly suitable for the story he has to tell."},{"Title":"The Ugliest House in the World: Stories","review":"To read this delightful collection of stories is like taking a balloon trip around the world with an acute spyglass to your eye; you see diverse moments in history and across cultures with tremendous specificity and clarity. But Davies' best accomplishment is the tenderness with which he presents his odd characters--the chinese painter pressganged by a group of violent communist buffoons, the striking Welsh miner who must choose between pride and love. Even a buttoned-up group of colonialist Brits striving to oppress the Zulu come in for their share of quiet sympathy--a story that begins by lampooning an officer's embarassment as he farts in the presence of his superiors ends with the suggestion that both Brit and Zulu share a deep corporeal response to the prospect of death. The stories in this book are wide-ranging and unpredictable, but so satisfying. I loved the book. This writer is here to stay."},{"Title":"The Ugliest House in the World: Stories","review":"I thought these stories were pretty remarkable--daring, exotic both in subject and style, bracingly original. It's probably criminal to mention Updike in the same breath as the author of a first collection, but I can't think of anyone else I've read recently who writes short stories with this particular brand of agile, athletic grace. He takes chances on every page, but you never see him sweat. And best of all, there aren't any stunts here--no showing off. No trendy cynicism, and no easy answers.

For example: - At the rate the book recommends, you won't have enough crossbow bolts in the Aljir Prison Break-in level; - Use the .45 in the Gregorov level? It's slow, noisy, and not very accurate -- hardly the best for taking out the lights; - Chance is much more easily defeated than that long-winded strategy they describe -- simply manoeuvre by the chopper and you'll be fine; - The M-16 works much better against Morgan. Also, when you're stalling him, there's no reason you have to leave the first crate's cover at all. - There *must* have been another way other than the button sequence to open up the &quot;Disc 1/2 Movies&quot; secret -- I didn't have the sequence, but I had those movies opened up, and I don't even know how.That said, the last page of the book alone is worth the price. Since the developers of Syphon Filter 2 have put in a generous number of secrets but made the requirements for the secrets very obscure (aside from &quot;Girlie Magazine&quot; and &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, obviously!), that list was invaluable and allowed me to open up many more Multiplayer Arenas, even though I'll probably never use them. And the walkthroughs, if I had needed them, are quite detailed, with lots of screenshots so that you can compare where you are and find the right place by matching game to photo.If only they'd also offered some cheats (invincibility or infinite ammo would be nice -- the thought of the &quot;Hard Mode&quot; of *this* ultrahard game shivers my skin).

This is, in fact, one of my three favorite Jeeves books. The story is deliciously different, and eccentric at every turn. I think what is most noticeable about this book is the exquisite relationship between Bertie and Jeeves. We are wounded along with Bertie in the opening pages when Jeeves gives notice, although what follows makes their relationship more interesting than ever and, if I may say so, charming. This is the only book in which we \\"see\\" the servant's quarters (where Bertie spends much of his time seeking out Jeeves's advice), and the first in which we see how utterly devoted Jeeves is to the \\"golden-hearted\\" Bertie (Jeeves's words), although for the vast majority of the book he doesn't even work for him. Full of hilarious sequences such as Bertie's getting awakened every few minutes by the police constable, and getting chased by a drunk Brinkley (the new valet) with a carving knife (an event which is alluded to more than once in later novels). A wonderful, sweet, and zany book that tops the list of must-reads for Jeeves and Bertie fans.I could be wrong, but I believe the reason for this book's being out of print is Mr. Wodehouse's repeated use of the word \\"nigger.\\" In context, it is perfectly obvious that while the word is slang, it is never meant to be the extremely offensive and derogatory word that it is to my generation. In fact, Bertie has nothing but respect for the \\"nigger minstrels\\" and only wants to learn some banjolele-playing tips from them. The use of the word is simply a reflection of the times in which Wodehouse wrote-after all, this book was written more than seventy years ago, and times, and words, change.Next: Right Ho, Jeeves"},{"Title":"The Defector","review":"Bertie is in an awful pickle when Jeeves, over Bertie's constant playing of the banjolele, leaves his employment and is replaced by a knife weilding socialist who would rather see his blood running down the gutters than bring him his cup of tea.

Whew, what an adventure.This is also P.G.Wodehouse's first full length novel, and on reading it one chafes that he did not start writing full length Jeeves novels earlier.

While this edition is commendable in many ways, it falls short in one critical respect. The hardcover, binding, and paper are very nice. However, the font is small. I'm not that old, and I read a lot for work and pleasure. The font is appreciably smaller than usual for hardbacks, paperbacks, magazines, newspapers, and journal articles. It strains the eyes. So, while Wodehouse's content would merit a 5, this edition gets a 3. Hopefully, this review will help someone who (like me) is already a fan of Wodehouse and is looking for a nice hardcover.

This is a British book written in 1936. The word had absolutely no negative connotations in that context at the time (the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, models of decorum, use the word more than once), and to complain of it is sheer ignorance.

Wodehouse's novels reflect a bygone era, which may cause his novels to seem somewhat dated in terms of modern comparisons. Yet his main character's adventures and misadventures are as funny and fascinating as ever, transcending time with comic genius. In \\"Thank You, Jeeves\\", Bertie Wooster finds out what happens when he believes he does not need his irreplaceable valet Jeeves.The separation of lord and servant begins with Bertie's refusal to give up the banjolele and Jeeves refuses to remain with him. After some trouble with others in his apartment building, Bertie Wooster repairs to Chuffnell Regis, a town run by an old school friend, so that he can play his instrument to his heart's delight in a cottage by the harbor. But matters are complicated when he goes to lunch with his old pal, and finds a former fiance in attendance, as well as her less-than-happy-to-see-Bertie-Wooster father and the man who was responsible for ruining their engagement. Bertie quickly sees that his friend and former fiance are in love, and does everything he can to help them become engaged, but only manages to mess everything up. It's at a time like this that he could really use Jeeves, who just happens to have been employed by said friend, to set everyone to rights again.\\"Thank You, Jeeves\\" is a fast-paced, chuckle out loud read that is difficult to put down. For those familiar with other Wodehouse works, neither Bertie's scrapes and difficulties will come as a surprise, nor the manner in which Jeeves solves everything. The plot is extremely thin, and this novel seems much more dated than others in the series, but it is still classic Wodehouse and entirely enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Defector","review":"On almost every page, I found myself laughing out loud while reading this pitch-perfect book. The characters are wonderfully eccentric; Wodehouse masterfully skirts the edge of making them campy or caricatures of themselves.

In all, it was a diverting escape to the inconsequential adventures of minor British nobles and their servants and neighbors."},{"Title":"The Defector","review":"Classic P.G. Woodhouse.

I won't praise the comic language, as worthy as it is of praise. I'll just note that in his first Jeeves novel, Wodehouse is reaching toward the polish (pardon the word) of the next novel. The ending of this one is not nearly as neat, and Jeeves is much more voluble than elsewhere: Bertie and gang have to cut him short. (Wodehouse did one short story in Jeeves's own voice.

To be clear, the N-word certainly had negative connotations, even in the England of the 1930's. The upper classes, of course, saw nothing offensive in using demeaning terminology to describe inferior peoples, and for Wodehouse and his peers, Blacks were about as inferior as people got. In an unrelated short story (not in this volume) Wodehouse writes of an adventurous Englishwoman who would not marry a man she found enticing because he was \\"black as the ace of spades.\\" It was a laugh line whose humor depended on your acceptance that such an interracial union was absolutely beyond serious consideration.You can view this as offensive or just the way folks like Wodehouse saw things in 1936. But please don't claim that it is not horrifically disparaging to people of African ancestry."},{"Title":"The Defector","review":"As a big fan of P.G. Wodehouse, it pains me to assign only three stars to \`Thank You, Jeeves, but I have my reasons. Jeeves and Bertie go their separate ways over Wooster's \`banjolele' playing, so the first objection is that a large chunk of the book lacks the necessary goodish portion of Jeeves that nourishes Wodehouse fans.This reader's other two objections are intertwined and, I hope, a bit subtle. The story is just plain dated. A gag about white men wearing black-face runs on and on through the book and it's just not that funny anymore. This objection stems not so much from race consciousness as it does from the fact that the gag just falls flat - if not on the first instance then certainly by the umpteenth replay.And then there's Bertie's repeated use of the N-word to describe a group of minstrels. Now Wooster does not use the term as a straightforward epithet; he likes the minstrel show and wants to practice with them. His attitude is patronizing, but not hateful. And the word has or used to have somewhat different, perhaps slightly less offensive, connotations in England than in the US. No doubt the use of the word accurately represents the unspoken assumption of racial superiority that permeated the British upper class. The best you can say is it's an anachronism today. By the way, Jeeves calls them Negro minstrels, also an anachronism, but never intended offensively. Maybe Wodehouse was trying to make a point.The BBC TV series adapting the Wooster and Jeeves stories is highly entertaining. For this reviewer, these adaptations brought the characters to life in a way that improved upon the mental images I had formed.Jeeves & Wooster - The Complete SeriesAnyway, there are plenty of other better Wooster and Jeeves stories, likeThe Code of the Woostersthat are far superior to Thank You, Jeeves.I highly recommend Jeeves and Wooster, but this volume can be left aside."},{"Title":"French and Native North American Marriages, 1600-1800","review":"This book helped me solve many mysteries on my geneology.

Will Wright undertakes a structural study of the westerns made by Hollywood from 1930 to 1972, concentrating on the top moneymakers in the genre. He treats westerns as the depiction of myth, occupying space between individual and societal norms. He believes that for these films to be popular they must \\"appeal to or reinforce the individuals who view it by communicating a symbolic meaning to them\\" (p. 2). A take-off of the work of Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss, Wright extends symbolic meaning to represent and reflect the social institutions and attitudes that create and sustain myth. He notes that myth shifts in response to the social world in which it exists. As he explains it: \\"My argument, then, is that within each period the structure of the myth corresponds to the conceptual needs of social and self understanding required by the dominant social institutions of that period; the historical changes in the structure of myth correspond to the changes in the structure of the dominant institutions\\" (p. 14).Less psychological than L&eacute;vi-Strauss, Wright uses a tribal myths concept to explore the sociology of the Western film. He creates a typology of the western genre, emphasizing the development of four recurring plot structures that repeat themselves with variations throughout the history of the Western film: classical, vengeance, transitional, and professional. Western films have evolved through these plot structures, and Wright seeks to demonstrate a correlation between the films, their plot lines, and the larger society that embraced them. Offering short plot synopses as examples, Wright then explores the structural meaning of these films. The classical plot is represented in such films as \\"Shane,\\" and emphasizes the separation of the hero from the society around him and the strength of the individual to aid that society. The vengeance plot of such films as \\"One Eyed Jacks,\\" a variation of the classical plot, has similar elements but casts the hero outside of society, and never capable of living in it. The transitional plot, such as \\"High Noon,\\" anticipated new social values while forcing the hero to stand against both evil and the society at large. Finally, the professional plot, such as depicted in \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\\" suggests that companionship comes only in the banding together of skilled groups who sell their services and remain loyal to each other but no others.Will Wright concludes: \\"In the sixties and seventies, the traditional conceptual conflict between the idea of society and the idea of the individual has been transformed into a conflict between society and an elite group. This is perhaps one of the most significant consequences of the emergence of capitalist technology as a social and ideological force\\" (p. 184).This is an important and provocative book. It has received both praise and criticism for its attempt to place the Western film into this rigid structural analysis. There are good reasons to be skeptical of some of its ideas. There are also very good reasons to accept much of what Will Wright says in this challenging book."},{"Title":"Sixguns and Society: A Structural Study of the Western","review":"Wow. Read the book and promise to finish it.It breaks apart the insides of these old stories and lets you see how they work. That's the best way I can explain it. It gives countless examples.

The only knowledge required to understand it is perhaps Ordinary Least Squares. A theoretical explanation of the spectral analysis is not in the book. There is only a brief comment on De moivre's theorem (the one allowing and sustaining the whole spectral analysis) in a footnote. The main purpose of the author is to deliver an empirical methodology for empirical researchers not interested in the theories. The advantage is that, once you see such empirical applications, you understand the underlying idea of spectral Analysis. The elementary examples are very illuminating. The book is well organized and the review of \\"de-trending\\" (on this particular subject, I would like to say that the scientific discussion has evolved a lot in the last 20 years and the author's presentation is a little bit old), \\"harmonic analysis\\", \\"periodogrammes\\" seems pretty coherent. Perhaps the only drawback is that the text is a little repetitive and thus, slightly boring; but this is a minor problem, if you consider that this style will make more solids the understanding of the fundamental concepts. It's a great introduction to spectral analysis. Students having standard mathematical knowledge should begin here and then start reading more technical works, such as Bloomfied's \\"Fourier Analysis of Time Series\\" and the chapter of spectral analysis of Hamilton's \\"Analysis of Time Series\\"."},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis Of Time Series Data (Methodology in the Social Sciences)","review":"No one writes more clearly than Rebecca Warner.

For those who are new in the subject with the least mathematical background it is a highly recommended book. R. Warner offers a very intuitive approach to the difficult subject of spectral analysis and motivates, in a sense, the interested ones to go further with more advanced texts. For those who would like to get the idea of spectral analysis, to apply and interpret it, especially in the context of the behavioural sciences, it is the ideal book. However, for those who are more mathematically inclined (e.g. engineers, physicists or economists) and are interested in the-how-and-the-why by means of mathematical reasoning, other texts would be more appropriate."},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis Of Time Series Data (Methodology in the Social Sciences)","review":"The book is written in a simple language, however, I am not entirely happy about it.The book describes data and tables that are not available automatically in SPSS and to explain how to get them, it says that one should go back to books published by SPSS in 1993. So at least half of the book relates to tables not avilable without these further publications (SPSS for Windows. Trends. 6.0 or manual for SPSS base from the same year I suppose).Secondly, it says very little about interpretation and avoids co-spectral analysis issues. So I run a co-integration analysis and I learn that despite that my original time series had individually different cycles, their co-spectrum is different. And then what?So from one problem, I went to another problem - where can I get from the abovementioned manuals and where can I read about co-spectral analysis.It is a great book, but why not to simply write commands to get the tables that the author uses in a book and why not explain co-spectral analysis as well as spectral analysis was explained.I am angry with the idea of referring me to another manual, this is not fair - unless you have 1993 manual, you won't be able to repeat the calculations made in a book.

The concepts are exposed in a clear form, including illustrations, facilitating their understanding."},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis Of Time Series Data (Methodology in the Social Sciences)","review":"Ok, so this book is not going to make you a spectral analysis guru. In fact, it contains almost no theory or mathematical rigor. The main merit of this book is that it is very simple and conveys intuition about what spectral analysis is and how the results may be interpreted, which is what is lacking often in more rigorous treatments. The book is extremely readable (you'll finish it in 2-3 days), and provides much needed clarification of what all the terminology means and how it looks like in practice. Overall, a great starting point for an undergrad or a total beginner in spectral domain methods. No background is assumed, except for a basic stats course (minimum ANOVA/OLS awareness plus a little time series background).Now, to the drawbacks. The first is that this is written with a behavioral scientist in mind, so all of the examples are from that area: data on amount of talk in a conversation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure etc. Say for an economist these may look a bit weird.Secondly, if you want to apply stuff discussed in the book, you will have to look up more competent/rigorous sources. Also, some of the statistical procedures discussed in the text are a bit dated. SPSS is the software of choice for examples, and data for examples is printed (i kid you not!) in the appendix. Nothing like manually inputting a spreadsheet from a book in the information age.Overall, though very old school and not immediately applicable for serious research, this is a great INTRODUCTORY book for spectral analysis that helps you convert your results into english. And that's very valuable, especially seeing as many of the very technical researchers often struggle to explain what their results mean to a person outside their area of expertise.Also, for what it is, it should sell a bit cheaper."},{"Title":"Electrical Properties of Materials (Oxford Science Publications)","review":"This work demonstrates that scientists are people too!

Add in the most unlikely mother, Chloe, who just happens to be the local madam, the side-splitting retorts from maid Daisy and the bratty antics of Fulton and you have treasure trove of characters that will keep you begging for more. Complete with a murder mystery that needs to be solved and a twist in the end, you will not be disappointed.While the love scenes are very passionate and sensual, they are far from \\"pornographic\\" as some readers have stated in earlier reviews. I found them to be very well written without being vulgar.\\"Emma and the Outlaw\\" is part two of the Orphan Train Trilogy. The trilogy is as follows:Part 1 - Lily and the MajorPart 2 - Emma and the OutlawPart 3 - Caroline and the RaiderEnjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"This is the 1st book in the orphan train series of the 3 sisters lily , emma and caroline .I found this to be quite nice but the book but it could be quite draggy at the back .The ohter sister lily had more of a back bone and was much more in teresting to read but this is quite exciting as you are able to learn the outlaw's background and how he was and how he became an outlaw . You will also learn that emma was brought up by the town's prostitute and how her irritating fiance was such a creep amd how she dumped him(you go girl!) As for the rest , you can just read on...."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"I loved this book. It was definately a page turner. I was captivated in the whole story from begining to end. I am a new Linda Lael Miller fan and I am so glad that I took the time to sit down and read her books. She is a wonderful writer and it shows in this bookWhen Emma was seven years old she was put on an orpan train by her mother. She was accompanied by her 2 sisters, Caroline and Lily. Caroline, being the oldest was the first to get adopted off the train. Then Emma was next in another town. She begged the lady to take Lily too but the lady refused.While on the way to her new home from the train, Emma and her new \\"mother\\" bumped into Ms. Chloe Reese. Chloe bought Emma from the lady and took her home and fed her.Thirteen years later, Emma, the most proper of all women, is involved with Fulton Whitney, one of the richest and most respected men in all of Whitneyville. Until she meets Mr. Steven Fairfax.She gets excited when Steven is around and she doesn't understand why. As she is falling in love with a man she barely knows, and is considered an outlaw, she can't figure out why he makes her feel the way she does. She has never felt this way and is the first to try to deny it.After everything that happened Steven is taking a heard of cattle to Washington. When he is gone Macon drops by to find his brother and that is when all the drama begins.I recommend this book to any one who is a Linda Lael Miller fan. Even if you aren't yet, try reading one of her books.They are amazing."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"Ahhhhhhh!! I just got done reading it for the second time, and I know I will read it again. The sex parts were a little explixit, but then again I've read a few that were down right boring. Steven was the type of man that many woman wouldn't mind catching for themselves. I know I wouldn't mind hehe. And the story line for the whole trilogy is wonderful. It makes you want to sit down and read book one to book three."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"This is LINDA LAEL MILLER'S book, EMMA AND THE OUTLAW. A tale of love involving Emma, a young woman of 20, a librarian who has also set out to finding her two sisters, all who were abandoned by their mother at a young age. Emma places an ad offering a reward for information leading to the whereabouts of her sister. Emma is also engaged to marry a man she does not love, but feels obligated to marry anyway. All of this changes the day, Steven Fairfax, a man termed \\"an outlaw\\" comes into town and walks into Emma's life. From that day on Emma is a changed woman and when she takes on the duty of nursing Steven after he is injured, she becomes further aware of him and he of her. Emma forgets that she is an engaged woman when Steven's charms begin to work on her. Even though he has a checkered past, Emma cannot forget how she feels towards Steven. Also, Emma cannot forget her desire to locate Lily and Caroline Chalmers. Emma's life is an adventurous one of love and danger, of which love conquers all. This is the second book in the Orphan Train Triology about the Chalmers sisters. The first is \\"Lily and the Major\\" and the third is \\"Caroline and the Raider.\\" They can be read alone, but are great together.It was wonderful revisiting the spirited Emma and her sisters."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"I enjoyed this book. I had read another in the series and I wanted to know what happened to Emma and the other sister. It was a good story and had a happy ending for the girls. The story of each girl was different and thus was not redundant as some series are."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"It pains me to give this book a not so good review. Linda Lael Mille is truly one of my all time favorite authors. I've read over 15 of her books to date and this is only the second book of hers that I didn't like. The first book I didn't like of hers started out with her usual flare but very quickly died. I couldn't finish it. This one also started out with her usual spunk. It wasn't until around 80 to 100 pages that things seemed to drastically change. Beside there being WAY too much sex in it, it turned into all telling, repeating, and very disjointed. I can't imagine what happened other then she may have been under a deadline pressure and didn't give it her usual time. Somehow, painfully slow, I made it through. I had kept hoping things would shift back to how the beginning was written but it never did. It took me so long to read it, and was so different then the beginning that it seemed like a different book then the one I'd started. Oh well, I still have several others of hers on my bookshelf to read and have every intention to read them. I know she's an amazing writer and we all have our bad days, so I wouldn't let two out of many deter me."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"This was a good enough installment in this series, although it was my least favorite out of the trilogy. Still, it reveals the story of what happened to Emma, and there were parts that made me laugh with their wit and humor. Not a bad read, just not my favorite."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"This was a very good book but the sex scenes were very explicit and could have been shortened a bit. I also didn't realize it was part 1 of a trilogy until after I had finished reading. I loved the story line and it kept you interested."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"This was a great book. It is book 2 of 3. I had trouble putting it down. I love westerns."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"Disappointing! This was the first Linda Lael Miller I've read. This library find was more than sexually explicit, so graphically and ongoing that I considered it light pornographic. No, I am not prudish! I've read many sexually explicit and sensual writers, however, this novel's puritanical cover distort's the reader's expectations. I found nothing especially captivating about either character, especially Emma. She wasn't strong willed, stubborn, spoiled, manipulating, or even innocent. Emma was oversexed from the moment her maidenhood took flight with the wind. She spent her time coaxing this man to satisfy her carnal desires throughout the book. Maybe Emma was no different from the average 'American housewife', the only difference being that her carnal desires and needs were met. Well, that is a feather in her hat!"},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"Loved the book however took a long time being delivered , already had Caroline and the raider, the third book of the orphan trilogy, but once got it liked it!"},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"This book reminds me of a song by Peggy Lee, \`Is That All There Is?' Info about the \\"orphan trains\\" was very interesting but that fizzled fast.The rest of the book had enough plot to separate the huge number of sex scenes -- barely. After awhile, the repetitive sex scenes became boring!The book opens with sisters Emma and Lily being separated at a train station. Emma has been chosen to stay and the conductor spirits Lily back on the train. One of the tragedies of that \\"orphan train\\" was the likelihood that a child could be chosen for reasons other than giving a youngster a safe home.Chloe, a madam, knew this was going to happen to Emma and pays $100.00 to the person choosing this red-haired child. When the woman snidely asks Chloe if she plans to turn Emma into a prostitute, Chloe says she has always wanted a child of her own - and Emma would be that child.The next phase opens 13 years later and Emma has a beau, Fulton. He is a banker and heir to a huge fortune. Emma realizes she isn't in love with him but she wants to be accepted by the town (being the child of the town's madam leaves her virtue in doubt).After an explosion, the injured are sent to various homes because of the numbers and the severity of their wounds. Thus, Emma meets Steven when he is placed in Chloe's home. Before the first day is over, Steven tells her he plans to \\"take her\\" soon. And he does.However, it didn't fit; Emma was going to marry a man she didn't love in order to get the respectability she craved. So she gives herself to the first man who isn't her intended? (Half the town watched Steven and Emma go to the island and knew what happened). Logical?The book seemed to shift focus on a whim. First, the story was about the tragedies of the \\"orphan trains.\\" Then it is a romance with a triangle: woman is almost engaged but runs off with the new man in town (who obviously has a troubled past).Then the brother of the man with a troubled past demands Steven go back to Louisiana to face charges for murdering 2 people. Steven and Emma go back to face the trial. In the meantime, the brother threatens Emma - stating that he will be \\"consoling the widow\\" as soon as Steven is hanged.There is a mystery about who could have killed the 2 people, and it is resolved in an interesting fashion. However, Miller had to resort to \`insanity' to solve the mystery. How ho-hum."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"Linda Lael Miller has a wonderful way of expressing herself and bringing the characters alive. They become family and it's difficult to put it down so you can do housework. Then I start on the next one in the series.
