At first I wondered how useful it could be, given that many of the book's affirmations have probably already occurred to many cancer patients. Then I remembered how I felt shortly after being diagnosed and realized how useful it would have been to have a book like this, filled with nonjudgemental expressions of support for the choices a cancer patient makes in living his or her own life.For that reason, I think From This Moment On may be most useful to those who are newly diagnosed. Also, I think it would be very valuable for friends and family members of cancer patients, who often feel more helpless than the patient and could use a &quot;window&quot; into a cancer patient's feelings.But I think the real affirmation has nothing to do with what's between the book's covers.

Wonderful find and at laughable costs, rapid delivery. No other way for my research to get to this once famous book from 1943."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"What a stinker !After a perfunctory \`interview' with Royal Navy Lieutenant James Hawkins, it's off to the Caribbean with Long John Silver, who escapes the Hispaniola with not just a bag, as Stevenson told us, but a whole chest of specie.. Silver settles into a routine as a pub owner in a Caribbean port, gets married (his \`woman of color' being somehow forgot) names his pub Silver Jack's, and takes a new name. Oh, and he has a brother and a young nephew, too.Skip nine years. Enter Captain John Paul, lately having skewered a locally-popular fellow who just happened to try to lead a mutiny on John Paul's late ship, moored, wouldn't you know it, on the same island where Silver lives. John Paul befriends Silver's nephew, and after lots of confusing dialogue (did you know Silver attended Oxford?) Silver, still burning for the remainder of the treasure (did I mention there was another whole untouched cache? What else didn't Stevenson tell us about?) but somehow unable in nine whole years to obtain passage to nearby Treasure Island, is somehow convinced that Captain Jones is just the ticket to get him, Silver, the treasure, with the help of his nephew David, against his brother's wishes, who doesn't want the boy to go to sea. Wouldn't you know there's a ship to be had, so John Paul, now Jones, sails off, nephew David in tow, for the Colonies, rumoured to be starting a Continental Navy, in 1774, long before any Declaration or anything.Confused? Just wait.Our hero Cap'n Jones goes to sea in a small schooner with only six crewmen, including David the nephew. They encounter some weather, crack a crosstree and split some sails, and are dead in the water when a known bloodthirsty pirate vessel, well-manned and captained by Joshua Smoot, Flint the pirate's bloodthirsty son, is sighted, and gives pursuit. So at this crucial juncture Captain Jones naturally goes below and falls asleep, apparently so he can have a meant-to-be-shocking blade-bared dream about Smoot, who he has never seen. Upon his waking, we hear that the pirate vessel is in cannon range. Rather than working like dogs to escape, we get a half-page of \`salty' chest-beating dialogue between Jones and his men. Remember we're talking six men vs. 150, and I quote an excerpt:Crewman: \\"Our powder be dry an' the linstocks is burnin' bright, Cap'n Jones, jest like ye showed us!\\"Jones: \\"And those muskets, are they loaded also?\\"Crewman: \\"That they be, Cap'n! An' every jack man (sic) o' us be totin' a brace o' pistols, fer close-in fightin'!\\"Another crewman: \\"And we got our cutlasses an' daggers besides!\\"Arr. Matey. Arr.There's more, which I will spare you. Don't worry about me spoiling the \`plot', all the just mentioned goings-on occur in the first 30 pages.For me, a Stevenson lover, and more recently a real fan of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels, this age of sail novel has all the period authenticity we've come to expect from the Fenimore Cooper Deerslayer novels. Please see Mark Twain's \\"On Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses\\". Twain skewers his target far more effectively than I ever could, and every offense Cooper commits has its twin here in Johnson's \\"Dead Man's Chest\\". Avoid it at all costs."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"Commander Johnson deserves 5 stars just for ambition. He has not merely written a sequel to Treasure Island BUT ALSO a sequel to A. D. Howden Smith's excellent but mostly forgottenPorto Bello Gold : A Prequel to Treasure IslandAND offered an explanation for a 20 month gap in John Paul Jones' history AND for how he overcame several obstacles to obtain one of the very first Colonial Navy commissions AND cleared up another mystery involving another historical figure or two AND produced several coincidental meetings of old acquaintances AND suggested that it is all based on a true story AND ... well, perhaps that is the problem. That's quite a lot for just over 300 pages, which all too often breaks through the most sincerely attempted suspension of disbelief.Which is a shame because Johnson has put together a pretty rousing adventure overall. His Long John Silver may be the most Machiavellian of all, spinning a scheme that would cause Andrew Murray to blanch, carrying it out mostly from offstage like a spider tending a monstrous web (though when he finally takes a hand, it tends to be decisive). I hesitate to describe his scheme both because I don't want to give too much away and because it is so damn complicated!Briefly, having failed disastrously at convincing Robert Ormerod to reveal where the larger portion of the treasure was buried inPorto Bello Gold, Silver has an epiphany (so to speak), what Ormerod won't do for money or in response to threats he MIGHT do for a higher cause: The Revolution. Silver's adopted brother, a comparatively honest merchant, has come into possession of a shipload of the finest cannon, disguised as ballast, in a ship he obtained from the notorious pirate, Joshua Smoot, Flint's illegitimate son, who was unaware of their presence in the bowels of his prize. Silver's idea is to get John Paul Jones, currently in town and on the run for killing a mutineer, to convince the American would-be revolutionaries, to convince Ormerod to dig up the treasure and trade it for the cannons, without anyone realizing that he is the author of the scheme because who would ever trust Long John Silver?That's just the beginning; now things start to get complicated. JPJ picks a bad time to fall in love; the Revolutionary leaders figure out where the cannon originally came from; detouring to the original Treasure Island to pick up the silver bars left behind by the Hispaniola is suggested; Smoot gets wind of the scheme; a certain Lieutenant James (Jim) Hawkins, RN, shows up; etc.; etc.; etc.As tends to be the pattern in Treasure Island versions, prequels, and sequels, one of the most interesting relationships is between a naive young boy and a Machiavellian old man. The man of course is LJS, and the boy is David Noble, the son of LJS' adoptive brother. David is easily the least naive (and most conflicted) of these potential proteges because he knows exactly who his uncle is and is willingly helping LJS to succeed with his scheme (well, the part of it he knows about, anyway). When he's lying through his teeth trying to con JPJ, you know he's a long way from Jim Hawkins or Robert Ormerod for that matter.Faults other than a plot that makes an Indiana Jones movie look like a PBS documentary and a crappy job of editing? I can think of two that really bothered me. First, by far the most boring, tiresome character in the book is John Paul Jones. Maybe the retired USN officer author didn't feel comfortable messing around with one of our greatest naval heroes, or maybe JPJ just wasn't that interesting a person at this stage in his life, but the result is that whenever JPJ takes the stage, the reader will be impatiently waiting for him to leave it. Not what I've come to expect from reading about the later man, that's for sure.Second, Johnson really treats A. D. Howden Smith's characters rather shabbily, spoiling the ending ofPorto Bello Gold, which came as a surprise because with the increasingly wild revelations as the novel hurtles toward its end, I was sure that he was going pull a rabbit out of the hat for them, too, and I could even see how he was going to do it. Instead we get the craziest revelation of all, and Smith's characters get zilch.It says on the back of this edition ofDead Man's Chestthat this book is being developed into a major motion picture. I'm sorry, I just can't see it. Besides the problem of having crammed in more plot twists than could be handled in a mini-series, such a movie REQUIRES a movie version ofPorto Bello Goldand a remake of Treasure Island just to set it up! The only hope would be if all three books could somehow be slipped onto Peter Jackson's reading list! Still, I'd love to see it happen, if only Commander Johnson would agree to fix the problems with the ending!"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I obtained this book in 2001 but emerging family caregiving situations kept me from reading it. Once I started I could barely put it down.

Is it true that an aging pirate, Long John Silver, manipulated John Paul Jones and other patriots of the American Revolution into recovering treasure from a small island in the Caribbean? These are but a few of the questions I was asking myself after I finished reading Commander Roger Johnson's well crafted adventure novel, DEAD MAN'S CHEST. As a writer, I know how tough it is to spin a yarn of factual fiction, and do it in a way that makes every page believable. Mr. Johnston has done it in spades - and everything rings true - from the sailing lore to the historical backdrop. It is a saga bigger than life and destined to be made into a major motion picture. Move over C. S. Forester, Patrick O'Brian and Dan Parkinson - there is a new author on the scene writing in the same tradition. We can only hope Commander Johnson will continue to tell us more about the characters he has so skillfully brought back to life in this truly entertaining novel. If you enjoy factual fiction with a nautical theme, you will not be able to put this one down."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I took Dead Man's Chest with me on vacation. Essentially, my planned vacation activities were put on hold until I completed reading the book. Roger Johnson related the characters' thoughts, actions, and words so clearly, and the story locations so realistically, that I truly suspect that he might really have found historical documentation of actual events. I hope Mr. Johnson will continue writing and publishing novels of this high caliber."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I just finished reading DEAD MAN'S CHEST, and I can honestly say it is one of the best two or three books I have ever read. It is the remarkable story of how one man, Long John Silver, was able to manipulate both pirates and patriots in order to aquire the Treasure of Dead Man's Chest; the other two-thirds of the treasure John Flint burried on Treasure Island. The action takes place between November 1773 and June 1775, the same twenty months in which the naval hero John Paul Jones disappeared from the history books. He was a foreigner and had a warrant on his head, yet he did something so remarkable for the American Colonies that he was awarded one of the first naval commissions in the Continental Navy. DEAD MAN'S CHEST reveals for the first time exactly what he did, woven together with other historical events and with just enough fiction to give this amazing novel a hook to keep my undivided interest. I give DEAD MAN'S CHEST five stars!"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I just finished reading Dead Man's Chest by Commander Roger Johnson and was thrilled with each page. I'm not much of a fiction reader, but once I read the two page preface, I was hooked. Commander Johnson has put together a marvelous story of adventure, mixed with love, intrigue, and how Long John Silver manipulated hundreds of pirates and Colonial patriots into doing his bidding to find and take back the treasure of Dead Man's Chest. I was especially taken with the 1777 transcript of the Royal Navy Admiralty Court of Inquiry that formed the foundation of this amazing epic adventure. I recommend Dead Man's Chest to everyone who likes a great yarn, and truly hope this important literary work makes it to the big screen."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I don't know how he's accomplished it, but Commander Johnson's new novel, Dead Man's Chest, is written with the same rivetting plot and clarity as Patrick O'Brian and C.S, Forrester. By the time I was halfway through his most interesting preface, I was hooked, and couldn't put the book down until all was revealed about Long John Silver's involvement with the American Founding Fathers and the Revolutionary War. An amazing tale of lust for treasure, sabotage, power, and how one man was able to manipulate both patriots and pirates to do his bidding. This is a must read for anyone who loves the sea, anyone who enjoys a plot full of twists and turns, and anyone who just loves a great yarn."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I feel in love with \\"Treasure Island\\" about 45 years ago as a child. I've always longed for a sequel. I've read many sea historical fiction novels since then but I couldn't find a \\"Treasure Island\\" sequel. I've read a biography on John Paul Jones. He's a man I admire and appreciate. I was captivated with \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" by the time I reached the third page and hated to put it down. CAUTION FOR PARENTS: This book is definitely for the 13+ age group. There's blood, murder, treachery (of course we're talking Long John Silver and pirates here!) cannibalism, illicit sex, drinking. . . These are (mostly) vital to the plot, but not appropriate for the under 12 crowd. Can I give this book 10 stars?"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I like how the author intertwines references from the original Treasure Island, and the prequel Porto Bello Gold by Howden with just enough historical facts to make the reader wonder...maybe it could be almost true. For example, John Paul Jones did actually kill a mutinous crew member in Tobago in 1773 and did spend some years on the run and adopted Jones as a surname during this time. He also did have a brother William in Frederickburg, VA and did court Dorothea Daindridge, etc.On the negative, I agree with a previous reviewer that the editor/publisher should be fired for the numerous unexcusable typos throughout the text. As a retired USN Commander I am sure the author would agree the editing was less than \\"ship-shape\\". Also I found that some of diaglogue in the story seemed a little strained or awkward, sometimes it just didn't flow well. One other issue which may be the editors fault is a reference to Robert Omerod daughter being kidnapped and dying in a fire set by Long John Silver's agents (pg 113). The dialog seems to refer to a previous mention of this incident earlier in the story but I could not locate one. This incident is later referred to again when Robert attacks Long John Silver when the finally meet again. Just seems like an inconsistency that should have caught.All in all this is OK effort that rounds out the prequel and the orginal tale but I don't think Johnson is in the same league as Stevenson or Howden."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I've always loved adventure stories about pirates and treasure and now to have the story of Treasure Island continue is a real treat! It's wonderful to follow the intrigue into later years.

The deadly cutthroat must form an alliance with his teenage nephew and Captain John Paul Jones, who just might be more dangerous than any wanted criminal, to retrieve a staggering ransom of gold and jewels from the &quot;Dead Man's Chest&quot;. Highly recommended for any with an interest in nautical myths or stories of pirate escapades!"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"While passing through Crescent City in early July 2001, I purchased a signed copy of Dead Man's Chest as a gift for my wife, since I'm not the reader in the family. As we stopped in Roseburg, Oregon, I decided as a fluke, that I would read just the preface. That was all it took because I was unforgivenly hooked. I began reading at 11:00 AM, and fourteen hours later I had read all but the last two chapters. I was so impressed that I insisted we drive our motorhome back to Crescent City to speak with Commander Johnson and to get a photo with him. I can tell other readers that this is by far the best book I have ever read, and am convinced that it must be made into a movie. Anyone who loves a great mystery, or an action/adventure story with strong characters and an intriguing plot must get a copy of Dead Man's Chest! And don't worry that it's a pirate novel. This is an instant classic that will be read for generations!"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"If you are looking for this book at a used bookstore or the library, be aware there is a second book by the same title (author is Rankin, I think) which is a chronicle of the travels of Robert Louis Stevenson, not a sequel to Treasure Island.Don't know if this will happen to anyone else, but I checked out the wrong one. Be sure you know which one you're getting!"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I've wondered what might have happened when Long John Silver and Ben Gunn pulled away from Dead Man's Chest in their small boat finally escaping death.

And Long John Silver surfaces along with other pirates, providing us with stories within stories finally bringing us to a momentous conclusion. Would that Roger's tale become a movie."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"This is a very well written book with a great story.

Take note publisher: spend a little more time making sure your books are error free.Johnson's writing is excellent and deserves better care from the editor and publisher!"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"It seems that writing sequels to &quot;Treasure Island&quot; has become something of a cottage industry. That doesn't shock me, for any good and interesting book invites its readers to speculate about what happened to the characters after it ended. This particular sequel posits the idea that Long John Silver helped John Paul Jones obtain his commission in the newly-formed Continental Navy, and also helped the colonists to acquire the cannons needed to carry on their war against England. The naval aspects of this tale are excellent, and the characters are fairly well drawn. The plot is a bit far-fatched, but interesting all the same. My only quibble is that there's really not enough about Jim Hawkins, who only appears as a minor character. Long John himself doesn't appear to be the same fellow we remember from the original book, but it's the author's right to do with his characters as he wishes. The story is enjoyable aside from some minor lapses in plot, so it is worth reading if you enjoy pirate and adventure yarns."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"There were times I agreed with the very positive review on Amazon, and times I agreed with the vitriolic one. Too many plot lines and some lack of clarity. Some of the nautical detail left me behind, but that's my ignorance. Yes, bad editing (misspelt names etc). Absurd that Howden Smith's \\"Porto Bello Gold\\" is not named anywhere; if I hadn't known that \\"Treasure Island\\" prequel I think I'd have been completely lost. Silver's early attempts to get the location of the treasure from Robert seemed to me unclear, and to require a lot of turning back to understand. And the final twist - you could see something like it coming - is just odd. Why (without issuing spoilers) the lady in question had, as a girl, a different name from her father, I never understood. Nor why she was said to have had TWO children. She is very sanguine about being an unmarried mother, too, for her time. David's romance seems a bit of an afterthought, and his sweetheart a rather uninhibited wooer for a girl of the period. The poor girl who DIDN'T survive being taken prisoner is given somewhat indecently short shrift.BUT there is some terrific writing, especially involving the young pirate, and the maroons who were left on Spyglass. At times the author convinces you he is keeping all the balls in the air successfully, and bringing [back] to life his ambitious mixture of original characters, Stevenson's characters, Howden Smith's characters and real people.Commander Johnson's pirate captain Smoot seems to be a version of Flint, which is fair enough as - of course - he has two names and a secret parentage. His Dutch captain seems like a version of Howden Smith's Peter Corlaer in \\"Porto Bello Gold\\", until he displays some more distasteful characteristics.It seems a little surprising that originally English characters like Silver and Gunn should be so wedded to American Independence - but I can forgive the Commander a good deal for the originality of some of his writing."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Chest: Library Edition","review":"I loved this book.

Now, after more than a hundred years, author Roger Johnson has taken up the thread to provide its logical successor, Dead Man's Chest. The theme bears slight resemblance to its 19th century parent--quest for hidden treasure--but new wrinkles fairly abound. While we are long familiar with the likes of Long John Silver, several additional colorful characters are introduced into the equation, such as the schemer-turned-good fellow, David Nobel and the malevolent Joshua Smoot. Serving as historical backdrop are the crisis days of the American Revolutionary War, and a formidable cast of familiar figures has been assembled, including Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and most notably, the redoubtable John Paul Jones.Building upon a platform of solid factual research, Johnson tantalizes us with the prospect of what might have occurred in those hectic days had the fictional figures had opportunity to match wits with their historical counterparts. Needless to say, the possibilities are endless, but the proffered model makes an entirely plausible and illuminating case for &quot;what might have been&quot;. Johnson has evidently done his homework and knows the subject, both inside and out. He exhibits a ready command of established facts, and the jargon comes thru with a zest as real as the salt air. The result is a compelling story line which holds our attention and can easily be described as cracklin' good!"},{"Title":"Teresa Wentzler's Celestial dragon: Cross stitch","review":"I purchased this pattern many many years ago and have slowly been putting it together.

How did they climb mountains, how did their ships work, how accessible was glass?This is a handy book about weapons up through the 20th century, but not much else."},{"Title":"David and Goliath (A Bible Story)","review":"This version of the bible story David and Goliath is fantastic! It tells the story with full-color drawings done by the author and tells the story clearly for kids from 4-10. It will make your kids smile at the sometimes silly drawings, but while they are laughing, the story is sinking in also. This is one of the best renditions of this story I have ever read, and highly recommend it. The little sheep at the bottom of each page never hesitate to add their cute comments as seen from a sheep's point of view, either. My kids really enjoyed this book and I'm sure yours will too."},{"Title":"David and Goliath (A Bible Story)","review":"There are many stories for children written about the Bible character, David, as he is a main figure in several books of the Old Testament and the favorite of many children (as well as adults). David and Goliath, written and illustrated by prolific author/illustrator Jean Marzollo, tells the well-known story of David's battle with the giant Goliath, taken from the Scriptures 1 Samuel 17. Children unfamiliar with the story will enjoy the suspense of the story; those who already know it, will enjoy this retelling.What I Like: I liked Jean Marzollo's writing style. She tells about the battle, and what leads up to it, with an emphasis on what David thought about the whole thing. I think kids can relate to that. And, she uses lots of lively, descriptive language throughout the book. In the introduction, she explains that David was the author of many psalms, that are like poems or songs. So, she included verses from the 23rd Psalm as part of the text. The verses are highlighted in blue ink to set them apart from the rest of the text.At first, I didn't like the illustrations. The Bible story is retold, in part, in the usual manner, with normal-sized print on the page. Some of the illustrations are what you'd expect, pictures on the page to illustrate the story. But the storyline is interspersed with comic-book-like illustrations. The characters in the illustrations \\"talk\\" to each other, like they do in comic books. I thought they made the page \\"too busy.\\" But, I've changed my mind: I now think kids would enjoy the story being told this way. And, I know they would enjoy the bold colors, which I do like.Also, there are little animals that run across the bottoms of each page. The pages of David and Goliath are decorated with lambs because, as the author explains, \\"David was a shepherd.\\" The lambs also comment on the action depicted on each page. I think young children would enjoy these extra illustrations.What I Dislike: Nothing, now!Overall Rating: Excellent.Age Appeal: 4-8.Christine M.

It is not an easy book to handle and there are fewer ceviche recipe's than the author suggests.

To copy a recipe and place the copy on a stand, you must \\"break\\" the back of the book to keep the pages apart, and the book will look tacky thereafter.There are some great ideas on ceviche, advice on related basics, even a recipe for Peru's papas huancaina (there's LOTS of variations!) , and the chef knows his stuff.Bad book design, could use more recipes, it's certainly above average with 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Ceviche Book","review":"The other comments about the print quality of this book are true, but I found the insights and recipes to be well worth the extra effort to deal with the binding. There is a great story and excellent recipes. The philosophy of ceviche is revealed."},{"Title":"The Great Ceviche Book","review":"For those who are perhaps unfamiliar with the term, \`Ceviche' (I've heard it pronounced \\"seh-vee-chay\\" and \\"seh-veech-ee\\") refers to a delicate method of cooking certain foods (usually seafood) by immersing it in an acidic brine (typically a modestly salted lime juice, but sometimes a mixture a vinegar and various other citrus juices instead) for 1-3 hours. The acid has the same effect on the proteins that heat does, except that there's no heat or caramelization involved. After a set period of time, the acidic brine is then drained off and discarded, and the ceviche is dressed (seasoned) and served in much the same way that a seafood salad is - with diced vegetables and herbs, and a light finishing sauce (typically citrus based).The \`Ceviche' process (which is most popular in central and south america) is related to, but somewhat different from, classic pickling, in that the former uses more acid, and is much less aggressively salted/spiced ... the intention being to serve it almost immediately (within a few short hours), rather than to preserve something for long term storage.Ok, on to the book itself. I have very mixed feelings about this particular offering:What I liked:TOPIC: There's a great paucity of books on this one particular topic, so this book is a very welcome addition to an otherwise grossly overcrowded field.FLAVORS: I've also (as of this writing) worked with several of the recipes in this book, and so far, the flavors have been impeccable. I'm also fortunate to have eaten (several times) at a restaurant owned and operated by a chef who's worked for/with the author (sample dish: diver scallop ceviche on the half-shell, lightly dressed with blood orange and grapefruit). In fact, it was the chef/proprietor of this restaurant who recommended this book to me. It's always nice to encounter a book in which virtually everything has already been tested and approved by actual use in a successful restaurant, and to see ripples from said book (and restaurant) slowly spread outward into the larger culinary community. As I write this, Sushi is all the rage here in (semi)urban America, and I can easily see ceviche following hot on it's heels.INTRO: The author has a decent introductory chapter that overviews both the method of cooking, as well as some of the regional variations in style (Ecuadorian, Peruvian, etc.). I wish that more authors were as diligent.GLOSSARY: The author includes a helpful glossary of terms and ingredients. I wish more authors would do that.TECHNIQUES: Chapter 4 (unintuitively titled \\"basics\\") provides some helpful preparation instructions on how do things like cook octopus, blanch shellfish, open oysters, etc.HEAD NOTES: Many of the recipes contain interesting head notes about what inspired the dish or where it came from. That's something else that I wish more authors would do.What I disliked:AWKWARD FORMAT: The edition I have is a 4\\" wide by 10\\" long by \\" thick soft-cover \\"chap-book\\" binding, on stiff paper, with a glued-binding. It's designed to be visually appealing on a bookstore shelf, but I cannot emphasize enough what an annoying format it is. It's awful. It's too stiff to open comfortably, you can't lay it flat on a table and work from it, and you actually have to exert hand strength just to hold it open - almost like the book doesn't want you to read it. Think hard-shell clam, struggling to close on your fingers, after having been caught gaping. The space-wasting format also causes even short recipes to spill across 2 full pages ... sometimes even 3-4, if there's a photo involved.NOT ENOUGH RECIPES: The author, on page 6, claims this book includes 60 ceviches. The back cover mentions \\"50 of his favorite recipes\\". Both numbers are WRONG. I counted - there are only 35 ceviche recipes in this book. All of the other recipes hinted at on the back cover, and in the introduction, involve recipes for things like interim procedural ingredients (ex: poaching liquids, flavored oils, etc), condiments, and accompaniments. Surely this book is a candidate for Consumer Report's infamous \\"black hole\\" award ... a book 162 pages, with a over price of $18 US, but only 35 recipes of the style implied on the cover. I'll overlook the fact that some of those 35 recipes involved shellfish & bivalves cooked by heat, rather than acid, and thus could be considered \\"seafood salads\\" rather than true ceviches (ex: \\"Indian Mussels\\", \\"Peruvian Black Ceviche\\", \\"Honduran Fire and Ice Lobster\\", \\"Peruvian Tuna Causa\\", etc.) ... but that's splitting hairs.INTRO: In my opinion, the author did not provide adequate coverage of explaining the why behind why certain types of seafood should be cooked (or handled with greater care), rather than eaten raw. There's also insufficient attention to sanitation issues (how to sanitize cutting boards to cut down on bacteria, dangers of cross-contamination, etc.), as well as concerns involving resistant parasites (nematodes, worms, etc.) ... how to spot/minimize/avoid them, techniques that can kill them, etc. A book that champions such a delicate cooking technique, and revolving around RAW flesh for it's subject matter, should show a bit more responsibility to the topic and aggressively deal with such matters head-on, rather than lazily tucking tail and short-sheeting the matter.PROCEDURAL TIPS: Chapter 4 could have been MUCH longer and more robust. I would have like to see more information (and pictures) on things like assessing fish quality; cleaning and butchering fish (esp. ones you've caught yourself); more advice on timing (such as how long the various recipes will maintain peak flavor/texture, once assembled); a fuller discussion of bivalves (size grading, point of origin labeling protections, types of knives used to open them and pictures of how to do it, etc.); a general discussion of tools (fillet knives, scalers, slicing knives, etc.) and also more supplemental information on how to make use of throw-away items (like shrimp shells, fish heads & frames, fish skins, fish innards, etc) to make things like fish stock & soups, bone cracklings, skin cracklings, etc. All of those things are a natural byproduct of making ceviche, and the book is so criminally short that there's little no reason why they chose to be so stingy with such material.NO RECIPE INDEX / DISCERNABLE ORDER: A book this short should have a convenient recipe index ... either right up front, or at the start of each of the 4 chapters. No dice here. If you want one, you'll have to type it yourself, fold it up, and stuff it in. To compound matters, the recipes do not appear to be in any discernable order within in their respective chapters ... alphabetical or otherwise. They seem to be a random jumble.PHOTOS: There's a shortage of photos of finished dishes, and a gaping void of helpful procedural photos. The photos that ARE present are far too big (taking up an entire page, and sometimes 2 pages), too few, and are often so myopically close that it's hard to tell what it's supposed to be. [Note to would-be food photographers - if the far side of the plate is out of focus, and the foreground is so close that it causes claustrophobia on the part of the reader, you're zoomed in too much. Please consider an alternate career in pornography.] There are also irrelevant photos present that have nothing whatsoever to do with making ceviche ... such as the picture of beer opposite page 1, popcorn on page 120, several pictures of the author and his friends/staff, etc. Oh, and as long as we're on the topic of popcorn, the author's recipe (p.121) is a bit weak ... the amount of oil required should be 1/3 cup, not 2 tbsp (popcorn follows a classic 2:1 ratio of kernels to oil), and the author neglects to include a 60 second rest off the heat, after the 1st kernel pops, before putting it back on the heat to finish popping (which greatly increases the yield and reduces scorching).IMPRECISION: I was pleased to see the author include a brief discussion of gourmet salts in his introduction. However, in standardizing to the generic (and vague) term \\"salt\\" in all his recipes, he neglects to mention that the two most common salts in culinary use (i.e., plain table salt and coarse kosher salt) cannot be substituted on a 1:1 basis of for each other. I find that to be a glaring omission that could lead to irregular levels of salt, from one reader to the next, depending on which salt is the default usage for their household. For those who are curious, 1 tbsp regular table salt is roughly equivalent to 1.5 tbsp of coarse kosher salt, with a slight upward or downward variation on that depending on just how coarse the kosher salt really is ... it varies. As you can see, a 50% salt difference is NOT negligible - esp. in a book dealing with raw fish. I'm also not keen on recipes that use imprecise terms like \\"one bunch of thyme\\" (p.136) and don't bother to give better guidance how big a \`bunch' is, or if it's fresh or dried. For the most part, the author does a decent job of precision throughout his book, but he definitely drops the ball when it comes to salt and herbs. It's one of my recurring pet peeves with many cookbook authors.FOCUS: I think the author would have served the subject, and the reader, better if he'd focused on presenting the material from a practical home-cook standpoint (which is where the cuisine originated to begin with), rather than faithfully parroting the elaborate recipes he prepares at his restaurant. As is, many of the recipes in this book are highly impractical restaurant-only offerings, and are thus useless to most readers, even those who are fairly serious about the hobby. For instance, the \\"Honduran Fire and Ice Lobster\\" (p.81) calls for cup of lobster stock {p.136}. Speaking from personal experience, very few home cooks, even those who cook lobsters, go to the trouble of making classic lobster stock ... much less do it just to get cup to make ceviche with {and by the way, only restaurants will squander a full cup of butter just to sweat mirepoix for making stocks in general ... home cooks uniformly use oil}. I repeat - it's a restaurant-only recipe. Ditto for the \\"Sea Urchin Shots\\" (p.56) ... it's a restaurant-only recipe. Someone like Thomas Keller can get away with that sort of thing (primarily because he's famous and his books are as much about the philosophical quest for perfection as they are about documenting what he does at his iconic restaurant) ... this author cannot. Sorry. For a book pushing the $20 mark that only has 35 ceviches, I expect recipes that are practical and make-able.RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION: Several of the recipes in this book call for varieties of seafood that are either already endangered (Chilean Sea Bass), or well on their way to getting there due to overfishing (Sea Urchin, Red Snapper, etc.). I think boosting the popularity of such products still further is a bit irresponsible. I was pleased that the author mentioned the overfishing of conch, but he could have gone quite a bit further in extolling farm-raised alternatives for more of his ingredients.Bottom line: This is one of those books in which I love many of the recipes, but for which the book as a whole gets a negative review. I wish I could give it the thumbs up, but it's long laundry list of annoying shortcomings and omissions drag that back down into the below average zone. My advice is to hold off on buying this one and hope the author eventually decides to republish a greatly expanded and reformatted edition. If, however, you love ceviche, and if you're physically holding the book in your hand there in the bookstore, go grab a cup of coffee, then spend 20 mins reading the intro to overview the basic technique (i.e., cup lime juice & a heaping spoon of salt, stir, use to marinate 1-1.5 lbs of sliced/diced fish for 1 hour, drain, and then dress and combine all the rest of the ingredients like you would a fancy seafood salad ... that's pretty much the gist of it), then skim a few recipes to get a general idea of flavors, and then put it back on the shelf ... you can find whatever else you need on the internet."},{"Title":"The Great Ceviche Book","review":"\`the great CEVICHE book' by Douglas Rodriguez presents what may be the second great native American food style, after barbecue. While both styles of cooking have serious non-American influences, both are also certifiably born and raised in the New World.Ceviche is a method of \`finishing' seafood with citrus or other edible acid such as vinegar. Language leaves me at a loss here, as I am not fond of saying the acidic marinade \`cooks' the fish as no heat is involved, yet there is no other word which quite seems to fit.Douglas Rodriguez is an experienced cookbook author, as this is his third book, appearing in the 10 Speed Press' series of tall and skinny books on culinary topics. I have seen three of these titles and this is better than Mark Miller's book on salsa, but not as good as David Lebovitz' book on chocolate. I confess the relative quality has a lot to do with how much interesting history there is to give about each subject. My opinion of the chocolate book also has a lot to do with the fact that of the three, it has the most background material meant for the easy chair rather than the kitchen counter. I simply do not see what 10 Speed Press was trying to do with this long, skinny format with a binding which works against propping it open and following a recipe on one of its pages. The publisher would have been much more intelligent to put the material in a squarish volume with spiral or plastic rib binding similar to what Random House did with Paula Deen's \`The Lady and Sons' cookbooks.In spite of all that grousing about the format and binding, I must recommend Rodriguez' book because there are simply very few books on this most interesting subject, and even fewer good books. And, Rodriguez' material in this book is very good. As with Lebovitz' book on chocolate, there is a lot of introductory material on the origin and homeland of this culinary technique. In a nutshell, modern ceviche seems to have been developed by a meeting of Peruvian and Ecuadorian fishermen's techniques with fish and citrus with Japanese immigrants' overlaying Japanese raw fish techniques.The book divides the world of ceviche dishes very neatly into the simple \`tiraditos', dishes made with only one raw seafood protein and \`mixtos', dishes made with two or more raw seafood proteins. To these two styles, the author adds recipes for side dishes that complement ceviche dishes. The author does not dwell on this aspect of this cuisine, but it should be evident that ceviche is very healthy, very easy, and relatively cheap. The hardest thing about this cuisine is finding a trustworthy source of fresh fish. Once you have that, virtually the entire cuisine reduces to variations on the fish plus five ingredient types. These are citrus, onion, salt, herbs, and chiles. Aside from salt, all of these groups are pretty broad, so what seems like a limitation is really more like the requirements that a poem scans and rhymes. It imposes a discipline that leads to creativity.And, the book is about the creativity of the author rather than being a catalogue of traditional Ecuadorian or Peruvian dishes. The foreword by eminent New Yorker foodie writer Calvin Trillin makes it clear that Rodriguez' inspiration is rooted firmly in the traditions of Peru and Ecuador, but the photos show dishes which are 100% New York City food styling.For an annoying binding and page format, the $17.95 list price seems a bit high, but the contents are very, very good. Highly recommended for anyone who likes fish and easy culinary methods. My feeling about this book is that the thing to do is to assimilate Rodriguez' principles behind the technique and go off on your own improvisations."},{"Title":"The Great Ceviche Book","review":"Lots of great recipes, so far we have liked all tried.

Since then, I have learned to keep it close by - it migrates from the coffee table to my night table to the bathroom to the breakfast table - I need it handy. I refer to it constantly, and often find myself opening it at random and immediately being hooked by whatever subject comes up.It's a tremendous compendium of easily accessible information on all aspects of the English language, and there are nuggets of value throughout. It is well-written in a lively, non-pedantic style, and has plenty of illustrations to reinforce understanding and make it more interesting. It's appropriate for most ages except very young children, and is a terrific way to introduce anyone to the wonders and mysteries of our language.The same remarks hold true for Crystal's &quot;Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language.&quot; That work is presented in the same way, but with much a broader scope - it covers all aspects of human language. I like to browse in it and then get greater detail from the English Language book - they work very well together.I'm in awe of Crystal's ability to present such huge subjects so coherently and in such a comprehensive and fascinating way.I strongly recommend both books, for you or for anyone you care about."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language","review":"David Crystal impresses me with his combination of elegant erudition, intellectual open-mindedness, and conciseness. In writing this book, he imposed a harsh constraint upon his writing: every topic had to fit into a two-page spread. The result is insidiously like potato chips: it's such an easy read, you can't help but reading \\"just one more spread\\".The breadth of knowledge that he brings to bear on the subject is astounding; his bibiography reads like a catalog of Western intellectual history. Time and again, I found myself marking a point with a note to delve into the matter more deeply.Intellectual integrity is another impressive component of his writing. He cheerfully acknowledges difficult issues and treats linguistic variation with respect, yet never descends into cover-your-ass academic frippery. The effect is to provoke deeper contemplation in the mind of the reader; language truly is endlessly complex!A confession is in order here: I did find the last few score pages rather tedious. Perhaps it was merely the fatigue arising from my breathless rush through the first 400 pages; more likely the subject matter does not suit my tastes. But in a grand parade of ideas of this size, I cannot complain if a few floats or marching bands fail to excite me; there's more than enough here to keep anybody dazzled.The greatest tribute to this book that I can offer is the revelation that I have been too reluctant to shelve this book in my library; it remains on my desk, bedstand, or next to the computer, ready for a quick re-read of some random topic.Betcha can't read just one spread!"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language","review":"Crystal's _The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language_ is not really the type of book I would use for reference. There are much more appropriate books when I want to learn about the proper use of a gerund. This is, however, an absolutely fascinating and addictive book! It is the type of book I pick up to read and get so involved I lose track of time. It is also a beautiful book. The color, illustrations, and publishing quality are magnificent!The focus of this book is not American English. The flavor is cosmopolitan. Questions are answered like how the variations of English in New Zealand and the Caribbean affect road signs. If you ever wanted to know how morphological, lexical, syntactic, and discourse humor compare and contrast, this book is for you. This encyclopedia also features a brilliantly edited collection of poems interspersed in the pages. _The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language_ will remain one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language","review":"I have truly enjoyed reading this book, and recommend it highly to anyone interested in learning about the English language. It is easy to read, clear, and authoritative. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that Mr. Crystal seems to hold the subtly snobbish attitude toward American literature and language still prevalent among the educated class in Britain. He gives due credit to Benjamin Franklin, Noah Webster, Edgar Allen Poe, and H.L. Mencken, but dismisses Mark Twain as being simply a humorist with vaguely racist tendencies, and fails to even mention Hawthorne, Melville, or Longfellow, the leaders of the 19th century American Renaissance, who succeeded in creating a distinctive American literature, separate from the English tradition. He also fails to mention Stephen Crane and Ernest Hemingway, but includes Burton Raffles, Peter Sellers (twice), and John Le Carre.At the same time, I sometimes have the feeling that we Americans have merely borrowed the English language, and don't understand it, love it, and use it the way the English do. For us, English is handy tool, but if something better came along we would abandon it without a second thought, whereas the English will always speak English. And Hawthorne, Melville, and Longfellow may be more widely read in the UK these days than they are in their own country. Mr. Crystal obviously loves the English language, and writes about it with lucidity and affection. So my complaint is a back-handed compliment, in a way, and I would not discourage anyone from buying and reading this book from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language","review":"I first found this book in my high school library. When I stumbled upon it in my local bookstore, I couldn't resist. Its graphic richness makes it a great coffee table book (and conversation starter--see section on linguistic pet peeves), yet the continuous accompanying text makes for a good (if not exhausting) straight read-through. Well researched, organized, and selected material--there is little in this book that is less than fascinating."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language","review":"As a graduate student in Linguistics, this book is a true gem. Especially wonderful is the history of every letter of the English alphabet"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language","review":"We use English everyday. We even studied spelling and grammar in school (maybe not as much as we should have studied). However, most of us do not know the origins of the language, how it has changed over the centuries, or its variants around the globe. Today, English is used by more people in India than in the United Kingdom and the United States combined. So, whose English is authoritative and why? I am not saying it is not the Queen's English that is not the standard of our language, I am just pointing out that there is room for discussion and reconsideration.David Crystal has provided an amply illustrated journey through English that begins with considerations of what a model of English might look like and then takes us through a fascinating history of our language from the Old English through today's World English. Part II provides five chapters on the vocabulary and lexicon of English. Part III tackles the knotty problem of English grammar. Part IV discusses spoken and written English, Part V talks about the varieties of using English by region, societal variation, and even personal variation. Part VI talks about learning and studying English. The appendices are full of useful information such as a glossary, references, further reading list, index, and so forth.The book is worth having just for the concise history it provides the English language, but the other discussions are worth knowing about and considering the various points of view the author provides us. As always, it is not necessary to agree with everything provided by a scholar to benefit from what he provides us. Just wrestling with the ideas and clarifying why you disagree with this or that point, or digging deeper to gain a richer understanding than the author provides are certainly worthwhile benefits to be gained.An excellent read and reference for your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language","review":"Buy the 1st Edition and save yourself thirty bucks.It's got the same cover (but a different color), the same number of pages (506 pages) and is as far as I can tell, the exact same book.

Though they used to be ubiquitous in the textbooks of yore, such line drawings are rare nowadays, and I sometimes wonder if the rage to illustrate every facet of the physical Earth in 3-D digital animation has truly increased understanding or confused it.

Necessarilly and irreversibly, the fate of one will be more and more intimately tied to that of the other. The sooner that politicians at every level understand this, the better.

Kaufman and Moss Hart, can be quickly described as a comedy about a madcap family. It is, however, beneath its very funny surface, a meditation on the problems of individuality, conformity, and the ways in which one decides to live one's life.The plot concerns the Vanderhof clan, an extended family who all live in a large house situated somewhere near Columbia University. The house is owned by Grandpa Vanderhof, a man who left his life in commerce some years before and now spends his time collecting snakes, throwing darts, and attending college commencements. His daughter, Penny, writes plays on a typewriter which had been delivered to their home by mistake. Penny's husband is named Paul. Paul manufactures fireworks in the base ment with the help of Mr. DiPinna, a gentlemen who came to deliver something and has stayed on for seven years. Paul and Penny have found time to produce two daughters: Essie, who dances ballet to the xylophone accompaniment of her husband, Ed, and Alice, the sole &quot;normal&quot; member of the family.Alice has become involved with the boss's son, and most of the plot revolves around the complications that arise from the son (Tony) bringing his parents to dinner at the Vanderhofs' one night before the dinner was actually scheduled.The plot, however, is only a small part of what makes this comedy (which ran for more than 800 performances on Broadway in a time when 200 performances was considered a hit) an endlessly fascinating, always enjoyable event.The characters are rich, often loopy, and even eminently sensible. Grandpa Vanderhof is a sage, and lines of his run through my head almost daily as little pieces of wisdom with which I make my way through life. &quot;Life is kind of beautiful,&quot; he says, &quot;if you just let it come to you.&quot; This, in many ways, sums up the theme.It's a play that reads well. From the opening description through to the final line of dialogue it is entertainment, pure and simple. The first act is extraordinary, a mixing of exposition and farce which has rarely, if ever, been equalled. The play as a whole is human, humane, and witty, and wise. It has an almost Taoist quality and a peace at its core which I feel makes it unique. It is a great play which should be seen, read, and experienced at every available opportunity. On top of all this (to quote Woody Allen), it makes me laugh."},{"Title":"You Can't Take It With You: A Play","review":"From this wacky family with pet snakes, fireworks, playwrites, and dancers: you learn to expect anything that doesn't make sence, but what you don't expect is them to make sence!

His family, however, is not so accepting.My high school has just started preparing for our performance of this wonderful play. We have all fallen in love with the script and are eager to perform.

It just percolates with fun from start to finish. It has wonderfully endearing characters and is very indicative of the 1930's America concerns and values. It informs the audience about those times, while teaching a wonderful message of tolerance and the benefits of diversity and individualism. The character of Grandpa espouses a philosophy that is both timely and timeless, and that would benefit all people at all times, if they would just adopt it as a way to live. It is simply to relax and enjoy life. Quit striving for the seemingly important, but actually unimportant things like money, position, unrewarding work for other people. Give up the prejudices and conventional negative assumptions about other people that actually make us unhappy. It seems odd, but is instructive to audiences of today, to know that the play was controversial when written and first produced."},{"Title":"You Can't Take It With You: A Play","review":"I've acted in 2 productions of this play, and directed one.

The chocolate zucchini spice muffins are *not* to be missed, especially if you love zucchini bread and have avoided it because of the fat.

About half the book is about different branches of Christianity and half about Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. There is only brief mention of faith branches that have sprung up in the past two hundred years. The book tries to give an honest summary of what each faith path teaches, what it wants its members to be, and how they should go about being members. It is necessarily simplistic, but its judgment seems sound concerning what it includes and what it omits.This now-out-of-print book impressed me enough that I am using it as a core book in an adult comparative religion class I am teaching at my congregation. We will begin with the descriptions of our own faith (to give us perspective on the likely accuracy of the scholarship) and then move on to other pathways. I recommend this book as a good starting point for understanding both others' beliefs and their practices in America.--Leslie Simons"},{"Title":"My Friends' Beliefs: A Young Reader's Guide to World Religions","review":"I love this little book and I am so glad to find it is still available. As always, shipping was prompt and the book arrived in perfect shape."},{"Title":"Spain: The Root and the Flower","review":"If one is looking for a brief overview of Spanish history, art, and literature then this book might just be what is desired. While it does not go into great depth, it does provide the reader with an overall basis of beginnings of the Spanish peoples, the civilizations that invaded the Iberian pennisula (Visigoths, Romans, Moors), and describes each of the monarchs.In addition, the author does provide an insight into the greater known artists of Spain and some of their more well-known works. He also explains the literary talent that Spain has contributed to the world.The is a good, if not in depth, summary of the events leading up to the Spanish Civil War and what it meant politically to the country. The author covers a good deal of the Franco era, possibly because he was in the country during that time. Still, it provides the reader with a conceputalization of the period. I was a little disappointed that the author did not bring out the less valued parts of Franco's Spain. By reading this book one would think Franco was very nearly a saint. Still, I was thankful for the knowledge of international affairs during the Franco era, and America's reaction (or should I say non-reaction) to it.The last chapter, \\"Spain Today\\", I feel is totally irrelevant. I would recommend not bothering to read it. This book was first written in 1963, and the last update to it was 1984/85. As the author describes \\"Spain Today\\" it is 20 years ago. A lot can, and does, happen in 20 years and I feel this chapter should either be updated or completely left out of the book. If one is reading this to educate themselves on current mores and values in Spain, this is not the chapter to gain that information. Because of the dated material in the final two chapters, which I feel are a waste of a reader's time, I felt I had to give this book 3 stars.If one is looking for a book to provide a brief, easy to read history of Spain, including artists and authors, then this might be a worthy read. If one is looking for the modern day Spain, then this book is not of much use."},{"Title":"Spain: The Root and the Flower","review":"This history book has several things going for it. First, it's eminently readable; the author is a skillful writer who keeps you thinking about the subject matter, not his own style. Second, the reader's interest is doubled by the author's constant interweaving of the development of Spanish character into the history. Thirdly, the author always attempts explanations of the deeper historical processes at work, keeping the (interesting anyway) history from devolving into just descriptions of events, kings, and battles.The middle third of the book is devoted to explicating the Spaniard's eight-hundred year struggle to expel the Moors. Memorably pointing out that the Moors had superior economic strength, superior technology, vastly greater learning (including science, of course), the author stresses the key factors about Spanish character that enabled their ultimate triumph. The situations at almost any time during this period were never simple, of course---sometimes groups of Moors and Christians would be allied against other groups of Moors and Christians, and there would also be periods of relative peace on the penisula.I wish that all history books would use John Crow's book as a model."},{"Title":"Spain: The Root and the Flower","review":"If you are ignorant of Spanish history, this is not the place to start. This is, as the title suggests, an \\"interpretation\\" that assumes a fair amount of previous knowledge. However, if you want to understand why Spanish people are the way they are today, this is the best book I have ever read for that purpose. I am an American who has lived in Spain for 18 years and am married to a Spaniard, and while I don't know if all the facts are correct (as disputed by a previous reviewer), I can say with assurance that the \\"interpretation\\" of those facts rings true. I gave this book to a German friend who has also lived here for many years, and he described reading it as, \\"a light bulb going on in my head\\". Be prepared for a sad story, though; since the glorious medieval times when cities like Cordoba where far more enlightened than any other in Europe, the story of Spain has been one of many missed opportunities. It is true that this book was last updated in 1985, and therefore does not capture present-day Spain.

I see it is available again. It is an excellent book, an excellent introduction to the history, culture, art, thought and people of Spain. It is the kind of history I enjoy reading. I can't stand it when a professor of history writes a book and completely inundates the reader with facts, dates, figures, statistics. This is the history that is life, that breathes.This book has blood, life, beauty in it. You can feel the pulse of the world he writes about it. There is history here but enough to satisfy (and of course the historian scholar will mostly likely scoff at the lack of dates and the author's personal recollections of his times spent in the countryside and cities of Spain - no matter).This book has been a pleasure to read. I looked forward to reading it, to absorbing it in small increments. Crow writes with great sympathy for his subject. He doesn't romanticize his subject, he feels a certain compassion for the Spanish people and their struggle to find a common welfare in government and social policies. He also presents a very approachable glance at the events leading up to the Spanish Civil War.This book is more of a work of literature than a mere text. It reminds me of when books were written for the sake of exploring a world. I avoid history texts because they're often soulless, written by clumsy historians, placing emphasis on the importance of fact over interpretation and not finding a balance between the two.If you want to understand a country and its people beyond the dates and facts and figures, this is the book. This is the book everyone should read before visiting Spain, simply to appreciate their delicate, diverse and deep history. This book has impacted me and I'll most likely not find something as moving and fascinating as this one."},{"Title":"Spain: The Root and the Flower","review":"As someone who is 1/2 Spanish and lived there for five years in La Mancha, I can say that this book is a great book about the Spanish people and the great history that Spain has. While there are some facts that are untrue (the origin of the Iberians for example), the book is an overall joy to read. Crow captures the sorrows and pleasures of Spain and the Spanish people like no other author has before or since. I recommend this book for introductory Spanish history and then read The New Spaniards to pick up where this book left off, the end of the Franco regime up to modern day. Please everyone, if you have the means, come and visit Spain and see for yourself how wonderful this land really is."},{"Title":"Spain: The Root and the Flower","review":"A very detrimental book. Amazingly wrong point of view.To say that \\"the Spaniards spring from an Afro-Semitic race\\" is just a wrong start.To say that the Arabs were in Spain for about 800 years...is not to have any idea about the history of Spain!!. In reality, the Iberians could have been today's Basques, incoming from the Georgia plateau, as of today no one is certain about the origins of the Iberians. The Basque were never touch by the conquest of the Arabs, nor the Galicians, nor the Cantabrians. In Catatonia the Arabs were expel by the Franks by the year 977 (that is 220 years after their incursion in this region). Valencia was liberated by 1248. Only in Granada did the Arabs lived for around 800 years (most of them of Syrian descent, is that north Africa?) . Spain is a country of different ethnicity's, some with direct Celtic ancestry like the Asturs, Galicians and Cantabrians, some like the Catalans with Frankish descendants, and some, like Extremadura or Andalucia from Mediterranean past, and still some like the Basque, with an uncertain past, but a unique history, never subdue neither by Visigoths, nor Romans, nor Arabs.I have a PHD from the University of Salamanca, and I could not disagree more with John A Crow. I found many inaccuracies in this book. If you would like to learn about the true history of Spain, or just learn about the life and culture of Spain be aware of this issue.

And as I said before, this book won't tax anyone's attention span.My biggest complaint, and this will make many of you out there angry, is my own opinion that FDR rated as the 3rd greatest President is a so completely WRONG! Even today when many of us are now aware of his willfull lack of awareness on communism and the soviet threat and his \\"New Deal\\" policies have created more problems than solved onwards to this very day, should have placed him closer to the average zone than the great zone.

Maybe that's my problem, but I don't think that when reading a book like this that a person should be able to tell if the writers are liberal or conservative.

A popular president wasn't necessarily a good president. As far as what each president accomplished during his tenure, sometimes it takes a long time for the policies of a president to catch up with events. Perhaps a president that gets credit (or blame) for an outcome of a situation deserves neither. The outcome may have come about because of the policies of his predecessors.While I found this book interesting, ranking of the presidents for me remains a matter of opinion. The men and women that did the ranking are scholars, journalists, historians and political leaders. Perhaps these people had ther historical facts to make their decisions, perhaps they did not.The most interesting aspect of this book ws the choice of authors for the very short articles about each president. Whether historically accurate or not, it was rather interesting to read the thoughts of Robert Bork about Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This is the most glaring example in the book of authors chosen that were opposite in their political thinking to their presidential subjects.I will admit that this makes for an interesting read, but not solid history. It merely leads to short vignettes that are also short on scholarship.The good read was worth four stars. The mere opinions about the great and not so great was only worth two."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"Taranto provides concise and generally well-written critical biographies of the presidents (Washington to Clinton) written by authorities on each, along with an interesting ranking created by a wide range of academics and other professionals.

The fact that one editor is from the WSJ, one from the Federalist Society, and the introduction by William J. Bennett is kind of a giveaway. The polling they conducted may have been more even handed, because the numerical ranking of Presidents fairly typical. But the essays provided by such conservative icons as Robert Bork, Lynne Cheney, Ken Starr, Peggy Noonan, and Fred Barnes generally go out of their way to point out the flaws in Democratic presidents like FDR, Clinton, Wilson, and pay glowing homage to Republicans like Reagan.

I have read many of Mr. Taranto's WSJ columns and always find his observations excellent and thought-provoking! May I add that Randall Arnold's review of the book here deserves a review of its own. He writes that Mr. Taranto is an &quot;extreme right-winger in the Neo-Conservative camp&quot;--goodness!--could he, perchance, be an extreme left-winger in the Michael Moore camp&quot;? Mr. Arnold continues with a desperate-sounding bid to smear Mr. Taranto's journalistic integrity with references to web sites that make feeble attempts at impartiality themselves. This kind of reaction from the left has become a moral plumb line: It is axiomatic in today's political climate that the more light, truth and integrity that is reflected by authors, pundits or whoever, the more the left will run frantically out of their dark corners to screech their protests--even in reviews on amazon.com. Pity. With that in mind, however, if Mr. Arnold's reaction is typical of the left, you can be sure this book is on to something, perhaps up-ending the leftist revisionist agenda in some particulary unsettling way.

There is not much to be learned about what made a president either great, or a failure from reading this book.Strangely, the 3-4 page vignettes written for each president by the \\"celebrity\\" authors (Maureen Dowd, John McCain, Lynn Cheney, etc.) spend little if any time explaining, or even listing the accomplishments and failures of their subject president. (And, Oh, by the way, what are the credentials of these celebrities for issuing historical analysis and opinion?) The book lists Jefferson as one of the \\"Great\\" presidents - yet read the author's vignette and you would think him one of the worst. This strange pattern extends across the descriptions of most of the presidents. The best part of the book is the appendix where the statistical results from surveys of academics from within the disciplines of Political Science, History and Law are presented.There is inherent illogic in believing that even the first 6, 8 or 10 Presidents can be ranked, without at least a first-order knowledge of all 44. Any serious ranking of presidential achievement requires a breath of knowledge on the topic; a task for historians, political scientists, or legal scholars - not celebrities. There are serious historians who have covered this turf for any who really care. This book is written for the readers who \\"disapprove\\" of that kind of scholarship and demand an answer that they want to hear.I left the plane at IAD and forgot the book in the seat pocket - with no regret at all! I recommend you skip this one, or maybe you will get lucky and find the one on the American Airlines flight between IAD and DFW, even then you will find it a waste of your time, if not your money.

How wrong I was! This book has a serious right-wing bias, so if you're looking for an honest appraisal of US presidents, look elsewhere. For example, Christopher Buckley \\"treats\\" us to a rather smug and condescending account of James Buchanan (rated no 40), ending it with \\"He finally did what most Democratic ex-presidents do - write a book blaming it all on the Republicans.\\" No bias there! Warren Harding, ranked no. 39, on the other hand gets a fairly gentle evaluation from Jeremy Rabkin. This gap between the rankings and the essays abounds throughout the book, and generally breaks down along the lines of Republicans getting marks for good intentions and effort, no matter how lowly they rank, while even successful and highly ranked Democratic presidents get, at best, grudging credit, while their flaws are disected in detail. Clinton, in particular, gets slammed here, while Reagan is gently admonished in two sentences for Iran-Contra (followed by another slap at the Democrats).There are some good interesting essays here, such as John McCain on Ted Roosevelt and the pieces looking at the role of the presidency in general in government affairs.

Presidents are rated based on various (and subjective) criteria by various authors from across the political spectrum (including hot tomato extreme Peggy Nooooonan). It's hard for me to argue with the ratings since I don't know too much about any of these Presidents although I was delighted to see James K. Polk listed alongside Honest Abe and FDR. My personal hero (U.S. Grant) never does too well in these lists and I wish Taranto et al. had focused on drinking skills more and leadership less. Nevertheless, it's a worhty endeavor and the contributions, although subjective, are well rendered and well written. Perhaps not as informative or amusing as Taranto's excellent BoTW, but an impressive tome to take along to the beach with your favorite picture of (ha, ha) Al Gore (never a president, ha ha ha).

A great resource for Americans and everyone in the world...unless you have an agenda that doesn't match with objective reality."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"This is not a good book, nor, unfortunately, even a reliable source of information about the presidents. Its primary purpose is to serve as a conservative counterweight to the presidential rankings published for decades by historian and conservative bugaboo Arthur Schlesinger Jr. Reflecting the ideological tastes of the book's publishers -- the Federalist Society and the Wall Street Journal -- \\"liberal\\" presidents are dutifully demoted (or trashed -- you won't recognize FDR) and \\"conservative\\" presidents are promoted (unless they're George H.W. Bush, who gets the usual shiv for not being Reagan). Schlesinger's rankings unquestionably skew left, reflecting the outlook of the academic historians who dominate his survey sample. But it adds nothing to the scholarship of the presidency to deliberately skew an alternative survey to the right. That, alas, is precisely what \\"Presidential Leadership\\" does.The even less worthy secondary purpose of the book is to further the twin current fetishes of the Angry Right in America -- the deification of Ronald Reagan, who gets \\"near-great\\" status here, and the vilification of Bill Clinton. The chapter on Clinton, by conservative historian Paul Johnson, can be summarized in two words: \\"Clinton LIED!!!\\" Odd, then, to find in it several outright falsehoods, and an entire made-up story about the 42nd president. But then, Clinton always did make conservatives act strangely. In his soul-searching memoir, My Life, Clinton wonders \\"why my adversaries were so consumed with hatred, and so willing to say and do things inconsistent with their professed moral convictions.\\" Good questions! Someone needs to tell the Clinton-haters at the Wall Street Journal that it's time to Move On.Most of the other chapters are exercises in celebrity author solipsism. Peggy Noonan's chapter on JFK is about, well, Peggy Noonan. This will surprise no one. For the foreword, the oleaginous moralist and high-stakes gambler Bill Bennett rearranges a few paragraphs from his previous writings, betting that no one will notice. This is one left-of-center idea the editors apparently support -- recycling.The one chapter that's worth reading is John McCain's moving encomium to Theodore Roosevelt. The rest of \\"Presidential Leadership\\" ends up being nothing more than a work of Angry Right pornography."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"Taranto provides refreshing perspectives and a balanced view of the men who have had the greatest influence in shaping our nation and the world as we have it.

As most Americans are woefully ignorant of history, this includes every president but those of the past few decades or whose faces grace Mount Rushmore, for most people.Now for the negative: Several of the one-star reviews complain of a \\"conservative bias\\" in this book put out by the Wall Street Journal and the Federalist Society (what a shock!). But in reality, the bias towards conservatism is in the classical sense, meaning Big Government. In fact, one could easily say that this book has a liberal bias, if one defines liberalism as loving Big Government. But truthfully, the conservatives have cornered that market in recent years.Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard hypothesized that the founder of the Big Government conservative movement, William F. Buckley, was a CIA operative, charged with the mission of converting the small-government Old Right into a rabidly nationalist, Big Brother-loving horde. Whether or not he worked for the CIA, this was certainly the effect of his work, and it is perfectly exemplified by this ode to statism and presidential \\"greatness\\" by supposed \\"conservatives.\\"These conservatives love a \\"strong president.\\" Not strong as in standing up for the Constitution, but \\"strong\\" as in overriding it when \\"necessary.\\" That's why these \\"conservatives\\" love the most government-aggrandizing and liberty-crushing presidents of all time: Abraham Lincoln, FDR, Theodore Roosevelt, George Washington, and Ronald Reagan all grace the front cover of the book. For those who don't know, George Washington is more responsible than any man in history for liberal judicial activism, since he appointed 100% of the initial federal judiciary (more power than any other president), and he would only appoint nationalist/monarchists who favored the ratifying of the Constitution -- the \\"classical liberal\\" (conservative) judges who were skeptical of the federal government's power under the Constitution were barred from serving. But you won't find that out in this book. Nor will you learn that Ronald Reagan signed the greatest tax increase in U.S. history into law, ballooned the federal deficit, and appointed arch-inflationist Alan Greenspan to the Fed (setting the course for future disasters). In fact, \\"conservative\\" Harvey Mansfield says this: \\"Ronald Reagan was a partisan president. Our greatest presidents, Washington and Lincoln, America's founder and America's savior, were partisan.\\" The notion that the tyrant Lincoln was our nation's \\"savior\\" coming from a \\"conservative\\"? Wow. Harvard really is in trouble if this guy's the opposition.This book really shows the false choice in politics. There are two liberal-statist parties with liberal-statist ideologies who worship the same presidents. \\"Conservative\\" Robert Bork handles the chapter on FDR and he's far from critical. John McCain celebrates Theodore Roosevelt, the original neocon. The truly great presidents are castigated as \\"do-nothings\\" and the most heinous monsters: Polk, Wilson, Truman, Nixon, etc., in addition to those already named, are virtually deified. The appendix provides a ranked list of presidents, and even breaks it down by the partisan affiliation of the respondents. Here's all you need to know: Republicans rank FDR as the fifth best president. Where is the \\"conservative\\" bias in that? The only bias is towards big government and mass murder.This book is valuable if you want to come briefly acquainted with the truly obscure presidents like Chester A. Arthur and Benjamin Harrison without reading more than a few pages. But as an \\"educational tool,\\" it fails completely. It is a propagandist piece for Big Brother."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"Leonard Leo and James Taranto beautifully orchestrated this amazing leaugue of respected authors to compile a book much in need today.

The rank was awarded by a mixed group of 78 liberal and conservative scholars.A numerical score determined the rank. I believe the book arrived at a fair ranking system. This is in contrast to previous rankings by mostly liberal university professors who would rank Reagan average, and Clinton above average. A series of essays about each presidency is written by eminent and distinguished contributors. Every chapter is readable, exciting, and fascinating. Christopher Buckley's essay on James Buchanan was amusing and memorable. Ater reading, you will never forget the ill-suited, fecklesss, hand-wringing bachelor Buchanan. Paul Johnson, a British historian, has written a chapter on Clinton that was right on the money. Jay Winik's essay on Lincoln was good, but his book, April 1865, was superior to the too-brief chapter. Overall this book is a good reference and makes excellent reading.

History buffs are sure to recognize more than just a few of the names listed.It is doubtful that anyone will be in full agreement with the rankings, but the book gives great detail as to the criteria used.

What we have here is a chronological sequence of analyses from Richard Brookhiser's of George Washington until Paul A. Gigot's of George Walker Bush. There is a separate chapter devoted to each of the 43 presidents, all of them written by an expert on the given president. I especially appreciate the reader-friendly checklist of key facts which precedes each of the commentaries. Contributors include Lynne Cheney (on James Madison) and John S. McCain (on Theodore Roosevelt) and both have much of substantial value to say about their subjects, as do all of the others.Presidents are classified within six categories: Great, Near Great, Above Average, Average, Below Average, and Failure. Some rankings surprised me as being too high (e.g. Dwight Eisenhower as Near Great and John Kennedy as Above Average) or too low (e.g. Richard Nixon as Below Average) but such reactions are no doubt indicative of my lack of expertise.

While a few of the essays were written by well-known scholars, the vast majority are authored by people I (and probably you) never heard of.My biggest criticism is that the book lacks a coherent theme. Instead the reader is confronted with a poorly edited collection of essays that bounce around from President to President without any real structure or connecting theme, which you would think is supposed to be &quot;What makes a President great?&quot; The book is a good idea, but the editors seem to have just taken what was given to them and not put much effort into the project. Save your money."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"Every few years, it seems, historians offer a new round of rating US presidents. It's fun to see how contemporary changes affect the ratings' outcome and with this new book, &quot;Presidential Leadership&quot; it's time to take note that James Buchanan has replaced Warren G. Harding as the worst president in the nation's history. Appendix 1, where the comparisons are listed and discussed, is a fresh approach and gives a different tilt as to how presidents are judged. The problem with &quot;Presidential Leadership&quot; is that this section is the only redeeming part of the book.Had the editors stayed with this as their main thrust the book would have been better. But it centers around thumbnail sketches of almost all of our presidents (William Henry Harrison and James A. Garfield are not rated because of the short tenures of their presidencies and George W. Bush because his White House years have not yet been completed) that are vastly incongruant and often irrelevant. On the face of things it might seem to have been a good thing to ask men and women of different political persuasions and backgrounds to write about certain presidents but because there are so many different authors the book lacks cohesiveness. The chapter on John Adams barely mentions his presidency at all and to have Peggy Noonan write about John F. Kennedy is like asking Maureen Dowd to write about George W. Bush.The most disturbing part comes in the sections about presidential leadership. (which follow the mini-biographies) Though of a generally conservative bent they nonetheless were written several months ago before the American public began to turn against our involvement in Iraq. The writing reflects the earlier public support and, in judging Bush at that time, seems no longer relevant. Victor Davis Hanson's view that &quot;George W. Bush made it clear from the outset that the mission of the American military in Iraq during the 2003 war was the removal of Saddam Hussein&quot; is a tenuous statement at best. The administration's reasons for invading kept changing so it was anything but clear.There are some technical mistakes as well (I counted five regarding dates...see John Quincy Adams, Millard Fillmore, Calvin Coolidge and two regarding William McKinley) so it appears this book was hastily edited. What could have been a finer achievement had it been written by one author with a focus on that wonderful Appendix 1 regarding the rating of presidents, it would have been a very good book. Sadly, it is not."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"This book has potential, but unfortunately fails to meet it. This book can?t seem to decide whether it wants to be a popular work or a scholarly one and, as a result, fails at both. Nor can the book seem to decide whether it is a series of essays on the presidents, an analysis of leadership characteristics, or a rating of presidencies. The section devoted to ranking the presidents is the section of the book that merits the most praise. Unfortunately it is far and away the smallest part of the book and the editors relegated it to an appendix. Putting aside the conservative bent of the authored pieces, the essays lack any cohesion ranging from a clear grab for a popular audience in the inclusion of media darling John McCain to scholarly professors like Jeffrey Tulis to seemingly obscure David Rivkin and Mark DeLaquil."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"Most of the analysis in this book is right on the money.

Some very good essays about the Presidents, and also the end sections on Presidential Leadership with the economy, foreign affairs and other specialized issues. My knock on this book would be the aforementioned sections on JFK and FDR, which dwell on their foibles and not enough on their achievements. But as I said, it's the Wall Street Journal? Did you expect canonization? To be fair, the two get their due in the other sections dealing with the Presidency overall. I would say that because each president gets an individual bio, the results are sometimes disappointing. Particularly Madison, which dwells exclusively on his formulation of the Constitution and leaves one paragraph for his presidency, which included the War of 1812. The Nixon section has some good points about whether Nixon actually displayed leadership (albeit tardy) in resigning, though I learned more about Nixon's economic policy and its disastrous effects than I ever learned in many biographies of the man. The Clinton section practically glows with animus. But these examinations are occasionally too specialized where I was hoping for a broader overview. Still a great book."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"This book has been extremely interesting reading. As I expected, a &quot;more&quot; fair and balanced academic attempt in accessing our past Presidents. Although no work could ever be completely unbiased, this attempt makes every effort in addressing the real effects that these men had on our American and World History. The analysis of their data was even cross-checked against those that gave it, i.e potential of liberal or conservative bias. So in my humble opinion, this book is an excellent resourse in learning about our Presidents without the mind numbing propaganda one expects from today's intelectual elites."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"At this politically polarized point in history, NO set of essays edited by James Taranto and Leonard Leo, both well-known conservatives, could ever pray for a favorable review from Publisher's Weekly or any of that ilk (so why did Amazon bother?). None the less, and partly because the opinions of the liberal press have for so long dominated publishing, this collection of essays has much to say -- to most of us, anyway. Of course, the essays about recent, popular presidents are bound to get the most attention -- and generate the most controversy! -- but it's from the less well-known lives that you get the sense of perspective: that our nation will survive this bitter, devisive campaign season as we have others."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"I found this book to be an excellent reference addition. The ranking system is by far the most objective I've seen to date. There are few surprises here since a real attempt was made to balance the biases of liberal/conservative historians, lawyers and political scientists.Using widely different authors for the brief discussion on each president allows the reader to get a different perspective on the historical significance of each president."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"As has been chronicled by previous reviewers, this book's essays have a conservative bias that damage their credibility and that of some of their writers.In particular Robert Bork's essay on FDR is so negative that you wonder if he's still bitter over losing his chance to become a Supreme Court Justice. FDR is ranked third on the list of presidents, on the strength of a relatively balanced panel of judges. But in the essay, Bork paints FDR as a socialist dictator who got lucky to have been brought into a war. You can believe whatever you want to believe about him, but there's a fundamental disconnect when a president ranked third is presented in such a negative light.Likewise, Warren G. Harding is ranked 37th in the survey, but the essay about him is almost entirely positive, save for the cursory mention of the Teapot Dome scandal, and exonerates him from all wrongdoing. So much for the notion of surrounding yourself with good people.I would have prefered that the essays support the rankings better; else what is the point of doing the exercise? The body of work on the American presidents is sweeping and (despite what Bill Bennett says) largely honest. Contributing an additional biased work does nothing for the genre.Nevertheless, I read this book in a weekend and was entertained. The writing is accessible and sheds new light on a number of presidents. Some high points are: a hilarious piece on Franklin Pierce, pointing out the struggles of a public relations executive to promote the 200th anniversary of his birth when Pierce was so universally criticized; John McCain's poignant essay on his hero TR; Jay Winik's thorough personality profile of Lincoln; and Robert Dallek's balanced and thoughtful summation of LBJ. If only more of the authors were true historians such as Dallek and could put their subjects into a more balanced context.In the end, what is politics if not an exercise in back-and-forth debate? In that sense, this work just provides another excuse to crack open a beer and argue who was better than whom, who gets an unfair rap, who is overrated, etc.? I just wish the rankings and the essays didn't deliver such a mixed message.DJ"},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"This is a good book for anyone wanting a nice way to get familiar with our former presidents while only having to read just a few pages of material each.

Carter is ranked very low and Clinton only average; but George H. W. Bush was ALSO ranked only average. George W. was too new in the job to be included in this book; but Reagan received high marks, as even the Democrats now would concede he deserves. It took a decade but finally after his death Democrats have honored him with praise; some former USSR towns have erected statues of him for ending the Cold War. He also reduced a punishingly high top tax rate and did wonders for the economy which fueled the tech successes of the 1990s.I viewed this book as fair. Even Clinton fans should be able to judge his two terms fairly and see that it was a period of \\"treading water\\" (perhaps when we should have been beefing up our military and taking seriously the growing international threats.) Many who are not his fans may say they were too generous to him and nothing substantial was achieved. The cult of personality will, perhaps, have to die out before certain people see him as he was.As for George W. Bush, time will have to tell how he is judged. Certainly, at the moment, many would count him among the best for aggressively addressing what we see as a world-wide existential threat; and of course others don't see it his way and would judge him harshly. There is hardly a middle ground on this one. It will be awhile before this is settled.The book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"This history of our Presidents and their reactions to the challenges of their times teaches us not only about them, but about the history and development of our nation.I found it to be a very valuable book.The fact that each President is profiled by a different author makes it interesting in one way, but leaves one to wonder how the profiles might have read if the subjects and authors had been shuffled differently.I particularly enjoyed James Taranto's piece on Presidential leadership in situations where a President assumes office without winning a popular vote.(Possible Bias Disclaimer: I used to debate Mr. Taranto on a local BBS 'before the Internet' and bought the book because I saw him speak about the subject on TV.)Dean HathawayPhoenix, Arizona"},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"I just finished this book and it was just marginally ok.

Most of the profiles is just history which you can get from any good textbook.

The book gives a shallow coverage of each of the presidents and does not sufficiently analyze the role of the presidency with any objective criteria.

As such it would be a great surprise if the book did not have a conservative slant in its descriptions of our presidents.In point of fact, the editors selected specific authors to write chapters on each president. It is hard to believe that such selections were unbiased. For example, President Clinton is vilified with a venom that was not even present in newspapers during his term of office. That chapter, on Clinton, was authored by Paul Johnson who is described as the author of Art: A New History. An art historian is offered the opportunity of writing the definitive summary of the Clinton presidency? Johnson's extreme attack on Clinton, by the way, is at variance with the votes of 100 historians who rated Clinton as our 24 th best president, an average rating.Even more astonishing is the description of Warren Harding's presidency. In that chapter the author has absolutely no negative comments about Harding and even describes him as \\"the most successful postwar president in American history.\\" Again, this chapter on Harding is at great variance with the summary judgment of 100 historians that Harding was a failure and one of our 4 worst presidents.The appendices of this book, in which the presidents are ranked by professors of history, law, and political science are interesting. The chapters on each president, however, which make up the major part of the book are very distorted and represent the biased viewpoints of each separate author."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"I found this book recommended on some website and the premise sounded interesting so I thought I would read it.

The book attempts a tone of objectivity that I found fatuous under the surface. Taranto's M.O. seems to be to affect the role of disinterested observer while engaged in the thick of political battle. The section on Reagan is pure hagiography, and you get the sense that Taranto and co. would like nothing less than to see the faces of Mt. Rushmore replaced with four Reagans. I would recommend this book only for those who regard presidents with idolatry rather than seeing them in the context of the times in which they lived."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"Obviously since the author decided to survey 78 \\"scholarly\\" and presumably, influential persons, it might seem elementary to do, and compare the survey with a multitude of the American people, but in all fairness, since a President represents, at least, in theory, everyone, the qualities that constitute a good President versus a bad one ought not to reduce itself to the lowest common denominator of accessible knowledge of a particular President's term, but it appears to. As a point of fact, this book might not have been written otherwise, or may be targeted to a certain well defined audience it is hoping to influence with its rationale, and criteria for measuring. Practically speaking, a well drawn survey might be produced that would tend to rate qualities, not popularity or power, sufficiently to define what really does make a good President. The fact that the American people are offered the chance to vote for whomever the scholarly powers are who designate the likely primary winner and run campaigns in that manner is a part of why Americans seem to have lost faith in the political parties to begin with, and in America as a derivative of that method since the President, whomever and however chosen, is often chosen for political interests and political expediency within the parties rather than with a view toward who has the qualities that might make for a good President. Much like measuring apples and oranges, the perspective is narrowed often to produce what some few highly valued persons (who often make or direct the news) emphasize as their personal preference. That may be different from what the American people as a whole see when they view any President. The real question is not which President or what qualities might count, actually, but whose voice counts in choosing those criteria? The people or the Washington establishment? There is quite a difference, it seems."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"After reading some of the rave reviews for this book I was confirmed in my sense that it was not educational in the strict sense. Yes, it has some illuminating material in it, but there are already much superior books on presidents and the presidency that are written by historians whose take on things is that of the scholar interested in weighing things carefully, not by people who turn out to be more partisan spokespersons and axe-grinders than teachers. Reading this book you can sense the unbalance without even knowing who they all are. This feeling that the authors are &quot;getting back at someone&quot; comes through too often. But then the treatment of Clinton in this book, celebrated by some of the reviewers mainly because Paul Johnson really clobbers him, is a dead giveaway: This is not remotely a measured work of history that school kids should use -- they cannot really learn what it is to be rounded American citizens from this. I'm glad I was sorry a friend had purchased it as a gift for me. I'll take the work of a David McCullough or Walter Isaacson over this any day -- authors with high standards whom the cheering five-star-givers probably don't appreciate."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"If you are looking for a studied, objective, serious analysis of presidential leadership, do not buy this book. If you want to see how some scholars will prostitute their intellects, read it with careful interest. Although it disguises itself as one thing -- a work of history and high-minded criticism -- it is quite another. You will find factual inaccuracies, pre-conceived conclusions, falacious and sometimes comical reasoning, and in the end a snapshot of 43 political leaders taken through a purely right-wing filter. Perhaps one illustration will suffice. In the section on George W. Bush, the author recounts his subject grabbing Laura Bush from behind to feign placing her hands in wet cement during a dedication ceremony. To Bush, this was reportedly hilarious, to the author evidence of an admirable measure of self-confidence.

Though I must still doubt the objectivity of any poll that has Ronald Reagan listed as \\"near great\\" when most experts consider him as average, at best.But the rankings make up only two pages, while the bulk of the book is devoted to highly biased essays from a number of well known conservative Republicans, including Lynne Cheney, Ed Meese and Robert Bork. The foreword, which wants to send the academic discipline of history back to the \\"Stone Age,\\" was written by right wing crusader William Bennett, of all people. The essays themselves extol the virtues of not only Reagan and Bush, but past Republican failures such as Cavin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. Meanwhile, they do a hatchet job on great Democratic presidents like FDR and JFK. Anyone who thinks this book is \\"fair and balanced\\" is clearly delusional.

Interesting articles on each president also make this book a worthwhile pickup for anyone. A great book!"},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"Given that the Federalist Society is seen by some as a dark cabal of hyper-right wing lawyers and judges, it's a little disappointing to see that the survey of presidential historians that forms the basis for this book is so decidedly un-revolutionary. By the book's own admission (p. 251), and despite the effort to balance the survey pool between conservatives and liberals, the results of this survey varied hardly at all from one done by the overtly liberal Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in 1996. In fact, if you compare the results of this survey to those of three others (not including Schlesinger's) analyzed by statisticians Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway in the far more interestingReassessing the Presidency : The Rise of the Executive State and the Decline of Freedom(Mises Institute, 2001), you'll see that nearly all surveys of \\"presidential greatness\\" turn out pretty darn similar to one another.Vedder and Gallaway have a theory about this: the historians and other academics surveyed for things like this are dependent on government for their income, and thus have a clear bias in favor of presidents who increase the size, scope, and expense of state power. Presidents who don't flex the muscle of government and generally leave the American people alone, get ranked much lower. Despite (or these days because of?) the conservative leanings of the Federalist Society, the Wall Street Journal, and many of the contributors, the bias here seems to lean the same way.It's too bad the folks who assembled this collection chose to focus on the presidential survey, because the forty-two essays on the individual presidents are the more interesting part of the book. Like the presidents themselves, some of these essays shine, some are disappointing, and quite a number are unremarkable. The decision to have Ken Starr write on Richard Nixon was a stroke of genius, while Peggy Noonan on JFK was up to the high lyrical standards of her Reagan biography. The two best essays, in my opinion, were a fascinating piece by Jeffrey K. Tulis arguing for Andrew Johnson as a far more significant transitional figure in the history of the presidency than he is usually given credit for being, and John O. McGinnis' portrait of Calvin Coolidge as perhaps (my words, not his) the most libertarian president we've ever had. Ari Hoogenboom's look at Rutherford B. Hayes reminded me that Hoogenboom's Hayes biography has been on my to-read list for an awful long time, and made me want to move it up that list somewhat.On the down side, I don't think you need to be a fan of Thomas DiLorenzo and hisThe Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War(although I am) to be a little skeptical of the Christlike-colossus-bestriding-the-earth sort of language with which Jay Winik clothes the holy martyr, Abraham Lincoln, or the breezy ease with which he dismisses Lincoln's trampling of law and Constitution. Similarly disappointing was John McCain's discovery, in a recycled bit from his memoirs, that Theodore Roosevelt was a proto-John McCain (so much for my hope that he would report Mark Twain's conclusion that \\"Theodore, as statesman and politician, is insane and irresponsible\\").Unsurprisingly -- it's typical for books about the presidency -- the descriptions of recent presidents are always more problematic than those of men shrouded in the mists of time. I thought Paul Johnson, for example, did a masterful job dissecting Bill Clinton (the third best essay in the book), but I can imagine it will give his still-active legion of supporters hives. Joshua Muravchik's essay on Jimmy Carter, the smallest and least of our ex-presidents, gives this sanctimonious failure the hiding he deserves.The pages of the Wall Street Journal frequently feature some of the best opinion writing going today, and the quality of that writing is carried over into this book. It doesn't break much new ground, however. Disregard the \\"best and worst\\" survey numbers and just surf the essays."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"This is a great read, rich in depth and detail. The editors have pulled together a series of essays by notables on each of our Presidents, building on an October 2000 survey of 78 scholars in the fields of history, law, and political science.For instance, Solicitor General Theodore Olson writes of William Howard Taft, 27th President March 4, 1909 ? March 4, 1913. Olson provides much in describing the temperament of Taft, as well as characteristics Taft lacked, but in Olson?s view, essential to functioning as an effective Executive in a charged political environment. It?s well written and a compelling portrait of a simple man doing his best for the Nation.Paul Johnson?s treatment of Mr. Clinton is tough, focusing a good deal on his womanizing and his administration?s scandals. Johnson does find the silver lining of Clinton?s Presidency ? that he was so consumed defending himself against accusations, he had little time to spend on policy initiatives or other Executive activities. This meant a long period of economic growth, which might not have been possible had Clinton had the time to ?manage? the economy.There are also topical treatments spanning multiple Presidencies. The best of the four (Presidential Leadership in Economic Policy; During Wartime; and The Judiciary; and After Disputed Elections) is the late Robert Bartley?s exceptional piece on economic policy. He argues persuasively based on the evidence that markets work and Presidents who take a minimalist approach to market interventions enjoy the significant benefits from healthy, productive economies.Individually, these essays provide interesting details and insights into the men leading our Nation. Collectively, it is a powerful historical educational piece ? it surveys the entire range of our Presidents, providing the context of the Presidency over time. In this form, the book is a very good jumping off place for further study into the individual President, the Legislative and Judicial branches, or the time period. History and government teachers can make good use of this as a primary text or background resource for any number of US History subjects.Leaders of any organization can make use of this book. It provides insight into the decision-making process and techniques, successful and unsuccessful of our Chief Executives."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"I was delighted to see the results of the Wall Street Journal/Federalist Society survey on presidential leadership, originally announced in October 2000, published in book form. The survey is a fair and balanced (to borrow a phrase) appraisal of U.S. presidents, representing the opinions of 78 scholars, including 30 historians, 25 political scientists and 23 law professors. The survey sponsors were scrupulous about achieving ideological balance to avoid the &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; orientation that has marked previous surveys.It is interesting to see how viewpoints varied among the three groups of respondents. For example, while Washington ranked #1 overall, Lincoln edged him for top honors among both historians and political scientists. Meanwhile, Wilson (#11 overall) attained top 10 status among political scientists and historians, but managed to rank just 15th among law professors. Not surprising, modern presidents were the most controversial: Reagan (#8 overall) ranked as high as fifth among legal scholars but did not reach the top 10 among historians. Clinton (#24 overall) ranked as high as 20th among historians, but only 27th among political scientists and 28th among law professors.Besides the survey results, the book contains informative profiles of all 43 U.S. presidents. The write-ups are generally sympathetic, but not overly obsequious. I found the profiles of Grant and Hoover more positive than expected. Curiously, the Truman profile fails to mention the Korean War, even when making reference to several elements of Truman's Cold War containment strategy.All in all, &quot;Presidential Leadership&quot; is a worthy addition to any home library, certainly a valuable reference tool for anyone with school-age children and grandchildren."},{"Title":"Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House (Wall Street Journal Book)","review":"This book attempts to compare presidential performances which, because of luck (good and bad), preexisting circumstances, and the passage of time, are fundamentally incommensurable.

It's about time that his undeniably strong war leadership is tempered with his prolongation of the depression. There's plenty of evidence the New Deal, while salving the wounds of economic distress, did nothing to heal it, and only prolonged it. His Treasury Secretary said so!Why are Warren Harding and US Grant always dumped on? Ok, they had a few scandals on their watch, but also tremendous positives about their administrations (Harding's phenomenal fiscal policy kicking off the roaring 20's, and Grant's efforts to repair the damage done by the disastrous Johnson).And get Wilson out of the Near Great category. I'm not ready to lump him with the pre-Civil war stinkers, like Glenn Beck would, but his foreign policy was almost as naive as Jimmy Carter's and even more consequential. He helped set the stage for WWII and even the present middle east mess.Andrew Jackson is overrated...lots of positives (westward expansion, voter enfranchisment), lots of negatives (Indian fighter, killed the economy with the bank). He should be in the middle somewhere, perhaps upper above average. Eisenhower was pretty good, but just below Reagan?? Put him in the above average group and move Reagan (and Truman) to the top of near great. Yes, just ahead of Teddy Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson.John Adams should be in the near great group, why is everyone hard on him? Watch the HBO special and read the David McCullough bio. He was nearly as consequential as Thomas Jefferson.LBJ should be below average, far below JFK, who is above average. One screwed up the economy and the war he ran, the other kicked off 1960s economic boom and recovered nicely from the Bay of Pigs with the Cuban missile crisis. JFK wasn't perfect, he started the public sector unionization that is killing us today. But on balance much better than his veep.In general, there is far too much weight put on scandals, which are really of interest to contemporaries, and too little to the long run implications of sound or sordid foreign, domestic, and especially economic policy. Since I'd weight economic policy, Harding would move into the above average, and Coolidge into the near great categories.

Each essay is written by a different author. All of this makes for meaty, well-written prose.My favorite essay is Paul Johnson, the famous British historian on Bill Clinton. The incident Johnson relates in an Engish pub with Clinton going full steam is priceless.I also learned much about our more obscure presidents such as Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Benjamin Harrison, and John Tyler.Although Franklin D. Roosevelt ranked third in the survey, he comes across as not having accomplished very much.Peggy Noonan does a good job on JFK, describing his charm as well as the astounding amount of medication the man was ingesting.Calvin Cooldige was more complicated than the image we have been given of him.Altogether this book is an excellent read and history lesson all in one."},{"Title":"Ensaladas: Salads, Spanish-Language Edition (Coleccion Williams-Sonoma) (Spanish Edition)","review":"\`Williams-Sonoma Salad' with recipes and text by Georgeanne Brennan, under the general editorship of Williams-Sonoma founder, Chuck Williams is an excellent little, inexpensive hardcover book all about salads. Unlike some other grandly titled books on salads, this little volume does two big things right for a salads only book.For starters, it's first chapter of recipes has seven (7) recipes for major, classic salads, almost all of which originated in French, Italian, or American cuisines. These are:Caesar SaladCobb SaladPotato SaladSalade NicoiseCelery Root RemouladeInsalata CapreseAmbrosiaThe second \`big' thing it gets right is that the next four chapters cover salads appropriate to each of the four seasons. While your average megamart has virtually all fruits and vegetables throughout the year, there are still some important seasonal considerations that make a difference in the quality or cost of a salad. For example, asparagus and artichokes are far cheaper in the spring than at any other time of the year; tomatoes and fresh corn are at their very best if obtained locally in the summer; apples and pears are freshest in the fall, and citrus is most abundant and least expensive in the winter.The last chapter of recipes gives us seven (7) \`picnic' salads whose taste improves over time or which are easily assembled at the last minute \`on site'. They are also very good for extended periods without refrigeration as they contain no mayonnaise or any other uncooked or semi-cooked eggs.There is a non-recipe chapter at the end on \`Salad Basics' covering the primary ingredients and techniques including vinaigrettes, creamy dressings, types of greens, and varieties of other ingredients. It is beyond me why this chapter is put at the back of the book when it is something you should read before embarking on the recipes or on a career of ad libbing salad making.The only other quirk of the book's organization is that the two potato salad recipes are in two different chapters, one in the classics and one in the summer chapter. Otherwise, in general, this is a very well thought out book organization, making up for the slightly pricy $16.95 list price for 43 recipes. We are also well served by the fact that there is a full-page color snapshot of the results of each and every completed recipe. For a glossy book like this, one would feel cheated if there were pics of only half the recipes.With all this good stuff going for it, I did find some things that were just a little off. In the recipes for the classic salads, I found at least four instructions that concerned me. The first two were where poaching chicken and cooking hard-boiled eggs were done at substantially longer times than what I have found to be necessary from both other authoritative recipes and from my own experience. I was inclined to think that the author was just trying to be careful with microbes, until I read the Caesar Salad recipe, where a totally raw egg was used to make the dressing. In all the very best recipes for Caesar Salad, the raw egg is \`coddled' before adding it to the dressing. That is, it is cooked in boiling water for about a minute to kill off any microbeasties. I was also just a little concerned with the amount of fresh garlic used in the Caesar salad, and the method by which it was added. It called for first making the toasted croutons, then rubbing the fresh garlic onto the sides of all those little cubes. This seems to be a relatively tiresome method, which could easily be replaced by toasting the bread slices, rubbing on the garlic, then cutting the toast into little cubes. And even better and quite traditional technique is to rub the cut garlic into the wooden salad bowl before mixing the dressing.All in all, this is a better salad book than others I have seen and it is a very good first salad book."},{"Title":"Pedlock & Sons;: A novel","review":"Very readable story of a Jewish immigrant family in the United States, starting at the time of the Civil War.

I would like to try more of Cathy Mc David's books."},{"Title":"Just Kate (Mira)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Linda Lael Miller and she wrote this book back in 1989 and this is a release that I had not read. LLM has definitely honed her skills as an author since then, but this is still a great read. I was equally pleased with Cathy McDavid and look forward to exploring her other books.Just Kate.... is a quick paced romance about a young woman who in a short span of time is let down by both her fiance and her controlling father. So she decides to take a trip to Australia to find comfort in a visit with her deceased sister's son, Gil. While she very much enjoys her time with her nephew, the comfort she craves comes from her brother-in-law Sean whom she has secretly loved since she first laid eyes on him. Sean takes Kate camping in the Outback and to visit his friends at a remote Australian sheep station and is pleased to discover while his late wife Abby hated everything about his life, Kate enjoyed every moment. Sean, falling deeper in love with Kate realizes he just may have married the wrong sister and asks her to stay. Though hesitant, Kate starts making plans and all is going well until an unintentional breach of trust and her father's interfering break the bonds of love and passion. Full of sex, romance and the angst of trying to get over the past, Just Kate is a satisfying read.His Only Wife... was a really enjoyable book and had you rooting for the leads... Aubrey and Gage, from start to finish. Having been married for six weeks when they were younger, amid pressure from her father, Aubrey leaves Gage behind to pursue her career in nursing. It's ten years later and Aubrey returns to take care of her ailing grandmother, only to discover that her love for Gage burns as brightly as ever. Gage, who never stopped loving Aubrey even after the divorce, is now a successful rancher and a Hotshots Wilderness fire fighter who vows that this time, he won't let her get away. Between career troubles and parental pressure, Aubrey and Gage have to decide what's important and how hard they are willing to fight for a life together. There are some interesting scenes with the firefighters that gives you a glimpse of what a tough and dangerous job they have.

There appears to be a severe shortage of good authors which are published for release in Australia. I picked up this book, Just Kate, hoping to find another author along the lines of my favourites, Sandra Brown, Elizabeth Lowell and Linda Howard. This book was quite well written and I did enjoy it, but I found it quite offensive (being Australian myself) how the hero, Sean, used our slang. I have never come across an Australian guy who calls his girl &quot;Sheila&quot; as an endearment. Basically I found the book a good read, with plenty of sex, but not the sexual tension that makes you ache while reading it. I'll read other books by LLM, I hope it was just the Australian references that disappointed me with this book."},{"Title":"Just Kate (Mira)","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer! If an Aussie male called me a sheila I would consider it to be a HUGE insult. As much as I love to read the romance novels written by the very clever American authors, I have yet to find one that can write accurately about Australia, esp. regarding the correct usage of our slang.

While the world says the way to success is through self-promotion, God says the way to success is to honor and glorify Him. The world says to exalt yourself, God says to humble yourself. These are just a couple of differences.The authors maintain that the ways of God are:1. Love2. Sovereign3. Holy4. True5. EternalThe book is around 180 pages - about 160 dedicated to the book itself and around 20 pages of a group discussion guide.As with other Blackaby titles, the title is well-written and contains many Bible verses relevant to the particular chapter.Read and enjoy and be encouraged to seek and follow God's ways instead of your own or that of the world.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"Lengthy and well written, but a disappointment in theme. In the era that this book was originally published, the general theme may have been better received as a true pioneer in women's literature; however, I had a hard time sympathizing with a woman who seemed to take no joy in her life at all. Are we supposed to associate her manly ability to work and take joy in the cultivation of fields, her inability to forgive a mistake made by her husband, her inability to cope with her children or to deal with anything in the sphere of the periodic woman's world as virtue? I found what was described as a precocious child to grow into a selfish adult who shuns her responsibilities. &quot;Judith&quot; does not exhibit resourcefulness and by mid to end of the book wallows in her plight by acting out and against her family and neighbors. She is not a likeable character: she is self centered. I do not consider this a prototype of the Feminist novel, because I believe feminism is only defined by positive action toward the betterment of the woman's experience. Judith does nothing to better her earthly stead. She's a jerk."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"I've been savouring the wordcrafting of Edith Summers Kelley, which makes this story rich with scenery and characters. Their stories of rural North Carolina, and farmwork brought back memories of stories shared by my grandparents. I don't always understand the main character's actions, but it was a different time, a different place. I also thought that this was a first work by a new author (silly me!) and was looking forward to the next book. What a surprise to find that it was originally published in 1923 and is a reissue. I believe that Kelley died in 1956 - what a loss for us!"},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"Weeds is another book I think belongs on required literature lists. The story goes from about the turn of the century to after the first world war. If it's about rural Kentucky or the urban world we live in now it's still about people and their deepest feelings when times are tough. Perhaps our young women have grown used to our times. If they looked back to the heroine in Weeds they might be able to better stand up for themselves.Edith Summers Kelley was Upton Sinclair's secretary. Her descriptions of the environment she lived in are vivid and beautiful and/or brutal."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"I liked this book. It's the story of a woman whose potential and vision for her life far exceed what her life circumstances will ever allow her to achieve, how she struggles against it and how she makes peace with it, at least in part. It was very realistic in that it didn't end with the main character miraculously overcoming all of the limiting circumstances of her life. That would have made for an unbelievable ending to this story that wouldn't have taught the reader anything important.This is not a happy story. We'd all like to think that we can achieve whatever we're capable of, no matter the circumstances, if we never stop trying. The hard fact of this story is that most of us really are limited in significant ways by our intellect and the circumstances of our birth.Regardless of that reality, the story shows how the characters find moments of grace and beauty in their lives in the small ways that sustain them. It's a great story about truly accepting the things one will never be able to change and focusing on the parts of your life that can give you contentment and peace.It's a good story worth reading."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"I read this book over thirty years ago and have thought about it off and on ever since. It has that kind of impact. I just now ordered it and can't wait for it to arrive. (Thank you, oh internet!) I remember being captivated almost immediately by the story of a young girl just a little bit smarter and more alive to the possibilities of the world around her than her kinfolk were -- there's a scene in which she and other kids her age are dancing around and shrieking next to a barn, and something -- sunset? a bonfire? -- throws their elongated shadows against the side of the barn. Such an amazing, powerful image. Sadly -- and this just rang so true -- being a little bit smarter was not enough to save her.

I found it in the local library, but would purchase the book to make it part of my permanent collection. It paints the difficult life of Kentucky tobacco farmers on a beautiful and colorful canvas in a true picture of Americana."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"\\"Weeds\\" was written in 1923 and was found and republished in 1982 by an enlightened reader who recognised it for the brilliant piece of American fiction that it is. Kelley was one of the members of New York's Greenwich Village set, at the turn of the 20th century. She later married and lived with her husband on a series of tobacco farms in Kentucky which is how she has such intimate, first hand knowledge of this life. The book is of such a descriptive style of prose that it's breathtaking but, having said that, it's also one of the most depressing stories that I've ever read, describing the life of Judy Pettinger, the daughter of a tenant tobacco farmer and later married to a tobacco farmer. The life is relentlessly hard, with the same grinding work, day after day and the ever present fear of crop failure or of the price dropping below that which would enable them to continue. The yearly arrival of babies, poor sickly little specimens because of the poor nutrition of their parents, exacerbates the frustration of a life of endless work and poverty, and I'm sure WAS the life of these poor drudges in those days. I now desperately need a really cheerful book to read to get over the blues!"},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Judy's story is told with humanity but without sentimentality. Never has life in rural Kentucky been more searingly told. Judy's transition from tomboy is real, and our own lives' disappointments and grinds seem frivilous next to the struggles these people live with daily. However toward the end of the book, one character tells what he loves about his life and where he lives, and the beauty of the area comes alive. The smells and sounds of rural living."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"When I originally read this book, I thought it was a book about nothing and very depressing, but reflecting on it I have changed my mind.

Both depressing and enlightening."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"While there were times when this book was difficult to read, it's unflinching look at rural poverty -- and at life for women before birth control, central heat, running water, electricity, supermarkets, washing machines, etc. -- was powerful and incredibly moving. You don't always like or understand Judith, but you feel deeply for her and her family. If you are interested in learning how people lived -- really lived, day to day -- in early 20th century Appalachia, you must read this book. I loved it."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"This book was very moving to me as I thought backon my mother's role in my life growing up on afarm.Though notnear as stark orhard as the main character's, Judith, it was fairlybrutal at times. I love my mother more for havingexperienced this book."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"This book is the story of a woman making the transition from being a precocious girl-child to becoming an adult who accepts her life as best she can, in a setting that is, in itself limiting in the extreme and in a society that, as a whole, proscribes a woman's place in very narrow terms.Judy is not like the others around her, who have become inbreed and passively accepting of the life that has been handed them. The women around her take to housework while Judy wants to work outdoors. Judy has a lively, adventuresome spirit that leads her to do and try things that are not considered acceptable/normal behavior for a woman. A lot of the book is working to show you how terribly ill-suited Judy is for the world in which she was born. Sometimes she seems terribly self-involved and selfish--especially in the sections where she rejects her role as a mother.Rejecting motherhood is taboo, even today. People don't want to hear that motherhood isn't a glorious embraceable reality that all women ache for. Well it is one of those terrible secrets: Not everything about motherhood is wonderful--a lot of it is a drag and Kelley lets Judy, her character, lose in this taboo territory. Likewise Judy has an affair-to ease her boredom and she doesn't know if she really loves her husband, who seems to be a pretty nice guy--even if he's not the brightest bulb.Again and again Judith chaffs against the definitions that the society provides for her--but she has NO IDEA who she really wants to be -- or what she wants to do. Yes, she is talented (for instance, she paints abstract pictures when people what her to paint pretty pictures of houses and other familiar things that she had no interest in making reproduction of.)Overall she is bored, bored, bored. That seems plausible to me. So--for all of those who don't exactly fit in and who are bored with the world they find themselves in (most of us?? In some ways??) - but who don't know what it is they are struggling for or against--Rebels Without Causes --here is an early fictional character to look at. What might she have done to bring her potential to flower? There is a question!Finally, I want to say that I recently read \\"Tobacco Road\\", by Erskin Caldwell--a book which some say is a classic. I say it is a mean-spirited, dog of a book spouting nothing but arrogance and making rural tobacco workers the butt of a bad joke. Compare this book to that--and you realize that tobacco workers were complex, interesting people, living in conditions that narrowed their horizons--but that doesn't make them stupid, as Caldwell's book suggests. This book is an excellent antidote to Caldwell--a much, much better story and much, much richer picture of rural life.I wouldn't read this book again--but I am glad I read it once. I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone--you have to rather love literature to like this kind of book. It is beautifully written--Kelley is a craftswomen with words-so it is lovely to read--but it is slow in many places--and the story isn't something that you pulls you into it. It is a good book but it is not for everyone"},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"WEEDS tells the story of poor tenant farmers in rural Kentucky with great power and simplicity. The book's unique greatness comes from it's portayal of this life through the eyes of a spirited and analytic young woman. Set in a ten year period just around World War I, we watch this creative and resilient woman face the overwhelming challenges of rural life. The story is filled with the details of the everyday drudgery and hopelessness of a poor farmer's wife. Though dark, it always has a glimmer of hope and resoluteness that is inspiring. A wonderful novel for women's studies and people interested in rural sociology. Originally written in 1923, Weeds is a classic work that sheds light on both these fields."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"I also purchased this book thinking it was recently written. Edith Summers Kelley was definitley before her time. I loved the characters and found it to be a fast read. This book is up there with the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"Given what I had heard about this book before I read it I expected a monotonous novel about a mean-spirited woman to leave me prematurely thinking, &quot;What am I gonna read next?&quot; Happily, I found myself the opposite.First of all, I love Ms. Kelley's style of bold writing. She doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to supplying detail. So many writers of the time before it became &quot;hip&quot; to try and shock readers with unspeakable situations were often obscure and obtuse about such things, but details about &quot;the knitting needle,&quot; and premarital sex not only surprised me, but allowed me to continue the flow of the story without having to try and decipher what was going on through ten pages of puzzle pieces.And as to the character of Judith, I agree she has some flaws (as is human) but I don't think she is evil. She makes mistakes, but that keeps her interesting. However, she's not without some redemption. For example, when she is contemplating the possible death of her child, she doesn't wish it for hope of a lighter load of work for herself, she wishes only that they escape the life she knows is destined for the child. And in the end she prays for their life. I would call that a mother's love to want true happiness for that child.The conclusion is a rather painful one. It makes sense and follows the timbre of the story, but leaves one with a sadness that things should have turned out better for her. On the outset, it seems to be almost a relief, but there is a great sense of loss which left me with a broken heart. This is definately a great read."},{"Title":"Weeds (Crosscurrents/Modern fiction)","review":"To catagorize this material as 'social realism' as some have done is a mistake.

Who needs to know that fault lines, trauma, \\"points of no return,\\" happen regardless of whether one's an international spy, or facing down a murder charge, or simply growing \\"out of the nest\\"?The dryly-informative \\"NOTE\\" that precedes this collection (\\"There comes a moment in the life of every individual when reality must be faced.\\") entices the reader, as of that moment of text-encountering, to become one who can accept this truism: in reality, as practiced, however, the masses of humanity, every last one of us, face \\"ships\\" that could \\"sail without us\\" -- and the litany of excuses that our society may-or-may-not be \\"blameable\\" for help obscure this everyday direness.Sound wordy? Too bad. There's no guarantee that any one individual, thus born, WON'T end up playing \\"a parody of who they once were, once they're past age 28,\\" as \\"S-T-E-V-E With a Van\\" posits in Richard Linklater's debut, the genre- and generation-defining \\"Slacker\\" -- but this, hardly, is the sort of thing one picks up \\"beach reading\\" (to compliment du Maurier's savvy & narrative fluidness, in this case) to confront!Well, nobody lives nowhere real if our Entertainment ain't our Art, too, since we're apt to become a bit too adept at \\"splitting the difference,\\" trading off false choices, rather than eating one's meals whole -- as you can, here.(Did I mention the tales range from hilarious to heartbreaking to suspenseful, exhibiting a real mastery of Short Story Form, and, in one, case, providing an exemplary understanding of the \\"real\\" machinations that underlie nation-states' intriques, the most worthy of Machiavelli one'll come across before Pynchon's \\"V.\\", published four years later?)Well ... now, I did!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------PLUS: If this excerpt doesn't clue you in to the sort of whimsy-and-seriousness an adoring daughter could pick about the acting trade up from having a famous stage actor as her beloved father ... I don't know what would!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Barry Jeans -- when his fans did not call him Barry and wanted a bigger word for him -- was known as the Menace. The Menace, in movie language, and especially among women, means a heart throb, a lover, someone with wide shoulders and no hips. A Menace does not have long lashes or a profile; he is always ugly, generally with a crooked nose and if possible a scar; his voice is deep; and he does not say much. When he does speak, the script-writers give him short, terse snaps of dialogue, phrases like \\"Lady, take care!\\" or \\"Break it up!\\" or even just \\"Maybe.\\" The expression on the ugly face has to be deadpan and give nothing away, so that sudden death or a woman's passion leave it unmoved. Only the muscle at the side of the lean jaw tautens, and then the fans know that Barry is either going to hit someone, and hit him hard, or stagger in a torn shirt through a jungle carrying on his back a man who hates him, or lie in an open boat after shipwreck with the woman he loves but is far too honorable to touch.It was May [his wife] who pushed Barry into having an audition for the Lonsdale play that was going into production in New York at the end of the twenties. It was a small part, and the chap the producer and Lonsdale wanted had appendicitis at the last moment, so they were obliged to take Barry. After that he never looked back. It's a curious thing how actors who fail to make the grade in London go over big in New York. Like ne'er-do-wells in Australia. A fellow slips away below decks, and the next thing you hear is that he has a million sheep on a ranch the size of Cornwall.It was the women who went for Barry. They adored the way he stood there on the stage, in his English clothes, with his hands clenched. It was strange it had meant so little to the women in England.When the Lonsdale comedy came off, Barry was offered a part in an American play, and although it folded quickly he hit the headlines. He hadn't a great deal to do, but he had to bring the curtain down in the second act with the words \\"Scram, baby, scram!\\" and the way he said it did something to the American Women. Barry's future was assured, and he had an offer from Hollywood the opening night. May told him to accept, and three weeks later they were on the Coast. Barry Jeans the Menace.In a matter of months his face was more familiar to women all over the world than that of their own husbands. And the husbands did not mind. In a sense, it was sort of a compliment if a girl married a chap at all. It must mean that the chap she married was a super-Barry. His hat -- a trilby with a dent in it -- his cigarette, never hanging from his lips but always held between his fingers, the little scar on the side of the temple that suggested a brush with a rhino or a knife thrown in a Shanghai joint (in fact he had slipped on the breakwater at Herne Bay when he was not looking) -- it all exercised a subtle and indefinable magic which left every other movie star standing at the post. But above all it was the mouth, firm and decisive above that square jaw with the cleft in the chin, which maddened millions. It never relaxed, it never smiled, it never, in fact, did anything. That was what got them. Women were weary of close-ups of their favourite stars lips to lips in a passionate embrace, and Barry did not give them that. Instead, he turned away. Or stared over the girl's shoulder. Or just murmured the word \\"You!\\" and nothing else. Then there would be a fade-out into the next scene, and the fans would be left writhing.Barry Jeans the Menace really started the fashion that became so prevalent between the two wars on both side of the Atlantic of men and women not making love at all. What was vulgarly called \\"making a pass\\" was no longer done. If a fellow took a girl home in his car, and drew up in front of her house, there was no question of parking and staying put for half an hour. Barry Jeans never did that. He pulled the trilby hat still further over his eyes, his mouth became more stern, and he said something like \\"Quit . . . \\" The next thing you saw was the girl on the front doorstep, fitting a key in the lock and crying, and Barry Jeans banking the corner in his Cadillac. It was the same on mountains or in the desert. If Barry Jeans got himself on the edge of a crevasse in the Andes or the Alps, or lay beside a mud-pool oasis with three palm trees five hundred miles from the nearest Legion outpost, the woman of course by his side, he never touched her. He did not even have a rope to help her out of the crevasse, or a tin mug to scoop up the dirty water from the pool. He just said \\"This is it,\\" and either walked away or died.It was his manner that made the Menace popular with men as well as with women. You did not have to take trouble any more. You did not have to kiss your girl. You did not have to make love. And all that tedious business of booking a table at a restaurant, and seeing the headwater, and ordering the wine, became completely vieux jeu. Barry Jeans never did that. He walked into any place with his woman, and he just held up one finger, and everyone seemed to know what he meant. Waiters fell over themselves, guests already seated were told there wasn't a table, and the Menace sat down with his woman watching him, waved the menu aside, and uttered the one word \\"Clams.\\"New names, pop singers, and the teen-age craze made no difference to the Menace. His fame was too deeply graven into the hearts of all men and women over thirty-five. They had been born and bred in the faith of Barry Jeans, and they would die in the faith of Barry Jeans. Besides, the kids liked him too. The greying hair -- only at the temples, mind -- and the slightest suspicion of a bag under the eye, and that line on the jaw, it did the same thing to the daughters that it had done to the mothers twenty years before; it made them dream. Who wanted to be kissed by the boy next door or the young man round the block when you sit alone in perfect darkness and have Barry Jeans say \\"Someday\\" out of a wide screen, and turn his back on you, and go? The inflection of his voice, the meaning he put into it, and never a glint in the eye, never a smile. Just the word \\"Someday.\\" Whew![from \\"The Menace\\" (1959) by Dapne du Maurier, as collected in \\"The Breaking Point\\"]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTEThere comes a moment in the life of every individual when reality must be faced. When this happens, it is as though a link between emotion and reason is stretched to the limit of endurance, and sometimes snaps.

Well-sized, it's ready-to-hand, organized dictionary style under the topics of Cultural Theory which range across all disciplines, made here easily accessible to the reader in a tightly knit format. The book has an extensive bibliography and index. A must for every scholar's personal library (even those expert in the field will find it useful as a teaching tool - great for handouts), and a go-to-first guide for anyone who needs to understand the often complex, elusive, gnomic terminology of the post-modern intellectual environment. The explanations are concise, yet not thin. The book as a whole exhibits a fine sense or proportion and judgement."},{"Title":"Cultural Theory: The Key Concepts (Routledge Key Guides)","review":"As best I can tell, cultural theory aims to understand culture (or cultures) in an interdisciplinary way, drawing mainly on philosophy and the human sciences (especially sociology and anthropology), with perhaps a few ideas of its own thrown in to produce a fairly eclectic mix.This book surveys cultural theory by describing more than 350 key concepts from the field, with the length of each entry typically being intermediate to a dictionary and encyclopedia. Examples of the concepts are absence, authority, civic humanism, counterculture, dramaturgical model, feudalism, ideological state apparatus, libertarianism, myth, philosophy of language, propoganda, ritual, sociobiology, syntagm, and youth culture.As you can see, the concepts range from the familiar to the highly esoteric. Since the book has two editors and thirteen contributors, the quality of the entries likewise varies somewhat, and you will occasionally encounter some which are too unclear, although most are quite good and some are outstanding.I read this book from cover to cover, and the net effect for me was that it was enlightening, often to the extent of being a page turner, which is saying a lot for a book organized alphabetically. The book would, of course, also be useful to look up concepts on an as-needed basis, as well as for randomly dipping into.Highly recommended to people with an interest in relatively highbrow intellectual sort of stuff."},{"Title":"Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation: Resolving the Controversy","review":"As a parent, children's karate instructor, and 10 yr veteran sales compensation consultant, I found this book to be both enlightening and a bit of \\"preaching to the choir.\\" Given my profession and hobby, I can't help but concur that rewards are valuable motivating tools. I've seen it in practical action too many times to give much credence to the theory that all rewards are harmful.The key value that Cameron and Pierce bring to the debate in this book is the understanding of the ways in which rewards can be harmful (e.g., when the reward actually carries the message of failure) and what is required to make them successful. If you are dealing with children, an important take away from the book is that \\"tangible rewards that are offered for mastery, effort, and meeting challenges have positive effects on performance, perceived competence, and interest\\" (build the rewards in small increments, allowing the child to build success upon success) and for employees, a key take away is to \\"tie material incentives to specific, reasonable and attainable standards of performance.\\"I do have a couple critiques to make, one stylistic and one substantive. First the substantive. Cameron and Pierce discuss the outcome of testing which shows \\"when rewards are given for exceeding the performance level of others, the results show a significant positive effect on free choice\\" [Free Choice for the studies is the observable proxy for intrinsic motivation]. What this does not address is the impact on those who were \\"exceeded.\\" I've worked with companies who use K-performer or other forced ranking systems to calculate incentive payouts and universally find these systems to be more harmful than motivational when used for the PRIMARY calculation of incentive pay. They create feelings of inadequacy and resentment in those who are ranked below the standard and are generally destructive of any team atmosphere which may be desired. The only time these systems can be beneficial is when used for a short-term SPIFF (contest type program of short duration with modest payout relative to the core incentive plan), but then care must be taken not to create so much emphasis on the SPIFF that the main incentive program is subverted in importance to your employees. Cameron and Pierce talk elsewhere about the harmful effect of a less than maximum award, as this carries the message of failure rather than success, but they do not directly tie this conclusion with the observation that for one party to exceed the performance of others, there must be others who are being given the message of failure. This is every manager's challenge - to develop an incentive or reward program that creates an atmosphere of success and healthy competition for as many employees as possible, and to prevent the very real consequences of a negative reward system (tuning out, giving up, rebellion) on those who are not receiving 100% payout.The stylistic critique is that much of the book is redundant and it could have been quite a bit shorter. Cameron and Pierce repeat the same findings and conclusions throughout the book. A single summary at the end would have sufficed. Anyone looking primarily for practical advice on using rewards to enhance motivation should go right to Chapter 11: The Effective Use of Rewards in Everyday Life.For any manager who may have been caught unawares by an employee who cites studies challenging the effectiveness of rewards, or by any parent dealing with a school system who either over-uses, under-uses, or misuses rewards this book is a helpful introduction to the debate that has been raging for the last 40 years."},{"Title":"Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation: Resolving the Controversy","review":"If you are looking for an accurate review of the evidence relating to the relationship between motivation and reward, Cameron and Pierce's book will in all likelihood be of little value to you. Why is this? The quick answer is that the research is poorly done, employing many dubious practices. How do I come to this judgment? I base it on a number of sources.First comes a study by leading researchers in the area of rewards and motivation (Deci et al, in the Review of Educational Research, Spring 2001, Vol 71, No 1, pp 1-27 and pp.43-51), the arguments of Cameron and Pierce that form the basis for this book were found to (a) use inappropriate control groups, (b) misclassify studies (unsurprisingly, this is typically to the benefit of C&P;'s arguments), (c) use improper measures of intrinsic motivation, (d) include irrelevant experimental conditions and exclude relevant ones, (e) collapsed significantly different experimental conditions without proper moderation (pp. 44). In short, C&P; manipulate the data in unacceptable ways to give the best possible result for their side of the argument, contrary to some long established, scientifically sanctioned, practices.As the Deci et al paper notes, C&P; presented an analysis of data that was \\"scientifically inappropriate\\" (p.46) at best, and of questionable motivation at worst; that is, C&P; have an apparent inability to learn from their mistakes, or to correct misleading or incorrect statements in their work, even though their work has been subject to very convincing (and in my view, conclusive) criticism over a period of years. In my view, work that massages the data, choosing studies if they support their already formed conclusions and rejecting studies if they go against them, works that ignore large chunks of the argument of researchers who have argued for different conclusions are of little value if you are looking for the facts of the effect of rewards on intrinsic motivation.Don't take my word for it - have a look for yourself. All of this is documented in a series of debates in The Psychological Bulletin, vol 125, No 6, pp 627-668 for Deci et al's original review, and pp. 692-700 for their critiques of the C&P; methodology. Even more importantly, for those looking for more than just name-calling between rival researchers, is the fact that the Deci critiques were corroborated by a team of researchers from Stanford University, again, in The Psychological Bulletin, 1999, Vol 125, No 6, 669-676. In a study that supported the findings of Deci et al, from above, the Stanford team stated unequivocally that the method used by C&P;- produces \\"simplistic overall conclusions\\" (p.674),- \\"tells us essentially nothing about the phenomenon of the actual literature under review [the literature of the effect of rewards on intrinsic motivation, that is]\\" (p.672),- that it is precisely the use of this inappropriate method that \\"produced the anomalous conclusion that negative effects of extrinsic rewards are merely a myth\\" (pp.672-673).Hardly a ringing endorsement of the Cameron and Pierce work. If you want an appropriate reference, you should probably start with the Deci et al Review of Educational Research article above. I found it useful and clearly written. I'd advise you to give the Cameron and Pierce's work a miss: from its selective and scientifically inappropriate massaging of the data right down to its conclusions that fly in the face of the \\"very robust\\" findings of an intrinsic motivation literature that is now \\"very large\\" (from the Deci critique of C&P;, p.698, above), it is a seriously misleading body of writing that is likely to confuse even a sophisticated reader."},{"Title":"Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation: Resolving the Controversy","review":"This book presents study findings and provides an in-depth discussion on the question of whether or not extrinsic rewards negatively affect intrinsic motivation. The authors conclude, on the basis of over 100 experimental investigations, that there is no support to the claim that rewards produce significant and substantial decreases in people's intrinsic interest. They also conclude that rewards can be used to enhance performance and motivation. This is a scholarly work of outstanding quality and clearly addresses a controversy that, to this day, divides people in management. As a management consultant specializing in compensation, I highly recommend this book to every practitioner, academic and author/expert who would rid the world of pay for performance; I hope they have the intrinsic motivation to read it with an open mind-if so, I believe they will be rewarded for their effort."},{"Title":"Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation: Resolving the Controversy","review":"This work continues to misuse science toward the authors belief perseverence.

But would those social problems exist without information technology? Mostly likely yes. These phenomena are not new, they predate the advent of the Information Age (the World Wide Web and mass adoption of internet is a post-1990 phenomenon). Multinatioal organizations (or globalization) have been around for many decades, same goes for the North-South polical economic paradigm.

My reaction however is one that is culturally-induced as a midwestern woman. This was a beautiful story. It seems as if Sayuri (the main character) told it and wrote it herself. Golden did a fabulous job!I was impressed by the portrayal of Sayuri and her life as one of the most esteemed geishas of her time. Golden disspelled the myths and mental images that I possessed about geishas and made the life almost seem, well, class in some sense. In a very odd, erotic way nonetheless!I was pleased to see that Sayuri's true dreams and feelings were granted respect in the book. It's hard to imagine the life of a geisha determined on behalf of one person by others. As we look at other cultures and ways of life, perhaps as Americans we should not be so quick to judge what is right or wrong in other cultures.

Her memoirs chronicle her life as young girl sold into a Geisha's life by her poor widowed father. In a stoic, frank way, she narrates the challenges, the desperation, the achievements, the abuse, the secrets, and the cruelty that she experiences as she becomes one of Japan's most prominent Geisha.While the milieu of the novel is often described in luxuriously striking detail, the characters are never really developed to a great extent throughout the novel. Despite the fact that the plot is charged with emotional intensity, the main characters remain fundamentally cardboard-like and stereotypical - \\"the antagonist\\", \\"the protagonist\\", \\"the love interest\\", and \\"the benefactor\\" are painfully obvious and often 2-dimensional and insipid.Granted, Golden's attention to detail and research into the life of a Geisha is apparent from the outset of the novel. However, the actual writing of the account, while at times enjoyably metaphoric, was mediocre at best.Nevertheless, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", in spite of its many flaws and clich&eacute;s, remains a weekend page-turner that gives us a westernized glimpse into the disquieting life of a Geisha, often shrouded in mystery."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved the book from the minute I started the first page!!! A poignant sensitive story told in a masterful way. I felt like I had lived their lives thru this book. I am a child of a Japanese mother and American Father (Amerasian) and spent my early childhood growing up in Tokyo. I remember twice actually seeing a geisha walk down the streets of Tokyo and how onlookers would just hush their voices and stop and stare at their gentle beauty and their gracefullness as they proceeded down the street. I will never forget that image and that was the image that I saw when I read this book...."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story of the book developed just as well as the main character Chiyo developed from a young naive girl to a alluring woman.Chiyo originally came from a small fishing village, living with her parents and older sister, Satsu. Chiyo's mother grew very ill and was dying, Chiyo and Satsu were then sent away to the city where Chiyo had to learn to become a geisha, and Satsu winded up as a prostitute.Chiyo and Satsu were sent to separate places, the night they were supposed to have ran away together, Chiyo tried to sneak out by climbing the rooftops but fell and thus failed. Satsu ran away, leaving Chiyo behind. From then on, Chiyo had to learn to live a challenging dramatic life on her own.Memoirs of a Geisha touched me in so many ways and taught me so much about Japanese traditions at the same time. It is somewhat of a fairy tale though written realistically, with countless twists."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I consider this to be one of the best books I have ever read! This is my second copy and I just loved the story and the story-telling!I recommend! Buy it!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a story about how a young girl from a poor town grows up to be a world renound Japanesse geisha. The novel traces her sturggles, hardships and the loss of her family at an early age. It is a book which accuarately describes how hard it is to become a geisha.I recommend this book to any reader who is interested in looking into the distict life of a Japaneese geisha. I liked thos book because of the smooth writing style of Arthur Golden, and the colorful way he describes how hard it is to be a woman in Japan during the 1920's."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This story was a beautiful one. I bought the audio book and while it took some time to get used to the American accent trying to do an Asian accent...the story progressed beautifully. I almost did not listen to the book after hearing the narrator's horrible voice but I endured and it was great.If you know nothing about the life of a geisha this book educates you without banging you over the head with a lot of terms and useless information.Hard to believe it was written by a man, the woman's perspective was captured quite nicely by Mr. Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book! Yes, it's long and the print is tiny and the pages are thin, but the story is remarkable in its authenticity. Arthur Golden did a wonderful job of seeing the world as a Japanese geisha would in the early 1900s. The characters came alive in my mind. I actually find myself thinking of Sayuri (Chiyo), Hatsumomo and Pumpkin and wondering about their lives. I learned so much about Japanese culture as well."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"BUT this is a wonderful book. I was hesitant, almost bought it, didn't, almost bought it again, and then a friend came to me saying, &quot;I know this does not seem like the type of book we usually read, but I loved it!&quot; I took it from her and devoured it in one night. A week or so later my cousin called. She said,&quot;I just read this wonderful book! I know the title sounds like something you might not be interested in but . . .&quot; Yes, it was 'Memoirs of a Geisha'. Don't hesitate. Buy it. This is a great story, well written and historically informative. I am so happy I read it. It is now on the list of my all time favorite reads."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Mr. Golden's ability to express the main character is a very intriguing and imaginative writing style. I have to admit that I would not have read this book if I was not required to find a contemperary author and read a bood of his. I found this book in my school library, I thought that it seemed different. I was right, only after reading a short section of the book, I had been rapped up into the text. This book and the way that it is handcrafted does not seem like a ficticious novel, but I feel as if I was sitting down next to this old geisha as she weaved her past history into a story in the fabric of my mind. Mr. Golden's understanding of Japanese history is a great amount of help in this book, giving it a more dimentional character and story all together. One can truly feel and empathize with the young Chiyo-chan. I believe that this book is not buting a false light on the cultural tradition of these Japanese Geishas, but rather holds them up because of some of the adversities that they have had to but up with through out their life. I wish that my writing could be as descriptive and lush as Mr. Golden's. All I say is Bravo for capturing a dying form of life as we continue to move on through time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's been a few years since I've read this one, but it's made a lasting impression on me. I enjoyed the text's effective manner of getting me lost into the story and the conflicts of the characters. I laughed and cried and kept reading. It's a facinating story of a lost antiquity. After I finish reading Gone With the Wind to my daughter, I will likely read this one to her next."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought Memoirs of a GEisha was an excellent book. The characters were very complex, the plot was intense and because of the suspense I had to finish it. Each chapter kept me enthralled, I wanted to know what happened next and I wanted to know what happened to the characters in the end. I also learned a few events that geisha girls had to go through that I didn't know before. I'd say it was four stars out if five. The complexity of the story was what held me but the suspense is what drove me to finishing the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book, &quot; Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is an extremely good book. The story takes yoiu to the streets of Gion Japan, where you are thrust into a different culture. The book gives vivid detail to teh surroundings and pinpoints true facts on teh Geisha's lifestyle. Teh book may be fiction but as you read it becaomes real. &quot;Memoirs&quot; is an outstanding book. I recommend this book to any one who is open to learning avout different cultures."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found Memoirs of a Geisha a brilliantly written book. The characters intertwine perfectly together which made it enjoyable to reas as I learned about the geishas of the Japanese culture. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading a story about the life of a geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is the ultimate page turner, there was no way I ever wanted to put this book down and I was up almost all night reading it. I found all of the descriptions of the customs and life of the Geisha extremely interesting, and the love story so beautiful. I was so captivated in the story of Chiyo/Suyuri that I needed to know what was going to happen next, but I was sorry when it had to end. This has to be one of the best books I have ever read and I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It certainly made me feel fortunate that I had value to my parents and that they had the money to keep me. To put children out as merchandise to be marketed and profited upon by everyone in their path is certainly another place and time to most of us. But it is valuable to all of us to know what lies behind our own safety nets. Very well written and researched, it brought to light what has been a mysterious sisterhood for centuries. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I saw the trailer for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and was intrigued. I had never considered a geisha before, but I think the cultivation of a \\"companion\\" caught my attention. I thought, this must be based on a book. I read the book over a weekend.The book was well written and informative, the only drawback is that some descriptions had too much text and seemed a bit longwinded - it is realistic if someone is telling their story, but distracting while reading.Not only did the book provide more than a glimpse into the culture of geishas, it also placed that culture in the larger societal context - pre and post war and alternative occupations.The book could've easily been an autobiography - I assume the character types and setting are historically accurate."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Dear reader;I do recommend this novel, it is very engaging and if you are like me you will find it challenging to your conscience, and let's be thankful that it is not a real story, I cried more than laughed while reading this novel because of the events that shaped the life of each character. It is a powerful novel.At first I could not get myself to make a decision whether Geishas are talented hard working artist, or hard working prostitutes? but that how we get to recognize perspectives and respect other cultures; I came to respect the Geishas for their great talents and their abilities to live such lives..and I guess we should live like that \\"go with the flow\\" !I liked the author's style of writing, it is easy to follow and easy to understand, although it contains foreign vocabulary, you find yourself understanding what they imply to.I had fun reading it while riding the BART train every day and evening ;)Enjoy"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is DEFINATELY a book that people will never forget. Arthur Golden describes the story in such great detail it's hard to miss, or misunderstand anything that he says. The book is fictional, but it's based on true events from tons of research that he's done on geisha in Japan. The whole setting is in Japan and it gives readers that are from a different country a very different insight into life there.The protagonist in the story, a.k.a. Sayuri/Chiyo, encounters many different problems throughout the story. All of which vary in many different solutions. This enables the reader to try and decide which decision Sayuri will make, which lets the reader have fun!!I thought the book was really interesting because it changes your views on some things. For example: If you knew what a geisha was before you read the book, then this book would probably change your views about how they really are. The book is also described very vividly with lots of details, important and/or insignificant.Whether the details are insignificant, or you are wrong about the decision Sayuri might make, it doesn't matter. Because either way, this book is just one of those books that you just won't want to put down!!- Alyssa Honey, 14Napa, California"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was completely engaging. The life of a Geisha is fascinating and the author writes in a way to keep you turning page after page without so much as a breath (or any sleep for that matter!). I would recommend it to anyone, especially before the movie comes out in December."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book so much - I read it in under a week. I could not put it down. It has been years (either prior to this book or after it) since I've seen another book that I felt this strongly about. I therefore don't rank many books at 5 stars anymore."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of the best books I've read this year. I couldn't put it down once I started. The tale is tragic yet hopeful. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I've always been fascinated with Japanese culture. I am surprised I didn't come across this book sooner.This is beautiful beginning insight into the world of the geisha. Though fictional, it really opens someone's eyes to the life. I know it has inspired me to do further research.It is beautifully written. Very elegant and flowing. Definitely a book that keeps you turning the pages.I loved it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book to be completely captivating. It provides a look into a lifestyle about which little is known and less is understood by Westerners (hence the common misconception that geishas are prostitutes). I loved the main characters, hated their enemies, and was enthralled by the lifestyle, even though at times I also was dismayed by some of the characters' actions. I love Asian cultures (there is a substantial Asian population in my corner of the world), so I found this book irresistable. I also found the writing style to be pleasant to read, and the character and plot development were more than adequate to keep me turning those pages. The end came altogether too soon - I wanted more! I'm hoping Arthur Golden will write more novels soon, especially if they provide such enticing glimpses of Asian cultures."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the best book I've read so far. I'm excited to see the film version in December. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone. From learning some of Japan's culture and traditions to the unique love story between Sayuri and the Chairman, simply the best!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is an intricately told life story that encompasses beauty, sadness, struggle, love, desire, unjustice, and happiness.It is a story of a young girl left with no choices in her life when she is left an orphan and is forced into a life as a geisha. She takes you through her bitter-sweet journey of becoming a form of grace and beauty, a talented entertainer, and a charmer and pleaser of men.It opens the curtains of a hidden,exotic world that you will want to visit again and again. Memoirs of a Geisha is a poetic story that leaves you feeling enchanted."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I read this book, I had no preconceptions whatsoever about the content or the author. The author states in the preface that he interviewed a geisha and wrote a book about her life. I interpreted that as &quot;I found out some stuff about geishas and wrote a fictional tale based on that information&quot;. With the fallout that apparently resulted from this book (ie. that Arthur Golden really did interview a geisha and misrepresented her life), it's probably best to read Memoirs of a Geisha with an open mind.Having said all that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am not particularly fascinated with Japanese culture but I loved the descriptions of the life of Sayuri. Parts of it made me gasp aloud. It's rare for me to find a novel such a delightful novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Excellent book. Is the noveled version of Golden's research. He interviewed a geisha who later wrote her own book: Geisha: A Lifeby Mineko Iwasaki, both are great, one real, the other novelated. I do not recommend Liza Dalby's book, though, as it does not make sense unless you read these two first."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is a wonderful research..featuring it's lush and graphic story line, and beautiful dialog. But &quot;Memoirs Of A Geisha&quot; is more than just good research, it's a fantastic, personnel, and (Not to mention romantic) exotic look in to this amazing art of Geisha, where eight year old girls are sold for prostitution if they can't make it as a Geisha, and young girls are sold for their &quot;Mizzuage&quot; if they do. (Which is basicallya ceremony where the young apprentice Geisha becomes a non-virgin.) When you are nearing the last pages, you wish it would never end, and tell yourself it couldn't... But all good things come to an end. And I guarantee, this book is very good."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Allowing for the authors creativity, this book is a brilliant telling of Chio's life in her own words. I was immediately drawn into her story, beginning in her tipsey house. Such a way with words, provoking such lively imagery. This really is one of the best books I've read. If you like listening to audio books too, I highly recommend listening to the unabridged version of this book that is available at audible.com (an amazon.com affiliate). I'm not a sales person for them! It was such fun to have it read to me by an author who made me feel like I was sitting at Chio's feet as she told me her life story. Whether you listen or read, however, you'll come away from this experience feeling a bit changed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I've just finished my second time reading this book and I can't believe that it was better this time.The visual imagery is just stunning and his writing evokes emotion written as a woman coming of age in 1930's Japan. She learns through hard work how to make something of herself after much adversity.This book brings tears to your eyes and stirs your emotions. I'll be reading this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished reading this tale of woe. All I can truly say is that after reading this story of the life of one woman, I have newfound respect for women of the past who were born into the Asian culture.What is it that we think about when we hear the word Geisha? Prostitute? Street Walker? Yes? No? Well, what I thought about Geishas' was not at all what I found to be true. While a Geishas' main role in life is to essentially please and serve her man, that does not automatically entail that she will end up sleeping with him. On the contrary, that could not be farther from the truth.This is the spellbinding tale of Sayuri, a child who was taken from her home, and sold to the highest bidder. This is her sad tale of injustice that happened to a woman, who had the misfortune of being born into poverty. Living day to day with her continuous monotony of school, lessons and self preparation of the life they were \\"destined\\" to lead.I cannot convey the sorrow I felt for Sayuri, Pumpkin, Mameha and the others, at the role they were meant to play. Never an honest feeling or moment. For who in this impoverished country could really care about the needs and wants of a simple little girl. Who was she, but a painted face, exquisitely dressed, to serve and to satisfy Man.This is a tale of FICTION. Reviewers who are bashing the author, obviously do not understand that the story is ficticious. As to whether or not something like this could have happened, is very believable and quite plausible. Japan of the past, is not the Japan, we know now."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After living in and around Kyoto for two years, I felt connected to this story and its characters more so than most other books. The author's beautiful prose took me back to a time and place of hanging lanterns, reverent temples, and of course, geisha. This book does a good job of showing that geisha are not prostitutes, like so many people think, but are rather dignified entertainers. I also think the author depicts the attitude of so many Japanese men - an attitude that, until recently, women have put up with. I really enjoyed this book. It's brilliantly written, full of interesting and lifelike characters, and meangingful. Zehi, yonde mite kudasai."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This fictional memoir (so detailed, I thought it actually happened for the longest time) shows a sweeping view of a Japanese girl's rise into Gion society as a geisha. From humble beginings as a fisherman's daughter, Sayuri is sold into geisha-training at a tender age. After an encounter with the illustrious Chairman as a child, she dedicates the rest of her life as a geisha to eventually snagging the only man she ever dreamt about. This turns out to be much more difficult than expected when the chairman's college Nobu--disfigured in the first world war--seems much more interested in her.The real beauty of this narrative lies in the brilliant detail of a geisha's every day life: the multicolored kimonos, the hairstyles, the tea ceremonies...all are fascinating. Far more disturbing is the downward spiral of Sayuri's motives to win the affection of the chairman, even after he refuses to notice her for over fifteen years. I found the ending sour, asking &quot;and the point was...?&quot; I wonder, are all women destined to a similar fate?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book has now been added to my 'favorites' list. The story is about a young girl who is sold by her ailing parents to geisha house. She is soon taken in by a very popular geisha to learn what is to be expected of her. Sayuri soon becomes a very popular geisha within the Gion teahouses. She meets may different men who all have different ideas for her. The final 100 pages are probably the best. Just when you think Sayuri will finally be happy, the opposite happens. I promise you that you will absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"WOW..what can I say except that is one of the best books I have ever read and will instantly jump to the top of my \\"universal recomendation\\" list. This book is gernre defining and all encomapassing in it's appeal. I would highly recommend it to anyone..(although due to sexual contect it might not be appropriate for those under 18).The story is simple as it follows the protagonist as she rises to Geisha hall of fame. Along the way she has to deal with her modest upbrining, pesky rivals, unwanted suitors, wars and unreturned love.After noticing that this book had 2000! other reviews I spent a few minutes trying to think of something original to say. I realized I loved this book so much because it frequently reminded me of John Krakauer's Into Thin Air. Just like ITA dives into the history, logistics and buisiness aspect of climbing Everest, this book delves into everything Geisha and it's the most fascinating of subjects. Golden's structure is a great asset as he intermingles characterization, plot and Geisha knowledge into the perfect literary web. We come to understand that the Geisha lifestyle is an almost neccesarry and meticuously beautifull means of glorified prostitution.Golden's writing is phenomanal as he constructs Sayuri with a perfect Japanese stream of consciousness. Her dialougue seems exquisitely real and foreign in the most satisfying and peacefull way often associated with Japaneese perspective. By the end I often forgot this was a work of fiction and not an actual autobiography/memior. The supporting cast is phenomonal and endearing as well.Bottom Line: This book has really turned into a modern day classic over the past 5 years. It's really a must read for all and I can't wait to go be dissapointed by the movie!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The novel \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is one of the most beautifully written books I have read in my life. I found my self constantly rushing home to once again delve into the adventures of the geisha, Nitta Sayuri.

It really makes it seem more realistic. I love the ease that I can listen to this unabridged book on CD's. (I prefer that to the unabridged editions.) This way I can listen to the whole story. I am able to listen to the interesting story and still do my quilting or other sewing project. I can also still participate in a review of the book with others.I also like the ease with which I could purchase the audio book.

I was taken back by the language and the way it flowed so beautifully. I was unable to put this book down and many a night I found myself reading an extra chapter in hopes that it would be less exciting than the former. It certainly belongs in any book club anywhere. The story of this geisha is absolutely phenomenal. There is absolutely nothing missing from this book, and you are left satisfied but still wanting more.While this book is fiction, you know the story has its truth. There is a strong voilition behind this story and it rings through. I could not wait to see the movie the minute I finished the last sentence. I raced out to see it the day it opened in my hometown, and it was amazing.

I felt the book:a) failed to create a believeable female protagonistb) did seem too Western (even with my extreme lack of familiarity with Japanese culture)c) seemed as if Golden is trying to demonstrate his knowledge of the culture by stuffing in as many details of Japanese culture as possible. BORING! Props to you, Golden.All in all, I would recommed catching the movie for this one. I am usually a devout \\"novel is always better\\" critic, but this time I feel the movie portrayed the characters in Sayuri's life with personality (with Mameha being very kind and Hatsumomo being terribly nasty) and evoked some genuine emotion for Sayuri's dilemma (which I severely lacked in the novel)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Truly one of the worst books ever written.

Its plot is so ingeniously constructed and well-paced that it reads like an epic poem.

Would highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"So, I admit it. I don't get it. The reviews and the hype surrounding this novel suggest that Arthur Golden had pulled off a miraculous feat in imagining this tale of a geisha. The obvious implication being that a white American male can't penetrate the mind of an Oriental woman. Well, first of all, why? This is what writers do, create vibrant worlds to transport their readers to. Is it because of the inscrutable Asian thing? For one thing, how do we know his portrayal is even accurate? Second, what has he done here that authors like James Clavell haven't done before? Or putting the shoe on the other foot, remember the way that Kazuo Ishiguro captured the world of a British butler in Remains of the Day?So you're left with the story of a prostitute. I know, I know, it's all gussied up and there are all these rituals involved. It's supposedly an art. But at the point where you auction off your virginity, you're hooking. And of course she's likable, we all know every hooker has a heart of gold.It's all mildly diverting, but nothing to get too worked up over."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book captured my attention right from the start.

I donot care for this type of book but because I am in a book club and this is what they chose I read it with a fairly open mind and was right on all accounts. The subject matter was hard for me to take because I donot believe that any culture should subcome to anyones specific wishes without voicing their opinions if they have any. I do tho understand that this is the Japanese culture, not the American way. I'm sure that alot of people liked the book but I as an individual did NOT."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden opens the door to the sophisticated yet elusive underworld that is the life of the geisha. The novel is written with eloquence that following the progression of the life of the main character, Sayuri, was a thrill in itself. Sayuri perceives the world and describes her feelings and reactions to people and events around her as if she was possessed by the spirits of the natural world. There are many allusions and references to events in the realm of nature that many of us may imagine but in reality are barely perceptible. Thanks to her physical attributes that met the stringent requirements for an apprentice in the competitive geisha society of pre-war Kyoto, she was literally uprooted from her family and forced to live by Gion's rules, or else... One can only wonder what emotional pain lingers in the hearts and minds of many of these women who have taken this path not by choice, despite the image they project of a highly sophisticated and cultured entertainer, almost symbolic of the pinnacle of Japan's cultural evolution over the centuries."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm totally amazed at Memoirs of a Geisha. I wouldn'tnormally get a book like it but my friend and I are takingturns to pick a book out of the BBC's top One Hundred andthis month it's Athur Goldens.This intricate, beautiful novel kept me totally spellboundthroughout its 420 closely printed pages. I'm SO happy tohave chosen it and read it. It's a little tough emotionallyin the way The Grapes Of Wrath is or perhaps Clan of theCave Bear but there are many feel-good moments in amongstthe feel-bad moments. And you can't but help to appreciatethe beauty of some of the characters despite their customssometimes seeming so alien. The cleverness of the plotpulls you along also and now that I've finished it I know Iwill be hunting on the net, hungry for more info on Geishas.I'm amazed I hadn't even heard of this book untilrecently."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur golden creates a stunning, enriching and soul inspiring peice of art, which will captivate not only your mind, but your whole world. This book inspired me to write a play based on the geisha girl. It offered me the ingredients to write a play which bound the geisha girl to real life.'Memoirs of a geisha' had me entwined with the main characters. I myself being a white english girl, I found surprisingly, I could relate to these characters who were created, astonishingly by an american male.It is an absolute joy to read, you'll find yourself devouring every last page."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"and beautifully written. This book deserves all the accolades that it has received. So sad in parts that it made me angry, but the heroine was a survivor. It reads like an autobiography, and it's difficult to believe that it was written by a man. Truly a wonderful novel, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel is a true work of art. Memoirs of a Geisha drips with one of the most exquisite languages ever written. Arthur S. Golden's take on the Geisha culture before the Second World War is insightful and thought provoking. I couldn't put this book down. It had me from the opening of the first chapter! Various critics have complained that the author uses cliche descriptions to illustrate the Japanese government -- I couldn't disagree more! I was able to discover many things I hadn't known about the aforementioned government. This is one of the most intelligent novels I've read. And I urge everyone to give this wonderful and literary work a whirl."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was captured by this book from the start. It took me only 2 days to read it! I had to know it all at once. I recommend it for all without any doubts. This is a novel that refuses to stay closed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was beautifully written. From the very beginning you just fall in love with the main character. This inside look at the life of Geisha is heart wrenching. These poor women were brought through so many emotional and difficult experiences, and yet Sayuri manages to get through all of it and remain a whole person. Characters are weaved throughout the book -- such as the Chairman, and you find yourself wondering what the motives are behind each of them, what they are made of. As Sayuri grows from a child, to an intelligent and clever woman you cannot help but to be drawn to her, and to her life experiences. Although Japanese culture has changed since this book was written to a larger degree, it is fascinating to learn about what it once was. An amazing book that everyone should read. I cannot wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is filled with such detail, both historical and emotional, that I had to stop periodically and remind myself that it is fiction. Also, Golden's ability to tell the story from the standpoint of a Japanese woman in the early 20th Century is quite remarkable. He really makes you feel Sayuri's pleasure, pain and personal growth. An excellent read!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is really a difficult one to rate. I'd probably give it 4.5 stars if that were an option. The book was a fairly quick read, I was able to get caught up in the story, and the payoff was satisfying. But maybe a little too satisfying. Chiyo undergoes a dramatic transformation and that's all well and good, but things end up wrapped neatly into a little package and I'm not sure if I liked that or not. The book was superbly written, and very dramatic, but I just felt like I wanted more. Maybe the book was a little too short. Maybe the climax wasn't high enough and maybe there was not enough time to absorb the climax and conclusion. There seem to be some points when the author said to himself &quot;I'll just skip over that part&quot; although he fleshed out most everything. This is a great book and came in handy when sumo wrestling was on ESPN at TGIFridays. I'm amazed at how much I pick up on the little details in books of this nature.And that is one thing that Golden does extremely well. He minds the details. But not to the point where you feel like he's bashing you over the head with it. Although I fear I may turn into my father and start walking around the house saying the three Japanese words I know (it happens everytime he reads Shogun), I did enjoy the cultural knowledge I gained through this book. I would be interested to know how much of this story could be true. Although I know the character is fiction, I wonder how much could have been based on reality.Well, either way, the book is a wonderful read. You really feel for Chiyo throughout her life and embrace her character. I truly felt her despair, her love, and her joy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was extremely interesting, especially for a person who knows little of the world around them. It portrays a life that I believe few could imagine, giving insight to a world beyond the typical day experience. This book has the abilty to transport a reader into another time, and into another place. At the same time it is about coming into womanhood (to which any woman can relate)in a world where women are viewed as property rather than as individual persons. It is very well written (which really shocked me, due to linguistic and cultural differences). From my limited understanding of the cultural differences, details are well translated into Americanized ideology while maintaining the flavor of this foreign, but at the same time, familiar, story about coming of age. Anyone interested in global awareness must put this on their &quot;Must Read&quot; list, but I do forewarn you that you may become so intrigued that a trip to Japan, in attempt to find a traditional tea house, may be in order!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is an excellent book. Golden really sees into the heart of things, where there are truths that apply to all people of every time and place. Even though these &quot;memoirs&quot; were written by a man about a girl in a culture and era very different from mine, I was amazed to find that, as I read, I was holding the glass up to myself, and looking into my own heart and mind. This book is elegant and moving. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I finished this book in a few days, sneaking a read whenever/wherever I could. Fascinating portrayal of a geisha's life(which I had misconceived in the past). Sayuri is a strong, warm, hopeful girl--- a romantic, yet a realist, too. (I was so immersed in the book and her character, I craved Japanese food, and it doesn't really appeal to me!)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha blew me away. Arthur Golden writes beautifully, and every word captivates your mind. I enjoyed the beginning, climax, and ending. I thought it was suberbly written. The only disapointment was knowing that this story was fictitious and the Geisha Sayuri, in fact, never existed. Read this book, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The first 3/4 of this book was a spellbinding mix of intersting characters,intriguing relationships, and cultural eye-openers. However, the author lost credibility as the book spiraled toward a contrived ending, seemingly written for the silver screen. The thrown-together ending, filled with atypical behaviors from the characters, didn't do justice to the clever formality with which the characters carried themselves through the books first 300 or so pages. Though what would have been a five-star-rating was pulled down by this decline in quality, I am, nonetheless, glad I took the journey."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I started reading this book, I realized how much it touched reality.. the real life, the real culture, the real ideas and poeple of a country over a period of time.This is a part romance, part historical novel that is very enjoyable. The writer has certinaly got great skills, for he's got a real good imagination, and an even better way of capturing the way children think and picture things in their everyday life."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"i have always had great respect for the Japanese culture. It appears very rigid and suffocating -especially for women. But we always truimph with our innate and intuitive abilities. This is apparent in Geisha which I did enjoy and yet it was obvious at several passages,this was written by a male.I felt he missed the mark-not by much but still."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As I read the introduction, I thought to myself- &quot;Great! Just another biography...&quot; But then, once I started, I couldn't put the book down! It was so interesting to be able to experience the life of a geisha from the very beginning. Little naive Chiyo to a beautiful, sensible Sayuri... It's almost unbelievable how Arthur S. Golden was able to write in such a way that you could SEE everything as you read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"So many reviews of this book! Such strong emotions it has evoked in the readers! But, alas, not for me. My Japanese mother-in-law is 10 years younger than Sayuri, and she can tell much truer stories of life in post and pre-war stories of Japan. Although this book was entertaining, two things kept bothering me. First, the dialect was not spoken in the manner of a Japanese immigrent such as my husband's parents. The Japanese women I know who have gone through the war have a certain way of speaking English that was totally not captured in this novel. Second, I kept thinking, if Sayuri was so clever to become the number one geisha the book purports her to be, why could she not outsmart Mother, Auntie, and the awful geisha's she was forced to deal with. I could never come to the point where I believed why this &quot;blue-eyed&quot; Japanese woman was so superior to her cohorts, that was never fully explained. The only thing that seemed to set her apart was her blue/grey eyes.....and in the pre-war Japanese culture, I'm afraid that perhaps would not be considered a sign of beauty, but of freakishness. So, my recommendation is, read the book if you are looking for a quick and entertaining read, but don't assume it truly captures the culture of the time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed the book because of it's ability to transport me into another world but when I landed home I could not recall any lasting impression or reflections other than &quot;Gee,it would have been nice to have a real Geisha&quot;. (not really..,ok,really...I'm a bad man) The set up was full of intrigue,the details rich and authentic but the finale just sort of collapsed like a dead moose on the road.I wonder if Quint Tarantino should direct the movie rather than Spielburg..,nah,some books are better off left as books...or manuscripts for that matter."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Though Mr. Golden constructs a reasonably good story, he fails to energize his characters with any purpose or spirit. Sayuri's love, the driving force of the book itself and the only reason I kept reading, remains unexplained and unfulfilled right to the end. Why did she love him so much? Why did she love him at all?! Why did her rival geisha hate her so much? Sayuri herself is an unintended dichotomy. The other characters say repeatedly what a clever, witty woman she is, but the reader only sees an undecisive and pliable girl whose ultimate fate is a matter of dumb luck, not will. In an odd turn, I hope that the film version is better than book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I first read this book when it came out in hardcover and I think I've reread it at least 5 times since. It's just so rich and absorbing. I know the ending is a little sappy, but I love it anyway. Awesome book, safe gift to buy for almost anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"\\"What did you think life as a Geisha would be like? We don't become Geisha so our lives will be satisfying; we become Geisha because we have no choice.\\" A well know Geisha in the book said this. The book takes place in a small town of Gion in Japan. The main character's name is Chyio. After she becomes a Geisha, her name is changes to Sayuri. She goes through an interesting life in Japan. She has a sister and they were taken from their home and brought to Gion. Her sister was taken and brought to a disgusting place. Sayuri was taken to an okiya. When the sisters found each other, they were so happy and they decided to run away. That was one of the stupid descions that Sayuri made. She got hurt and the owner of the okiya stopped her lessons. So Sayuri was destined to live a life as a maid. The owner would not put any more money or trust into her. Any hope Sayuri had at becoming a Geisha or doing anything with her life was almost gone. When she was on an errand one day, Sayuri ran into the man who would change her life forever. The Chairman.I think my favorite part is the part where Sayuri gets her revenge on Hatsimono. Hatsimono was a monster toward Sayuri and she hated her guts. Sayuri never did anything to Hatsimono, but she was treated horribly. For years, Sayuri felt like a mouse, and Hatsimono was the cat. She would get pushed around and chased like a mouse and cat story. But after Sayuri and another Geisha ruin Hatsimono's night, Hatsimono is not popular anymore and people get scared of her. Her career is over and Sayuri is now the cat. Guess who the mouse is now?The main idea in this story is, Things might not always work out how you want, or ever imagined, but sometimes they are better. Sayuri never expected of becoming a Geisha. She had never even heard of a Geisha until she came to Gion. But she grew up to become one of the most popular Geisha in Gion.I love this book. I would defiantly give it 5 stars. I love every part. The book has a few sad parts, but they are what shapes the characters. If things wouldn't of happened this way, Sayuri wouldn't of become a Geisha. Or if she would of, she wouldn't of been so popular. She wouldn't be the person she is today. I don't think young kids should read this book. In some places it is a little disgusting and it can also get very confusing. I had to go through and reread a few parts so I could fully understand it. I think a good age is 14."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Such a great novel.

Until I read this novel I had little appreciation for what the life of a geisha entailed. Not only has Arthur Golden given the reader a great story and very real characters, but the detail he goes into regarding the organisation and politics of the world of geishas serves to both educate and provoke thought. Whilst I found the ending was less than satisfactory, I am still raving about this book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully written novel that will slowly draw you in to a race to the finish. I truly felt as if I was living the novel. The writing is vivid, imaginative and thought provoking. The book is way better than the movie. Simply put, Memoirs of a Geisha is a must read. A great novel for a book club!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was one of I'm sure many who watched the film Memoirs of a Geisha first and fell completely in love with not only the gorgeous scenery and costumes of the film but also the actually well- structured plot of one girl's desire to be a Geisha to finally find and capture the man she has loved since childhood, one they call the Chairman.The movie though, despite being very good, also left out too much. You find this out when you finally get your hands on the novel and read it with so much eagerness. There is just a lot, especially in Sayuri's childhood, that is cut out due to the film's need to keep it from becoming too long of a film but definitely is interesting to finally read about. The characters are taken especially more in depth and certain other characters that were left out from the film give the plot a few more twists and turns that I enjoyed reading.Overall I will admit when the film first came out I thought it looked pretty but boring. When I finally watched it though I just had to read the novel. The story will keep you guessing, and the characters are memorable and most are likeable. And seeing into the world of a Geisha was actually quite interesting.I was also told to read Geisha: A Life by Mineko Iwasaki, one who helped Golden, the author, see into the real world of Geisha so he could write this story. I am almost halfway through and it definitely is interesting to read on a few of the inaccurate details Golden gave about Geisha in this story but this story is not entirely inaccurate, and overall is an entertaining story worth the time.4.5/5"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book based on the recomendation of a friend, who said that this book was her favourite.

Her lip was cut wide open. She continued on until a man came up to her and told her that he would fix her up and that she shouldn't have been running in the rain; and he also pointed out to her how lovely her gray, sparkley eyes were. She thought that this man was very kind, and learned that he owned a fish company. His name was Mr. Tananka. She hoped that one day, she would see him again. And she did. The next day he called her and her sister Sayo to come and spend the night. When they got there they were checked over by a fortune teller, who said that they were very healthy. A few weeks after leaving Mr. Tananka's house, Chiyo came home to see Mr. Tananka talking to her father. She heard some words that led her to believe that she and her sister were going to be adopted, seeing as their mother was soon to perish. The next day, Chiyo and Sayo were called to meet him at the fish factory his family owned. Chiyo was certain that they were going to be adopted, but they were pushed in to the back of a wagon and taken to a train station. They were wondering what was going on. The train stopped somewhere around Kyoto, and they were taken to the city of Gion by wagon. When they got there, she and her sister were separated and put into different Okaiya's. They had sooned learned that they had been sold. Chiyo was to become a Giesha, or entertainer, while her sister was just to be used as a maid.

Golden couldn't seem to decide between writing a travelogue or a cheesy novel and ended up failing at both. He's got a few moments of smart dialogue or interesting factlets (the old lady's chicken-neck thing...eww) but those only seem to highlight the rest of the book's shortcomings (like the thin plot and the pathetic, one-dimensional characters). The highest praise I can give is that it's a decent time-killer and I wouldn't smack it out of someone's hands if I saw them reading it. As for me, I'm going to try to forget I ever saw it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is an incessant chit-chat on &quot;misuage,&quot; waxed hair, beautiful or tore kimonos.

I expect more from a novel. An understanding of the human heart (no sign of it here, just a lot of cliches). Writing that goes beyond the pedestrian (I know the author spent many years writing this book, but the prose is barely competent). If I had read this book without reading any of the reviews beforehand, I probably would have said it was pretty good. An interesting, though unchallenging, novel. Entertaining, as long as you're willing to put up with it's superficiality. But the reviews made me expect this to be one of the best books I would read this year. Not even close.

The protaganist is Sayuri whom we follow from her involuntary servitide to an 'okiya', a sort of boarding house for geisha, through her training as a geisha, to her position as one of the most adored in her profession. Through the author's simple prose and ample, but not overstated, use of detail, we are able to be in Sayuri's world; we are in the Gion teahouses with her while she displays her subtle graces to her wealthy customers and we come to understand the often intricate relationships between customer and geisha. Sayuri is a strong character who has aspirations even in the midst of the hardships of her servitute, the depression of the 1930s, and WW2. She is not perfect and I frequently thought her unlikeable; she is not immune from jealousy and treachery. But one very easily admires her strengths and is able to empathize with her actions in the setting of another culture. The author, who is male, has done his research well. He has succeeded in placing the readers in another culture and letting them enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"see, i didn't know that until i was on the last 20 pages. i thought i was a real biography, which just goes to show you how believable and real are the characters and situations. until the last 20 pages, at least."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is amazing.

While reading it, the reader's heart aches for little Chiyo as she is sold into slavery in the form of a geisha house, cheers for her as she overcomes all obstacles to become Sayuri, one of the most famous geisha in Japan, and is delighted when Sayuri discovers the true meaning of love. This book is well written with an insight into the little known world of Japanese geisha, where women live to entertain men with jokes, dances, and parties. Golden's version shows the women underneath the makeup of the geishas and how they are simply women forced to make a living the only way they know how. Sayuri shows the reader that even when there seems to be no hope for the future, all of that can change in the blink of an eye. &quot;After all, she said, Who would have thought one of the greatest geisha in Kyoto history was born in poor fishing village?&quot; Despite being branded as a poor investment who will never become a geisha, Sayuri perserveres. She does so because it is the only way she can keep contact with the man she loves.

This was a very well written and captivating book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There were two points that stood out for me after I had finished this book. The first was the rich detail of this novel's world. While it is possible that it does not exactly match the reality of a geisha's world, the language and writing style Golden uses makes his version of that reality very believable for a reader. The other point that struck me was the subtle, yet prevalent, religious tone to the geisha's lifestyle. From the intricate ceremonies to the unwritten code of behavior, Golden quietly makes the point that a geisha's life carries with it a sense of duty and servitude similar to those that a religion would espouse. Thus, the book not only depicts a life and a search for love, but could also be said to show one person's spiritual development.I realize that my interpretation likening a geisha's lifestyle to one of a religious bent might seem a little outlandish. However, good literature allows the reader to experience something new while still remaining universal enough to reflect their interests. Memoirs of a Geisha accomplishes this task. It is a deceptively simple guide to a place and lifestyle that has rarely been visited by other authors. Yet, the bonds of emotion and obligation depicted in its pages should be familiar to any reader. The result of this combination is a book that is worthy of the accolades it has received."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book gets an inside view of the old-fashioned trained geisha. I couldn't put it down!!! the way he describes the daily life of a geisha kept me always turning the next page. I reccommend this for every age. I loved it. it is clearly the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is a fascinating glimpse of Kyoto geisha life in the 1930s and 40s. While strictly a fictional story, Golden did his homework so well that one could easily believe that the story of Sayuri is true.The novel has many strong points, the strongest being Golden's colorful and detailed descriptions of geisha life in Gion. The characters are very real, and Sayuri is an extremely likeable heroine...you're rooting for her from the very beginning. The story flows, for the most part, very smoothly, making for an easy and pleasurable read.The one part I found disconcerting (very much so, in some places) was the dialogue. I really felt like Golden was stretching or compromising in certain parts, trying too hard to be poetic or dramatic, and it threw off the otherwise lyrical flow of the story. Other than that, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is quite an enjoyable experience, and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy a good storyline."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"this is the best book i've read in a very long time. it was very imformative on the life of a geisha. if your only going to read 1 book this year read memoirs of a geisha. i can't say enough about.i learned all about the daily life and life in genral of a geisha. in a fictional point of view but it has facts and dates. i loved it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is by far the best book I've ever read!!

But I really just couln't get the fact that she idolised the Chairman for 20 years, a man 35 years older than herself, and to be honest the 'happy' ending brought down the standard of the book. I know, I know, different cultures and all that, but still..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have live in the United States for fifteen years, and I think that Memoirs of a Geisha mekes me very homesick. It is a remarkable accurate picture of life for a Japanese. I do not know about geisha, but I have read many articles which tell me that life of geisha long ago was much like what Mr. Goldon has said. Today it is not so much like that. People who complain about this book being 'inaccurate' don't really understand what the book is about. People who in love with this book are feeling this way because of Mr. Goldon's work as novelist. He has made very convincing character in Sayuri. She is REAL Japanese lady, even if she never existed. Any Japanese who tells otherwise, I can't understand it. I know what is to be Japanese, and I am impressed with this book. Many people feel some jealousy, I think is the problem, and I don't blame them."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Very good. Expertly written with wonderful insight into the life of a Japanese Geisha. The classic romance aspects of the novel had fairly predictable twists, turns and outcomes. In addition, Golden's philosophical messages were restricted to bits of Haiku. However, I felt the purpose of the novel was to form a biography representative of a class of women who no longer exist as they once did. Golden's work is a tribute to Japanese Geisha. What a fascinating topic he selected to develop. The account of Sayuri's emotions, as well as the attention to detail were incredible. I would recommend this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A wonderful, totally absorbing novel!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read.

I highly recommend this book and think it would make an excellent movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A truly remarkable achievement. We follow not only the story of a young girl, but the study of Japanese culture during the War. Golden's novel entices you from the very first page, inviting you to swim in it's deepening waters, making gasp for breathe at regular intervals, eventually leaving you spent but satisfied on the shore of this emotional masterpiece."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was the most amazing book I've ever read. I was so enthralled by the plot and by Sayuri and her stunning story. I was actually sad when I finished the book and didn't want to start another so I could savor the good feeling it gave me. It was magical and beautiful and the rivalry created between Hatsumomo and Sayuri/Mameha is intriguing. Thanks for the good read and the mini lesson in Japanese history, Mr. Golden. Five stars all the way!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"To be honest, I wasn't sure a man would be able to write an intimate story from a woman's point of view.

I just wish it wasn't such a hectic week or I'd have read it in hours. It is an incredible book with lush words and imagery. It is surprising to note that this book is written by a man, when the women characters seem so real. I admit this book is probably not for everyone, but at first I wasn't sure if it was for me, but after a few chapters I was completely transformed into a different world. I think this book will become a classic someday."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I must admit, despite the shallowness of Sayuri's obsession for the chairman, I enjoyed this book. I could not put it down and even read it during class, lectures, and when I should have been doing homework. The ending was a little dissapointing, but I think the point of the book was to have an insight into the life of a geisha. Most westerners have very little knowledge of Japanese culture and history. I think Mr. Golden not only wrote a book that was educating, but so enchanting that you couldn't tell you were beign given a history lesson. Wonderful book overall and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This books was wonderfully written and more importantly a great story. I was very impressed with the history and culture of the times. The heroine, Sayuri, is such a spirtually strong women who champions through being sold as a geisha to being driven to live by her one true love. It is a story about the human spirit. It was a throughly engaging and impressive book. I recommend it to anyone as a great read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Hi my name is [anonymous], and boy do I have a book for you! Do you like reading about Japanese Cultures, well I do. That is why I read Memoirs of a Geisha, by Arthur Golden. It is a very, very, very, very, good book. I thought Sayuri is very neat. So if you like reading about Japanese cultures, I suggest you visit your local bookstore or library and pick this book up. Back to you Lavar!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This exquisite book was a gift to me. I usually prefer to choose my own books to read; my taste is eclectic and personal. I suppose everyone is the same way.If you are open to hearing a tale told in a luxuriantly long and expertly crafted manner, with visually rich scenes and a taut undertone of sensuality that pulls you toward the ending, you will probably like this book.It is as simple, and as complex, as anything that is nearly perfect. I think of the kimonos and the incredible descriptions that are given of them when I reflect upon one aspect of this book I found entrancing. I enjoyed learning things about the culture and I surrendered myself to the plot. Like a flower unfolding and blooming, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is a treasure to enjoy and keep in your memory."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Great book!

Enough said."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There is nothing in this story of a young, Japanese woman ripped from her impoverished family that would lead you to believe that it was written by a Jewish, American man.The beauty of the language of this book is breathtaking. The imagery is so vivid that you feel as if you were right there, the entire time.And, for all of Sayuri's hardships, there is no means available to feel sorry for her. The tale does not inspire anything resembling sorrow. Her spirit is indominable. Her character wins your heart.I read this in one sitting, as has everyone I know who has picked it up. And, I didn't just enjoy it for the simple pleasure of reading. I learned things. Things about Japan and geisha and my own heart.Read it when you have time to not put it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Wow. This book was unbelievable! The way Arthur Golden translated meaningless words into pictures, dreams, hopes, and desires, was unbelievable. The quality of writing in this book was remarkable; the city of Gion comes alive through bright description and dialogue. Golden emphasizes minute detail, from face cream made of nightingale droppings to the high priced-auction of a girl's virginity. I think its astonishing the misconceptions that are displaced in this book; Geisha are not prostitutes, they are very pricey call girls who deal with relieving their customers anxiety and stress, yet they are almost like slaves to their 'mothers' in the okiya that they live in. Overall, this book was brilliantly done with masterful description and beautiful, poetic language."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Wow. What an amazing and beautiful story. I didn't even understand what a geisha really was before reading this book; now I feel like an expert. Mr. Golden has created a masterpiece so delicately written, it almost seemed like a poem to me. Very intriguing and thought-provoking; gorgeous, gorgeous writing; plus a history lesson like you've never had before. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel was incredibly difficult to put down. It was filled with poetic beauty, gripping seduction, and sheer mysticism. I was amazed at how well Golden captured the essence of a girl during this time period, and of this culture. Not an easy undertaking, but Golden does it with relative ease. I would recommend this book to someone who wants to read something from out of the ordinary. It really opens minds, and broadens perspectives. I can't wait till the movie is released!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This history is very descriptive, you don't know how real it is, a wonderful book, it's a good way to know every detail of Geisha's life enjoying a fluid story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is hard to put down- had I not had homework to do, I would have read it in one sitting.

Beautifully written, it paints a gorgeous picture of Sayuri's life and makes the reader yearn to experience the life of a geisha personally. It was VERY moving and wonderful read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a nice read. I really liked the voice of the narrator. I think Mr. Golden did a fine job and I was totally immersed in Sayuri's story. The descriptions are wonderful and the cultural aspects of it are fascinating. I was in Japan many years ago when I was young and this book brought back many memories especially of rural Japan. I saw the movie, too, but there is no comparison. The book really is superior."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was an eye opener for me. I always thought that geishas' were prostitutes, but it's much deeper than that. The women that do or did this had no choice in the matter. Either they could become a geisha and have a danna, or starve in the streets at that time. Sayuri is such a beautiful woman. Her struggles in her life started when she was a very young girl and spun into her adult life. She is such a beautiful person and she is also a very caring person. This book is a must read. I would advise anyone who loves to read good material to read this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Nitta Sayuri recounts the adventures of her life as a child in a fishing village in 1929 to her virginity auction; her training as a geisha & her life during the past 70 years in Japan.This is like entering a whole other world, a different pace, a different place. Life as seen experienced and recounted by a tender, wide-eyed child who finds her mission at the age of twelve. It doesn't matter that her life choices were made for her, it matters that after weeks of impassioned resistance to her fate, fate deals her an enchanting moment of consciousness and from then on she knows what she will be.Gloved in the delicacy of pliability, beauty and harmony is one determined, lively and curious mind. Back and forth, Nitta Sayuri weaves her memories and we are led into her life, like a thread, eager to join the tapestry.Stories within stories, crowded with people, images, colors and rituals. The life of a geisha truly becomes a work of art. Like priestesses, the geisha administer to the wealthy bureaucrats and like aging prima donnas, squabble among themselves. This is all about relationships. All about advantages, payback and the rarefied reaches of honor, codes and manipulations.One story that illustrates the complex ritualized way of life is when Nitta's virginity is auctioned and finally plundered. What a cultivated ritual: the deflowering, the collection of bloodied towels and the disembodied formality. It reminded me of Margaret Atwood's A Hand Maid's Tale.Did I enjoy this long read? Yes and no. The descriptive passages about rituals, weather, music and clothes were well written and entertaining. Did I learn new things? I did as my main reason for reading the book was to understand what a geisha is and I found out that a geisha is not just an everyday prostitute. A geisha must learn the fine art of dance and be graceful and refined while laughing at a man's dumbest jokes. A geisha isn't a prostitute she must have a personality and a man's campaign. Arthur golden also writes vividly and beautifully with wonderful senses of imagery.My reluctance is in that I was never engaged by anyone in the book. The subtlety of the difference between destroying a rival madam and the untidy emotion of romantic love, escaped me. I didn't enjoy dwelling so long in the alleyways of such callow indifference, masked emotions and euphemisms."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The details of this story brought such substance and life to the characters and bygone japanese customs I felt like I was living it. What a wonderful story; written as if it were a biography made it that much more real."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It was hard to put this book down. You truly feel like you are in the mysterious world of a geisha. This book was something different to read. My only disappointment was that this was not a true story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"\\"Memoirs of a Giesha\\" is a glimpse into the past and a culture that has been changed by time and circumstance.A child from the country is sold into virtual slavery through the influence of a well-meaning neighbor. Disheartened, lonely and oppressed, she is uplifted by the kindness of a man she meets in a Kyoto park. His action inspires her to seek the life of the geisha. Her goal is frustrated by the cruelty of one geisha but aided by the kindness of another.After becoming an apprentice geisha she meets again the businessman who first inspired her. Obsessed with him, she seeks to devote herself to charming him. Oddly, he seems inclined not to recognize her and to ignore her while his taciturn and war-damaged associate and several others compete for her company and, later, in an unusual auction, for her virginity.Despite the fact she is grateful to Nobu, the associate, for his kindness-which extends to his having rescued her from poverty and, possibly, death in World War II-she is not willing to become his mistress and devises a scheme which sours his opinion of her.Though it's fiction, Golden has done a remarkable job of bringing reality to a way of life few in the West can imagine. And, in doing so, he opens a window into a culture that was beautiful, sensuous and refined and, at the same time, had its elements of cruelty and superstition.O-medeto gozaimasu! Umai desu."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"By far this is my all-time favorite novel. I have yet to come along any piece of fiction that has touched me like this book has. It's of those books that stays with you after you read it. Every word, every sentence is pure beauty. The story is incredible. It tells you the story of Nitta Sayuri, a geisha in the district of Gion, Kyoto, Japan. You start from the beginning of her life as a child named Chiyo, and from there she takes you through her entire life. As you read with her, you feel like you are sharing in her experiences. You understand her fears, you feel her pain, you feel empathy. Arthur Golden does a magnificent job of truly connecting the reader with not only Sayuri, but the rest of the characters as well, providing details that really bring them to life. He also does an excellent job of having Sayuri, the narrator of this story, explain to you the ins and outs of Geisha life, and helping you understand how this mysterious world really worked. It is beautifully written. The first paragraph and the last paragraph are two of my favorites in the entire book. I've cried everytime I've read this book. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! You won't be able to put it down, and you'll just be completely entranced by it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As I read this book I felt as if I was there living her life.

Thumbs UP!!!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book made me happy, and gave me a whole new observation of the Japanese calture.

The Author had discribed it all so vividly, and I would like to thank him for the experience."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

I could picture every movement, every scene in my mind, and I yearned for more.While reading, I found myself not only involved with Sayuri and her story, but quite involved with the other characters' stories, as well. I wanted to know more about them, I wanted to find out what made them the way they were. I couldn't wait to turn the page, eager to know what was going to happen. And I was so very sad to find I had reached the end of the book.I've recommended this book to many, many people, and I hope they take me up on it. As for myself, I can't wait to read it again!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"One of the BEST books I have ever read!

It will continue to amaze readers for many, many generations to come."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I probably wouldn't have bought the book had I known a man was the writer of a geisha's life story just because the perspective could be tweaked.

As far as I'm concerned, it's just selling OUT!)Thankfully, this beautiful yet haunting tale of Geisha in the early nineteenth century turned into an outstanding choice.

The author deserves the gratitude of all westerners for opening our eyes to the beauty of the Geisha culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't remember when I've read a book and was so riveted by a character, time, place, profession, and gender ideas. GEISHA invited me into a world I knew little about, introduced me to a wonderful heroine, and held me captive until the end. The author successfully combines informational and educational aspects--complete and interesting descriptions of what it's like to train as a geisha---with prose that is both poetic AND plot-driven (hard to pull off, in my vast reading experience). For me, that's the best kind of novel--combining beautifully-written sentences with an entertaining plot to learn something new. The best book I read in 1998 (and again in 1999!)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was a facinating voyage to a different culture. Although the book did go to long about spacific kimono information, it draws ont to this world to the point one can't put this book down. After actually going to Gion, it makes it all that real. The biggest dissapointment was that the charracter was fictional, as it is hard to believe this book is fiction. Two members of my family read this book and enjoyed it as well as I did. Me, because I am a history teacher and enjoy history, and my mother and sister, because they like the romance aspect."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this story... it is one of love, sorrow, sadness. Highly recommended, take it for what it is without expecting it to be the story of all Geisha women in Japan... Just a glimpse of what it might be or might have been."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In a world dominated my superfluous writing styles, &quot;Geisha&quot; is written in wonderfully simple prose, which flows off the page as smoothly as if it were a tale being told to you by a good friend. There's a certain sincerity in the way Sayuri (as she comes to be called) tells the story. You instantly feel for her, and feel the weight of her sorrows. You are absorbed into the story. Through the eyes of a young girl with innocent thoughts and dreams, the environment comes to life: both the good and the horribly bad. You feel what its like to walk the streets of Gion at midnight, and smell the aroma of noodles and broth from the street vendors. A great read. A fast read. One of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was browsing through the library when I found this book, and I'm so glad I did. Ironically, I was judging it by its cover (since I'm part Japanese), and the cover picture of the geisha with light eyes (Sayuri) intrigued me. Sayuri's story and personality shines through vivid and convincing use of Oriental analogies and metaphors. It is a persuasive and evocative story that teaches about Japanese culture without being tedious. It fascinated and hooked me from the start; I read through it at a lightning pace and was disappointed when it was done. Arthur Golden is very talented. Overall, a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book as a FICTIONAL story. I cannot emphasize that enough!!If you really want to understand what being geisha is all about, I suggest reading Mineko Iwasaki's Book called &quot;Geisha, A Life&quot; - an autobiography of one of Japan's best geishas in history. It's an ACTUAL book from an ACTUAL real-life geisha.This book however, was excellent, if taken as a story, and nothing more than a story. Geishas are not prostitutes [courtesans/&quot;oirans&quot;] bought and sold, and it isn't quite as harsh as it seems, it's just a different outlook on life. Geishas are PERFORMING artists who entertained women, men and even their whole families!!This fairytale follows a life of a fictional character named &quot;Sayuri&quot; (her given geisha name). She travels through the flower and willow world, learning the geisha profession and entertaining. Lots of intricate plots, complexities and emotional twinges - perfect for a rainy day. The characters are vibrant, realistic and their personalities (either nasty or sweet) are well portrayed through Golden's superb writing. I didn't find this book difficult to read, and on the whole most of the people I recommended this book to, loved it!It was a truly difficult book to put down. You were always led into another section, and you HAD to find out what happened there.. to put it in more solid terms, I have astigmatism which makes it hard for me to read in cars and on subways.. but I just couldn't put the book down, no matter how much of a splitting headache I got. And after I finished, I read it again.Golden's writing is beautiful, a great story to read, the research is half done, and much of it glossed over in favour of more salacious details. I'm all for recommending this book - it is one of my favourite stories to read over and over again, but take the information provided with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This beautifully-written, detailed story not only carries the reader through the complete range of emotions, it is also chock-full of interesting information on the training and politics of the geisha society. The author maintains the polite, restrained voice of the geisha throughout the book, without deviation--quite a feat! This is a thoroughly engaging book, not to be missed. I'm planning on reading it again!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Like most Westerners, I had lots of stereotypes and little real knowledge of the life of a geisha before reading this book. The author is a man, and yet he writes this book in the first person and succeeds in sounding like the voice of a Japanese woman. She is born with the name Chiyo in a small fishing village on the Sea of Japan. Unfortunate family circumstances cause her father to sell her and her sister to someone who will have them trained to become geishas. She and her sister are separated and she is put into a household of women, including another geisha who always seems to be at cross-purposes with Chiyo. When she tries to meet her sister and run away, she is caught and her training is interrupted. When things seem darkest for her, there is always a rescuer who appears on the scene. One of the most fascinating parts of the book is the training Chiyo goes through. Geishas consider themselves to be hostesses and entertainers and they spend years training in dance, singing, musical instruments, and the tea ceremony. Throughout her life Sayuri, as she is known after becoming a geisha, is at the mercy of other people, first the women in the place where she lives, and later the men who support her. This is a bittersweet tale of a young girl who first loses her family and then her closest friends in order to survive and attain her goals. It is a fascinating look at one aspect of another culture, but it has sad undercurrents throughout."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is the best! Great for Sunday afternoon reading-considering you wont be able to put it down. It is the story of a scared and confused young girl ripped from all she has ever known and dropped headfirst into and okiya,only to learn she will be trained to become a geisha. Along her rocky path to a full fledged geisha, you get caught up in her emotion and feel sadness, desperation and sometimes regret for the girl. A book filled with secrets and questions,all mostly answered towards the end. I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is one of those books I just didn't want to finish. I fell so in love with the characters that they become dear friends. It will be hard for me to now let them go.Arthur Golden has written a delightful tale of Japan and the Japanese culture during WWII. I travel a lot, but for some reason have never been tempted to visit Japan. After reading this book, my feelings have changed. His descriptions of this country and it's culture, using his easy to read style of prose which is almost poetic, has changed my mind. I now have a deep desire to visit Kyoto and &quot;the land of Sayuri&quot;!I realize how ignorant I have been of geisha, and their role in society. I learned so much about their lifestyle, their country and this time period. I also was reminded of some important lessons in life. The hard times that we go through help to make us and our lives even more special, and the people we meet along the way stay with us long after we are seperated from the physically.I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed reading Memoirs of a Geisha. It gave a peek of how it was during that time in Japan. It also showed what it was like to be a woman living through those times. I think what I liked the most about it was the fact that it was written by a man. When you are reading the book you don't even get a hint that it was a man writting the story. There was so much emotion through out the entire book that made it feel as if you were there watching this girl grow up. I definately recommend reading this book if you want to experience what it was like to be a geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Amazingly written, Memoirs of a Geisha takes you into a world in which wealthy men pay for the services of Geisha and Geisha live not for themselves but for the financial means of their Okiya. The author, Arthur Golden, includes such exquisite detail and insight into the life of a Geisha that it is difficult to remember that the book was written by a man. This captivating story of a young Japanese girl, Chiyo, going through strict training and experiencing sexual and mental hardships that are difficult to imagine will keep you turning the pages. The details of her life seem to make you feel as though you know her and are right there with her, experiencing things as she experiences them. I would recommend this book to anyone, whether for the Japanese culture, the art of the Geisha, or just for pleasure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found the book to be funny, poignant, and surprisingly quick to read. To a non-Japanese reader, the book is very appealing for its glimpse into a secretive and unique culture - that of the geisha. Like most people, I too had assumed before reading this book that geishas were essentially just prostitutes and the book really opened my eyes to the complex and ritualized lives these women actually led as well as the power they wielded in a patriarchal society. My only complaint is that Sayuri comes across as very self-absorbed and downright selfish at many times. Although she no doubt had to learn to be that way to survive in the cutthroat world of the okiya (corporate boardroom battles were probably less intense!) it is interesting that she constantly criticized Hatsumomo for her selfish behavior, yet was equally selfish, though in a less malevolent way. Also, it was rather predictable that she would end up with the Chairman, who she had idolized since childhood - now, does real life ever really work that way?! Still, overall I found it a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book after reading so much press about how great it was. I was skeptical but thought the subject matter was interesting. By the time I was into the second chapter I didn't want to put it down. I don't want to say anything about the story so as not to give anything away but I recommend the book highly. I have already given it to 2 friends who loved it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When my book club picked this one, I wasn't excited to read it. BUT the writing was just magnifiscent and I was capitvated with the story, the characters, the history and the vivid imagery. I missed her when I wasn't reading the book and couldn't wait to get home to read more! I was thrilled with the ending but depressed that it didn't continue. I cannot wait to read his next book! Absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have always been deeply interested in the unique and mysterious culture of the geisha of Japan. The experiences of Sayuri, a geisha living in Gion, are both informative and exceptionally enthralling. I found myself glued to the pages of this wonderfully personal and touching novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What a great book. It feels like Sayuri is an old friend. She overcame great challenges and showed the resilience of the human spirit. It was wonderful to have the old Kyoto geisha days come to life and get an insider's view. I could not put this book down. It made me grateful for how much freedom I have to make my own choices."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Overall, the novel was entertaining. We see the protagonist maturing into a very calculated character as her situation determines. In the end, she becomes more condemnable than the characters that she has combated throughout her life as a Geisha. The distinction is that she is willing to injure someone dear to her to obtain her goal, while the other characters that have throughout the novel been seen in an unfavorable light seem to have a certain element of honor in that they hurt the people that think have slighted them or threatened them in some way without before hand owing them a great debt or forming a strong bond with them.Some of the characters portrayed are very simplistic in that they were portrayed as either entirely good or positively bad. One of the main characters is portrayed as the knight in shining armor and another an admirer that is little more than a tool to serve the protagonist's ends. The only insight into their real lives is the events t! hat form the images in our minds about the individuals; thus we know that one character suffered a terrible accident explaining the condition of his skin, but all else is measured by levels of desire. The protagonist does not dwell on the hollowness of her existence but accepts it as if she was born into it when she truly was not and thus had more reason to question her fate. She, unlike other novel characters does not dwell upon counterfactuals.The novel is essentially a modern fairytale as nearly everyone that gets their just deserts does so and the others that have played a role in slighting the protagonist get their comeuppance in the end. Too many mysteries remain in the novel, we never know the true character of individuals, we only get the caricature of them. Indeed the ending is hollow, as we are not allowed to witness the awkwardness of certain situations between two principal characters when one has been slighted.I found it difficult to believe that the p! rotagonist, who is portrayed as an intelligent individual, ! does not question the morality of the men that she seems to care for. Her object of desire is seen as a grail, the quest/desire for whom has entirely guided her life. This man has a family of his own to which he is being unfaithful but is portrayed as having no faults. He is forever honorable in the eyes of the protagonist. What grounds does the protagonist have to believe that any character is interested I her for anything other than physical pleasure? Is this the ultimate relationship for which she has searched. The impact of Geisha on the families of the men that do frequent geisha houses is barely explored and this is a fault. Does our protagonist geisha who is so caring not consider the position of the wife?The book in no way compares to Wild Swans or any of the strong books based on Asian culture. It does, however enlighten the reader about the culture of Geisha, and provide some good entertainment."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sit back and immerse yourself in another time and place like slipping into a silky hot bath. Close your eyes and let the sights, sounds, and smells of pre-war Japan surround you. An amazingly detailed and enjoyable read -- the kind of book I always look for but seldom find. Many thanks to the author for one of the most enjoyable books I have read in months."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I want to make this clear-this is NOT literature, it is something to read on the beach. I rank this right down there with the Bridges of Madison County-written by a man, that for some reason sends certain women into paroxysms of gushing. It has the usual villainous rival, the Daddy Long Legs benefactor, the male fantasy of old man/young girl(oh sure, every pubescent teenage girl falls in love with a middle aged man on first sight and pines for him for years), mean mistress, etc. etc. There's too many good books out there to waste your time if you are looking for quality prose. it's fine for escapist summer reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Honestly, had my sister not given me this book I would have never read it. It pales in comparison to the work of Amy Tan, Maxing Hong Kingston or Shirley Lim.The writing was mediocre at best and I was sorely disappointed. Now, I understand why so many of my friends didn't like the book and refused to see the money. I'm going to the used bookstore and trading this in asap."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This worldwide bestseller dramatically narrates the life of Nitta Sayuri - a fisherman's daughter who blossoms into a skilled and highly successful geisha in the alluring city of Kyoto. Arthur Golden weaves a haunting and unforgettable tale by means of a descriptive yet swift narrative, superb characterization, and intense emotional drama. We are seductively drawn into Nitta's milieu, a world of eroticism, intrigue, and deception. This is truly a grandiose work of fiction, undeniably a \\"five star\\" novel.The movie, unfortunately, falls a tad short. The movie's fatal mistake lies in the casting arena. The budding Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang was cast in the role of Nitta Sayuri. While Zhang is undeniable talented and very attractive, she absolutely does not look Japanese! What a pathetic mistake! How could they have selected an actress that does not remotely look Japanese to play the part of a Japanese geisha?? This momentous casting flaw totally erodes the movie's credibility. To add insult to injury, the two most important supporting female roles, likewise geishas, are also played by women who do not look Japanese at all. This outrageous casting mistake would be comparable to casting a blond woman to play Rosa Parks or casting a red-haired Caucasian to play Indira Gandhi."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I actually borrowed this book from the library and my dog literally ate the cover off (thank god for hard backs) so I had to purchase it from the library. After reading it however I was thankful for that result as I can read it again and again and pass it on to others.It is so beautifully written, so wonderfully crafted that the fictional author created in the beginning of the book had me for the remainder of the story. Her voice came through so clearly, there was no doubt in my mind it was a biography. The story is so inspirational I wanted it to be true. It took me a while to accept that it wasn't but the theme and message that came across though the reading was worth it all the while. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought Memoirs of a Geisha sometime around exam week and Boy was that a bad idea. I couldn't even put this book down to study. My mom finally had to resort to hiding the book in order to get me to study for my exams. I think it is probably one of my most favorite books ever. And it transcends all age barriers. I loved this book and I'm sixteen and My neighbor across the street, who's a thirty something mother of two, loved it just the same. Its just an amazing story and a wonderful work of litterature. Buy the Book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel tells the extraordinary life of an extraoridinary girl. Chiyo, later known as Sayuri, led a life full of sadness, hardship, discipline, perseverance &amp; determination. One thing that made Sayuri unique from the other geishas was her brighter disposition amidst the loneliness her culture brought &amp; the events that have transpired during that time. For although Sayuri obeyed &amp; accepted life &amp; its consequences, as was expected of women that time, she never lost hope &amp; focus in attaining her dreams.This novel also gives us a glimpse of Japan's unique &amp; artistic culture. A glimpse, because it is like taking a peek behind a thick curtain, &amp; finding that what lies behind is different, interesting &amp; causes you to desire, to know &amp; see more."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a 9th grade English teacher and my only regret about this book is that I cannot use it in my classroom, according to curriculum guidelines. However, I would highly suggest this book to a teacher or professor who is interested in teaching literature or literary devices from a world literature perspective. I am in love with this book and have recommended it to all my friends. The author throws us into a Japanese culture that is not well known or understood by foreigners and even Japanese people themselves ( I read this latter fact in several other books about Geisha). The content of this book opened my eyes to the mysterious dynamics between men and women, the potent power of a seductive and beautiful woman, and the sad plight of women all over the world who must humble themselves and serve others to the point of self degradation for the right to live. The only thing that was puzzled me was this question:Is Sayuri a real person who dictated her memoirs to \\"Jacobsan\\" or was she truly and completely fictitious; a compilation of Japanese history and biographical/historical accounts? I would highly recommend the audio version (on CD) as read by Bernadette Dunne. Although I have listened the abridged audiocassete version by the other gal, Ms. Dunne's reading is much better and more enticing. I listened to the book on CD as I commuted to work and it was very difficult to turn off the car and in to work...many times (while doing errands in my car) I would drive an extra 30 minutes or so just to get to the end of a chapter or CD.

Sayuri the geisha!This is the sad beginning and it doesn't get better .. even when you think that she had achieved what she always wished for but there is always a trace of sadness that the little girl kept in her and never seemed to forget it ..The author explains a lot about what a geisha is, the kind of life they lead, their kimonos and dancing and you get to discover a different kind of living with all its secrets and fascinations.. but he doesn't make you forget Chiyo and always seems to remind you that it is the story of Sayuri and not the life of geisha in general is at stake! You never forget Chiyo, you never forget her misery and how this little girl had to grow up speeding up the days and months to become what people around her wanted her to be... but she had a dream and the ending is the surprise turn in the story..I really don't know if she felt happy after she got what she'd always wanted.. I couldn't feel it... her suffering and unhappiness over the years felt more overwhelming than what she finally had... she never forgot her home, her childhood memories were with her all the time seen with the eyes of a nine year old, and her sister was her family and no one filled in her place ..A delicate sensual narrative full of imagery and soft breezes of superstition and circles of destiny!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My review of this book is short and sweet...this book was great! You have to read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a voracious reader, I chose this book nearly 2 years ago and it has remained one of my favorites. It inspired me to read both *Geisha* by Liza Dalby and *Geisha, A Life* by Mineko Iwasaki (the basis for Sayuri's character). Both were very informative and interesting, but obviously not as entertaining or engrossing as *Memoirs of a Geisha*. They did an excellent job of documenting and describing the life of a geisha (much of what I had already learned from Memoirs), but I was disappointed that neither was able to elicit the emotions or vicarious experiences that I had enjoyed so much in this novel. Golden was able to mesmerize me in a way that few authors can. He took me by the hand and led me into a world that I was completely unfamiliar with. I felt as though I was an unnoticed character and was almost offended that I was never mentioned as Sayuri's closest confidant! It is an unforgettable journey that impresses me each time I read it. It's one you should not miss!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book has been reviewed plenty of times, I won't even go into the story line of it. Someone gave me this book 2 years ago to read and it sat on my shelf and I gave it back. I thought it would be like a history lesson and wasn't interested. Then a month ago, someone sent it to me to read and I thought, okay, I will. Foolish me 2 years ago. It is not a history lesson textbook kind of book, but an entertaining and educational story. I will forever view geishas (whether I see them in movies or other stories) with more insight than I could have before. If you are really debating on whether to take the time to read this or not, TAKE THE TIME. It is a flowing, captivating story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Imagine being a seven- or eight-year-old little girl, ripped from what little family she has left and sold to a mean old woman. The only hope she had was to become a glorified and respected whore, a geisha. On the long road to geisha-hood, Chiyo later known as Sayuri, finds herself in a bittersweet position torn between love and practicality.In Arthur S. Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha,one travels with this young girl to a partially fairytale, partially nightmare world, a world where she makes no decisions and has no choices. She must simply endure hardship and disappointment, hoping for a better day.I chose to review this excellent book because I am fascinated with oriental customs and history. I have read many other wonderful books, books like Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth and Amy Tan's Kitchen God's Wife, but none have left me with such a vivid understanding as Memoirs of a Geisha.An excerpt from the back cover: \\" In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion.\\"The author has done a terrific job in writing this modern day masterpiece and upon finishing this book one is left with an accurate, vivid image of what life for a Japanese Geisha was like. If I were to rate this book from one to ten it would receive a perfect ten for the wonderful style the author used along with the extreme clarity used to develop characters in the classic good guy/bad guy routine."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Beautiful work.. Golden has really made to start the book in a slow yet intriguing manner and the characters are both switching from a realistic athmosphere since not many of us are aware of what geisha societies are like, I don't think. And at the same time.. the rush of Chiyo's life as a maid.. the planning of Mameha and the tangle between the Chairman and Nobu is beautifully executed. You will feel like the character.grammar is beautiful as well, and the description of the details is averagely subtle.Beautiful work, get this!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a wonderful book. To me the characters were so vivid. I fell in love with some and hated some. It really brings emotion while you read. The culture of a Geisha is very interesting.

I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs&quot; is both a historical drama and a intricate love story that takes the reader back to WWII Japan and the examines the life of one girl's rise from slave to renowned celebrity.

The book was engrosing, eye opening, inspiring and wounderfully written. If you like memoirs, this is as good as they get. To read Mr. Golden's book is to know Sayuri.

Many of them move me. Memoirs of a Geisha is one of these. Arthur Golden has created a classic tale of love, life, change and growth. I feel as if I had the opportunity to meet an amazing woman.

A must read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As an afficionado of all things Far Eastern, I was DYING to read this book, and I couldn't put it down. HOWEVER, after the first 100 pages, I became a bit bored with Sayuri's overly sacchrine-sweet descriptions, as well as her wretched yearning for the Chairman. I found myself desperately wanting to reach the predictable, neatly tied-up ending even before Sayuri became a geisha. Disappointingly, Arthur Golden writes most definitely as a male trying to get inside the mind and heart of a Japanese woman, and that point is not missed in his sections about sex, which seemed to present a 2-dimensional view of sex and male-female relationships without much depth. Did Sayuri even feel like a woman? The book is dazzling in its portrayals of the secondary characters, which I could relate to (Hatsumomo, for all of her fiery maliciousness, was such a delight to hate). However, I didn't think that Sayuri's character was allowed to fully breathe into her own as a WOMAN, which would have made me feel closer to her. I also felt that the language was very coarse in parts, and it didn't always ring accurate (did geishas really offend each other and act so NAUGHTY??). I'm sure this will be a great film, though, and I will be first in line to applaud Spielberg when it's done."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After the first third of the book I couldn't stop raving about it and recommending it to friends. By the time I got to the last third I couldn't wait to finish it and move on to something else. Arthur seems to have lost interest half way through the book and did what he could to finish it.

It is beautifully written, lyrical and stays with you long after you have put the book to rest on your book shelf."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This riveting novel is the story of a young peasant girl who becomes one of Kyoto's most prominent geisha. The tale begins in a Japanese fishing village during the Great Depression, and ends in current-era New York. The author brings a wealth of knowledge of Japanese culture and of the geisha culture in particular. But what I found most striking, what will stay with me the longest, is the freshness of the imagery in this novel. The sea is described as looking like &quot;chipped flint&quot;, giving a feel for the coldness and harshness of the ocean. The face of an angry geisha in a crowd of happy people is likened to a bruise on an otherwise perfect piece of fruit. This wonderful novel is filled with such revelations, and is a delight to read.What may be mosy astonishing is that this novel of Japan and of the world of the geisha was written by an American man. Arthur Golden has achieved what we expect of our best writers: to bring to life something new (why do you think we call them &quot;novels&quot;?) and different; to allow us, if only for a short time, to visit another world; and to leave us with a fresh way of looking at our own world"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Regardless of the argument of whether Sayuri is believeable as a real Japanese character or not, I was completely disappointed by the general tone of the book -- that those who are the most capricious, selfish, conceited, shallow, manipulative and superficial will always win out over the same types, and that inevitably, those who are loyal and true will only lose out.The main lesson of the book, if there ever is one, is that it is better to seek perfection in superficiality over true good-hearted nature on a much more deeper level. The true tragedy of the book is that it lauds the attaining of dreams through manipulative and shallow methods, and punishes those who stay true to their principles."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There is something addictive about &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot; I zoomed through this book at a record pace. It's like a meal entirely of popcorn. Tasty, fun, but not really filling.The speed with which this book gets read says something about it's depth. It's key strength is the factual account of the life a Gion Geisha in the 1920's. I feel like I took a quick course on Geishas. The weakness of the book lies in storytelling. I have no real attachments to any of the characters. Suyari pretty much gets life handed to her on a silver platter. She is a very uncompelling heroine with few admirable qualities other than her features. She is a great Geisha because she is beautiful, and because benefactors choose to present her as a great Geisha. She achieves nothing by her own devices, and lives only by the whims of others. The only character that I had empathy for is Nobu, whose story is never adequately told. I was disappointed by the ending, which was a little too &quot;Hollywood.&quot;All this aside, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is a fun book to read. I enjoyed it. I recommend it. It is just not a book that moved me in any way other than entertainment."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I hated this book, partly because I found the writing style pedestrian, but mainly because I thought it had already had a successful life as Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind. There is, of course, the long-standing question of whether male authors can and do depict female characters accurately. (I've not seen the obverse of that situation. Has anyone been part of a debate as to whether female writers succeed in getting under the skins of their male creations?) Did I think the American male author gave us an authentic Japanese female voice? No. She had about as much life as a fifth-grade math problem: if one train starts in San Francisco, travelling at 50 mph... I realize that the Geisha of the title begins as a child but she remains a child throughout. There is no maturation and no charm in her character. Furthermore, I detested the use of coincidense in this book and the interesting thing for me personally about my own rejection of this novel is that I have spent long hours puzzling over the coincidences in my own life and yet I hated the melodramatic coincidence found here. The whole thing was silly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's hard to believe that a man wrote this novel of the journey of a young Japanese girl and how she came to be a famous Geisha. Although a work of fiction, there is so much real detail on the inside world of a geisha and the culture. The story is very engaging and stays with you long after the novel has ended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed most of &quot;Memoirs&quot;, especially the detail of the ritual and rules and regulations of geisha life. The picture I had of geishas before reading this book was very vague, but now my understanding is much better. For most of the book, I found the story very engaging, even with lots of desciptive detail. I'm not sure the rest of my bookclub would agree, as a number of them never got very far into the book.My main complaint about the book is that the story took a sudden turn toward the end, and then it seemed as though the author suddenly tired of writing it. I got the distinct impression that he was thinking, &quot;Okay, enough of this - got to wrap it up!&quot; Despite this, it was an enjoyable book for me and one that I'm glad I read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden's fictional account of the Geisha culture in pre- and post-WWII Japan is so well-written, you will find yourself checking the cover again and again to make sure it's fiction. After her mother's death, nine-year old Sayuri's distraught father sends her away from her poor fishing village with a wealthy man who promises to look after her. They travel to the city of Gion, where Sayuri is sold as an apprentice Geisha. As Sayuri grows, we follow her from one teahouse to another as she emerges from a clumsy child into a beautiful, much sought after Geisha.I couldn't put this book down. My only complaint is with the hurried ending. It didn't seem to fit with the rest of the story. Other than that, it was one of the best book's I've read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A good story; well-written and filled with great imagery, symbolism, and metaphors. To be taken with a grain of salt: although the title may imply a true story, it is a work of fiction. This was written for sheer entertainment and not as a basis of fact (despite what Golden says in the intro). Who can really know what the life of a geisha was like - it was all shrouded in mystery (to the Western world, at least). One error I noticed: towards the end of the story, the heroine, Sayuri, states that she will not reveal the father of her child. Yet, a few pages after, she says she remained in New York and did not return to Japan since the Chairman's daughter's fiance-to-be would not marry the daughter of a man who has an illegitimate child. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable reading and I recommmend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the ONLY review I will not go into detail with. I just want to say if you love the hidden secrets of geisha lifestyle, if you are interested in Japanese war or culture, or you are a woman...you MUST read this book. It is a modern classic. The words flow like poetry. The scenes fill your mind with landscapes and perfumed beauty. It will melt you. I adore this book...it is reavealing, almost shocking to the way I used to think of women who were Geisha. I thought they were sort of &quot;party dolls&quot; for married men. I was wrong. I now see them as one of the most interesting things in Japanese culture. The story is bittersweet. Think of a Japanese version of &quot;Cassablanca&quot; or &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. If you must read intimate details of the book ...read other reviews. I strongly urge you not to. Once details are revealed this story is ruined. There is one thing about the book I will say. I, as an artist have always admired kimonos on display..they are works of art. Just the reavealing aspect of how important they really are to a geisha was new and shocking to me! I will never look at one the same way again. Please do not pass this book up...just listen to all the buzz about it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; by Aurthur Golden is a thought-provoking novel, dealing with the themes of adversity, and in many cases, its resolution, was written to allow its readers an insight into the lives and depth of the Geisha culture. The book is written in such a convincing manner, in which an elderly retired Geisha reflects back on her life story. So convincing infact that as a reader, I felt as if I was standing in her shoes and experiencing the life and adventures of the Geisha first hand!&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, set during the period between the Depression (late 1920's) and the 2nd World War, leads us by the hand of the main character,Chiyo-Chan htroughout her enchanting tale of love, hope, hatred and happiness. Chiyo-chan's life begins in a smalll fishing village where at the time she is living with her impoverish family. However due to unfortunate circumstances, she and her sister are forced to begin a new life in the city of Kyoto. Chiyo is sold to a renowned Geisha house wherre she is forced to learn the arts of the Geisha culture, such as music, dancing, poaring sake and wearing Kimono.&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; to my mind, is an important novel on the theme of adversity and the Geisha culture which elaborates mainly on how the main character overcomes lifes barriers which she is faced with. Through the events and the main character, I found I learnt so much, not only about the themes incorporated in the novel, but also about the japanese traditional Japanese arts, which are dealt whith using the enchanting tale of one of the most celebrated Geisha in Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A great story to read. This book should be on your shelf. Mr. Golden transports you to a different time, culture and morals. Geisha derserves to be on the bestseller's list."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was intrigued by the author's attention to detail of Japanese life, and he is a very good storyteller. The prewar japan constructed by the author seems to be very authentic. the writing is very good, the dialouge is flowing. A novel novel and very good for a first work. It does not seem to be written to a specific audience. The only faults I have with the book is, one, the fact that the author does not totally come across as a female. His geisha does not fully convince me of her authenticity. The second fault has to do with the first. I simply did not believe the ending. It was too simplistic.This is a very good &quot;fun read&quot; novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The Memoirs of a Geisha is a compelling story about a poor young village girl who is auctioned off to the highest bidder for her virginity and later becomes a very prominent geisha. This story is filled with romance, eroticism and suspense which is written in a colorful way that makes it difficult to put the book down. Each chapter Sayuri is evolving into an enchanting, beautiful creature that overcomes the hardship of her past. She has been trained to entertain the most powerful men of Japan and to love someone is considered a fantasy. This book brought me through all of the emotions and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever had to struggle."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I picked up a copy of this book while I was in New Delhi, India for a study course in French. I know the two don't sound very complementary but thats how it happened. I was studying French during the mornings and had the greater part of the day free to myself and thought it would be great to sample Golden's (Premier?) work while free. Now, I won't be the average magazine hack and tell you what a good read it was and how fast paced it is ...Passe! This genre is certainly not what i read often but the idea of a little poetry, a fabled land and sultry seductress' did strike as a wonderful plot (pardon the pun)to while away a boring afternoon. The story is centered around a young girl and a later geisha, Sayuri. Taking its beginnings from a small town in Japan, the story is essentially a recount of Mme Sayuri's travails across a colourful canvas of Japanese Tea Houses, Suitors, Owners of Geisha Houses and other such equally quaint characters and locales. Though it does emit a tearful and at times &quot;creeping&quot; sadness on the fate of someone forced to start to eke out a livelihood very early in life, it has its moments of joy and happiness. Alas! they are few and rather far apart. Perhaps Golden attempts to mimic the Buddhist philosophy of the orient world showing with great candour, lyrical ability and poise, the thematic idea of suffering being a primal and defining characteristic of life and how, to minimise suffering, sacrifice and self-denial is the answer. A poignant story, the central theme revolves around how Sayuri driven by a combination of Ill-luck, poor Karma, Poverty and ensuing fate - which is a result of all her desires to be a woman respected in the world - is driven to be a Geisha. The story then takes on the character of a Jane Austen book detailing the need for young women to find good partners and finally along the central theme ends with Sayuri transported to a world different from her childhood - but respected and honoured. Is this the Nirvana that Golden tries to juxtapose? An interesting story, interestingly told...but caution, can become a little pedantic at times."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book. It was incredibly well-written, and was so interesting that I couldn't put it down. It was so realistic that at first I thought it was a true story. I know that the whole Chairman obsession could get a bit annoying. However, I think the point that the author was making was that Sayuri had a horrible life, so she clung to what she thought was the epitome of kindness. It would have been a lot more realistic if the Chairman had been more 3-dimensional, not just the perfect man."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book comsumed my life, I could not put it down.

I loved this book and I was really hoping not to be disappointed by the ending. Unfortunately, I was. I found the ending a bit too trite and I lost a lot of my sympathy for Sayuri. She seemed very shallow to me in her treatment of Nabu/The Chairman. I don't want to say more because I don't want to give it away.Until that point, I found it to be fascinating. Most especially because it is written so convincingly as a the memoir of a Japanese woman, but is written by a man. The culture of the Geisha is not somethign I am familiar with, so I can't really comment on the accuracy of Mr. Golden's description, but it was thoroughly enthralling."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the way to drive to the beach.

I could not put the book down. You would never think this book is written by a man. Everything is described so well that if you close your eyes, you'll imagine it all. I really never knew what goes into being a geisha. After reading this, you will have a deeper understanding and respect for geishas.Now, I can go see the movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read the first chapter of this novel in The New York Times. I was so impressed with the elegance of the prose and so intrigued with the story that I drove to our local bookstore in Woodbridge right away! Of the more than two hundred novels that I read in the last fortyfive years, only a dozen or so novels have I read without skipping a sentence. This novel is one of them. This is how the author describes what Sayuri saw when she looked at her image in the mirror on the day she and Mameha became sisters: \\"I knew that the person before the makeup stand was me, but so was the unfamiliar girl gazing back. I reached out to touch her. She wore the magnificent makeup of a geisha. Her lips were flowering red on a stark white face, with her cheeks tinted a soft pink. Her hair was ornamented with silk flowers and sprigs of unhusked rice. She wore a formal kimono of black, with the crest of the Nitta okiya. When at last I could bring myself to stand, I went into the hall and looked in astonishment at myself in the fulllength mirror....\\" I was impressed also with the ending: \\" But now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean. Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too often they bleed into a wash. just like watery ink on paper.\\" Prose as lovely as any I read in the last few years. I think the details of a geisha's life sound authentic because the author consulted the geisha Mineko Iwasaki, \\"one of Gion Kobu's top geisha during the 1960s and 1970s\\". Often, a novel of this length sags in the middle or the end. But not this novel. I admired Golden's control over both the story and narration, and also the magical flow of the flawless, luminous sentences.When I finished the novel, however, a couple of questions lingered in my mind. Why did Sayri's rival geisha Hatsumomo hate Sayuri so much? The author did not give a satisfactory explanation for Hatsumomo's maniacal hatred for Sayuri. Also, I wondered whether there are any practicing geisha in Japan now?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the moment you open the first page, to the moment you finish the last, Arthur Golden releases you and never lets you go. Sure, it's nearly 500 pages, but I was still wanting more."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Several years ago, a good friend of mine recommended that I read MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA by Arthur Golden. My friend claimed it was one of the best books she'd ever read. So, since we share similar taste, I've been meaning to read it ever since. But you all know about TBR piles and how huge they can get. (g)Well, when I spotted this in audio I picked it up. Still, I didn't start it right away. Instead I listened to the other audio book I'd picked up, which turned out to be a so-so suspense. However, yesterday, while I was running errands, I popped in the first tape and finally started MEMOIRS.To say it caught me right away is an understatement. This book is wonderful! It's excellent in a way that totally surprised me. This is not the kind of book that usually captures my attention so completely. It's not a fast paced, non-stop action book. In a way, I'd almost call it a quiet book, but so well done. So. . . fascinating. And I keep having to remind myself that a \\"man\\" wrote this.Long story short. . . I finished it in two days!Patricia LewinAuthor of BLIND RUN, OUT OF REACH, and OUT OF TIME"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book about 5 years ago, just got done reading it again over the Christmas holiday, and the only word I can think of to sum up this book is unforgettable. Some books you read and they were great, but when you're asked a year or so later what it was about, it's often hard to remember. This is not one of those books.Golden manages to write this story as if he were a Geisha. He makes this character come so alive, I'd swear she was a real person. What also sticks out in my mind about this book si that all of the facts he details about the country and about the lifestyle, are very interesting and educational. At least for me, I am always interested in a book that can teach me something.The story, is obviously of a little girl torn from her home by the countryside and exchanged to a geisha home, where she grows up and is trained. The novel chronicals her transition from youth into adulthood. We follow her struggles to get along with her fellow geisha, to become accustomed to the geisha way of life and through out her learning experiences with men.I'd definitely recommend the book to anyone who enjoys a good story. Whether you know anything about Japan or not, you don't need it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this book and have read it several times, as I have long been interested in the culture of geisha. The writing style of this novel is enjoyable (though the flowery metaphors get to be a little much after a while) and Golden's descriptive details of the geisha districts (especially of elements such as clothing) weave a mental image of a world full of wealth, culture and beauty.My issues with this book are the unrealistic elements of some of the characters. I find it hard to believe that Sayuri would continue to pine for the Chairman for so many years in the manner that she does; this clashes with the somewhat sober and self-restrained Japanese idea of \\"getting on with things,\\" which is described in other (non-fiction) books about geisha culture. Perhaps in the pampered world of Gion a girl like Sayuri might have had more leisure to think such things, though in many ways the geisha world is austere, and geisha are tied into the rules of their arts and their closely-bound, insular society. At any rate, it just doesn't ring true, and her continued childish harping on the idea gets annoying; this absense of fluidity in the floating world makes Sayuri's character seem stunted, like an instrument stuck on one tuning. The fact that the relationship turns out as it does makes it all the more unrealistic.Also, the character of Hatsumomo, Sayuri's great rival in the Nitta household, is far too one-dimensional. It's very easy to under-develop a character in such a way and make them all evil or all good. Had her character been tempered with some other qualities this might have been avoided, but she is singularly cast as the evil harpy standing in Sayuri's way. Of course, as in any other social group, there would be rivalries and jealousies, but Hatsumomo's flat bitterness and jealousy place her too easily into the Snidely Whiplash role.The cherry-on-top ending is just too pat and convenient, which certainly is not a common trait in real Japanese literature.I implore you to learn more about the subject of geisha before you take this book as gospel. Liza Dalby's _Geisha_, John Gallagher's _Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art_, and Kyoko Aihara's _Geisha_ are great places to start. Certainly you should enjoy this book as fiction, but do recognize it as such, and keep its flaws in mind."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was not expecting that much from this novel, since I rarely find something that is so hyped up to be worth my time. I got just about what I expected. It is very easy to believe that this book was written by a man. As I read it, I felt no sort of connection to Sayuri. It was hard to relate to her, and no, it isn't because of the &quot;exotic&quot; setting, or the fact that I am white and she was Japanese. A good character should be easy to relate to no matter their sex, color, or place of origin. I found Sayuri lacking any real character development. Her supporting cast was not any better. Hatsumomo, who hated her for being too much competition, while she was nine years old. The mean mother of the okiya, the dumb, chubby friend who betrays her, and the harsh Nobu whose every move was easily predictable, as was every plot twist in this story. I didn't find the writing style to be anything special, the prose was lacking in true soul. It was as if Golden wrote this feeling nothing. The entire novel seemed to be saying &quot;Hey, I know a lot about Japan, read me!&quot; Knowing about a country and being able to capture its essence are two very different things. Perhaps it would have helped if he hadn't, for over sixty pages, used the word &quot;geisha&quot; at least once per page. I realize that she is living around geisha, and working for geisha, and training to be a geisha, you don't have to keep using that word. And if the Japanese want to prove that geisha are not prostitutes, this isn't a good endorsement. I hate to tell you, but if you are being paid for making love to a man, I don't care how educated you are, or what culture you are, that makes you a prostitute. I simply feel that this book would have been better had it been written by someone who actually was or had experience with geisha. The very woman that he based this story upon was outraged, and claimed that he told her life story completely inaccurately, and that there may even be a lawsuit. I suppose in the end, I just didn't enjoy the style of writing, the absence of characters with personalities, and the lack of feeling with which this novel was written."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I was told that I wouldn't believe that it was written by a man. However, I could believe it! There is no character development or meaningful friendships or relationships. All of the characters in this book are one-dimensional. All women are portrayed as greedy, shallow, vain and vindictive.

Now she's brought back to the Gion district and all the Okiya are once again open in Japan. I hope for the best ending because in what I've read Sayuri deserves all the happiness this and the next world have to offer. An excellent true-to-life book that I just can't seem to put down.

An example of how &quot;the East ...and ... the West&quot;, the twain did meet. It opened up my eyes to the true nature of the geisha. She is an &quot;anachronism&quot;, a rara avis, an endangered species if not one already extinct. I think I saw only one or two in a recent visit to the Gion district of Kyoto. Although the denouement appears contrived with a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; ending, it really is in the spirit of both the whole book and the Japanese culture (or other Oriental cultures for that matter - Indian, Chinese, Filipino). The inticate maneuverings of social &quot;dances&quot;, the round about ways of accomplishing a goal, the subterfuges, the &quot;beating around the bush&quot;; every convoluted machination belying the Western dictum that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line!

The correct name for the body of water is the &quot;Eastern Sea&quot; in Chinese characters, as proven by histocial Korean maps. This name is another one of the distortions of history committed by the Japanese during the occupation of Korea. Also, this book made me feel again that most Westerners' interest in Asian culture is concentrated either in the Japanese or Chinese culture.

Whether it is outwitting her rivals, or finding her true love as her traditional society crumbles around her she triumphs. The sensuality and detail with which Mr. Golden writes, takes the reader into a world of which most westerners have no comprehension. I felt as though I lost a friend as I read the final page. I have recommended this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I came down with the flu on New Years Day, but wasn't able to read this book for a few days. I'm glad I picked this up for a Christmas present for myself. A wonderful read, with historical facts woven through out the story. A worthwhile novel, with rare insight into the Japanese tradition of Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Much like the Japenese culture itself, this book subtly reveals its charms. A fascinating journey to a time, place and lifestyle few Westerners ever know, Memoirs of a Geisha utterly transports. The level of detail is astounding, but never overwhelming -- and accurately creates the atmosphere and underlying tension of the era with lyrical prose. My only complaint is that the main character could have been more deeply drawn, but a minor quibble with what was otherwise a remarkable book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story of Sayuri was enchanting and compelling. I certainly learned more about the life of a geisha than I had ever imagined knowing. I read this book during a rough spot in my life, and it certainly gave me a lot to think about and reflect upon. There is commonality among us in every age and time, and this story is timely and well-told. I highly recommend this book to take you to another time and place. The perfect escape with a pleasing ending."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't believe I read the whole novel in one night...Compelling and detailed when it comes to describing the process of becoming a full fledged geisha, I found the book most fascinating in the first half...The monstrous Hatsumomo, the guardian figure of Mameha....the callow Sayuri caught in their power play...it is not just obvious that the author meticulously researched the lifestyle of Japan but also had the talent to bring these characters to life. Why not a ten? I felt that the final third of the novel was a major letdown....true, I was interested in what would happen to Sayuri, but it seems as if the author lost sight of what made the story so interesting to begin with...a look into a subculture so fine-tuned that we feel as if we were a part of it. As the novel progresses to its &quot;sort of&quot; contrived fairytale ending, it lost its charm and became a typical girl-pining-for-an-impossible-love story instead. But nevertheless, it is still an amazing first novel from an author who I hope to hear more from....if he doesn't skimp on the endings, that is!!! *grin* By the way, am I the only one who was shocked at the &quot;surprise&quot; that one of the minor characters sprung on all of us?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Though &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; hardly needs another glowing review, I simply can't help but heap more praise on the mountain of 1,200 + reviews that already exist. The tale of Chiyo/Sayuri is truly the most elegant, absorbing piece of fiction I have read since John Irving's &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany.&quot; From the minute I started this book, I was taken away to a world I never knew existed and that I didn't want to leave when it became time to put the book down and resume my own life. All through the day, and into my dreams at night, when I wasn't reading the book, I was thinking of the geisha of Gion, and imagining myself in a gorgeous kimono and obi (though I imagine there were few blue-eyed, blonde geisha from Oklahoma!). Now I'm grieving having finished this wonderful tale! If you haven't yet read this marvelous book, do yourself a favor and ORDER IT THIS VERY MOMENT!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Maybe a little dash of sake would help bring this book to an enjoyable level. I haven't read anything so bad since I was twelve and went through a short-lived (thank god) Danielle Steel phase. It read just like a romance novel: contrived and depthless. The metaphors made me wince. They seemed to slip in every 100 words as if Golden thought &quot;Oh: time for another metaphor&quot;. I'm delighted to see that there are other intelligent people who don't believe this book should have been on the best seller list for over a year. This will be the last time I let overzealous marketing get the best of me."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was loaned to me by another fawning fan. It reads like junk food. The artificial flavoring may be tasty, but it was largely empty calories.For anyone who has spent time in Japan and amongst Japanese, the book rings false. It is purely a Caucasian male's projection.As an alternative read, I would recommend Tanizaki's Makioka Sisters (and if you can find it on video, it is a wonderful film as well)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although the subject matter was quite interesting, the overall book was not dazzling. The plot and character flaws could not be covered up with the author's lovely descriptions. The spitefulness, stupidity, and bitterness of the entire book was not endearing. The protagonist herself was not bright, even though the author found it necessary to remind us constantly of how she appeared to be a \\"smart girl.\\" Sayuri was also coniving and selfish. The ending of the book was unsatisfactory; the resolution of her romance wasn't believable nor remotely credible. Also, her treatment of Nobu was absolutely awful; it reveals her to be selfish and crass. The way that her actions late in the book were interpreted was also unconvincing. The ending was just uninspiring. I've DEFINITELY read better books. By the end of this one I was thoroughly disgusted with most of the characters. If you must read it, get it from the library. It isn't worth buying."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I suggested this book for my book club's November read for selfish motives. After living in Japan, about 40 min. by train from Kyoto, for 2 years I was eager to reimmerse in their aesthetic culture. I have walked down the same streets where Sayuri's character lived in Gion and it was wonderful for me to relive my memories through her story. I did know that a geisha was not a prostitute, but I learned so much more and felt that Golden captured the spirit of the Japanese psyche or soul. I miss Japan very much and at least I was able to visit again by reading this book. The focus on appearances is very prevalent in Japanese culture, and also the fleetingness of beauty/youth. The author did a great job in his research and understanding."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Man, I love this book. A juicy memoir, full of flesh and curves, sweet and chewy. The wording was great, the stories fun, the intimate cat-fights were entertaining. I would read this book again, except I find the length to be a bit overwhemling. Nevertheless, a great New York Times novel that isn't like all the other trashy junk on the list."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought this with little insight as to what was held within its pages. But when I got home, I couldn't stop reading it. I showed it to my japanese teacher, and he said it was very good. Now it is my battle against boredom, because I can get lost into it many times."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Refeshing after so many of the &quot;same old-same old&quot; novels. To learn what the life of a geisha was like was interesting. I was surprised that my notion of the geisha being a common prostitute was incorrect. A great story, funny, sad... a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"finished the book about ten minutes ago. i'm still under the influence... it is THAT good. marcela halmagean"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Very interesting and detailed treatment of geisha life, but plot builds tension only to waste it on hurried and disappointing conclusion. I heard the author speak and he said he spent 9 years working on this book, but he should have spent more time thinking about how he was going to bring it to a conclusion. First 2/3 of the book is 5 stars, but last 1/3 is 1 star, with steady decline over that period. Still worthwhile, but the good aspects of the first portion make the denouement even more of a let down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is one of my favorites. Arthur Golden's writing is exquisite. The metaphors he used were so vivid that I would often re-read them several times, in awe of the clarity with which he describes the feelings we have all felt at some point in our lives."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Before devouring this book in less than two days, I thought of geishas as weak and subservient &quot;delicate flowers&quot;. How surprising and heartening it was to find that the delicacy is an illusion carefully created by very clever women to mask the intelligence and wit with which they manipulate difficult circumstances to their best advantage. Sayuri's story is told with the fascinating detail a close friend would reveal in an intimate conversation. I wanted to linger in her world for a long time. Unfortunately, I couldn't stop turning the pages to make the story last."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this story. I learned something about a dying Japanese tradition and felt for a moment that I was living in Kyoto in the early 1900s. I wish that Golden had spent more time on the relationship with the chairman as it was so much a part of her life and everything she did. But definitely an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I never read a book more wonderful than this one.You get caught up in it in the first paragraph.Read the book ,You'll like it.I promise."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this very much. Golden has a gift with the language and a lovely weight to his prose. The story never really seems to wind itself up and Sayuri doesn't seem to grow and change much as a person, but maybe that's Golden's restraint showing itself--after all, it's supposed to be a memoir, not a fable. It's well worth your time and I've read my copy over twice (and marked it up fairly well with my trusty pencil!)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a high school and community college English instructor. I had read and heard many positive reviews of the novel and therefore, decided to read it. I found myself thoroughly engrossed with Sayuri's successes and failures, so much so, that I finished the entire novel in a few days. It is a lovely and informative tale that has prompted me to further study Japanese literature and history."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After reading this book, I read the summary about the author and boy was I surprised! A white male writing about the intimate details of a geisha? I don't know anything about geisha's but this author painted a pretty picture of the life of a geisha. It was truly enchanting to look into another culture and another life. Geishas as presented in the book were so valued and of such high status that it makes me wonder about values today since clearly here prostitutes don't come close to being valued as geishas are. It was a truly enjoyable book and I'm glad that I read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm not the sort of reader that demands action or high drama on every page, but I think a book ought to be going somewhere and this Geisha's story never really arrives. Seems like the real lesson about geishas is that it's an utterly superficial and subservient world, ultimately. Not the stuff of a great novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a book which draws you totally into the life of the main character, Sayuri. She is a strong character who manages to rise above her humble origins. Although her profession requires her to make herself available to men, she is able to hold back something of her inner self. The reader is able to glimpse a world that is so exotic, you find it almost unbelievable. Yet we know that until after the second World War this was a life lead by many young Japanese women."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is an excellent book about a little girl who was sold by her parents. She grows up to be a geisha - high end prostitute. This book is not about prostitution or lame commentaries on prostitution. This book is about a little girl's dream and her pursuit of love. One of the best books of the decade!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I finally broke down and bought this book after trying to borrow it for 7 months! I'm glad I did. I lived near Kyoto for three years, and the description and imagery in this book are superb. The minute details in this story remind one of Dickens, and the story is just a plain good read. Get it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a captivating story from the first moment. We lived in the shoes of this young girl and felt her experiences as she grew up and became a well-known Geisha. All the questions were answered about who these women really are!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a high school student who is a voracious reader on the side. When I picked up this book, I read it from cover to cover during Christmas vacation. I cried, I laughed, I was spellbound. This book will appeal to mass audiences, from literary critics all the way to students like me. Read this book not because it is on the bestseller lists or you read a profile on the author, read it because you want to be transported to another place, where women painstakingly paint their faces and have their hair coated in wax and &quot;evil&quot; comes in the form of Hatsumoto!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The detail of geisha life in historical Kyoto was marvelous and drawn with delicate words of detail; however, the ending left me cold. I wanted Sayuri to GROW UP and stay with the man who obviously cared for her throughout her life or perhaps to break off from all pre-existing relationships. The man she ended up with was a 2 dimensional, charicature of a man. However, I enjoyed the detail immenseley, especially of the kimono worn by the geisha. Beautifully detailed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I passed over this book several times when choosing a new read. Finally, I bought it in an airport. This book is engrossing, well-written, and was extremely difficult to put down. It has been passed around to several of my friends - they all love it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The development of the main character never actualizes her early precocity, and despite all her travails and triumphs I never really cared about her. As a history, it does create the physical flavor of those times. I actually felt as though I had read it before, I don't think it is much different than any other,&quot;Geisha&quot; book I have read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is a beautifully written story that is captivating from the begining. The descriptions are vivid and have stuck with me long after I finished the book -- the tipsy house by the sea, the make-up ritual, the beautiful Kimono's...Anyone looking for great summer reading should look no further. You've found a throughly enjoyable book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought this book to widen my horizons, and because I've always been intrigued by Japanese women and thier cultural standings. I felt this book was well written, I couldn't put it down! Passionate and educational, it makes you want to become a Giesha just to see if you'd survive the training!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The ending was fabulous, it is a great portrayal of a geisha. It brought to the surface so many emotions, emotions of sadness, joy, triumph, but most of all an intriguing novel. I would highly recommend it, it is a book that cannot be put down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I could not put the book down. The author made me feel I was living the life of a Geshia. It was a captivating story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An extremely well written novel that is as captivating as it is brilliant. The characters and places are described in meticulous detail to bring the book to life and to transport the reader to another place and time. It seems like every superlative has been used by readers to describe Memoirs of a Geisha and they are all justified. I particularly enjoyed Memoirs of a Geisha because of the unique subject matter. Along with Fried Calamari, this is the most original book I have read in quite some time. Most of all this is a very rich novel that any reader will enjoy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found the book totally engrossing - a very interesting, descriptive story about the life of a Geisha. I stayed up all night to read it, but when I reached the end, I was totally disappointed. It was a typical fairy-tale ending where all the loose ends are tied together in one neat little, pat ending. Sigh."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It was difficult for me to put this book down. I don't know if it was because &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; was so easy and facinating to read, or because it was so capitivating I wanted to see what happened next! Through this book I have gained a new level of respect for different human cultures. I already want to read it again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A fascinating insight into the Geisha lifestyle and ethos, this work fails as a novel through one dimensional charcterisation and weak narrative. The rise of the heroine, through the Geisha hierarchy is revealing about that system, but not its main protagonist. The reader simply never feels this is a real peson -merely a useful instrument in Golden's quest to enlighten. One also feels gets the feeling that the author wants us to share his ambiguity about a intriguing, but immoral system of oppression. Part of the general trend to worship everything different from the Western paradigm. For &quot;culture&quot; freaks everywhere"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I could not put this novel down! I commend Arthur Golden for enlightening my &quot;western&quot; mind. I grew up with the knowledge that a geisha was just a Japanese prostitute. How insultingly incorrect for these women without the beatiful choice of freedom that we, as women of the 90's have. I read the ill reviews from those who must be some sort of &quot;scholars&quot; in the field of literature. But, none the less, I'm glad we are able to voice our opions (good or bad), unlike the geisha Arthur Golden taught me about. Thank you Mr. Golden for sharing this bitter-sweet novel of a time past. I am aware that the author could not possibly have put in every detail of the geisha, as some have felt was a &quot;lack of depth&quot; in this novel. Why take the artistic talent and analyze it to that sort of depth? We are not all made of the same mold (thank goodness for this). I share the same feeling, in that, I didn't want this book to end. But, none the less, all good things must come to an end. Mr. Golden, you have given to me a new and more powerful understanding of what &quot;geisha&quot; entails.

I was educated, entertained and artfully seduced into becoming an ally for this young girl to achieve her hearts desire. I enjoyed this book immensly and was saddened when I reached the end because I will miss the characters."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The author has obviously done a lot of research, and the memoir gimmick and the details of geisha life were interesting. But there was no story here, and there so easily could have been. The poor little heroine is saved by her fairy godmother and prince charming. We're expected to love her for that -- never mind that she herself is cruel and dishonest to the very people who have been kind to her, or that, even though she once considered death preferable to life as a maid, we never once hear her worrying about any other maids after she herself is &quot;promoted.&quot; This could have been a terrific book if the complete failure to discuss the moral questions is revealed as the oppressor-identification one might expect, if there had been a change in tone when we reach WWII, and Sayuri got some perspective on her world. Instead, she learns nothing and inexplicably returns, without even any discussion of the choice, to the geisha life she once risked her life to escape. Likewise, we never learn why she forgot all about her sister, how the other geisha found themselves &quot;in the life,&quot; what happens to geisha who do escape, and other really interesting possibilities. It's also disturbing to see this institution (so it's not exactly prostitution -- it's more like courtesan culture -- big deal) romanticized to the point where so many readers fell in love with it. Set it in the US instead of an exotic location, take away the fun descriptions of clothes and hairstyles, and what you have left is the kidnapping, sexual abuse, and slavery of young children."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was sad and depress when i have actually finish the book. I WANT MORE... It is as if i have been part of the life of Sayuri. i wish that i could go back and finally be able to admire one of the Geisha. I finally discover the world of the Geisha the way my Japenese friends have been describing it to me. Thank you Mr Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you're looking for a novel about geisha culture, you've got the right book, but be prepared to get swept up in a romantic story, as well. I'm not particularly fond of romance novels but I found myself rooting for Sayuri. Once I was done, I did have to go back to the acknowledgements just to make sure that it was fiction. Thank you Mr. Golden for writing a book that is still in my head two weeks after I finished it, I love it when that happens."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"To those readers who say that it is surprising that the &quot;memoirs&quot; were written by a man, I offer the following rebuttal:The author stereotypes women's emotions as the soap opera like manipulations of exaggerated characters like Hatsumomo (the conflicts are external rather than internal) ; he rationalizes his inability to imagine Sayuri's inner life by saying that a woman of her type wouldn't reveal herself too much (see Amazon's interview with Golden) in a memoir; he fails to imagine Sayuri's possible maternal instincts or fear of pregnancy; he suggests that female love is obsessive and idealized as in Sayuri's love for the Chairman, another stereotype; he suggests that Sayuri feels physical aversion towards Nobu but in general I think men (more so than women) want the object of love to be physically appealing.I think the book succeeds at the level of journalism but is seriously flawed as a novel. It tries to imitate Dickens in its depiction of a child being exploited by a heartless adult world, its use of nicknames and epithets for characters, and the revelation of mysterious benefactors. However, Dickens is an outmoded model for a contemporary novel.Another criticims I have is the conscious attempt to trick readers into believing that the work is nonfiction rather than fiction, a trend we have seen with &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot;'s journals and the author placing himself at the scene in &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; when he wasn't there. A novel should rely on being true to experience and not to try to deceive readers through gimmicks such as the phony translator's message at the beginning.The novel is worth reading in spite of its serious flaws if the reader maintains some critical judgment and doesn't accept it all as &quot;truth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was moved with every line of this queit thriller. The wisedom and tenderness of Sayuri is displayed through out the story. I learned to appreciate the 'mysterious' world of Geisha and even searched for more information about Gion and Geisha culture. The story of Sayuri is fascinating."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Reading this was a bit like reading a good summer novel without much depth. It was interesting but too good vs. evil. Character development was quite weak with little understanding of the characters of the men that Sayuri was drawn to. In particular the feelings for the Chairman are not well developed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I kept thinking to myself: how can I be enjoying a novel abbout a Geisha? But Arthur Golden has done his homework. And the whole comes together, utlimately as a remarkable story about a character you will never forget. I love William Faulkner, and Arthur Golden is a story-teller in the tradition of Falukner."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is an excellent book that was nearly impossible for me to put down once I had started reading it. I HIGHLY recommend this to the serious reader who is looking for something different from the usual memoir-type books."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs Of A Geisha does not need an articulate and witty review, like most of the reviews I just read. It is simply, a really good book. I think anyone who likes to read will love this book. This book would appeal to readers ranging from Jane Austen to Danielle Steele. I think the coolest thing about this book is that A non- japenese GUY wrote it. This book will take you to another level!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Not since my childhood introduction to the &quot;classics&quot; have I been so intrigued by a novel. I cannot recall the last time I found myself in possession of such a brilliantly told story, narrated by an equally accomplished author. Golden has created a masterpiece filled with both historical integrity and human dignity. I found myself slowing the pace of my reading to prolong my interest and pleasure, while learning to appreciate the complexities of this beautiful, if not at times, cruel culture. I have recommended this book to every woman I know."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is why I was told never to read the back of a book. Although the story and plot line is involving and thought provoking, this book was ultimately a disappointment. The intricate details and nuances that pack this book evoke vivid imagery but some of it is unecessary and can grow tiresome towards the end. It also causes the pace to be even and consistant to a fault. There's a lack of complexity in the characters; they're shallow, contrived and 2-dimensional. I don't think any of them show much mental growth and self-awareness. The writing and the metaphors felt stereotypically eastern; Golden does not overall convince me that this is a Japanese voice, let alone female. And, I could not believe the happy ending. In &quot;a decade of crushed hopes,&quot; Sayuri's dream comes ture. How romantic. How typical. How trite, even though it was that only part of the book that was not predictable. I wondered when I was finished, why this book had to be a fictional memoir. This book was an easy and quick read. It was interesting, but maybe for the sole reason that I was not too familiar w/the geisha culture. The provacative, exotic subject matter and the lack of exposure most westerners have to the culture seem to be the largest contributing factors to the success of the book. There are memorable and shining moments sprinkled throughout; however, it is not that well written and the plot could have been more subtly composed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was skeptical when I started reading, mainly because of a negative review I'd read months before casting doubts on Arthur Golden's qualifications to write from a Japanese woman's point of view. The reviewer didn't know what he/she was talking about. I've lived in Japan for 10 years and while my main acquaintance with the world of geisha is through Liza Dalby's wonderful \`\`Geisha,'' I couldn't fault Golden on authenticity about Japan. After the first 90 pages or so of darkness I though this better lighten up soon or I don't think I can take it. But I really couldn't put it down. Beautiful and satisfying."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What is there to say about this novel? Words alone cannot describe the incredible imagery, use of metaphor, vivid narration, and all-around brilliance that makes &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; what it truly is. A magnificently beautiful and fascinating accomplishment from a writer with an other-worldly gift. The characters are always captivating and truly unforgettable...Sayuri, Mameha, Hastumomo, the Chairman, Nobu, Pumpkin, Satsu, Tanaka, Mother--is it humanly possible not to be moved by them all? I know my life has been changed by this wondrous work, and I will be forever haunted by its magical examinations of joy, despair, power, cruelty, friendship, yearning, and the quest for a better life. Brilliant and beautiful beyond belief."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The quality of Golden's writing is far superior to so much of the schlock out there right now. I was fascinated by the story from the very beginning and held to the very end. Excellent story!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is one of the most engaging reads ever. Teeming with evocative images and haunting characters, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; envelopes you immediately into the mysterious world of the geisha.

Its pace is brisk and leaves you wanting more at the finish, which comes much too soon.

I've never been to Japan, but I feel I know exactly how it looks, feels, and smells -- all through the eyes of a young Japanese girl.

I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The imagery and descriptive qualities used by Golden in this novel allows the reader to be transported to Gion and lives the life through the geisha's eyes as if they were your own.

But after only a few pages, I could not take my hands off hte book. It captivated me from beginning to end, and gave me a new appreciation for every aspect of Japanese culture. Soon, you don't even care what page you're on, or what time it is back in the real world. At times, I read until 3am. And I never have before. The poetry and beauty of the book made me sympathize wiht the characters, hate the characters, and fall in love with the characters. This book made fish, dresses, and make up see, more than amazing. I could smell the fish in the villages, and feel the cake of the make up on my face. I more than loved this book, I felt this book. And I not only read it fast, it has once again made me a reader. Thank you Arthur Golden!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Many people have reviewed this book as if it were traditional Japanese literature. That is probably not a good idea considering it is a nonfiction novel. I read this book for a great story and that is exactly what I got. It was written with a very simple style and the story flowed quite magnificently. I read the entire 400+ pages in 2 working days. It was fabulous."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I first learned about this book from listening to Arthur Golden's interview on National Public Radios' &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. A story about a Geisha written in first person by a western MAN sounded intriguing. A most difficult feat, but Golden manages to pull it off. In the interview, Golden described how he completed the research for this book and why his earlier attempt at writing in another voice besides first person failed. The details Golden adds when describing the rituals and training of young Sayuri, the Geisha-to-be is what I enjoyed most about this book. The Geisha tradition is very foreign to me as an American who has never traveled to the far east, and has limited exposure to Asian culture, firsthand. The story of Sayuri's life is very sad, but the reader is rooting for this strong willed woman to survive and overcome the tragedies of her early life. I think this book is destined to be a classic like Pearl Buck's &quot;The Good Earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A wonderful story that takes you right into the world of a Geisha.

A spellbinding novel if you enjoy living vicariously. A little predictable here and there, but I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book at first seemed to me like a modern-day Dicken's novel. I couldn't putit down. I read all 430 pages in three days. The problem is that after the great story development at the beginning of the novel, the last half of the novel is not that informative and, in fact, quite boring. In the end I really feel that for all I learned about geisha, I really didn't learn that much at all!! What do they do during the day, except pine for men old enought to be their grandfathers? After me initial excitment it was with much dissapointment that I finished this novel. I wish a woman had written this insipid drivel so that I could stop hearing about how well Golden writes a female character."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha began as a masterpiece. Arthur Golden takes the reader on a spectacular journey through the world of a young Geisha. However, I must agree with another reviewer in that the book ends far too abrubtly. I does seem as though the author simply got tired of writing and decided to wrap things up - very disappointing. I would've like to have seen the book end with the same gripping storytelling as it began. Other than that, I really enjoyed reading this book and have recommended it to several friends."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha, by Arthur Golden, is a very exciting novel. It's a novel that's full of passions, feelings, and sad moods which make readers want to keep reading to discover what's going to happen next. Also, Arthur Golden, provides lots of details for each event, and he discusses it smoothly with feelings and actions. Memoirs of a Geisha is about a young girl who got traded by her father and by the person that she admired; therefore, this incident changed her life. Because of all the exciting events and feelings, I highly recommened this novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book captivated me like no other. The language was beautiful and I really felt as though I had travelled to Kyoto. The smells, tastes, sights...But I guess Mr. Golden was behind on his deadline because the last pages were weak, vague, and unimpressive to this beautiful tale.Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a much celebrated book, just about everyone I know has a copy of it on their shelves. (note how many reviews were written) And I do not deny that I enjoyed it. The writing gets into you into the head of a Geisha, her hopes fears, wishes, dreams (blah blah blah). And also does not do a bad job of writing as a woman. (Not a terrific job, but not a bad job). Portraying what I would imagine to be a very realistic world of Geishas (past).And then the ending undoes all of the sympathy and warmth I felt for the character. She becomes very shallow and munipulative. Almost as if the writer got bored, gave up and wanted to end the book. I, like many other readers, would have liked to see a different ending.If I were to just rate the first 2/3rds of the book I would give it SIX stars. I still recommend the book, but warn against the end, what a let down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have never been so mezmerized by the colour of a persons eyes, especially when they are only seen in my mind. the way this book is discribed is so wantingly believable, you never want it to end.I can't discribe my disappointment as i was getting to the last pages,i wanted it to go on and onlike a really good day. the depictions of beauty, love, hate, and cruelty were so real yet so surreal to a person who can't fathom such hardship in thier own life were comparable to angelas ashes which is a true story. I'de like this to be a commentarary rather then a review so i could tell the author about all the bits and pieces of the book i enjoyed so much, but i know i can give nothing away. Suffice it to say if you really want to be swept away by a book you must read this one, it is the first one i have been motivated enough to need to talk about after the last page was read at 2:30 am. hence , iwrote this review."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was truly one of the best and most captivating books I have ever read. It was WONDERFUL! As soon as I finished it, I passed it on to my mom and she said the same. I recommend you to go out and buy it immediately. The story of Sayuri's life was so moving and it also gave the reader a good deal of knowledge about the type of life a geisha lives. BUY IT!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Highly engrossing from the very first page, Mr. Golden has painted a picture of a geisha's training for us. One thinks of beautiful Japanese women who would do anything at a whim, all sorts of exotic and erotic things. What we learn is that is not the case at all. We follow the tale of Sayuri beginning at age 9 when she is sent to live with a 'geisha' family. She then begins the vigorous training involved in becoming a geisha, learning many arts like dancing, music, the art of conversation, culture and much more. We learn what it is like to put on the kimonos, much more involved than I would have thought, the intense rivalry between the geisha, the superstition of the geisha, and much more. This book reads like it could have been Sayuri's biography, which in a way it is. A first rate debut for Mr. Golden, I look forward to many more novels by him."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"WOW. Is all i can say at the moment. Took me a few days to finish it with my schedule but I was impressed. I heard a movie is in the making as well as another book following this one by a true Geisha. I was definately into the story and trying to picture what GION would really look like in person as well it being surrounded in Geisha;s. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was absolutely fantastic. Not only does this book have an original, exciting plot, it is extremely informative and teaches about the process of being a geisha in Japan. I recommend this book to all my friends because it's an around fascinating book. It's interesting to me as well how Arthur Golden could write the book, being a man. I can't believe he can get inside the mind of a woman like he did. This book is great, read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book so much that I am ordering it today in hardcopy! It is truly an amazing story. I recommend it to everyone I know...male and female. It's a book that I will never forget and will read again and again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur GoldenSteph's Rating: 3.5 stars Overall Rating 3.5 StarsReview:Memoirs of a Geisha follows the life of a girl named Chiyo, who is sold into the geisha business by her parents and taken to geisha central, the Gion district of Kyoto. She is separated from her sister and has no choice but to become a geisha herself if she wishes to survive. The training is not easy and pressures from her senior geishas and \\"buyers\\" don't help relieve her burden. She is renamed Sayuri upon her \\"graduation\\" from her geisha studies, and now must spend her life entertaining the men who visit the Tea Houses of Gion and weaving her way through her deceptive rivals.I was very torn about this book after reading it. I can understand why people think it is so controversial. On one side, I thought it was a literary sensation that brings you into the Japanese side of things during World War II. It does show the hardships of it's citizens, both rich and poor, and the prejudices they receive. It also clears up some of the misconceptions of the geisha business: geisha's are not prostitutes, contrary to popular western belief. No doubt it was quite well written; Arthur Golden's writing flows and it really was able to draw me in. Since this book is, after all, a memoir, it is told from the perspective of a 60 year old Sayuri looking back into her life. There are lots of time skips, but Golden created smooth transitions. I found myself wanting to know what happened next in Sayuri's life all the time, and I do admit that I stayed up late to finish this book.On the other side though, I thought it was too americanized. Golden made the U.S. seem like some shining star in the midst of a dark world to all of our Japanese characters. The characters always praised America, and their \\"amazing cities\\". Japan wasn't as well off as America at the time this book takes place in since WWII was just finishing, but I didn't like how Golden made America seem very arrogant. I really enjoyed this book while I was actually reading it, but once I stopped and really looked back on what I just read, I found it to be a little unrealistic too. Sayuri, a Japanese girl, has blue eyes (again, americanized), and somehow manages to fall in love with a man who is around 15 years older than her just because he comforted her when she was crying. In this book, we learn that geisha's are not allowed to fall in love since it will hinder their work. There is an example of this, when one of Sayuri's senior geisha falls in love, but is later found out and beaten because of it. It is painfully obvious that Sayuri loves this man, but I just found it irritating that no one else seemed to notice it. Golden just makes Sayuri \\"too special\\" for my tastes, because in reality, nobody would be as lucky as her.Nonetheless, it was a great story while it lasted, and was quite thought-provoking throughout. I would say to put this on your to-read list, but you don't have to scramble to a bookstore to read it right away. I think it is a book that people should read at least once.--Steph @ A Walk on Words"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I absolutely loved this book, I saw the movie years ago and I loved the it.

The research must have been exhausting. The novel is quite memorable; I read it in only two or three days because I found it difficult to put down.The only thing I would've liked is for the Chairman to have been a more developed character. He is not three-dimensional in this novel, although his character is essential to the plot. His sketch isn't nearly as rich as any of the others -- he's more of a cardboard cut-out of a character. I had trouble finding out exactly what it is that Sayuri loves about him so much. Is it simply because he was kind to her once on a bridge? Does that encompass him?All in all, though, this book is one I'll remember. The movie doesn't do the book justice, but I think it would difficult to make the film as memorable as the movie, no matter who starred, directed or produced it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I listened to the audio version.

Sayuri, the protagonist in the novel helps us understand the complicated and complex world that geishas live, and the do's and don't they need to follow in their chosen profession.This was one of those books that I had to finish reading within a couple of days. Being a history buff and being familiar with history of Japan, I was still not prepared for some of the social history that Golden reveals in this book. I had to take breaks every now and then to absorb the details. The storyline was not complicated, but it was the details that I needed to pay attention. Be careful there are some details and practices outlined in this book can leave you mildly shocked.I am not sure how the book will translate into the film version.

This novel is like taking a trip back in time to another world. This book was recommended to me by one of my teachers. I really had no idea what it was about when I first held it in the palm of my hands. From the moment I began reading it, the story grabbed my attention. The book first takes place in Yoroido, a small town in Japan. Two young girls are the main characters; Chiyo-chan is the youngest sister of Satsu-san. The girl's mother is dying, and the father is having a hard time supporting the children. A very prosperous man, named Mr. Tanaka, sees that the children should not be living where they are. He then takes them away from their home, very far away, to begin their life as Geishas. The two sisters are torn apart from each other and sent to different places to be taught the ways of becoming a Geisha. Chiyo-chan is sought to be far more beautiful than her older sister Satsu-san, and is therefore being sent to a higher ranking Okiya than her sister. If they do anything wrong there they will get beat. After much time spent at Okiya, the girls change drastically.

I found myself being introduced to a foreign culture, and Arthur Golden does an excellent job of relating the reader to the characters. I learned so much about Japanese culture and the life of a geisha. \\"The author's beautiful prose took me back to a time and place of hanging lanterns, and of course, geisha. This book does a good job of showing that geisha are not prostitutes, like so many people think, but are rather dignified entertainers (Sanchez 2003, 1).\\" I agree with this quote. The author definitely has beautiful, and yet simple and easily comprehensible, prose. His detailed writing helps to bring the foreign culture alive for the reader. Also, he does dispel many common misconceptions about geisha, including the thought that they are prostitutes. He shows us the many aspects of a geisha's life. I felt very connected to Sayuri's trials, successes and experiences. The ending, while disappointing, could have been worse. The main disappointment is that the ending came off without a hitch, unlike most of Sayuri's other experiences. I expected some sort of hitch, and I was disappointed that the ending seemed a bit fairy-tale like.

I loved the overall plot and descriptiveness of the book, especially since I was reading about a completely different culture (Japanese) than my own. I also loved this novel because it showed the life of a Geisha and what being a Geisha meant - the book detailed all the training they underwent, schooling, what was important, how the world viewed them. This book was full with drama and action, and I couldn't put it down the first time I read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Read the book (twice actually) and was impressed with the rich wonderful descriptions of the environment and characters. An introduction to the pre-WWII Japanese culture.I also have to comment that I thought the movie was faithful to the book. I specially enjoyed Ziyi Zhang's performance as Sayuri."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I started reading this book at the airport, couldn't get into it as easily, my first trip was to California, the usual trip for work, and by then I had gotten more into the story of this poor miserable Sayuri girl. Then I was on my way to Japan where the story takes place, and what's more, I actually visited Gion and I was reading the book during all this time, and I finished it on the train from Kyoto to Tokyo. It made an amazing impression on me as the story went on and I can't tell you what an effect it had when reading it in the country where it was set. I do recommend it, and I can't wait to watch the movie.If you like to read my comprehensive review of Memoirs of a Geisha, please see my blog post below:[...]"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This exquisitely written novel has been one of my favorites for nearly ten years. Geisha culture is as remote from western consciousness as if it were a thousand years ago. Yet Golden's uncanny knowledge of this exotic world, and meticulous attention to detail, transports us to that world as if by magic.Chiyo's harrowing journey, her pain and her triumphs, and her tender, enduring love for a man who once showed her a bit of kindness, is a touching and gripping testimony to the power of the human heart. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is truly a work of art.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of the most beautifully written novels of the past 20 or more years, and definitely one of my personal favorites. Arthur Golden, a student of Japanese art and language, paints a remarkably true-sounding account of one woman's training and practice as a geisha. There's not a false note in the writing: The characters, dialogue, and emotional content all ring true. Aside from some slightly plodding descriptions of the protagonist's introduction to the geisha district of Gion, the pacing is excellent.I kept waiting for Golden to slip, for some implausibility in character or plot development, some anachronism or \\"artistic license\\" that would have made me feel cheated-but it never happened. Without further research, it's difficult for me to comment on the book's historical and cultural accuracy, but it always felt true, and Golden's simple but powerful language is absolutely compelling. The book surpassed my already high expectations, and increased my appreciation of--and curiousity about--historical Japanese social structure in general, and geisha culture in particular. Above all, this is a completely satisfying book about perseverance within boundaries. Both the story and the writing are filled with grace, power, and beauty."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a &quot;gaijin&quot; (foreigner) who spent 6 years in Japan and had ample opportunity to witness many of its social customs, I think it's worth noting that the setting Mr. Golden creates in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; is very much of a Japan gone by. This is sad. It is precisely the aspects of Sayuri's world that are the most exotic to us which exemplify the best of what is uniquely Japanese. Modern Japanese cherish the remnants of that romantic past the same way that Americans revere tales of our pioneering forbears--as a way to hold on to, and honor all that was poetic and noble about ourselves.I think it also bears mentioning that the average Japanese person today knows almost as little about the life of a typical geisha as the average Westener. Geisha entertainment has always been the province of extremely wealthy, powerful men--going to a teahouse to be entertained by geisha served the same function for a Japanese VIP that a British one would find at his tony men's club. Throughout the centuries that Japan's entertainment quarters--&quot;the flower and willow world&quot; as they call it--has existed, the number of patrons who could afford top-notch geisha entertainment for themselves and their friends has been an exclusive club indeed. In today's highly Westernized and technology-worshipping Japan, the idea of a geisha party is nearly as anachronistic and unattainable as it is here. Geisha belong to the same catagory as cowboys, knights on horseback and damsels-in-distress: cultural icons who have no place in the modern world. Mr. Golden does a superb job of capturing some of the magic of Sayuri's metier for those of us who will never have the opportunity to witness it firsthand. Sayuri and her fellow geisha may be trained from birth to be beautiful flowers, but they are also very human &quot;working girls&quot; (and I don't mean that in the sense of prostitute) Although there is an ever-present sexual overtone to the role of geisha, 99% of the time it is subliminal rather than overt, which I think Mr. Golden makes clear. I agree with one of the other reviewers who equated a geisha mistress with a Western &quot;trophy wife&quot;. This is a very apt description. While wives are chosen for their docility, domestic skills, and breeding potential, a geisha mistress provides color, dash and sexual sauce for those who are lucky enough to afford them. However, in today's economy, a man would have to sport a bankroll the size of Donald Trump's to be a serious contender for a geisha mistress.Geisha are not flourishing these days, but a few communities still survive in major Japanese cities. For an excellent, highly readable treatment of the &quot;modern&quot; geisha (if this is not an oxymoron!) I highly recommend Liza Dalby's book &quot;Geisha.&quot; The author was the only Western woman ever or since to apprentice as a Kyoto geisha, so she knows what she is talking about."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book! From the minute I picked it up I couldn't put it down. It tells the story of a young girl sold into geisha training in Japan. I had no idea how much of an art form geisha was in this pre-WWII setting Gion and it was very interesting to learn so much more about it through the eyes of a young girl caught up in it. Sayuri is a wonderfully drawn character with a wide range of emotions as she endures cruelty, jealousy, misery and a whole new way of life and comes to accept it, excel in it and even embrace it. Particularly intriguing are the questions and conflicts raised by the novel about destiny, love, survival and tradition. The movie is coming out in December so I highly recommend reading it now."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a twentysomething Irishman who's only ever lived in the UK, my contact with traditional Japanese culture, society and history is, as you can imagine, scant. However, Golden's classic 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is so beautifully crafted, and so powerfully descriptive, that even my bare knowlege of Japanese history is extended by having read it.It's the fictional story, cleverly told from an autobiographical point of view, of one of Japan's most famous and enthralling Geisha, a woman of a profession commonly mistaken for prostitution (Golden draws some clever and insightful distinctions between the two, both in general and specifically). Sayuri tells her story from her humble beginnings as Chiyo, the daughter of an impoverished fisherman, through desperation, war and trial, to the final happy ending.For a man to write so convincingly as a woman is a very rare thing - Nick Hornby's 'How to be Good' is an example of how it can go wrong - but for an American man to write so beautifully and convinvingly as a Japanese woman from a highly secretive society is an unequivocal triumph. We believe, from the first few chapters, that Sayuri is this observant, silent little thing, a lower-class child facing the arduous and enforced task of becoming a Geisha. We are there with her when she is sold into servitude, when she attempts a failed escape, when she eventually becomes a successful geisha - all thanks to Golden's rare gift for combining a strong plot with incredible descriptive prose. You can smell the incense and see the kimono as Sayuri is preparing to go to work. It's a strange, wonderful style of writing - set at a slow pace (after all, this is the story of a life from start to near-finish), Golden neatly sidesteps any sort of flagging pace by creating some hugely memorable characters - Auntie, Mameha, Mother and the destructive Hatsumomo - and giving them fully-realised personalities. The consistency with which Golden creates these women is admirable - after a while we feel we know them. Their reactions and situations seem perfectly reasonable to us, thanks to excellent character construction and atmospheric prose.An epic, enthralling and sensitive novel, 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is a huge recommendation for anybody fond of novels, epics and truly exceptional examples of fiction."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is good but the Kindle version has a typo every 3 or 4 pages. It's clearly been electronically scanned and not proof read.This really slows down the reading of the book and, for me, removes lots of enjoyment: after pondering over why it says \\"stem\\" instead of \\"stern\\", or \\"fee! happy\\" rather than \\"feel happy\\", or why there are random full stops in the middle of the sentences, the pleasure of reading the text is removed.As the Kindle version costs the same as the print copy I would expect a similar about of quality control as a book would receive."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is extraordinary, combining highly literary style with unusual subject matter, the world of the geisha. No, geishas are not high-class prostitutes, nor are they femmes fatales -- there is no comparable class of woman in Western society. In this piece of virtual historical fiction, we follow the life of a highly successful geisha from the time she was taken away from her parents at age 9 before the Depression. . . to her old age in Manhattan in modern times. Most of the story centers on the geisha's coming of age, struggles with other women and search for love (of sorts) during the 1930s and 1940s. Not only do we get inside the head and heart of one deeply sensitive woman in her particular world, but also see reflected the characteristic grace, stoicism and politeness of Japanese culture. We certainly would not wish to be a geisha. Yet,as we read through this gripping account, we couldn'tt help but wonder whether today's Western woman isn't &quot;kept&quot; in other ways. Finally, the author deals eloquently with Japanese spirtuality, and the protaganist's struggle to find meaning in her life and to deal with the loss of her family and other misfortunes in her childhood.This is a one-of-a-kind and beautifully written book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel rings false among Japanese. The reason is simple: Golden's &quot;exotic&quot; setting is not exotic for Japanese people. While I was reading this, I looked for something beyond the exotic setting because Golden's details in culture are what I'd already known. Yet, I found that it was empty under the skin!Yes, you can think that this novel is quite accurate, but don't think that Japanese people act like Golden's characters. Although Golden did a great job on creating an exotic setting, he failed to capture people who lived through the emperor system, the WWII, and the arival of democracy. This is the prime reason why Japanese people don't like this book.Anyway, I am glad that this book is popular among American people and they are more interested in our culture. There has been an invisible big gap between America and Japan, but Golden seems to have made a bridge inbetween."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a Japanese college student now studying in Tokyo. I was born and brought up in Kyoto so I know most of the things the author mentioned in this story. They mede me recall Kyoto city, and made me prond of Kyoto.This is a story of one geisha as the title goes. I am not sure how the term 'geish' is regarded in foreign countries and I wondered if it is just the same as Sayuri reffered to in this story. For Kyoto people, geisha is a symbol of elegent things and we do not have any bad image toward them, of course. Because of how they behave and how they look, we tend to see them 'weak' because once it was regarded good. (I cannot tell if it is still like that even now.) And I thought that they are frail and elegant - but I found another beauty toward this book. I found another beauty that woman have. It is not the weakness - but we cannot say it is strength. Something else. I cannot find a good term toward it, however I admit you can see many beauty in this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This first book by American writer Arthur Golden is an extremely easy read - a page-turner for sure - and all in all it presents an intriguing Japanese Cinderella story. Mr Golden has also made quite an amazing attempt at literary personification.Yet, I never quite felt that it was \\"dictated\\" by a true Kyoto geisha. Instead, I continually had the feel that the story was told through Western eyes masqurading as Oriental eyes. I cannot quite put my finger on it - perhaps it was the superfluous use of the \\"Japanese\\" aligories along with the overly descripted kimonoes - however, the story seemed to be too American-made... Moreover, several of the characters were in my opinion quite one-dimensional. Surely there must have been more to a geisha such as Hatsumomo besides her beauty and cruelty? Or to the mean greedy Mother? Or to the lovely and kind Mameha?Oh well - I did in fact quite like the story and particularly the descriptions of pre-WW2 Japan. Also, the presentations of the various cultural rituals, including the elegant tea ceremonies, were delightful reading.This is one of those books that makes you want to find more literature and facts about its subject matter - I can't wait to read more (hopefully authentic) descriptions about Geisha life. Memoirs of a Geisha is like a juicy appetizer that leaves you hungry for the main dish.I recommend the book despite its shortcomings. I have not yet seen the movie; however, I cannot wait to see the sure-to-be delightful Geisha dancing and elaborate costumes..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Reading about this beautiful gray/blue eyed child moved me to the point of tears. Arthur S. Golden (from my hometown of Chattanooga, TN) has done a masterfull job of research for this novel. I picked the book up on a Thursday afternoon, and was finished Friday morning. The trials this child went through at the hands of the owners of the Geisha house and the top Geisha in that house was so painful, at times I found myself enraged at fictional characters. Every part of this novel was so detailed, it ws as if Chiyo/Sayuri was alive and part of my life. Mr. Golden put you in the story, watching this young beauty go through each day, trial, tribulation,and finally, success. Seeing her become the &quot;ultimate&quot; geisha was such a pleasure. At the end of the novel, I was brought to tears because Sayuri was not a real person. I wanted so badly to be able to call New York and speak with this Goddess whom had achieved so much. From a fisherman's daughter to the most well-known Geisha in the world. Mr. Golden, congratulations on bringing this woman to life for so many of us. I must say this is one of the top 10 books, out of hundreds, I have ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Boy was I disappointed. Don't get me wrong, Golden know's his stuff. He has a thorough knowledge of Japanese Culture and History. But, I just felt so misled, when I realized that what I thought was going to be a an enlightening and entertaing read, turned out to be a thinly disguised 400+ page Harlequin Romance. It started out as such a charming story, but the subplot with the Chairman was so annoying, and the ending just ruined the whole thing for me."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The journey with Sayuri was well worth it. I ached for her most of the time, but savoured in her tiny bit of joy too. I like to send books that I've read off to friends in far away places, but my problem here is that I know too many people who would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was an interesting look into the life of a Geisha,but not a great novel. Where is the passion? Definitely not from a womans perspective."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"While I enjoyed the novel, I kept wishing there was an accompanying photo book, showing photos of various kimonos, Kyoto before the war, pre- and post-war geishas, their environment and their patrons."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is beautifully and emotionally written. You are drawn into Sauyri's world from the beginning until the poignant end. You'll be up all night reading, I know I was!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The first third of Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is a fascinating look at a veiled culture - that of the geisha. Golden allows us to learn about geishas along with Sayuri, the main character, and his picture of their lives and customs is fascinating and may well be accurate, given the author's degrees in Japanese art and history. Certainly the book has an authentic feel and an eye for detail that results in a rich, textured work.Unfortunately, Golden seems much less comfortable with plotting a novel than with Japanese culture; as the plot gathers speed, the book degenerates. Memoir goes from a sublime and fascinating glimpse into a world most readers will never see to a slighty-better-than-usual treatment of an exceedingly standard and hackneyed plot. Good girl, surrounded by mean and bad people, triumphs and wins the man of her dreams - this was old hat two hundred years ago.The conclusion, in particular, is exceptionally disappointing. For the first four hundred pages, Golden convinces us that Sayuri is a woman of exceptional strength and intelligence; in the last eighty, he expects us to believe that she is neither. Sayuri deserves a better end than this.Read the first two hundred pages of this book and put it down. Anyone with a genuine interest in other cultures or a love for beautifully ornate English will enjoy the first portion of the novel. No one will miss anything by avoiding the last part of it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although it was very well written and it kept my interest, I felt that Golden (a man) wasn't able to convey how the main character (a woman) truly thinks and feels."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a book so. It was fascinating to follow along in a little girl's life through womanhood; the personalities she encountered, particularly other geishas, and the traditions involved with being a geisha. All beautifully written with historical information tied in as a fictional novel. Wonderful reading!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldnt put this book down. Stayed up all night to finish it. The day after i finished it i went back to read the last few chapters. This is one book I am sure to read again as well as share it with all of my friends. I have a wonderful respect for the Geisha, the culture, the mystery."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's amazing that a man and a non-Japanese man no less was able to write so accurately about the Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A fascinating look at Japanese culture in the 20th century and a wonderful story of a woman's life. I felt her fears, her excitements, her sadness. Want to read it again to pick up any details I may have missed. Couldn't believe it was written by a man."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have been only aware of this book for some time because I thought wrongly that it must be just one of the frustratingly shallow Westerners' writings on Japan with much misunderstanding. But I bought it last week in California on my wife's request, and tried to use it as a sleeping pill in my jet lag night. It backfired. The book kept me awake all night. I have seen the diminishing number of respectable geishas for 40 years, mostly in company parties. But this book reinforces all my knowledge of geishas and covers much more I didn't know. Now I have a great respect to the author and this book of the exciting story which I think is very valuable also as the record of vanishing things."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sure, it's a fun read, a good book to take to the beach. The book's best characteristic is the in-depth look at Japanese geisha life of that period. Enjoyable at a certain level, but that's as far as it goes. Our all-women book club read it and a few people loved it (the ladies I privately consider the least sophisticated readers in the group) and the rest of us thought it was a waste of time for the group. Not because it's a terrible book, but it's not substantial enough to sustain a decent discussion. The characters are mostly one-dimensional, the descriptions are lavish but unconvincing, but it is a fascinating subject. My advice -- wait for the movie, then wait for the movie to come out on video."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book chronicles the journey of famous geisha Nitta Sayuri from her humble beginnings as a fisherman's daughter to the glamorous teahouses of Gion. Cinderella-like in plot(poor and pretty heroine, an evil geisha who ill treats her, a fairy-godmother-like good geisha who helps her) it is an interesting narrative of an exotic culture in a time gone by. The writing style is entertaining and the character sketches vivid. Some aspects of the geisha culture fascinate ( the elaborate plotting and planning among geisha for popularity,traditions and training of the geisha) while others shock and disgust the reader unfamiliar with the culture portrayed(e.g.auctioning off the geisha's virginity to the highest bidder,the actual act narrated in a matter-of-fact way by the heroine as if its a ceremony being performed). It paints a picture of a society where a woman's silent servility is unquestioningly accepted.The word 'exploitation' does not enter the picture at all.Sayuri is 'lucky' because she is sold into near-slavery to a geisha house and grows up to become a popular and elegant entertainer of men.Her sister, however,not being blessed with Sayuri's good looks is 'unlucky' and is sold into a cheap brothel. The book makes interesting reading (although the ending seems a bit contrived).Definitely to be recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I didn't like this book. Although I admire Mr. Golden's knowledge and efforts, I must say, as a Japanese woman, that I was very disappointed and somewhat disturbed by this book. The story is unnatural. Sayuri's behavior and emotions are not the ones of a Japanese woman of my grandmother's generation. I couldn't help thinking that something very important was missing throughout the book. People who are interested in Japanese culture should try reading books written by Japanese authors as well."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of the saddest, most inspiring novels I've read in many years. It reminds me of Tolstoy's Anna Kerenina in terms of its grandeur, sweep and tragedy. But unlike Anna, who dies under a train, this is a tale of endurance and triumph.I'm told this is Golden's first novel and I hope it is not his last. That an American man could have written so movingly and eloquently about the life of a little girl growing up in 1930's Japan is astonishing. That the girl, Chiyo, could become the woman, Sayuri, speaks volumes about the many lives we all lead. Fate and choice, destiny and design, irony and mis-direction play powerful and often confusing roles in our lives. Who can say who we may become?Particularly in America, we like to think we are in charge of our own lives because in so many ways, we are. We choose a career or vocation. We decide where, and how we shall live our lives, and yet in the background, fate has a role and destiny plays a hand. In this courageous and wonderful story, Golden paints a remarkable picture of how \\"pluck\\" and \\"luck\\" weave the tapestry of our lives. Certainly, this is not a story of predestination or inevitability. It's a story of courage and endurance, of faith and determination. As my Grandmother might have said, it's a story of \\"playing the hand life has dealt you\\" and \\"making the most of every opportunity.\\" It's a story of over-coming and survival, despite the odds.I'm convinced there is a bit of Sayuri in each of us. We are all born with a variety of advantages and limitations. We are all blessed with opportunities and misfortune beyond anything we deserve and life is the story of how we face this paradox.I consider this to be one of the best, most memorable books I've ever read. Take time to savor it. I suspect this is one I'll remember and ponder for the rest of my life. And, as a final note, if you saw the movie, which was \\"good,\\" be assured the book is infinitely richer, more touching and just plain better! Do yourself a favor and read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It was certainly interesting to learn about a culture I previously knew so little about. The book is well-researched, the plot was engaging and the characters were for the most part believable and interesting.But this book has a number of irksome flaws that a good editor would have and should have insisted Mr. Golden fix before publication, and for me, these flaws diminished enjoyment of this novel quite a bit:1. The metaphors are often forced. Comparisons are made to tatami mats, or rice, or Kabuki actors. Yes, these are interesting images and they contribute to the sense of place and time. But not everything has to be so self-consciously Japanese.2. Some of the attitudes Sayuri (the protagonist) holds towards men and especially sex ring false. It must be difficult for a Western 21st century male to write in the voice of an early-20th-century Japanese female, and I respect Mr. Golden for his attempts. But he fails badly at times. As Mr. Golden tells it, it is as though none of the female characters, including Sayuri, have any sexual feelings at all. And again, many of the metaphors are laughable. The \\"shy eel hiding in the cave\\" bit is particularly embarrassing, and is referred to again and again throughout the book.3. Most of the book is realistic and believable. The sudden fairytale ending, however, is wretched! It's as though Mr. Golden became bored with his story, and just up and wrote \\"and then they lived happily after ever, the end\\" just to be done with it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My ex-coworker told me she was reading Memoirs of a Geisha, a book that our large library system library hadn't ordered even months after it was on the NYT Best Seller list. I think it was because Arizona cowboy-types couldn't relate to Geishas and also the abundance of conservatives here who voted for Bush, weren't attracted to the Geisha (...) thing. My coworker said it was WONDERFUL !!!! , with great emphasis. I wouldn't have \\"read\\" it if I didn't come across it unabridged on tape. I mean, I wouldn't have taken the time read this thick volume on hard copy, as I rarely read fiction. I later turned Geisha onto another friend. They took it on vacation, thought it was WONDERFUL!Well I thought it was wonderful too, an engrossing trip to another world and culture. It was hard to come back to \\"my real world here and now\\", after my reading ssessions, so lost in the Geisha world did I become with that book.The book reviews said the author described the life of a Geisha quite accurately. But what I liked most about the book was it's picturesque writing, choice of words, so......like painting a picture. This is Golden's first book. How does he put those words together to paint such images? Amazing! That in itself is such a work of art, worth reading just for that. I am not one for spending three pages describing the lace on a woman's collar, like Jean Auel does. I don't have patience for that. All I can remember is the length spent on the description of the lace as irritating, not remembering anything about the lace itself. Arthur Golden does does not need lengthy descriptions. His words weave very vivid pictures in your mind, that would cause you to remember the scenes and characters for the rest of your life. I remember reading the same descriptive phrases over and over just to marvel over his sometimes cute and amusing choice of words to paint that picture. Wow! Such talent!At this point, ...has over 1500 reviews.

Lots and lots of beauty.I am not ordinarily a best-seller reader, but this book obviously appeals to a wide array of readers. The carefully researched story is a combination of pure escapist fantasy, poetic language, and historical truth. Author Golden succeeded in creating the crisply real voice of a geisha inside my mind. There is a delightful calm throughout, yet the pace is a softly beating crescendo, as if crafted with the same careful deliberation and grace as an origami crane. It's a treat for all the senses.Great to read if you are planning a trip to Kyoto! (Golden uses specific locations that can still be visited for breathtaking evocation of an era that is pretty much all gone). Popular with men, women, college students, admirers of Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This one has been on my &quot;to read&quot; shelf for more than a year, and I wish now I hadn't waited so long. Sakamoto Chiyo is the daughter of a poor fisherman. Her mother is dying from cancer and neither Chiyo nor her sister have much of a future -- though, of course, it doesn't seem that way to her. But it's 1929 (she's nine years old), and things are about to get much, much harder. Partly for his own (unstated) reasons, partly to rescue his two daughters while he still can, their father sends both girls off to Kyoto to be apprenticed into the geisha trade. Actually, he sells them -- they &quot;belong&quot; to their new mistresses -- but it takes a little while for the reader to realize that. Satsu, the older sister, doesn't meet the requirements and becomes, for awhile, a prostitute, until she manages to run away and essentially disappears from the story, except in Chiyo's mind. But Chiyo herself becomes a maid -- sort of a pre-trainee -- in the okiya of Mother and Auntie, and though she loathes the life, and the loss of her home, and expects nothing good of her own future, she adapts rather quickly. Over the ensuing years, she becomes first an apprentice, then a full geisha, and the story of her training, her growing understanding of her world -- the limits of the geisha-world of the Gion district of Kyoto -- and her understanding and misunderstanding of men makes up the first three-quarters of the book. Golden, a Westerner, nevertheless has considerable experience in and understanding of Japan and the social institutions peculiar to its recent past. He puts you there, looking over Chiyo's shoulder as she attends lessons in flute, shamisen, dance, and tea ceremony, as her name changes to Nitta Sayuri when she becomes a geisha and is adopted as the &quot;daughter&quot; of the okiya, as she learns from her &quot;older sister,&quot; Mameha, and suffers under the thumb of Hatsumomo, the senior geisha of her okiya, and as she forms her lifelong attachment to the Chairman and to the one-armed Nobu-san. Chiyo/Sayuri is a strange (to us) combination of worldliness and sophistication on the one hand and utter naivete and ignorance on the other, as was apparently typical for geisha. She has no idea whether a pound of tea costs more than a broom, but she shows astute knowledge of the history and art of every kimono among the thousands she wears in her young life. And, of course, just as she's nearing adulthood, World War II brings its full weight down upon the ordinary people of Japan, including the geisha. I can't recommend this novel too highly. It also proves once again that Knopf continues to be the premier publisher of high-quality fiction in this country."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was, simply put, wonderful. The narrative was rich with desription and humorous metaphor. I thoroughly enjoyed this peek into the culture and mindset of a woman in pre and post-depression Japan. I found Sayuri to be exotic yet still accessible and likeable. I read it in about four days, the time flew by while I was enthralled by Sayuri. I recommended it to my mother and two best friends who both also gave glorious reviews upon completion.

On one hand, I couldn't put it away until I finished it - it was very engaging and kept me interested until the end. On the other hand, the novel seems to be merely a Japanese version of any of Daniel Steel's stories. It was shallow and I learned nothing about Japanese culture, other than how to wear a kimono. The story was supposed to be a memoirs, but had a fairy-tale ending. There was not a single realistic character. I love the idea behind the novel, but I hate the way it was written. I think the author could have done so much more with this topic. I agree that this was not a &quot;woman's story&quot;; it was very obvious that the novel was written by a man. And I think there is much more to the world of Geisha than the author tells. According to this novel, Geishas are shallow, simple, uneducated women, whose only gift (if they have it), is being able to flirt and hold silly conversations. I think the author failed to describe a lot of cultural details and historical events that happend during that period, because he concentrated solely on trying to tell the story of one woman. I read a lot of novels that were written by men from a woman's point of view, and which I found fascinating, either because the main characters were so interesting, or because a lot of history and culture was added to the story. This book lacks both and that's what makes it so shallow. It's a good book to read while on the subway or on an airlane - to just pass the time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Amazingly the language by American author gives me an impression to be written by Japanese. Every word becomes one part of me very smoothly. Sayuri tells a story in the indirect ways such as &quot;isn't uncommon&quot; and &quot;isn't unusual&quot;, and sometimes you might feel something flat and boring, but this is very common in our speaking, really. The author seems to follow our style so as to make oriental atmosphere.In the earliest period of Sayuri's life, she was just drifting in the &quot;water&quot; filled with misery and sorrow. After her coming to Kyoto, &quot;water&quot; in her personality itself must have had a strong will to remove any obstacle like a dam and finally got a successful life at the end. What is a successful life for her? Only living with Mr.A she was seeking for a long time?

However, Geisha never truly gets into the mind of its narrator. In fact, it seems to brush over major events in her life. And the reader never really gets to know her all that well. It was quite obvious that the author was a white male. While Golden may be a student of Asian culture, he does not possess enough insider knowledge of what it's like to be Japanese let alone a Japanese woman. If you want a well-done glimpse into the mind and world of Asian women stick to authors such as Amy Tan who really know their subject matter."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you'r looking for a pleasant time - don't hasitate.

It starts in the first person, and asks the reader to imagine a time in the protagonist's past which was both the best and worst time in her life. There's a lot of promise in that situation, you think, a lot of delightful emotional ambivalence. You must pursue. You figure this might be a story about a woman forced into becoming a geisha, and who then spends her life unsure of how to be anything else. But instead, Golden gives us a geisha who becomes a geisha, and who continues to be a geisha even when she doesn't have to. And this is how a writer takes a promisingly bumpy narrative and turns it into a flat, historical novel. He seems to be too keen on making the novel a showcase of Japanese Geisha culture, and hence, does not let the characters be characters, and make their own decisions. Sayuri, we are told, has a lot of \\"water in her personality\\", always trickling into a new situation in order to escape the constraints of an existing one. But as someone who is credited with making the best of the worst, Sayuri is surprisingly passive. We're told that she's gorgeous, very intelligent, is lucky enough to be guided by one of the best geishas of her time. Really...wake me up when it's over! And her character is constantly plagued with little inconsistencies. She minds the fact that she's just another pretty woman trained to entertain men, but not enough to create any exciting stir in the story. She minds the fact that her virginity is bartered over, but is also anxious to make sure that the most profitable transaction is made! In other words, Sayuri is not the kind of heroine that you could be bothered to root for. If she's so complacent being a plaything, then why should you, as a reader, really bother hoping for her to be otherwise?!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really wanted to like \\"Memoirs\\" a lot more than I did. My review is in two parts because I need to address both directions of my critique.It is an enjoyable read, in a slighly potboiler mode. You get the tragic story of a young girl thrust into a life that she never expected. She is revered as an artist and work of art in her own right, but faces terrible suffering in a time of war. She faces abuse at the hands of the men that she was trained to serve, yet holds in her heart a pure love for an older man who stands as her masculine ideal. Yes, it does read a bit like a soap opera and some of the characters were outlandish and unbelievable, but it still was an enjoyable read and the first half of the book progressed quickly. The second half plodded a bit and I found myself starting to lose interest towards the end. It wasn't that it was bad; the plotline had slowed and I think that the novel could have been wrapped up a few chapters earlier.Now to the second point of my review... No one should ever take a fictional book as a resource on understanding a culture or period of history. As much research as Golden had put into his novel, it was clear that he was writing from the perspective of a westerner who has some misunderstanding of the history of the geisha and it's unfortunate that a reader who does not understand anything about the culture might come away from reading \\"Memoirs\\" with the idea that geisha were something akin to highly trained prostitutes. The novel basically ignores the deep cultural history of the profession and the important role that it has played in Japanese society.Some of the more intense scenes, such as when Sayuri is sold by her father and the night when her virginity is auctioned off do have some basis in history, but the manner in which they were portrayed in the novel clearly indicates that the writer is from a culture outside of Japan. While the geisha and the prostitute were both creatures of the Floating World, there was a huge sea of difference between the two. Golden seemed to regard the rigerous training that Sayuri endured as a cruelty and the woman who enslaves Sayuri while ignoring the compact that normally existed between a geisha and the owner of the ochaya who usually shouldered all of the considerable expenses for maintaining and educating a geisha. Hatsumomo was my favorite character, but was the most unbelievable as a geisha who acted in this manner would quickly find herself losing patrons and the support of her ochaya.This is historical fiction, and must be taken as such. I truly hope that people who were facinated by this novel will want to go and do research on their own regarding the true history of the profession. It would be very sad if they accepting this novel as fact and explore no deeper because they would lose out on understanding a very old and facinating aspect of Japanese culture that few westerners can truly claim to understand."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"By using his detailed long-term research on the geisha culture in Japan, Arthur Golden wrote a historical fiction novel entitled \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\" The book drives one to experience the entire life of young geisha by the name of Nitta Sayuri, beginning from her origins as a fisherman's blue-ish green-eyed daughter to her achieved status of a well-known geisha in Kyoto, Japan. Through the eyes of an emerging geisha, the author created a plausible fictional story that involve vivid historical events, and he capture the readers to encounter the Japanese culture with his use of Asian metaphors, attitudes, and portrayals. There are thirty-five chapters in this novel with an addition of the \\"Translator's Note,\\" which introduces a fictional character by the name of \\"Jakob Haarhuis,\\" who the elder Sayuri was recounting her life story to.This book explores the profession of a geisha in prewar Japan. The women in prewar Japan tended to be viewed as women who cared for others in their home and obeyed only their father, husband, and son throughout their lives. Before Second World War, geisha was a profession in Japan that preserved the culture of art, music, and dancing in which the name of geisha means an \\"artist\\" (p. 141). The profession of a geisha was not an easily achieved status. To be a geisha, a young girl would have to be accepted by renowned elder geisha before putting her through the apprenticeship which might involves living with the geishas. The process of being a geisha required a long period of time because they would have to learn all of the arts including dancing and music, and the casual manners that a geisha would have to perform in the presence of wealthy and rich men. In the Japanese society, a geisha functions as an entertainer in the teahouse for paying male customers and as a performer in the public productions. A geisha's main function was based on preserving the Japanese traditional arts in an era where Japanese people would not be able to respect and honor their oral tradition and ancient culture of their grace country of Japan. In prewar Japan, the profession of a geisha was an equivalent to a career of an artist, a performer, and an entertainer, but not to a prostitute as one might believe.One can apprehend the subordinated role of women in the Japanese society by looking at the geisha profession in Japan, the fitting role of a geisha, Sayuri's attractiveness, and Japanese men's appreciation of geisha's virginity throughout this book. With his decade of research in Japanese culture and the geisha life, Arthur Golden created an exceptional novel which expresses ravishing and interesting perspective about a geisha's life and the role of women in the Japanese society in his \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book has been sitting on my \\"to be read\\" shelf for a long time, mainly because the teeny tiny little print that fills the pages to within half a centimeter of the edge filled me with trepidation at the apparently insurmountable task ahead. Fortunately, I took the coward's way out and watched the movie first, and this gave me the boost I needed to get started. Watching the movie first allowed me to put faces to the names, and to witness almost firsthand the intricacies of the rituals that are so intimately described in the book.Suffice to say that I was completely captivated from Chapter one, and was even reluctant to put it down at the end. The novel tells the story of a young Japanese girl named Chiyo who is taken from her village in the 1930s and sent to Gion, to an okiya or geisha house. Her sister Satsu is also taken, but lacking Chiyo's striking beauty, she is sent to a house of ill repute. At first Chiyo dreams of finding Satsu and running away from Gion, but later realizes that this is never going to happen.The resident geisha at her okiya is a jealous and arrogant woman named Hatsumomo, who sabotages Chiyo's progress towards becoming a geisha herself, leaving Chiyo in the unenviable position of being a maid for the rest of her life. Fortunately for Chiyo, a chance encounter with a wealthy businessman (known as the Chairman) opens new doors for her and this brief meeting changes the course of her life forever.Soon, Hatsumomo's rival, an extremely popular and successful geisha named Mameha decides to take Chiyo under her wing as her little sister, and after the usual haggling over fees and royalties is completed, Chiyo finally gets her chance to continue her geisha training. An intense and vicious rivalry develops between the geisha \\"tag teams\\" of Hatsumomo and her trainee Pumpkin, and Mameha and Chiyo, who then assumes the geisha name Sayuri.With the threefold purpose of defeating Hatsumomo, winning a wager, and paying off Sayuri's debts, Mameha orchestrates a bidding war between rich men for the apparently acceptable privilege of deflowering her young apprentice, the financial results of which set a new record in geisha history at the time.Just when things seem to be settling down nicely, two events shatter the relative calm, and Sayuri finds herself torn emotionally by the reappearance of the Chairman, and then later, mentally and physically by the outbreak of World War II. After the War, she goes back to being a geisha, but has to choose between following her heart and following what seems to be the obvious path.The film and the novel are different in several sections, even down to the ending, but of course the book provides a lot of important background information that could not be captured in the movie version, even though I'm not sure of the historical accuracy. I would strongly recommend them BOTH to anyone who is not familiar with the amazing gilded world of Geisha.Amanda Richards, April 14, 2007"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The first time I read Arthur Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" the simple genuine voice of the narrator, Chiyo/Sayuri, as she moves from a puzzled girlhood to a fulfilling womanhood enchanted me. Sold to a Gion \`okiya', Chiyo, the illiterate child of a fishing village, shares with the reader her struggle to find her identity while surviving and accepting the rigorous disciplines and the personal sacrifices necessary to effectively and complacently morph into Sayuri, one of Kyoto's legendary geishas circa WWII in Japan.Golden gently instructs us without an information burnout of the extensive and thankless training the geisha undergoes to ensure her livelihood as a paid artistic entertainer. Borrowing heavily from first hand experience gleaned from one of Gion's top geisha during the 60s and 70s, and from Liza Darby's anthropological study of geisha culture, Golden recreates a lost world that rings sweetly with an exotic authenticity as lovely and as ephemeral as a cherry blossom.After watching the rather long and vacuous Rob Marshall film adaptation, I found that I wanted to give the novel a second look to substantiate my initial warm feel for the narrator, her story and Golden's depiction of her lost geisha's world. However, a viewing of the film complete with all of the novel's key scenes---spectacular glimpses of an attractive enigmatic demimonde of colorful pageantry and a treacherous infrastructure of cutthroat competitors --- still renders a re-evaluation of the novel devoid of the clarity of emotion so easily accessed by a first reading. Sitting through 145 minutes of kimono changes and nuanced facial gestures seems to suck at the marrow of the book leaving the reader softly mesmerized by pastel floral patterns and fluttering fans but feeling detached and disappointed as the film imprint stamps the novel's characters with too much of Marshall's peripheral vision and not enough of Golden's bulls eye heart.If reading Chiyo/Sayuri's story appeals to you, do so without tainting Golden's delicately told tale with Rob Marshall's whirlwind celluloid version. Picture Chiyo/Sayuri in your own mind while remembering that her words are told from the vantage point of a certain age and Park Avenue address. Remember that nuance is difficult to recreate on a screen where one picture forms a thousand words and no matter how clever or authentic the sets the actual drama takes place in the soul of a girl who has lost her heart to a man who once showed her a simple kindness.Recommended to all who enjoy first person coming-of-age narratives where the outcome does not soar with the usual happily-ever-after crescendo of music and lingering glances but comes fairly close for a parallel universe that is difficult to understand or imagine in the 21st century.Diana F.

I was hooked. It is a very well written, well researched book, that draws the reader in, portraying a world completely different from our own, and besides, isn't that what life is eventually all about? A series of seemingly petty everyday events, with a fight or two mixed in?This is an entertaining book to read. I am disappointed with the ending, however. The ending is much too much \\"hollywoodish;\\" I feel that personality should really have won out over beauty in the end.

When she unintentionally draws the attentions of a wealthy man from her village, she believes he will better the lives of her family by adopted her and her sister Chiyo.To her dismay, Chiyo learns he's sold her to a geisha house and her older sister into prostitution.This is just the beginning of a well researched and richly written tale of a young girl's struggle to become a top-flight Geisha. The wording is amazing and the voice of Chiyo/Sayuri sings out through the book.This one is destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I think what makes this book so fascinating not because it's fiction, but because it feels more like a tour inside the life of a geisha. Actually that's exactly how it feels, a tour inside the life of a geisha, to the point where you don't feel attached to most of the characters within the story. I think the setting itself, is the most fascinating aspect of the story: a girl kidnapped from her own village, sold to a geisha house with no choice, to aspire to a lifestyle of being a performer/entertainer only to have WWII crashing down around her. Other than the setting, the story, the characters otherwise kind of limp along as time passes. I usually am fascinated by geisha, although this was an OK book, it didn't always hold my interest. I think, the story really limps along up until the last few chapters of the book, where anything feeling remotely rewarding takes place.I'd hate to compare this to another book, but a book I found more superior to this one was 'falling leaves' by adeline yen mah. The similarities between these two, is that they are both asian autobiographies by women, with their stories taking place within the 20th c. Even though 'falling leaves' is a true account, and this is fictional; that book will leave you haunted for quite awhile, at least it did for me. The 1st time i read it, i had to read it in one sitting, and i couldn't put it down. Though underrated, it far surpasses this book, mostly because the story and the facts are REAL. If you were fascinated by this book, you will surely enjoy 'falling leaves'."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book follows the life of a (fictitious) geisha, Chiyo (later Sayuri) who is sold into geisha-dom at a young age. The bulk of the book takes place in her childhood and young adulthood in the years just before World War II. It follows her training as a geisha, her conflicts with another established geisha, and her pursuit of true love.To my untrained eyes, the book seems well-researched and realistic. It removed some misconceptions about what geisha were (hint: not prostitutes) and what life was like in this lifestyle. It is exciting without being overly-sensationalized; erotic and sexy without being pornographic. There is not a slow part anywhere in this book. The characters were convincing and the situations believable.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Some may find strange that I put that title, but so far, my experience has shown that good books are mostly the ones that get missunderstood, or reach too high for an unexperienced reader. Their only chance at fame is if they become \\"classics\\".So each year new products are presented, and over-presented and publicised, and among them books. We are flooded with so much mediocrity, that our standards fall, and we entertain ourselves as absent-mindedly as in front of a T.V.So why is this book good? First of all, I'd like to add counter-arguments to what has been written against it in other reviews.- It's not realistic/non-fiction/accurately historical etc.That's simple. It was never meant to be completely historical. It's Fiction. And realism is often misunderstood. If realism means portraying reality as it is, I'd go look out the window, or see a documentary, or read the dictionary.- The characters are simplistic.I may not know what Mr. Golden had really intended, but for me this book is a story. It's as beautiful as the stories I read as a child, the mythologies, fairy-tales, and phantasie pieces I loved. It has the same innocence even though, ironically, it's not about the standard Moral person. So for me, it matters not that the characters seem sometimes uni-dimensional. And they aren't really. The other characters inner life is not known, since the book is writter at first person. One can only guess, as in real life, what really lays beneath.- Some reviewers seemed to emphasise that it's a story about a prostitute, it's not one, it isn't moral enough, she isn't moral enough...Oh my goodness! If literature would be about good moral persons going about their dull perfect lives, I'd die of boredom. People aren't like that. They're complex, and never have I found in my hole life a saint or a complete demon.And to get all morally snobby over a book? Even if the book was about a prostitute, I feel no moral superiority towards them. I must guess no one does that for pleasure, but of need, of lack of money, or chance of education, or alternative. But this is another disscution already.It transmits emotion, one really feels emersed in the story, and all through the day I've been thinking about her, about a character in a book, that I never do often. Her comparisons are so vivid, so amazingly simple but representative, I'd love to read it again, just for that. (remember \\"onion life\\" - just beautiful)Bad things - a little slow with the ending, a little to happy an ending, but since I consider it a story, I'll let that go.

Taken from a life she knew and dropped in to a life she certainly wouldn't not have entertained, young Sayuri was obedient. Many times, she was like a 'lamb being led to the slaughter' and yet somehow she survived. I have recommended this read to several friends, and have in fact, already loaned my book. I hope it never comes back, but makes it's way to through the hands of many readers."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a wonderful book. It portrays the life of a Kyoto geisha from her childhood (not being raised to become a geisha) to a chance encounter with a man who trains her to be a geisha. When I bought the book, I was unsure about the contents, and I did NOT want a sexually written book, and with happiness that is what I got!!! If you are hesitant because of sexual content, go for it. It is more than that. It is written as though it was dictated from a geisha herself. Arthur S. Golden uses beautiful metaphors, and brings you to laughter and tears."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book facinating. It sparked my interest in Japanese culture. The book would have been better if we had been able to know the Chairman as well as we knew Nobu. Was the reason she didnt love Nobu because of the way he looked? The book is not perfect but I LOVED the wisdom of Golden's metaphors. GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs is one of the best books I've read. As with most books, you get out of a book what the author has put in. The author no doubt put forth a tremendous effort as an historian and a wonderful storyteller. I will definately recommend this book to my friends and family and be most certain no one will be disappointed.This book is a page-turner that will keep you energized into the wee hours of the morning!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is very difficult for me to put the book down. I brood about it while not reading it. It has captivated me.I have been interested in and have learned a lot about Chinese culture over the years but did not know much about the Japanese culture. I find it every bit as interesting as Chinese culture.I would categorize the book as a historical novel.The metaphors are beautifully poignant and very different than those in our culture. I am very fond of the metaphor about grief being like a window that opens on its own and over time, opens less and less.I keep insisting to myself that Sayuri is a real person. I feel sad she is not.This would make a GREAT movie.I hope Arthur Golden writes another book about the Japanese culture - perhaps about the life of a warrior or a sumo wrestler.My thanks to Mr. Golden for writing such a fine book for people to enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A really great well written book that is both fascinating and captivating. It offers a detailed look into a completely different world. I like fresh original works such as this and Fried Calamari by D.M. Roman"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was totally disappointed by the Disney-style happy-ever-after ending of the book, which I found to be totally out-of-place and ridiculously unrealistic. Perhaps that was what attracted the movie makers. But the book (excluding the ending) has lots of merits. It is a striking parallel to the movie and book Raise the Red Lantern, set in China. When women are reduced to slaves and prostitutes (geisha in this case and concubine in Raise the Red Lantern) in a male-dominated society, when their livelihood depends solely on appeasing the other sex, they will turn upon each other, trying all means to destroy one another so that they will be the only one holding men's favor. Women can be as poisonous and merciless as you can imagine when it is a matter of survival. I think that's a very relevant point to make and the author certainly succeeded in bringing it out lively for most part of the novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"...memories that never actually existed for me! But the writing of Mr. Golden was so vivid and imaginary - I felt I lived everyone of Sayuri's lives...from her innocent childhood as a fisherman's daughter to a geisha-in-training maid and finally...an exquisite geisha with her destiny cruelly within reach - yet untouchable.I read this book before the movie, in complete order and without any spoilers and was shocked to Golden's concluding claims that the stories of Sayuri were all fiction. It wouldn't have matter nonetheless because many \\"true memoirs\\" are dull lifeless claims and I suppose that some fictions can have contrasting effects. M.o.a. Geisha was definitely one of these as I'm sure Golden intended with the beginning translator's notes and his in depth research and interviews of several geishas. It was obvious that not only did he lived through their lives in telling this story, but he was entirely familiar with early Japanese culture and the effects of WWII. And for an American man to portray a Japanese woman so precisely - that alone required extraordinary talent.As far as the narrator, Nitta Sayuri, she lost a lot of modesty towards the end and perhaps it was the training of composure and confidence in geisha school, but I felt more compassionate towards her longing for something other than a man. Which goes to say that Golden did a terrific job with the speed and position of the climax since Sayuri's humility lingered on just enough so she can finally and deservingly glow with vanity.Not that I would score it any less than 5 stars but I was also a little (just a tad bit) disappointed with the Cinderella effect towards the end. Golden told the story without any modern opinions of what true love and Western marriages should be and although it would seem to a geisha like a happily ever after ending, we 21st century women very well know that her glass slipper was a little too tight. Thus, the irony in Sayuri's lifelong happiness is perfectly fitting for a geisha in that you can have everything you've ever wanted in life, yet it still remains empty."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This became one of my favorite books.

It has been one of the best books I've read in a long time. Intense, beautiful and very human. Read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"First, allow me to say that this is not my typical book to read. I tend to drift more to fantasy and horror and only picked it up as a curiosity. What I found was one of the most beutiful pieces of fiction that I have ever read. Seeing and experiancing the japanese culture through this characters eyes provoced emotions that very few books have ever evoked. How do I summerize it, beautiful, tragic, somber at times, or perhaps simply acknowlege it as what it is: a work of art that I will ask my friends to experiance because it defies even these words."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I anxiously await both the film version of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code and Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha, due to be released this December 9th. Golden took years to organize his research on the life of the modern 20th century Geisha. An expert in Japanese culture akin to James Clavell, Golden weaves a tale of realistic immediacy and we are genuinely concerned for the plight of this particular Geisha, loosely based on one of Japan's most renowned Geishas. Upon reading this novel, one learns the kind of life that geishas live and this is significant as a work of social study because geishas are still around today. The geisha in this novel was brought up in a poor home, thea daughter of a fisherman, and was sold to the highest bidder to give up her virginity. She is a fascinating woman, with an intellect and soul that even the men in the novel lack. She is ABOVE them, she is pulling the strings, albeit using her feminine charms and beauty as a weapon. And what a weapon! She becomes the mistress of several wealthy patrons and finds the man of her dreams in what appears to be genuine romantic love. A Geisha is the equivalent of the Western courtesan, a mistress, the lover of wealthy and powerful figures, namely royalty. Very few Geishas ever found real love and never married, though marriage was not forbidden. It was just that few of them even cared to marry for love. Most of the patrons they were paired with were normally married anyhow. This Geisha is sympathetic and her very human condition makes us care for her. Every detail, every glance, every phrase is so utterly perfect. The only weak link is the villain/rival whose motives don't seem to be anything other than jealousy of her beauty and how she attracts more men. I hope the film does this book justice. It is perfect Book Club material and even a book to be read in high school or college. Probably more suited for college if the class is on Japanese studies."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel gives us a wonderful insight in the world of real Geisha's, that already belongs the past...Most people very unfairly consider Geishas as courtesans or exclusive prostitutes. The truth is, they were (and some still are, but very few nowadays) true artists who's lives were filled with sophistication and beauty, but, on the other hand, they were totally devoted to improving their artistic skills (singing, dancing, playing shamisen, the tea ceremony etc.) for a price of their personal lives and happiness. Golden's story amazingly delivers unique atmosphere of Japanese tradition and the smart plot twists keep us fascinated throughout the whole novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden is a novel based on the life of a young, confused Japanese girl named Chiyo. Born into a poor family, Chiyo knows life can be very difficult. However, she does not realize how much of the world lies beyond her \`tipsy house' and Yoroido, the small fishing village she has lived in all her life.She does not come face to face with the reality of how cruel the world can be until she is torn apart from her family and sold into geisha training.From the novel, you are taught about Japanese culture before and during WW2. From the moment I picked up the book, I was compelled to read on. The story grips the reader with its romantic theme and competitive plot line.The story is told in a first person narrative by a girl about my age (I am 14). By reading this novel, I was bewildered by what the average young girl my age would go through. The culture of the Japanese truly shocked me. I had no idea of all the customs and traditions they have. I consider myself lucky to have been born into the 20th century. I don't have to worry about the stress that comes with being a young apprentice geisha.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is ready to be captivated by yet another heart warming story.

I love the ability to discuss books intelligently with friends so I took her recommendation and was very happy I did.While this book is fiction, it's presented as a factual memoir. There may be some discrepancies at times with Japanese lifestyles, geography and the era in which it takes place, but I didn't really notice. I don't know much about Japan, especially during the period between the 30's and 50's. I really enjoyed the imagery and the way the author made me feel like I was the main character at times, feeling the same feelings she would have felt at various parts of the book.When an author can make the reader feel something, especially if it isn't an emotion we let loose freely, I see that as success. At times I was so absorbed in this story that I had to remind myself that this was a work of fiction based on the author's research.I thank Arthur Golden for writing such an interesting novel.

Her story tells of the history of geisha in Japan, but also about the politics, rites of passage, and experiences that she had while entertaining businessmen before and after World War II.

Right from the first page I was transported to 1920's Japan and enthralled by the mysterious world of Geishas. The author, Arthur Golden, did an excellent job bringing Sayuri and her experinces to life. He payed great attention to detail, down to the last stitch of Sayuri's beautiful kimonos. I felt as though Sayuri was walking me through her life, from the tipsy shack she lived in with her family in Yoroido to the elegant teahouses in Gion. I found myself growing attached to her, feeling everything she was feeling. Her life of fear, desire, hope and pain is at once captivating and heartbreaking. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a work of fiction and not an autobiography.

Throughout this book, Nitta Sayuri describes the hard path of life she was forced to take, bringing us into the un-spoken world of women where they were auctioned and sold to the most powerful men in society, where love is excluded and beauty as the only power they have.This extraordinary book is described in such a way that as you read you would feel as if you could see the story happening right before your eyes. It is written with so much energy and emotion that the author humors, saddens, and angers you all at once. Every chapter of this book takes the reader down a different road to the life of Nitta Sayuri and surprises us with every turning page, up until the very last chapter of the book.Memoirs of a Geisha, not only entertains the readers thirst for entertainment but also educates us of the nearly buried ancient traditions that were ever so common in Japanese history.As I read this book I was so captivated by the story that I was unable to put it down! This story of geishas and the hard life they lead is so moving and heartbreaking that it would be impossible to not feel for them as you read from beginning to end.This enchanting novel should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Hundreds of people have reviewed this book, but I haven't yet, so here's my contribution. This is a book that ordinarily would not have read had I not had a little push from someone whose opinions I respect. &quot;Memoirs&quot; could have been fluffy and soap opera-ish, but it avoids most of those literary traps by eschewing romantic cliche and sticking to a fairly realistic, believable tone in which characters make hard choices with unexpected consequences and don't always get what they want. They grapple with making the best of their lot. In other words, a lot like Real Life.&quot;Memoirs&quot; is written as an actual confessional, and if you don't read between the lines, you could almost believe that it was dictated to the author. It's an interesting look inside the world of the geisha and of life in early to mid-20th century Japan. The characters are involving and the plot is sprinkled with interesting plot twitsts. Some of them are a little pat at the end, but not terribly so."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book 2 or 3 times. It really captured my imagination.

However It wasn't easy as 1,2,3. Her and her sister were torn away from their family, then soon torn apart from each other. The main character went through cruelty, lies, and she has to hide everything she feels. For a geisha was a woman who was only ment to entertain men.

With her cleverness, talent, and a simple embroidered handkerchief she's able to stand up against the many excruciating events and in so she's able to become a geisha. Her hidden passion for a man out of her grasp keeps the story exciting, as well does the Japanese culture behind it all. I learned a lot about a geisha and for readers I must tell you that a geisha is anything but a prostitute, as many have come to believe they are. Arthur Golden has written an amazingly realistic story, in which will entrance you with it's lovely, cultivating tone. I recommend this book for anyone who likes to learn new things and who are just interested in reading a romantic, realistic novel that'll memorize them. The book, to me, was easier to read after the movie because it was a lot easier to picture what's happening. Just to warn readers, the movie is different in some ways then the book though, so to some it may be confusing to see the movie then read the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is the story of a young girl sold away, along with her sister, from her dying mother and aging father. They leave their hometown behind, as well as their old tipsy house to find they have separate fates. Sayuri was to become a geisha in Kyoto and Satsu, her sister, was to have a lesser fate. Sayuri's eyes were what caught the attention of everyone. Her eyes are an inexplicable clear-blue-grey shade that captivates all who take note of them. Having \\"a lot of water\\" in her, which she received from her mother, Sayuri's personality was conducive to her cleverness, her ability to make sense of situations and her ability to meander through life. Through Sayuri's character, Auther Golden helps to reframe the American perception of geishas simply being prostitutes and depicts a more complex lifestyle.While Sayuri was sent off to Kyoto with the intention of one day becoming a geisha, the head geisha of her okiya, Hatsumomo, had other plans for her. Hatsumomo was Sayuri's obstacle. Filled with jealousy and hatred, Hatsumomo was threatened by Sayuri's beauty and potential. She tormented Sayuri and set her up with hopes that she would never become a geisha.With the help of one of the most prominent geishas in Kyoto, Mahema, Sayuri rises to success. Through Sayuri we learn about the life of a geisha. When war hits, the geisha districts are closed down and all look forward to the reopening of their well-known lifestyle. The seduction of men is a learn quality laced with natural ability. This is essential for Sayuri to be successful, the skill of conversation and flirting. Having her virginity bided off, her sexuality becomes and object useful for financial convenience as opposed to pleasure.At times, I would pause while reading the book to check the sex of the author. Auther Golden, writing with such conviction and emotion, beautifully captures the character of a young Japanese geisha. His writing leaves one unable to put down the book and always wanting to know what happens next. The size of the book should not be an intimidating factor.Reading this book taught me, personally, a lot about the Japanese geisha culture.

It opened my eyes the the world of geisha. I was one of those westerns who thought that a geisha was just a prostitute; this book changed my opinion. I realise the story is one of fiction and not everything can be taken for fact, but I know a lot more about geisha in general than I had before reading this novel. And the novel sparked my curiousity even further to do my own research. I plan to also read 'Geisha: A Life' to get the full prespective of the life geisha.

Eventually, being used as a pawn in an old rivalry, she becomes a geisha. She learns to use what little power she has to have some control over her life.Golden's style of descriptive prose is pure artistry. The reader is immersed in each scene as he tells the sights, sounds, smells, and even the feel of fabric. He dares to come as close as he can without crossing the line into over doing it. And he succeeds.Sayuri never attributes herself with above average beauty, intelligence, or cunning. Her character is very believable, never knowing more than she should. The other characters share this believablity, as they each have both good and bad sides.I can't imagine a movie ever being able to capture the beauty of this book, because the beauty lies in the words themselves."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the 2005 movie because I enjoyed it very much.

When I began reading, I had pretty much no background on this book, and, honestly, I had no idea it was fiction. The first half (or maybe a little less than half) of the novel was extremely believable. The characters were realistic, and I could feel the confusion of Chiyo as her life started to change. The story's delicate details, conveying elements of Japanese culture, only further convinced me that I was reading a factual account.This was not the case throughout the entire novel. I began to wonder whether this story was fact or fiction around the time Hatsumomo was introduced. I suppose she is meant to represent the competitive, jealous nature that having to depend on others for success can bring out. She played a major role in the story, yet she was developed so poorly that I can only describe her as cartoon-like. Rather than be depicted as delicately as the details that Golden wove throughout the story, Hatsumomo was not a believable character. She wasn't human; I was tempted to believe she was the devil incarnate. It was almost as if Golden thought the reader would be stupid to pick up on certain aspects of a geisha's life if he had been more subtle. This dissapointed me greatly.Nonetheless, I was still very impressed with the details throughout the story- the details alone earned this story 4 stars. By carefully describing rituals (the auctioning of virginity), types of makeup (and even the lead makeup that geishas had formerly worn), hairstyles, kimono (the intricate knot, the fabric, the people whose job it was to tie them), and even the business-like atmosphere that surrounded the seemingly magical geisha, Golden incorporates feeling into the novel. Using this detail, he powerfully illustrates that even though a geisha is taken care of, she belongs to other people. The pain that goes along with this reality is forcefully fed to the reader, and almost makes up for the cartoon-like Hatsumomo.If you are interested in Japanese culture or geisha (or want to become interested), you should read this book- you will most likely find it extremely captivating. However, do not read it solely for the plot, because there are many books with more devloped characters and stronger plot lines than this."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Of course I am not a Japanese geisha. But for being an Asian and exposed to the popular Japanese culture in Taiwan, we were ruled once by the Japanese and imagine how much Japanese culture has influenced our life past, and even now. Young people nowadays are very much crazy about Japanese dramas, the fashion, the music, and the food. Japanese Tv programmes are aired on TV 24-7. I can say that I much understand how exquisite the auther had considered in the details. And the tones, and the way of thinking, that just so overwhelm me. I need not to tell the whole story again but to express how vivid that I saw thorughout the line of words that I can almost translate them right into Japanese and will accurately click. It's unreal! (Too real actually) I would recomand anyone who is interested in finding out a path to the Japanese culture and the art of a geisha ( NOT a prostitute for those who have no ideas whatsoever), a story about grwoing up to strive for the untimate passage of one's life---searching for destiny and not giving up one's hope. But most of all, an affection so strong that changed the course of its own life. Using the forces of nature and observations of our lives to describe the very inner feeling of ourselves, no more words are needed. Just a gentle touch and all is understood. I love this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I reluctantly read this book, because I warily disdained it as a simple \\"romance,\\" but I would be dishonest if I didn't admit that I enjoyed it. The first third of the book, when Chiyo (who eventually becomes the geisha Sayuri) and her sister are sold into childhood slavery, was especially disturbing and powerful, and the historical and cultural details throughout are fascinating, although I found my interest flagging occasionally as the novel proceeded toward its somewhat predictable conclusion. Sure, the book is another Dickensian Cinderella story (it's also like Claire Booth Luce\`s \\"The Women\\" at times!), but its creative chutzpah, competent prose, and epic qualities ultimately won me over.The book's naysayers (few as they are) often level two accusations. The first charge is that the story misrepresents geisha. The detractors often cite as evidence the lawsuit against the author by Mineko Iwasaki, a \\"retired\\" geisha whom Golden interviewed while researching his book. Of particular embarrassment to Mineko, for example, is the sale of Sayuri's adolescent virginity to the highest bidder--a practice that has all but disappeared in Japan over the years. In Golden's defense, however, the novel is set in the 1930s and '40s--well before Mineko was even born. Although he may have incorporated some of Mineko's experiences, Sayuri is clearly Golden's own creation. Ironically, Mineko's lawyer herself acknowledged at a press conference that the book succeeds, at least partially, in its attempt to represent a geisha's point of view. (''All the buzz about 'How could a man get so inside a woman's head?' Well, the answer is, it's her [Mineko's] story.'')A number of readers also denounce the book because a white man has dared to write from the point of view of a Japanese woman, or that the book is \\"Westernized\\" and therefore illegitimate. I do think this is a valid criticism: it irritates me, for example, that Golden gives Sayuri blue-gray eyes, as if this all-too-Western feature is needed to make her truly beautiful. (Why not cinnamon eyes, for heaven's sake?) In addition, the book's dialogue is peppered with Americanisms (\\"Hey,\\" \\"Really,\\" \\"Heavens, no!\\"); according to an Salon article, the translator of the book into Japanese had to rewrite much of the prose to make it seem more authentic.Yet Golden himself seems to realize he must view this culture through a Western prism, so, with a wink to his reader, he \\"Westernizes\\" his character and adds an American intermediary. At the time she tells her story, Sayuri has lived over thirty years in New York (almost twice as long as she spent in the Gion district of Kyoto), so that she and her memories are assimilated to some degree, and she dictates her story to an American translator, who then transcribes her memoirs for an American audience.Overall, then, the fact that Golden has written a novel (as another reader put it) \\"from the vantage of a person who is completely removed from himself in time, space, culture, and gender\\" is not enough on its own to condemn it; numerous authors--from both East and West, from Shakespeare to Nabokov--have succeeded doing exactly that. For a debut effort, Golden's novel is pretty impressive."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had no idea what to expect from this book so it was a great surprise to find that I could not put the book down. And when I did have to put it down, I couldn't wait to find a few spare minutes to pick it back up. I learned about a way of life that I never even thought about and it was written in such an interesting way. The story of this geisha captivated my interest in a way that few books have ever done. I don't want to give any of the story away or tell you what it's about because you probably already know that. I just want to tell you that for me to read a 400+ book in a few days is highly unusual. I have picked up 4 books since this one and just cannot get into them because they don't even began to compare with memoirs. The author wrote in such a beautiful style. Just read it and you will know what I am talking about."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't know why it took me so long to finally get my hands on a copy of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" but I am glad that I finally took the plunge and bought it. Once you open the book, you will find yourself absorbed in Sayuri's world; a world full of decadence where men shower geisha with expensive gifts and engage in betting wars over a geisha's virginity. Besides the expensive gifts, Golden does not completey glorify the geisha profession, but also shows the dark underside of it: the beatings, harsh training, sexual harassment, and the objectification of women.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is the 'memoir' of a peasant girl Chiyo who trains to become a geisha in Japan during the Depression. However, the book does not just detail Chiyo's training and schooling, but her struggles to find her sister who was sold into prostitution and her assimilation into the geisha culture. There are also some pitfalls along the way as Chiyo must deal with her rival Hatsumomo, who tries to ruin Chiyo's chances to become a successful geisha.I'll stop there with the plot because I do not want to give much of it away but I definitely think that this book is worth a read. I found it more engaging and beautiful than Amy Tan's \\"The Joy Luck Club,\\" which is an excellent novel, but does not compare to the originality and brilliance of Golden's ability to write from the perspective of a nine year old girl as she matures into a woman. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is the type of novel that you wish would never end!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"At first I was wary of reading this book because of its acclaim and because I was worried that a foreign treatment of the geisha might be biased or inaccurate. I still can't say whether this book had been an accurate portrait, but as a story, it is probably one of the best books I've read this year.&quot;Memoirs&quot; is a well-written, plot- and character-driven story. It's written in a way that's reminiscent of Wally Lamb, but this is unique in its own way. Never was there a moment where the story sags or slow down. It's a rare and enlightening look at a secret culture that's both elusive and seductive.The ending is always hard, especially for a book like this where you want to see everything wrapped up. There is no perfect ending, and given the bond that author Arthur Golden created for me, there would be no adequate ending that won't make me miss Sayuri."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha offered an incredible insight into a lifestyle that is now very rare. Having been to Japan recently, I easily pictured Sayuri, the main character, in her environment, but readers don't need any prior knowledge of Japanese culture to envision this. Just by reading about Sayuri, I learned a lot about Japan that I didn't know and gained an understanding of how the ancient geisha culture has affected modern women in Japan. The author makes every experience, every person, and every place in Sayuri's life impeccably clear, and she came alive under my eyes. I winced with pain when she was beaten, felt her sorrow when she and her family seperated, experienced her joys, screamed with outrage when she was treated unfairly; in short, I became a geisha with Sayuri. I was mesmerized by this novel and Sayuri's character and was surprised when I realized that not only was it fiction, it was written by a man! The only part of the book that did not ring true was her obsession with the empty, shallow character of the chairman. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind temporarily becoming a geisha and ignoring everything else until the book is finished."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel, about a female named Sayuri who becomes a geisha in the Gion District of Kyoto, Japan, will reach out and pull you in so tight that you can not put the book down. I have never read a book that allowed me to feel as though I was having a private conversation with the narrator while she told about her time as a geisha. The technique that is used creates a very real atmosphere because she alludes to both the past and the future. What is most amazing is that Sayuri isn't even a real person! Sayuri's story is brilliantly told, outlining every detail of the life of a geisha. Even the way a geisha carefully applies her daily makeup and how she fastens the obi of her kimono. Memoirs of a Geisha will move you from the beginning to the end of the book with energy, stamina, and beauty."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Fascinating. Amazing. One of the best books I've ever read. As many other people, I had trouble believing the main character was not a real person. I have heard people complaining about how passiveness and petty dreams of the protagonist annoyed them. Yes, Sayuri might have a strange outlook on life and what happiness is all about - but that's strange only to a person of a western culture living in the 21st century. For a woman in that place and time, that sort of thinking was the accepted norm. Not only does Golden give great insight into a life and culture so totally alien to us westerners, he also paints it so colorfully and believably that it's hard to put this book down. Bravo."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a half-Japanese woman who has always had that side of me sublimated by my Western culture, I seek out &quot;Asian&quot; books -- especially those about Japan and Japanese culture. After I took a class in the Japanese narrative, I thought I was very cultured and smart, and I thought, in all honesty, that this book would be trite and annoying; I admit that I was a bit skeptical.Well, I was proved wrong. &quot;Geisha&quot; transports the reader back to another time and place. It is mystical, magical, informative, controversial, well-written, touching and clumsy (in a good way) all at once. I was instantly drawn in by not only the characters but the setting and the plot. Even if you have no interest in Japanese culture, this book is outstanding. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The only bad thing about this book is that it comes to an end.

I find it very insightful (a la Wally Lamb &quot;She's COme Undone&quot;). I could not put this book down, as the plot really draws you in. It encompasses so many human emotions- despair, jealousy, longing, triumph, betrayal, and love. I could go on...and on...Just read it and you'll see!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I hardly enjoy reading books these days. As a sophomore in high school, I'd rather watch Dawson's Creek or go shopping. But when my mom gave me this book to read, I was captivated by it. From the first page, I became engrossed in Sayuri's world and amazed by the life of a geisha. Golden's prose is unbelievably poetic and i loved the way he described every aspect of a geisha's life. This is not like the usual memoirs i have read; I found myself staying up till 3 in the morning reading as much as i could until my eyes failed me."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Before I started reading this book, I was never really interested in the Japanesse culture. But once I started reading it, I was not able to put the book down. It simply introduced me to a world that is not common in Western Culture. I always thought a Geisha was japanesse for prostitute but they were more than that. Not only did they entertain men but they were hostesses, taught to be well-mannered ladies and educated in the arts. Not only did this book captivate me but introduced me into the world of Japanesse culture. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about this culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put this book down! It's an intimate portrait of a way of life that is often closed off from Western view. Imaginative writing and strong characters keep you reading, dying to know more. As I read the other reviews, I notice that some people don't like the book because of the &quot;non-feminist&quot; geishas. They're missing the point. The book isn't judging geishas; it's simply giving us an in-depth look at how they lived. The fact that the geishas sometimes hated each other and used men just makes it realistic. In fact, the author was able to take a woman from that strange world and make her likeable and knowable. Yes, it would have been perfect if the ending were more fleshed out, but all in all, it's a very interesting study of a fascinating people."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"At my age, which is 15, most people the same age as myself do not prefere to read books this many pages in length.

With this book, I had a &quot;taste&quot; of the harsh cruel reality of what a Geisha's life must have been like, and it wasn't at all sweet. I can honestly say up until now I didn't have a clue to what a geisha was, only that they were very elegant and refined women. Golden's book made me get up and research this topic and I now have vast knowledge of this subject that I hope all of you will want to share the same passion I was so honored with. I want to thank Mr. Golden for writing this book and making me more interested in the cultures of these mysterious woman in Japan.

The tapes were transcribed into manuscript after her death. The reading is as if someone were talking to you, so being. That is what writing really is, talking via paper. But many writers don't get it. I was never able before to not sleep because of a book, but I found myself getting up in that dark unable to stop reading long past bed time. It is a haunting, sincere tale. Told in the most complete honesty a voice could make possible. Sold as a little girl soon to be orphaned into various slavery of many avenues as was the world of the women in that era in that place. Comes through WWll and the surviving of it. The greatest love story I have ever read.

It is deeply fascinating and well-written. I loved how the author, with great subtlety, changed the voice of the geisha, from a girl of 9 to a woman in her thirties and then later an old, retired Japanease Geisha in NYC. I felt I was inside the head and heart of the protagonist, Sayuri-san. I felt transported to an entirely different world, so foreign to most of us. A fascinating world that helped me to learn much about one particular facet of ancient Japanese culture. In one word, it was fascinating. Well-written.

When I came across the book at a bookstore, the back summary was very misleading - from the description they gave, it sounded like a story about, well, prostitutes. Finally, I found it in my high school library and decided to give it a try. It was DEFINITELY worth my original misgivings. This beautiful story removes all stereotypes one might have about the life of a geisha.Chiyo was a young child when she was removed from Yoroido, her small, insignificant fishing village. Always noticed for her unusual blue-grey eyes, she lived a peasants life with her family. Through misunderstandings and twisted truth, she suddenly finds herself in Gion, the geisha district of Kyoto - along with a wicked, popular geisha, money hungry Okiya mothers and powerful, geisha-loving business men. Chiyo must battle many misfortunes - mostly involving Hatsumomo, her okiya's only geisha - to become and succeed as the geisha Sayuri. Arthur Golden weaves a story that makes it hard to believe it's not an autobiography by Nitta Sayuri herself, telling of the trials of life, love, and destiny."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Usually I stick to novels written by John Grisham, but a book talk in my bestsellers class sparked an interest in reading Memoirs of a Geisha.

This is not a book you should skim through, or read while being distracted.

But to me, a reader having studied Chinese and Oriental culture for more than 20 years, this story is uninteresting, entirely written in a man's point of view. Throughout the book, it is obvious that the author is trying hard to convince the reader that the narrator \\"is\\" an oriental woman, i.e. the geisha herself. But he fails after all. And the result is, the story is full of stereotypes, especially stereotypes of Asian women (e.g. good girls and bad girls, rivalry between women...), Asian men (e.g. how they victimize women) and patriarchal culture. In short, it disguises itself as a history of Asia women's struggle (purely in the eyes of the West), full of out-dated symbols, cliche and exoticism, which only appeals to the readers in the West who are not similar with the Orient."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had two friends recommend this book to me, and I finally sat down to read it.

I wanted more! I sat and read the last 200 pages in one sitting and I really wished there had been more to the story... I mean, it seems like we learn SO much about Chiyo/Sayuri's life, and when the book reaches a certain plot point (I won't spoil it for others who haven't read it), you are pretty much left with a quick summary for the rest of the book...

The color of her eyes are with you every page of this book as much as the handkerchief is with her. I wanted to know how it ended the first few chapters I read but when it was over I wanted it to keep going. The picture of Japan was not very outstanding in the story but it was a compeling love triangle that had history and misery.

I had heard much about Geisha on American television and seen them mocked in many reruns of 50's &amp; 60's sitcoms, but never having an understanding what purpose of the life of a Geisha took on.The main function of a Geisha is to please men...period. To be a man's escort (even to the toilet) and to be his entertainment, drinking buddy, and livelihood at parties. And if he pays enough, to become his personal Geisha in the bedroom.The main character and the person who is telling the story Sayuri, was sold into Geisha life. But according to her story there are those born into the life if their mothers were Geisha.This story follows the life of Sayuri from the time she was nine years old when she and her sister were snatched from from their dying mother and spineless father, through Japanese Depression, World War II and the many perils of Sayuri's life that led her to the United States and the telling of this story. Sayuri was sold to 'Mother' the owner of the the 'Okiya' (name for home of Geisha's) and in this particular okiya lived a Geisha named Hatsumomo that viewed this nine year old child as a threat and made life pure hell for Sayuri. This was the beginning of a story that will not only give you insight to some basic Japanese culture, but basic human instincts. Is there always a right and a wrong.

I could picture her as a young girl in her fishing village, and later with the practiced smile of a geisha. I have read novels and seen movies where young girls are sold to men for their use, but this book told a slightly different story. The young girl Chiyo is indeed sold to a Mr.Tanaka, and probably because of her extraordinary blue gray eyes she finds herself on the path to becoming a geisha, while her plainer sister is also sold and becomes a prostitute. This was all disturbing to read. But soon I was caught up in the details of life in Kyoto in the 1930s, and the very structured life of a geisha. Men provided a geisha with gifts and sometimes with financial support, but all the control was in the hands of women - other geisha, teahouse managers, the mistress of the okiya where the geisha lived. Chiyo has some bad luck and then suddenly a successful geisha takes Chiyo under her wing. The caterpillar turns into a butterfly. Even so, Chiyo - now Sayuri - seems to be stuck in a world where there are many, many rules, and far fewer choices available to her. What will her destiny be? Even when, Sayuri risks everything to take control of her destiny for once, it doesn't turn out the way she hopes. At least not at first.

I love reading this book because it takes me back to the time I lived in japan the climant the food. The rich culture and the meld of modern and traditional that still exists if not so much in modern times with the Geisha themselves. In Japan you can walk down a modern business street and run smack into a shrine, see men dressed in business suits and a woman in a kimono.

This was not a novel written with just a few years research and a lot of conjecture, Golden was fascinated by the Japanese people so much that his B.A. in Art History focused on Japanese art and one of his M.A.s is in Japanese history. The whole novel took him 10 years to write while he interviewed many geisha, including the famous Mineko Iwasaki, and studied the art form. The result was this:Chiyo Sakamoto is one of two daughters sold into servitude by a poor fisherman in the hopes of raising enough money to save his dying wife in 1929 rural Japan. At first the sisters are kept together, but eventually they are sold into separate okiyas (geisha houses). Chiyo is working off her purchase cost, but continues to add debt to her bill when she tries to please the lead geisha Hatsumomo (by destroying a rival's expensive kimono) and when she is severely injured while trying to run away.After a chance meeting with Chairman Iwamura Ken, Chiyo decides that she no longer wants to live in fear of never surmounting her debt: she wants to be a beautiful geisha. Chiyo gets to continue her geisha training with one of the most powerful geisha, Mameha, and takes her apprentice geisha name of Sayuri. At her debut, a bidding war begins for her mizuage (virginity), fetching the highest price in memory and buying off her debt. The okiya that Sayuri has slaved in for years is now here's when the current owner dies.As the years progress, there are tensions that come and go with the pressure of geisha life. There are parties to attend, ceremonies to observe, rival geisha to avoid, & a distinct lack of romantic love. When World War II breaks out, everyone's lives are irrevocably changed. Some for the better and some not.This was an incredible story based in years of research, observation, and interviews. It's plausible that this story could have happened. Arthur Golden's writing style is evocative of the beauty that exists in this society & cultural. Many people see geisha as trapped women with no personalities; Arthur explores the reality of what it would have been like to be raised in a culture that admires the hard work and dedication these women possess in order to manipulate their clientele. The clients weren't paying for sex, they were paying for the experience of an entertaining force.Of all the geisha mentioned in the book, I think my favorite has got to be Mameha. She is a tough geisha with a kind heart. I would compare her to a high-powered female attorney, she knows her stuff and knows how to make people work in her benefit. Chiyo/Sayuri is an amazing person as well considering we watch her grow from scrawny, adolescent child into a strong, powerful woman. She never really seems to boast about her accomplishments and really only wants to live a simple life, but she has a grace about her that can only come from within.The language in this book is another thing that drew me to it. I really enjoy a book that properly uses words in another language in a contextually appropriate way. Frivolously throwing out words is useless. All the language used in this book had purpose and meaning. Truly amazing! While it can seem cumbersome, once I got lost in the story, I tore right through the whole book. The 2005 movie adaption really captured the visual side of the story. Check it out if you've never seen it, but only after you read the book! :)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a wonderful story about the life of a geisha. Until I read this book, I knew almost nothing about this side of Japanese culture. I found myself so drawn into Sayuri's life. It was so interesting all the things she had to learn to become a geisha. I liked reading about her beautiful clothes and really liked the way she described the scenery in a creative, pretty way. I really felt sorry for Sayuri and found myself caring about her a lot which is what happens when you read a really good novel. I can't believe I waited so long to read this book. Everybody was talking about it, saying it was so good. I just thought it would be a book about prostitution with a lot of sex, but it is really charming and moving and not what I expected at all. Definitely read this book. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

I was transported to Japan no matter where I was reading. I forgot who and were I was!! It takes a great author and an amazing book to do that."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I agree with a reviewer here: it is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. I had already seen the movie when it first came out 5 years ago, and can finally understand why it simply did not do the book justice. I was hesitant to read the book (even watch the movie) because well, at that time it was hard to see anything in the arts pertaining to the Japanese and WWII. My Chinese grandparents were severely injured by the Japanese when they bombed their farm and hearing how this book/movie was partly set during WWII and hearing about the depictions of Japaneses soldiers prevented me from picking up this book sooner. I'm glad I read this book at this point in my life anyway, because it now has a deeper meaning and I can really relate to the dealing with adversity from such a young age and not having any family and just trying to surviving through one emotional turmoil after another. It is unfortunate about the fallout between one of the real life geisha interviewed for the book and the author, but the book itself is so raw yet immaculate in its storyline. I've highlighted more passages in my Kindle from the book than any other. It really situated with me, especially the \\"If he couldn't forgive you for what you'd done, it was clear to me he was never truly your destiny.\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'd already seen the movie and loved it and was eager to read the book. I have to say, I found this book positively addicting. It was hard for me to put it down and I read it quite quickly I enjoyed it so much.Born Chiyo, Sayuri is a Geisha that had a long hard road to get to the top of her world. When she was a child, her mother was ill and her father old. This led to she and her sister being sold to separate places in Kyoto. In Chiyo's case, she was sold to a okiya (house for geishas) to be a maid and also possibly apprentice as a Geisha. Misfortune and a vindictive Geisha named Hatsumomo however, quickly stop her dreams and she falls into the drudge and life as a maid. It is only when Mameha, one of the most renowned geisha in the Gion district of Kyoto takes her as her \\"little sister\\" apprentice does Chiyo's life turn around.She receives her new name of Sayuri, and in spite of opposition, she and Mameha quickly make a place for her in the world as an Apprentice Geisha and she starts to earn some fame. During all this she thinks about one thing, the man who inspired her to do whatever it takes to become a Geisha. The Chairman, as she calls him, was kind to her when she was a girl and her greatest desire is to reach a level where she can be with him. To do this, she becomes a Geisha and lives the life as she has to, trying to reach ever closer to him. While she is doing this she must go through the rituals of being a Geisha, suffer through the war, and regain her place in the aftermath that is Japan after the war.The characters in this were well done. There were a couple that didn't really add anything for me but they were largely minor characters. Sayuri, while not having a lot of emotion described, filled the role of narrator well and told a compelling tale of a Geisha's life. Her arch nemesis Hatsumomo was decidedly evil but still seemed real as a villain. Nobu, a man who appears in the book many times is surly but likable and there are a lot of other characters that added to the story as well.Golden writes very descriptively and from his words it was interesting to learn some of the facts and stories about what it took to become a Geisha. I especially enjoyed learning about their makeup and clothing and how they were applied. He appears to have done extensive research and I trust that this story is fairly accurate in regards to those things. I normally don't care for first person narratives but I think he did an ok job of being Sayuri in this book.I definitely was pleased with this book and it has made me interested in reading more about Geisha. I highly recommend it as a love story and a somewhat historical account of Geisha clothing and makeup.Memoirs of a GeishaCopyright 1997499 pagesReview by M.

It tells the story of a popular geisha during the early 20th century. While the end is lacking and disappointing, what precedes it is fascinating. Golden delves into the culture of Japan and how geisha fit into it. He writes the story richly and convincingly, a most excellent read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"True that the author isn't a Jpanese women, living in Kyoto, Japan, in the year 1940 something. But I thought it was a great story about someone who may have lived back then. It's why we call it fiction that we are allowed to go into the minds of others if we please, and make up or own story of what it may have been life for real. It's not too far fetched to believe this may have been what a Japanese woman would have been subjected too. I have a Jpanese Grandmother, and I think this is pretty true to life, by what she told me. And I like that Aruthr Golden didn't make the Geisha seem like a whore, because she is not a whore, but an artist. Somone who endures many years of hard training, with sweat, blood and tears. I enjoyed this tale of Sayuri. I hope you will too!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was definitely not boring. It held my interest for the long run. However, the ending was slightly disappointing to me, as it seemed to end too abruptly, and I felt there was not enough closure. It was a good book, though, and I recommend it.

I found it easy to read and informative. I knew very little about Geisha and found the book to be fascinating. I felt close to the character Sayuri and hated to see the book end. I found it believeable and would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book opened up a world to me that I knew absolutely nothing about. It is a fictional story based on certain facts about a geisha's life, yet it's writing style so draws you in that you are convinced it's a true story and shocked by the atrocities the young girls endure. I thought this was an absolutely fascinating book, although I didn't feel the main character was held responsible for her irresponsible actions at the end. The too happy of an ending was a stain on what could have been a near perfect true to life story of how life is unfair. But then again, I guess that's why we read, to get away from life for a while! I really felt I learned a lot through this story. Even now, weeks after I've finished it, I find myself thinking about it. I have never found a book as memorable as this."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the story of Sayuri, a geisha in the first half of the 20th century. It details her life from a moment when she is sold as a young girl well into old age. It documents hardships, love, and spiritual triumphs. A beautiful story, really. For the most part, Arthur Golden's style seems smooth and thorough. There are spots in the book, however, that simply seemed to deserve more attentioon than was given. This especially applies to the ending. For such a complex and emotional book, Golden seemed to be in quite a hurry to get the ending over with. It left me unsatisfied, but the book still shines for a first novel. Hopefully, his writing will continue to blossom."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you have a heart for Japan, this is a good read. Having lived in Japan 1996, I came to appreciate the beauty of this culture. Kyoto, the setting of the book, is a remarkable place.

Everyone I know that has read this loves it as much as I do. The writer captures your interest right away and before you know it, you're living in Japan, during the war. I saw the movie after reading this book and was very disappointed with the movie. There is just too much to try and convey on the big screen. Treat yourself to some \\"me\\" time and read this wonderful story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha / 0-679-78158-7This artful, veiled look into the hidden life of the geisha is incredibly captivating. The realism grips the reader instantly, as we read of a young girl's coming of age in a world where she must compete with her beauty, skill, art, and conversation in order to be considered a coveted companion for men.Sayuri guides us realistically through her training, and shows us her childhood hopes and fears. Her hopes are the simple hopes of the poor: she hopes to have enough food, money, and shelter to survive and be comfortable. She does not dare hope to buy her freedom, nor does she know what she would accomplish with this freedom. After a chance meeting with the only man who ever treated her kindly without hoping for something in return, her hopes expand to include being a geisha for this man, which is the only interaction with him that she can imagine achieving. On the other hand, her fears are more complex: she fears the tyranny of the people who own her and live with her, and she fears that she will be a failure and will be forced to become a common prostitute. Most of all, she fears that she has no intrinsic worth or value.It is difficult to say how much of this novel is real and how much is fiction. Certainly, the glimpses inside Sayuri's world ring true, but I think belaboring the \\"truth\\" of the story somehow misses the point. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" transcends usual memoirs and instead becomes something else - a powerful tale of a young girl struggling for the only happiness within her reach.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book on a business trip and almost missed all my meetings because I didn't want to put it down.

It was amazing and I'd say a good read for both men and women."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved Arthur Golden's novel \`Memoirs of a Geisha'; I found it surprising that an American male was the author, this a testimony to his talent as a writer. When reading the novel, I truly believed that he was translating the life story of a real Geisha based on interviews. The time and the location of the book is beautifully described, making the book almost \`magical'.The story captures the life of Chiyo/ Sayuri, a grey-eyed Japanese girl, who along with her sister, is sold by her family as a result of poverty. Upon arrival at a Geisha house, the sisters are separated and Chiyo succumbs to her new role as a servant for the dominating Mother.Hatsumomo the Geisha of the house, develops a dislike for Chiyo and begins to make life difficult for her. Soon Chiyo starts attending Geisha school. Later circumstances will end in her punishment, as a result she will be banned from attending the school.One day, while attending to some errands, she meets the Chairman who extends her a kindness that she will never forget. When Chiyo grows up, Mameha, a leading Geisha, trains Chiyo can become the most desired Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the moving story of Sayuri a Kyoto geisha who came from a very poor home in the fishermen's town of Yoroido.She begins her story telling us readers: \\"I wasn't born and raised to be a Kyoto geisha....I'm a fisherman's daughter from a little town called Yoroido on the Sea of Japan.\\" Her story is an amazing blend of survival and fierce hope.Chiyo was sold with her sister into slavery by their father because he couldn't raise them alone with the little money he got and his wife was so ill he couldn't take care of all three so he sells his girls to Mr. Tanaka who seemed to Chiyo as the most gracious and kind of men only to learn that this is not true. Mr. Tanaka sells them to an Okiya (a geisha house) when she was only 9 years old because her blue eyes are so different that she will be able to grow into a pretty and interesting woman and that is what a geisha should be like, pretty and interesting in order to entertain men preferable rich men of course.Narrating her life story from her elegant suite in the Waldorf Astoria, Sayuri tells of her traumatic arrival at the Nitta okiya, where she endures harsh treatments from Granny and Mother, the greedy owners, and from Hatsumomo, the sadistically cruel head geisha.But Sayuri's chance meeting with the Chairman, who shows her kindness, makes her determined to become a geisha. Under the tutelage of the renowned Mameha, she becomes a leading geisha of the 1930s and 1940s.Golden, with degrees in Japanese art and history, has brilliantly revealed the culture and traditions of an exotic world, closed to most Westerners.With him we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion.This book is a triumphant work of fiction, at once romantic, suspenseful, erotic and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What a wonderful book is it! I waited a long time before deciding to read it and I was wrong! It is such a beautiful novel! With a delicate eye in a world so different and so easy to misunderstand! I really loved it and I have already offered to many friends as a gift that never failed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"So, like some other reviewers, I watched the movie first (and I wills ave the accolades for my review of the movie). However, after a watching it, I had an instant craving to read the book to see what was left out (cuz we all know that Hollywood loves to elave out the best parts of a book).And, what I found within the pages completely led me to believe that I was right for wanting to read the book as well. While I will say that for the first time the film and the book are synonymous in character and detail. I must also add that the beuaty of the book was better as written work than on film. If you thought the movie was amazing, the book will prove breath-taking.From the narrative voice, which is rich and full of personality and life, to the events themselves, the reader will be hard-pressed to put the book down. The move does an admirable job portraying the emotions and feelings of the narrator, but the book sits you front and center to everything Sayuri feels, thinks, breathes, and does. The reader navigates through every life moment with her like they were there--feeling the anger of her father's decision, the pain of relizing her dream of being a giesha may be crushed, and her determination as she plans how she will see the Chairman again. It's a wonder the reader doesn't set off on their own journey to meet Sayuri and the characters that enter and exit her world--they're that real.I left the book feeling a better sense of completeness than I did with the movie (no spoilers here). And, I feel that Golden's research and time were well spent and permeate not only the landscape and places in the novel, but also the richness and depth of each character.If you've seen the movie, please do yourself a favor and read the novel as well. You won't be disaapointed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It took me a while to finish reading this book because I was indulging myself word per word. This book isn't the type of novel you should rush through. Regardless, the fact it is wrong in some places, like the part where Arthur Golden mentioned about the \\"mizuage\\", the book pulled you in like a few other books could do. Plus it took me a while to actually pick up this book and I must admit I did watch the movie first, then read it, cause I don't want to be disappointed with the movie. The book itself is way better than the movie.The book centers on a first view perspective of a geisha named, Nitta Saiyuri, who was born with the name Chiyo. Originally daughter of a fisherman from small fishing village of Yoroido, Chiyo and her sister, Satsu; was sold off to Kyoto, one to an Okiya and another off to a brothel. Chiyo's early life in Gion was pretty much mostly hellish due to Hatsumomo (\\"), because she saw Chiyo's potential of being a successful geisha. There she befriends another of a girl around her age nicknamed Pumpkin (,J{). In the okiya she also met Mrs. Nitta, or \\"Mother\\", and Granny, the mistresses of the okiya, then there's also Auntie.One day, she met a man that would change her point of life, the Chairman, and another geisha named Mameha (\\"--t), who in fact is Hatsumomo's rival in Gion, who would trained Chiyo into a very popular geisha.

The book debunks all the popular myths about these women of Japan and provides an insight into the life, thoughts and angst of a geisha in Kyoto. Beautiful imagery and a fine attention to detail brings Sayuri to life for us. Although the thoughts and feelings attributed to the young Chiyo seemed rather adult. It was a pity the book focused so much on her early life and glossed over Sayuri's actual experiences in later years. The sense of yearning and the question of 'Will she really get to be with the Chairman she dreams of so much' kept me engrossed till the end of the book. The characterizations of Hatsumomo, her nemesis, and Auntie, her friend and mentor, were vivid and helped in understanding Sayuri. The reproduction of the Japan of the 30's and 40's was excellent and each minute detail well researched. On the whole, a good book, although the completion of it leaves you wondering about her later years. You are also left feeling sceptical about a teenager having such intense thoughts and profound mental imagery when faced with challenging circumstances in life. A good read, the book draws you in."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I could not put this book down.

Her mother is dying of bone cancer, and her and her older sister are sold by her father.Her sister is taken to a house of common prostitution, but Chiyo, the heroine who is narrating the book, is taken by a Okija (Geisha house).Geisha, I learned, are entertainers--they sing, dance, tell stories, make jokes, and carry on interesting conversations with the patrons of tea houses.They also become the mistresses of very wealthy Japanese men. I always thought the Geisha got to choose who would be her dannae (her wealthy patron) but as it turns out, they have very little sayso over it at all. The deflowering of their virginity, which occurs at around age 14 or 15, goes not to a man they might like, but to the highest bidder. There is, however, a love story in the book as well as the many other trials and misadventures of Chiyo, whose Geisha name is Sayuri.There are quite a number of twists and turns and plots &amp; counterplots, and I couldn't put the book down--I found myself rooting for this young woman in her battles against a very cruel, but very beautiful Geisha named Hatsumomo, and for her to find happiness with the man that she fell in love with when she met him on the street as a child and he was kind to her. But will she ever meet him again? Or will she be forced into becoming the mistress of the brusque, horribly disfigured Nobu--who is the business partner of the man she truly loves?The detail in the book is exquisite, Mr. Golden certainly did his research.

The critics who don't like the ending are not aware that the geisha living in NYC was actually fact based. The best part of the book is when Nitta Sayuri moves to New York City with the Chairman's son in order to continue her romance with him there. Back in 1977, my Social Studies teacher at Francis Lewis HS in Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY told us that there had been a small article published about Japan and Geishas om the New York Times and his friend, the other SS teacher told him about another article in the NY Wall Street Journal. He said that you don't have to go to Japan to find a Geisha or teahouse because we got it right here in NYC. Then, he proceeded to detail about an older Japnese Geisha who had been living for several years in the Waldorf Astoris Hotel in Manhattan, New York. First he said that it was either the Plaza or the Waldorf, but then said it was the old, square, big hotel which would have been the Waldorf Astoria. She was living in one of the floors similar to the floor listed in Memoris of a Geisha, decorated in Japanese decor where entertaining took place - as in the book. The hotel did not mind if a Geisha lived there nor made it public. It was the buzz around town. It was just kept low key. The Geisha was running one Japanese Teahouse uptown and was opening a second one mid-town. This is similar to the book. Then, I did see one waiting to cross by a corner, but in NYC, you see so many people dressed in many types of fashion and costume of various ethnicities. By the early 1980's, I also heard from a Filippina Asian woman whose relatives, including Chinese female friends, that she confirmed that they knew of three to four Japanese Geishas living in Manhattan, NYC, relocated from Japan. They had apartments in Manhattan, NYC. They wore colorful kimonos too. Many Japanese businessmen had visited NYC on business, especially in the 1970's when there was commerce between the USA and Japan, before manufacturing was replaced by China. Since Mr. Golden's family is prominent in NYT publishig, he must have had an inkling from reporters and brought this wonderful tale to us. This is how the book was able to recreate reality into believable fiction. Therefore, fantasy of fiction, it is fact based. That makes the book very special with the ending being honest! The love affair taking place in New York City betwen the Geisha and Danna is uplifting. Yes, the Danna is 30 years older than his Geisha mistress. It seems that Chiyo lost her father who sold her to slavery to replace him with the older Chairman who was freeing her. So, it is unfair when the book is criticized that it does not make sense why Chiyo was in love with the Chairman. The movie made their ages closer to about twenty years apart, which was more believeable. Yes, Sayuri/Chiyo may have let fate take its hand, but often, but years ago, women were docile to go with the flow. Chiyo/Sayuri took a stand and in the end, she got her man. Lost couples found their their love rekindled later in life. The story tells of a love that waited through the course in time waiting for the right moment for clearance to proceede. It is often that people find one another after pining away twenty years. There was a time that correspondance was slower and really not at the fast speed of technology today. My only criticism is that more about the discussion from Mameha and Sayuri about the Chairman needed to have been expanded after Sayuri's diary was found by Hatsumomo. Since Pumpkin told Sayuri she recognized that Sayuri had affection for the Chairman, it would seem that begrudged Pumpkin, being a gossip (remember she gossiped about a Geisha who slept with a politician) would have exposed Sayuri to take apart her position. Luckily, the Chairman exposed to Sayuri's later antics, was broad minded and took a chance with her once Nobu took off. The book shows how life has its twists and turns and there is always hope for one's heart. It is not just a Cinderella story but a fantasy based on reality gem! It translates into American for us to love Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Without a doubt, Memoirs of a Geisha is one of my favorite books of time, actual facts be damned. Golden introduces his readers to Sayuri (formerly Chiyo-Chan) and immerses us in her world of make-up, kimono, and manipulation. Readers follow young Chiyo-chan from her time as a fisherman's daughter in a small inconsequential town in Japan to her life as Sayuri, the geisha on the streets of Kyoto in one of the famous districts in the country. Sayuri becomes the plaything of some of the most famous and powerful men in all of Japan as well as a pawn in a tricky game being played by the two most famous geisha, Hatsumomo and Mameha. Everyone has an agenda for Sayuri but her only agenda is finding a way to be with the man that loves, even if it means hurting someone who treats her with more kindness than she feels she could ever deserve. This book is a page turner and when you finished, I guarantee you will feel like you lived her life with her, like you know Sayuri. It's haunting and beautiful and refuses to stay closed for long, I should know, I've read it 6 times now."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memories of a Geisha is fantastic to say the least. This book drifts you back to another time when women were not valued and a Geisha was best next to marriage. The movie was fantastic as well and stayed with the book rather well. I give this book a ten."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book. It's just so well-written; a wonderful love story with a happy ending. Most of the negative reviews here take issue with the authenticity, and some suggest reading Mineko Iwasaki's \\"Geisha, A Life\\" instead. Apparently the ex-geisha (M. Iwasaki) Arthur Golden interviewed for Memoirs of a Geisha wrote that one as a response to his novel, since she was infuriated by the inaccuracies. Well, since I loved this book so much, I tried that one. I was not a fan; the writing just wasn't very engaging, and I found the protagonist grated on my nerves constantly. I think I'll post a review for that book as well, so I can explain further. Anyway, I just adore Memoirs of a Geisha, and since I am not reading it as a textbook for a Japanese Culture class, I don't particularly care about a few factual inaccuracies. This is the kind of novel I can curl up with and devour in two days; sadly such books are few and far between in my experience, so I treasure the ones that captivate me and usually buy multiple copies as gifts for friends and family who are similarly literature-minded (and not necessarily actual-factual Japanese culture-minded). I've probably read it at least a dozen times by now. In short, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I know this book was a Book Club darling way back when, but I just had never gotten around to reading it. So glad I did. It is the most exquisite book I've read in a long time.

It took me forever to read it, but thats mainly because i had so many tests. i loved how Sayuri described everything. By the way read the book before you see the movie.

This book is HIGHLY recommended to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I can understand the character Sayuri and to some it might seem to be a weak trait or flaw, the choice to do what she did near the end. It wasn't an easy choice, and I'd have to say it was brave. I made a choice in my life and took the safe or more accepted route, and I'm regretting it. Are you really 'living' if you go with your head and not your heart? No."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's amazing that a man wrote this. From the first sentence, I was hooked... I didn't expect so much humor to be in a novel where I thought a geisha only meant a high priced \\"courtesan\\". Whether everything in the book is true or not, it is a great and enthralling read.In it, we follow Sayuri as she is sold into the geisha world... learning and training in the geisha arts. It's heartbreaking to realize that she will lead a life uncontrollable to her, but also we feel for her because she's lost everything and this is her only hope to survive. Without it, where would she be? And who would she become? She struggles to fight against it but knows there's nothing she can do, but succomb and try to become the best geisha she can. If it happens that Mr. Chairman is most partly the reason, so be it.I loved this novel. I loved it for it's humor... for the sad undertones... and the little insight into a world that I knew very little about. Aurther Golden's literary style is one I admire for it's visual metaphors. I can taste and smell what Sayuri is surrounded in when I read this. She makes me laugh and my heart breaks for her when times are tough. With Nobu, put yourself in her position... what would you do? Can you give your heart to a man as tough as he? Can you give your body to a man so unattractive? And to have your virginity sold to the highest bidder? Imagine! To us, it would be degrading... but it's a way of life for Sayuri in this fairytale world of hers. And we all know fairytales are a just a cover for something darker than what it really is.I'm on the edge of my seats, waiting for the movie to come out. I pray that it will do the novel justice... pray it's as beautifully told... and the characters as real as the novel.Of course I recommend this book... for anyone who's ready to enter into a world unlike any other... true or false."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book itself tells a great story; it's what started my fascination with geisha.

This book takes a good look at what other cultures values and beliefs are. In America we think selling our bodies for money is not only morally wrong but also against the law. In the society where little Chiyo grows up its consider to be an honor to be a geisha or in essence a high-class prostitute.

I disliked all the characters because they were too superficially drawn, and I felt that the writing was too repetitive. In fact, I skipped about half or more of the book, and merely read the ending because I could never NOT finish a book. Because the author keeps repeating himself over and over to drive in obvious points, I feel that I didn't miss anything, despite my blatant skimming.I'm sure we do get a good idea of what constitutes a geisha's life, though you can probably get better depictions by reading other books about geisha, and hence you can bypass Golden's annoying writing.Fortunately, I borrowed this book from the library! If you are still intrigued with this novel because of the high critical acclaim (unfounded), please just borrow the book. This is the type of novel that does not bear reading twice, or once for that matter."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"How did I buy this book?

I must say it's one of the best book (if not the best one) I've ever read in terms of fictional characterization of a Japanese woman, of a geisha. I thought the author is a woman. And when I found out he is Arthur Golden, a man capturing a woman fantasy, dreams, emotions, feelings, hate, anger, joys, sadness, triumphs, failures...everything. It's like reading Sidney Sheldon who I think is very good in handling woman character.... I am teaching basic Nihongo in my place and I always recommend the book to my students and sometimes we end up talking about it for the whole class session... And I want to comment about the critics...esp about the man who wrote that it's a &quot;prose without something&quot; (can't remember)...it sad he can't connect himself to the novel.

I found it to be one of the most refreshing, culturally rich stories I have read in quite some time. The plot, if viewed through Western glasses, may appear trite or &quot;Cinderella-like&quot;. However, if the reader takes care to absorb cultural details, he will find an intriguing, sophisticated story and a deeper insight into Japanese culture.I must admit that I was personally drawn into the story because I spent 6 years living in Osaka and could visualize the scenes described in Kyoto.

I found it thoughtful, elegantly written and entertaining. The author clearly has a profound understanding of human behavior and the skill to transcribe ideas. He creates the surreal world of a Japanese geisha with a rich balance of imagination and history. I am not an avid reader of fiction and don't pretend to have a thorough knowledge of the body of western literature which covers Japan, but this is the finest book I've read in the context of Japan since the I finished the non-fiction work by Karel van Wolferen &quot;The Enigma of Japanese Power&quot; (c1990) which outlined many of the commercial, economic and cultural issues that are currently challenging the great nation of Japan. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was torn on whether to read this book or not. Yes, the geisha do have a mysterious aura of sexuality around them that I'd like to know about. On the other hand, did I want to invest a lot of time learning about a peculiar form of culture from a foreign country that has probably seen it's peak? OK, the sex part won out, and I'm glad it did.First of all, it's amazing that a white male from Tennessee could write such a believable tale. I hear he specialized in Japanese studies and went to Harvard, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt that the culture these people lived in was more or less accurate. But even if it is, the story would not have worked if the author had not created characters that you really want to know more about. That he does this with a handful of them makes it a surprisingly interesting book.As for what drew me into the book in the first place, one does learn about how the Japanese of this time treated sexuality. You learn from the book that the geisha were not prostitutes as we know them, but they were not innocent by any means. Commercial sex was available through regular channels, as we learn when the herioine and her sister are chosen for different paths in their lives.The geisha represented attaining a certain status in Japanese society, although this practice would seem silly when viewed by an outsider. As a father of four, with no time for such dalliances, it's very amusing to see how the top pillars of Japanese society, many with wives and families, would spend so much time and money trying to make an impression upon the geisha. I guess men are men everywhere, and will go through great lengths and expense to get the right look from the right lady. The Japanese just made an art out of it.By the way, sex with a geisha, while infrequent, was possible. It's just that it's gonna cost you an arm and a leg. The few experiences our heroine has are described as tastefully as something like this is going to, but it also makes it clear that this woman probably never had a positive experience here in her lifetime. Sad, but it's part of what makes this an excellent book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Im a college student currently interested in Japanese culture and noticed this title because I once read an article about a modern day geisha in a girl's magazine(just flipping through) and found it interesting.

I thought it was wonderful, how the main charictar (Sayuri) describes her live, how though for the most part she lived in complete &quot;comfort&quot; having everything she needed and plenty of money. But though you can seem to have it easy you can still a quite hard emotianal life.

People use this as an accurate account of a geisha's life, but it's full of lies and slander."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Your perception of literature is also saddening, since you obviously didn't catch the ending of this book.It was a fairy tale ending. \\"The Chairman\\" had another family and she was just a mistress. So you see, she didn't get the love she had been after for so long. You're think more about the movie than the book (the movie, by the way, had beautiful imagery and acting but everything else...terrible) The ending was bittersweet at the most and she still ended up alone. Nothing happy or sappy about that.I'm giving it a five because of a four reasons:1. Unrealistic as it is and almost off putting because an American white male wrote it, it's a nice story. More fiction than real life. Even though the ending wasn't happy, everything else after the first chapter was kind of unbelievable. But good unbelievable.2. It's only boring if you don't like novels about romance. This is a romantic story about a young girl trying to get to the one person she had tragically fallen in love with. Yeah, it is a little bit of a twisted Cinderella story. I've read worst books (trying V.C. Andrews Flowers in the Attic...pretty bad).3. I though it was an amazing story. The writing could've been better, but sometimes people are so arrogant that they believe the writing has to be top notch in order for book to be considered literature. I don't view it that way. The writing could be awesome but if the story isn't interesting enough...screw it.4. It's better than the movie. Much better. If someone watched the movie and think the book is horrible, then you need buy the book to prove movies made out of books can never live up. Example: The Color Purple, The Scarlet Letter, It.Would I recommend this book to Japanese women or men? No. They could probably come up with better stories about their history than an American. Would I recommend this book to an American woman who needs a good cry and a never-ending but sad romance? Yes.It's an American book about a Japanese old-age tradition. More fiction then history. Don't read it for the history, read it for entertainment. Five stars for entertainment.Avoid the movie at all costs!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My only interest in reading this book is to compare it when I finally go see the movie. Well, this should be interesting since 3/4 of the book is dedicated to the main character at the age of 9-14 years old. The movie ofcourse has Zhang Ziyi as it's big star. I guess if you really try hard, she can play a 14 year old. Anyway the narrative prose is done quiete well and you almost believe in the existence of Chiyo-san. I didn't find the story special or unique. It's really Cinderella goes to Japan. The author is an Asian historian, arts educated type, so there's a lot of explaining about the art and history of being a Geisha. Well, Arthur Golden was passionate enough about this subject to put a lot of effort in writting this story. And his meticulousness shows through the details as the main character takes us through the rigors of becaming a Geisha. As we all know, a Geisha is not a plain old prostitute, but a prostitute with lots of talents and hundreds of years of tradition behind her, but a prostitute nevertheless. The book goes into great detail regarding the auctioning of Chiyo's virginity at the age of 15 and a breif mention of her time during World War 2. Everything ends nicely for our heroine, almost in a Gone with the Wind bravura.. But the girl ends up wtih her prince charming. This is light reading and didn't make that great of an impression on me.

Its detail regarding the life of a geisha was meticulous and interesting, whether or not it's entirely true-...-to a certain point. That's why it gets two stars. The loss otherwise comes as a direct result of its deterioration into a sleazy, dime-store romance novel in the last third or so of the book. Siyuri began as a marginally sympathetic character, even if she was infuriatingly weak, but declined into nothing more than a [prostitute]...I found her obsessive behavior regarding the Chairmain particularly pitiable, and when she [sold] herself to the Minister in order to rid herself of Nobu, in the hope of winning her childhood \\"hero,\\" I literally threw the book across the room. My empathy for her had already been fading, and at that point, I no longer cared if she lived or died.

It is extremely well written, and it has a simplicity in the book that humbles anyone who criticize Geisha. Geishas have been so much misunderstood.They are not prostitutes or ladies of the night.

Golden's opening this door allows the reader to vicariously join Mameha as she maneuvers a sinuous, convoluted path, progressing from being a slave to achieving a measure of independence. Following this path requires the geisha to master many skills and rituals. Examples of these rituals include donning 20 undergarments which lie beneath the kimono, presiding over the elaborate ceremony in which movements reflect belief systems, propitiating the multitude of Shinto gods and goddesses, and practicing the recondite Oki (a social and economic system as well as a physical structure in which the geishas live). Intricate protocol must be observed while negotiating the geisha's mizuage, the selling of her virginity. Another significant negotiating period occurs when she chooses a danna, her principal protector. For Mameha this choice is complicated by a familiar interloper-love. The author reveals Mameha's charm and intelligence through the metaphors she fashions-some charming and innocent, some saucy and witty. The book closes with an image Mameha constructs describing the choices she has made:\\"But now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean.

Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into a wash, just like watery ink on paper.\\"This excerpt, taken from the words of Arthur Golden's fictional character Sayuri, beautifully reflects the main theme in his novel Memoirs of a Geisha; no matter what type of hand life deals to us, in the end our struggles are of little importance. This talented author successfully gives a detailed account on the life and hardships of struggling Geisha in Japan during the 1930s and 1940s. Golden pulls the reader from the present and takes her back to a different place and time, providing a brief escape from reality. From the very beginning of this story, we are immediately immersed in a different world with a culture completely unlike our own. We are transported to a different place and time -where women are objects to be won, and where love is seen as delusion. Golden writes in first person from the voice of a young Japanese girl, effectively drawing us even closer to the story. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we learn of the struggles and joys of young Chiyo-chan as she is taken away from her home in Yoroido and abandoned at an unwelcoming Okiya in the geisha district of Kyoto, Japan. From there Chiyo-chan changes to Sayuri-san in her climb up the social ladder and discovers the pride and shame of her life as a geisha. As the previous excerpt from the novel demonstrates the lesson that Sayuri has learned by the end of her life, so do the readers of Golden's work also come to this conclusion by the end of the story. The clever way in which he organizes the events that take place in Memoirs of a Geisha make this possible. Although the character Sayuri and her story are fictional, the historical content in it of the life of geisha is true. I think that this novel fits its appropriate genre of historical fiction. As mentioned, the story in itself is not true but the historical facts included with it are. The author, Arthur Golden was educated at Harvard College where he studied art history and specialized in Japanese art. In 1980 he earned an M.A. in Japanese history from Columbia University. He researched the day-to-day life of Geisha for over ten years and interviewed actual Geisha of Gion before writing Memoirs of a Geisha along with numerous other people who spent time in Kyoko during World War II. The only discrepancy of the accuracy of Golden's portrayal of geisha that I have read about is that some geisha today disagree with his assumption that geisha are equivalent to prostitutes. Golden writes this novel in a very realistic style. Because he narrates from the first person point of view, the tone is very intimate and personal. The story becomes engrossing; it is as though we are reading someone else's diary. Every bit of information is a secret - captivating and enthralling. The reading difficulty was not so challenging that I was bombarded with unfamiliar words that I had to look up to understand the plot. However, this did not take away from the overall challenge and interest of the book. Golden writes with a semi-poetic style and includes a unique dialect to enhance the believability of the characters. After reading Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden, I experienced a kind of bittersweet joy. I was grateful that I had reached the conclusion of the novel and yet almost sad that I had to be brought back into reality from the fascinating world of geisha. Previous to reading this novel, I had temporarily lost my love for reading; Memoirs restored it completely. Immediately after finishing this thrilling novel, I wanted to find out more about the lives of geisha and obtain another one of Golden's works. Amazingly though, Memoirs of a Geisha is his first novel.

It is an intimate sharing of an Asian woman's experience, written in such a way as to seize the reader's heartfelt sympathies, but at the same time to educate the reader about the richness of another way of life.What also sets this book apart is the author's use of similes from nature not present in the work of other English/American authors. The similes bring vibrance and impact to the author's points. For instance, when the small girl stepped off the train into a strange city after being on the train all day, with no food, she said she felt as a rock must feel at the bottom of a waterfall.

We become geisha because we have no other choice.&quot; These are the words of an experienced geisha, Mameha, to her apprentice, Sayuri. They expose the truth behind the seeming glamour of a geisha's life in early 20th century Japan. Arthur Golden's, Memoirs of a Geisha, is a candid view into the private life, thoughts, and dreams of a successful geisha based on his interviews with former geisha, Nitta Sayuri. Memoirs of a Geisha is a fictional account of Sayuri's life told in the first person. Golden allows Sayuri to tell her own story using an intricate blend of her thoughts and feelings and what happens to and around her. She describes in great detail how she was sold and forced into the closed world of a geisha. The irony of her success is fully developed and ends with her eventual escape from it. In many instances, in lieu of using the names of those she was involved with, she gives them names that describe their most striking physical traits. Such designations include Dr. Crab and Mr. Snowshowers. Golden does justice to the exclusive sect be meticulously defining, through the eyes of a girl, exactly what being a geisha means and entails. He brings clarity to an occupation clouded with misgivings. Through the story of Sayuri, readers come to understand that the terms geisha and prostitute are not interchangeable. Even the designation of &quot;courtesan&quot; is not entirely accurate. True, a geisha's &quot;virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder&quot; and it is common for them to become a man's mistress for fees similar to a salary, but these aside, geisha society and responsibilities are far more involved. A geisha can best be described as a peculiar type of artist. They painstakingly perfect their skills in music and dance while forever taking on their famous &quot;china doll&quot; exteriors to entertain at parties with little more than conversation. Image and presentation are critical and captivating the men they entertain is crucial. Yet, these are still the outward traits of geisha that have been apparent all along. Golden truly shines as an author in his portrayal of the secret desires and aspirations of geisha that are so human, and yet, within their circumstances, so unattainable. Golden paints his eduring portrait of a geisha's life through the eyes and thoughts of innocent, naive Sayuri. Through her words and Golden's vivid descriptions, the reader is immersed in a society where a girl, a potential geisha, is owned and exploited in a manner which is comparable to slavery. Young girls are chosen and sold to okiyas, female households supported by geisha, and are trained to become geisha. They are expected to obey, succeed, and even one day support their okiya through the sale of their appearances at social events and, in specific instances, their bodies. They are taught to entice and seduce even the most distinguished men, all for little more than financial gain. Love is considered a fantasy, something to shirk. For geisha, falling in love is an impossible dream whose pursuit leads to self-destruction. Geisha are the property of their okiya, their duty being to obey their &quot;mother.&quot; For all but the most fortunate, this means that they must entertain the most affluent men possible, and become the mistress of whomever would benefit the okiya most. Simply put, a geisha is compelled to set aside her personal feelings unless she is foolish enough to follow them an risk certain discovery, embarrassment, and all too often, expulsion from her okiya to a cruel life on the streets. During World War II, geisha districts were shut down, and most inhabitants were forced to join the futile war efforts of a desperate Japan. After the was, geisha slowly filtered back to their okiyas and reestablished their connections, but geisha as a whole had diminished in number and had lost some of their former grandeur. It was in this time of uncertainty that some geisha left this way of life and ventured into the world, but Sayuri did not. She, like so many others, were bound by their senses of duty, loyalty, and honor, which made them feel obligated to return to their okiyas and continue their lives as geisha. Golden shows his mastery as a writer in his ability to display how desire brings unrest to the human spirit. He unveils the turmoil behind the makeup of a geisha who must choose between what is expected of her, however undesirable yet certain and a desperate plan meant to free herself from one man because of a passion for another. Such is the tale of all geisha. Obedience leads to security in a financial and social sense, but requires ambitions and dreams to be forsaken. Pursuing one's emotions and desires has but one guarantee; there are none. These are the reasons that geisha behave the way they do, like docile lambs following their shepherd without question. They submit to decisions made for them, thereby assuring their safety rather than risking the even less desirable existence of a common prostitute on the streets for attempting to follow their heart. This novel is especially gripping because of its incomprehensible nature. Few people in this country, or the industrialized world for that matter, can begin to fathom a life where someone has such complete control of your life. A life in which not only is your profession is forced upon you, but so is your lover. This was the tragic, hopeless realm of the geisha, a realm that has thankfully. for all intents and purposes, faded with the sunset of Japan's past."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am the last guy who would read this book (I like Scarface, Goodfellas and the Godfather for entertainment) yet this story keep me entertained to the very end.My response to those who didn't like it: DID WE READ THE SAME BOOK?1.

Written by a young, white American male in the late Twentieth century, it brilliantly depicts the life of a geisha in Japan during the 1930s and 1940s. The novel has been appropriately described by one reviewer as an act of ventriloquism because of the author's ability to get inside the mind of the book's female protagonist and write a novel of sustained versimilitude and historical and cultural accuracy. The achievement is even more notable when you realize that &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is Golden's first published novel.&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; tells the story of Chiyo, the poor daughter of an elderly fisherman and his dying wife. When Chiyo is eight years old, she and her older sister, Satsu, are sold by their father, both designated to become geisha in Kyoto. While Satsu is unremarkable and she ends up as a common prostitute, Chiyo's striking eyes, diminutive beauty and resilient intelligence make her a suitable geisha in training. She soon finds herself in conflict, however, with the resident geisha in her house, Hatsumomo, a beautiful and mean-spirited woman whose antagonism runs through the novel like a thread.Hatsumomo makes life unbearable for Chiyo and seemingly destroys her future until she is taken under the wing of Mameha, a beautiful and accomplished geisha whose motives are uncertain. Through the efforts of Mameha, Chiyo becomes a succesful and avidly sought geisha, taking the name Suriya and becoming the favorite of a war-maimed, wealthy patron named Noru. All this time, however, Suriya's romantic obsession is a business partner and deeply-indebted friend of Noru, a man simply known as the &quot;Chairman&quot;, a man who had once been kind to the young Chiyo when he found her crying by a stream.&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is, thus, an historical romance set in Japan during the Depression and the years during and following World War II. As a romance, it is a somewhat lacking because of its fairy tale quality, its unbelievability, its departure from realism. However, while its romantic aspects fall short, it is remarkably successful in depicting the geisha culture of the period--the extensive training of the geisha, the incredible physical and mental demands of the geisha profession, the cultural milieu, trappings, beliefs, and superstitions of the geisha in day-to-day life, and the place of the geisha in Japanese society. &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is also remarkable for the way its author succeeds in imagining, and expressing, the intimate life and thoughts of the young Chiyo and the mature geisha Suriya.While &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; does not rise to the level of classic status and can, at times, be somewhat tedious, it is a remarkably well written and imagined first novel, a stunning and sympathetic fictional portrayal of an aspect of Japanese culture that is often misunderstood in the West."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There is a bit of voyeurism in the title of Golden's first novel.Told inthe voice of Sayuri, a girl bought from her parents at a young age and delivered into Dickensian misery, she is later trained to become a prominent geisha in pre-war Japan. The book hints at providing an intimate glimpse into a strange and somewhat tawdry profession devoted to ritualized sexual display. And while it can be refreshing to confront the Japanese images of sex and seduction; the bare wrist, elaborate costumes, and the &quot;split peach&quot; hairstyle, Golden is ultimately more of a curator than a voyeur. He does not go into the geisha dressing room, the entire book is more like a runway fashion show. In fact, much of the book is like a fairy tale. Sayuri is Cinderella, a naive country girl who achieves big city success and the love of the man she has long worshipped, despite the evil plotting of her enemies. Hatsumomo is the cruel stepsister who is constantly planning Sayuri's downfall; the Chairman is a delicate Price Charming who stays out of the action until the right moment. Nobu is the fairy tale beast, a noble, gruff, deformed and misunderstood, but ultimately more interesting suitor who actively pursues Sayuri; the Geisha who befriends Sayuri is her only ally in a cruel world. Like most fairytales, Sayur's desire for the Chairman is not demonstrated thru the logic of the story. Most of Golden characters fail to display any depth or complexity; they are but shallow fairy tale caricatures, right down to the gruesome Dr. Crab. Golden does seem more interested in desribing the rituals of being a geisha, and one does wonder if he might have served his cause better by writing a work of nonfiction. But in a work of fiction, he is not bound to tell the truth, he can construct his novel any way he chooses. It is rich with atmosphere, but ultimately has little substance. I was quite taken with the book initially, but the lack of self-reflection or observations by any of the characters about their life or circumstances never does come about, and I grew increasingly frustrated. Indeed the novel is much like a geisha, bautiful and captivating on the outside, but with no real inner beauty. It reads like the work of a scholar (Golden is one) not the memoirs of a flesh and blood woman, though the book's run on the bestseller lists indicates we can all be voyeurs too!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Everyone screams praise of Golden, but most of the Japanese women I know who have read this hated it, as do I. Golden may have researched and trained for ten years, but my own music and dance training by a geisha taught me that geishas take twice that to train. A Westerner who attempts to write about Easterners is fine, but do not claim you can ever understand the nuances of a culture or that you are an expert on something when its obvious you are not. I was so insulted and continue to be that such horrible indiscretions about my culture continue to exist and are pedalled to be true by so many uneducated people. Being half American I am so ashamed that we believe a work of FICTION as truth so desperately. Its not about political correctness, its about misunderstanding a people."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was the most shallow and superficial attempt of a cultural novel I have ever read. I read that Golden wrote another poor novel before this one, also set in Japan, and the man had not even been to Japan before! When that novel failed, he decided that maybe it would be a good idea to understand what he is writing about. Good idea! I'd hate to see how it would have turned out if he hadn't.If the Japanese culture interests you, than please read Tanizaki's &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; and I promise you that you will realize what I mean."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book gets at least two stars for its educational value as a primer on the life of a geisha (assuming it is accurate). And it gets only two stars for completely failing to portray the geisha as a real person. It's almost as if Arthur Golden mistakes a language barrier for a lack of depth. The book fails for several reasons.I was not salivating over the possibility of sexual content before I started reading, but the attempts at descriptions of sex in the novel are numbingly dry. And the few moments that are supposed to possess a warm sensuality completely fail to express any pleasure. Perhaps because Golden is a man, he was wary of delving too deeply into the mysterious and confusing realm of womanly sexuality. I know I'd be intimidated, but I would try harder than he did.And isn't the main character supposed to be a clever girl? She continually notes her intelligence and her wit as strengths of her personality. Yet we see no evidence of that at all, unless you count the few slightly clever jokes she manages to toss out at geisha parties. Other than that, there is more evidence in the story to suggest that Sayuri lacked any sort of awareness of her situation. She floats along without being an active participant, manipulated by the GOOD geisha (Mameha) and the BAD geisha (Hatsumomo) alike. She never anticipates and only occasionally makes internal judgments of what transpires around her. Her disfigured friend and client urges her on more than one occasion to take control of her life, but she insists to herself that she is unable to match his expectations. And she never does! If I could give away spoilers, I could go into more depth. Her ultimate attempt at taking control of her own destiny is both morally backwards and a complete disaster. And her pursuit of an apparently empty romance is hardly inspiring. I kept hoping Sayuri would realize this Chairman fantasy was a hollow goal and redirect her dreams elsewhere, but she never does.Does Arthur Golden think so little of women that he couldn't imagine a stronger central character, one who really can take control of her life and has some amount of self-reflection? Characters around Sayuri are stronger than she. What's the problem? As I read further and further into the book, the distinct impression gained was that the novel was a high school prom fantasy wrapped up in an interesting aspect of Japanese culture. As someone else wrote, the book is essentially a Harlequin romance novel, and all the detail about the life of a geisha fails to hide it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am toatally baffled about all the attention this book has received especially all the underserved praise for the author. The narrative style was as dry as unbuttered toast and over-ladden with unnecessary and repetative details. The style is almost amateurish and the overuse of certain ajectives to descride everything from facial expressions to kimonos is annoying. The extent of the historical research is commendable, but the amount of it in the novel is almost oppressive at times (if he described how to tie an obi one more time I was bound to do something drastic). It is completely lacking in the basic elements of good storytelling: plot, characters, and theme. The plot was utterly uncompelling and went nowhere. I wasn't expecting any great twists or turns, but a few little surprises would have been nice (don't get me started on the ending). The characters are all cardboard cutouts with one or two defining characteristics. The most disappointing of all was the character, or lack thereof) of the geisha herself. She dosen't grow at all as a character or learn anything from her experiences. She is essentially the same at the end as she is a the beginning. This novel is about a mile wide and an inch deep. Maybe I've read too many well written books with well developped characters and meaningful themes to get any enjoyment out of this mess. I was reluctant to read this book because it was a bestseller, but after being pleasantly surprised by other bestsellers (notably Cold Mountain and Snow Falling on Cedars), I decided to give it a try, what a mistake!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My first thought, when I first heard of this book, was how could a white, American man write from the perspective of a Japanese geisha? The book's rave reviews, plus Spielberg's purchase of the story rights, convinced me to read it. It turns out that my original thought was correct. The prose is filled with cliches, and the story is quite inaccurate from the female perspective (particularly the scene where the heroine loses her virginity.) Why must every commercially hot property turn out to be like the script for &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (i.e. an unrealistic, male fantasy)? How degrading"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book! I gave it 5 stars because it has every component that a good book has.

It was a fasinating story with wonderful writing. Read this book or you will be really missing out on the most incredible adventure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha provides a look at an important part of the Japanese culture. Before starting the book, I realized I had very little knowledge of a Geisha except how they looked and a brief thought they were supposedly high-class prostitutes. I think this novel beautifully dispels these incorrect thoughts and gives a realistic view of a Geisha's life. If I like a book, I tend to find other books on the topic. One part that fascinated me to learn was there were apprentice geisha's and Geisha's. They varied in mode of dress, hair styles, roles and expectations. I did find some pictures of how both looked and dressed...beautiful.The story begins in the life of a child and her family. Her mother is ill and her father is detached. She and her sister are later sold due to the well-meaning interference of a local merchant. They are abruptly taken away from their home. Chiyo, later called Sayuri is unusual looking because she has gray eyes. The book details her trials and conflicts in trying to become a geisha and looking for her sister. She is befriended by a kind Geisha who becomes her \\"older sister.\\" Even though this book is a novel, it is loosely based on the life of a real Geisha, by the name of Mineko Iwasaki. There have been a few reviews that slammed this book saying that Iwasaki was not happy with the rendition of this book. You know, I think there is plenty of room in this world for all kinds of books and it's important to know, this IS a novel. I think Memoirs does a wonderful job of dispelling myths and showing the story behind the Geisha's and some of Japan's culture and history. Any book that can enlighten and at the same time be immensely readable has my admiration. I thought it respectfully depicted the Geisha's and Japan's culture in a realistic and favorable light. It has inspired me to read more on both. I think the book does a great job in depicting that Geisha's were first and foremost artists in dance, singing and tea ceremony, but at the same time showed there could be a seamier side. From what I have read so far in other resources, some of the Geisha and clients were not all well-behaved (kind of like in \\"real\\" life). In the book, Geisha by Jodi Cobb there is a quote by a Kyoto geisha (page 76), \\"It's hard to live in a geisha house. There are too many of us in one place, and things get out of control. This world is too competitive, and filled with jealousies. I have superficial friends, not real ones, and other geisha talk behind my back. But I believe in myself. When I was young, everything was new and I loved it all. But it's no longer a dream; it's all too real.\\"I have picked up Geisha, My Life by Mineko Iwasaki on whom Memoirs was loosely based. I intend on writing a review of it once I complete the book. I think it is important to understand that Memoirs does not say it is a book based on Iwasaki's life. The author Golden seems to have used the depictions of her life as a Geisha to flesh out the basis of his novel and get the \\"background\\" correct. I never opened this book thinking it was semi-biographical.I highly recommend this wonderfully written book. I could not put it down and read it in 2 days (even before our book club selection)!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I purchased this book several years ago and never read it. With the release of the movie I finally made myself open it up again. It took me 2-3 chapters to really get into the book. After that it turned out to be pretty good. I liked the story but it ended rather predictably and uneventful."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Amazing how a simple book of a life of a geisha can be describe in such a way that I was blown away with the style they live and that price they pay for a manageable life that is stable to strive through any times in life. This is the life of a geisha or the title of the book is Memoirs of a geisha author is Arthur Golden he had turn this book to a wonderful novel which is now recommended to people every where. As for my opinion it is the most great novel of its time. In which is now a major motion picture; as well as we should know by now. He had put in great effort to have this written in a third person point of view and under the influence of a geisha after her life in Kyoto. In this book it go through the history of 1929 before the war and during the war of WW II and the hardship of a child from a small village later was sold for a slave at a small geisha house. Then train to be one herself.In this book he had place our mind back in the time that we weren't or were born in. Acting like we too are Korean or Japanese in which he had take us from our reality and place us in a world we are going learn first hand. The beginning is start as a harsh life of a women and as a little sister being unnoticed and enjoy her usual life style. Father as a fisher men and mother sick from a unknown cause of disease at the time the doctor still was searching for a cruel for this disease. He show the way of a child life that was bass under a story line of Cinderella from poor and dirty to rich and nearly famous. The way chiyo, a child, was born in an shack she go through pain In which is hard like any normal life of any one like a kid just trying to make their parent proud of her and sacrificing the thing she love to earn their trust, their happiness, and to know that they are proud of her for the things she had done for them. The same way of any child would want plus everyone should know how it feel since we all been through it our self. From running chores for elders and or parents to clean up the whole house. Then there many other ways that the children live their lives. But the city of Kyoto is a different story in the year 1930's its was honor or death I believe. But kids in the poor side run freely and do what ever they want. In life you see life as a story if you have the time to think about it and really through it out in your mind then the book will relate to you in some way or another. Then if this is to happen then the author had done good job in look up fact on life as well as his own andThen what he does in this book is that he go in to every little detail about the story and the scene that take place in the part of the storyline like all the rain drop that shimmer off of leafs and sparkle in the light of the morning ray. When he type the word out on paper he express the small little senses that we need to fill our mind with the picture that he want us to see. He also want us to imagine the environment in which the children that live in poor houses or village have a difficulty in living their lives in which they want a pure happiness. Like mess up street that you can fall in and pond that count as a swimming pool and boys and girl don't care about the social static on what level they are when you live in a poor environment. Then he also show the way on how the geisha have to give up so much to succeed the high potential of maintaining the image of a geisha. From beginning at a young age and some were even sold to have a better life or help the family with money problem and many other reason why they sold their children that either benefit them or the children. Then when getting there when you are not to old you can become a geisha but if your to old you go to jorou-ya which is another word for prostitute or the area for it. For the young one they first have to earn they way to become a apprentices of a geisha or get chosen by a well renowned geisha. Before all the apprentices they must go to school first and learn all the dance music and many more that they have to do to be come a famous geisha. They have to keep their hair in a perfect form and it must stay that way till they are upgraded to a higher level of a geisha in which they change the hair style. There is also that they must not have any dandruffs on their sculpt for it won't look good for the geisha. So our life is much easier then back then.Then through all this the best part of this book is when he show the _expression of shriyo also know as chiyo when she go through all the pain of ever being sold and pulled away from her family and then to Kyoto and not knowing where her sister is till one month later. Then when she grew up she become more beautiful then most of the geisha with her gray eyes. She late find out that she must sell her virginity to the highest bidder. To her surprise she had many pedophiles that want her body and to be the first to be in her private part and that even if she is the most beautiful lady there. There are many people as in men want her for them self. Then she have to get a that support her school fines and all the other expenses that they may need to keep up with their life. Then there is also how they seduces the costumer. They just start of with pouring tea for their costumer and showing part of their arm and then talk about dirty stuff is funny. I guess that is the only way to get money for a living and under the word geisha it mean an art or an artist. To the people that live in America back then though it meant prostitute, but really it is a way with art song dance and look and so much more then you will think it is a way of art then having someone in you over and over night after night just for money. A geisha have this but the one different is that they do art in which a way is a dance and singing and playing instrument to make a song and perform on stage and movie with wearing silk art as in the kimono. The geisha is a very lovely in a way but a harsh life to live if you don't had discipline or self control and do drinking in a way to get away from reality is a bad thing. To be a geisha you must be ready for anything don't be a baby about every thing and listen to advices that is given to you and put it to good use. They need to use their brain and do something with their live and not just sit there and do nothing. They need to take on the problem and figure out what to do if you get to restarted you life again.The book of memoirs of a geisha is written by Arthur golden this is the most grand book I have read since I was born and I want to recommend this book who love story with drama and love. The book that is content is fill with wonderful content and emotion that is fill on each page. Hopefully you did as I did I pick it up and never stop reading till it was done. This is a magnificence book and the girl in this story you will be attach to her and end up knowing what is true about geisha and their artist way of life and living. So much people search to see if there was any fault in this story. To their astonishment the fact about a geisha was all true and the war was true as well he had done a wonderful job of find out the information and description about life in the 1930's. the emotion and imagination is off the scale of the work of a true writer. This book will have a way to stay with us in our life and take it a way that will help us through our life and know that we souldn't take things for grandit. Instead cherish the moment and the time that you have here on earth and the other good things in life and be happy that you don't have to live through any of what had happen in the story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read a lot!

Forced into becoming one because of her beauty, she learns the arts of a geisha and how to captivate men, like revealing just a touch of the inner wrist while pouring tea. In a world fraught by jealousy and hatred, plotting and scheming, Sayuri learns to survive especially from her jealous rival Hatsumomo who lives at the same okiya. She is not very much different from a doll that is sought after by men, has her virginity sold to the highest bidder and is not allowed to make any decisions except what kimono she is to wear. It is a beautifully written tale thats described richly in detail, so you feel as if Sayuri is taking you through a tour of her life.

Some reviewers may disagree with my callous remark that the main character, Sayuri, was bred to become an entertainer and call girl, because the story is told in a sweet manner and truly personifies the struggles of a geisha's training. However, she does have sex for money. In addition, many other characters are fully developed and intriguing in their own sort, which adds tremendous value to the storyline.I was impressed with the descriptions of the kimono dresses, tea parties, and of Pre-and-Post-WWII Japanese neighborhoods.

Her apprenticeship, beset by jealousies, was interesting, with its many informative pages about the geisha's necessary talents, such as dancing and tea-service.

As she is an apprentice she comes across a man, the only man that had shown her kindness when she was a child, increasing her determination to become a Geisha and gain his approval.This is not only the story of a Geisha it is the story of Japan during the great depression and during world war two, beautifully written around the struggles of a woman who must work as hard as she can to support herself. The romance is flawless and the drama is poignant and breathtaking this was an amazing read. The movie that followed this book is one of my favorites, though the movie could not come close to the beauty within this novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"\\"Memoirs if a Geisha\\" is (obviously) the story of a geisha named Sayuri. Originally a girl from a small fishing village in Japan, Sayuri winds up in Gion to train and become a geisha. The path is not an easy one for her, with rivals and obstacles at every turn, not the least of which is Sayuri's struggle to obtain a modicum of control over her own life/destiny. The novel follows her from girlhood, through her initiation as a geisha, her isolation in the countryside during World War II, and her return to Gion afterwards. According to the introduction, it is based on the true story of a real-life geisha who was interviewed by Arthur Golden for the novel.As a Westerner who knows little about Japanese culture, I found this book fascinating. The storyline and characters did a fine job of keeping me interested, but what intrigued me most was all the details; the kimonos worn by the geisha, Sayuri's training in various geisha arts, geisha customs, the food they ate, the day-to-day life of a geisha and ordinary Japanese people in the late 1930's-early 1940's, superstitions, hierarchies, etc. Golden is very careful to give precise and in-depth descriptions of anything that Western audiences might not be familiar with, like the process of wearing a kimono or why dance is such an important art for geisha, which is much appreciated. There are also historical details- World War II takes place during the book- that are obviously told from a Japanese point of view, which is not something that many Westerners are exposed to.Apparently there's been some controversy over parts of the novel, specifically the parts about the sexual relationship between geisha and their customers. I've since read that geisha were/are sorely entertainers and never sleep with their clients, which is directly contradicted in the novel. Since I am far from an expert on the topic, I cannot say which claim is true (so perhaps read the novel with a grain of salt), but I still felt that I knew much more about Japanese culture after reading this book, and it made me want to learn more."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the worst book I've read in years ...hundreds of books. My instinct in putting it off so many years was right -- what a completely romanticized, Americanized load of crap. I respect all the positive-review readers here, and I never write reviews here, but I just couldn't contain myself from trying to warn someone from wasting a slice of your life on this mush. If you want to spend \\"time\\" in Japan, 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is a much better experience."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read Memoirs of a Geisha because a friend of mine read it a few years ago and it's the book that got her interested in reading.I'm not sure what I was expecting but I do know that being treated to a rich and beautifully rendered narrative wasn't what I thought I'd get. This book created a world so convincing that I had to repeatedly research the author and history of the book to remind myself that it is indeed fiction.The story begins with a young girl living in a small fishing village in Japan whose mother is gravely ill. As her mother gets closer to death, the girl's father sells both of his daughters, one into prostitution and one to a Geisha house. Obviously the book is the story of the latter daughter.I knew nothing about Geishas, Japan, or really anything else described in this book and I wouldn't have thought it would interest me -- but it did. I was fascinated and really had trouble putting this book down. It was a story of overcoming staggering odds, making the most of even the worst situation and learning that human kindness can go a long way.In summation : I would highly recommend it to others and remain, weeks later, really surprised by how engrossing the story and the writing were."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This wonderful memoir takes you to the magical, exotic and oftentimes sad Japan between WWI and WWII through the eyes of one of Japan's best known geishas. The story really is moving and her way of telling it, with her colorful old fashioned use of language is very entertaining and interesting from beginning to end. I had already watched the movie before reading the book and without a doubt the movie is a MUCH deeper look into the world of the geishas. Leave your cultural hangups at the door though because there is a lot of child abuse, women being sold as objects and even a 15 year old girl's virginity being auctioned off to the higher bidder among a group of old men. This was simply the way that culture worked at that time and you do need to remove yourself from your cultural hangups to be able to enjoy the story for what it is. Overall, this is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After reading several books lately which took place in Japan, I was interested to learn more about geishas. Since I had purchased this book several years ago, it was a perfect time to read it. The book was very interesting, very sad, very informative. It appeared the ending was going to be tragic. Instead it had a delightful twist. It didn't make for a fairy tale happy ending, but it made the ending something I could accept and believe. I highly recommend it, especially for women."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book by Arthur Golden has been on my \\"To Be Read\\" list for a long time! I thought the narrator, Bernadette Dunne, did a beautiful job. I think I enjoyed this book much more hearing it than reading it, as I could hear the names and words spoken in the way that they were meant to be. I have always been fascinated with other cultures, so this book was a real treat.The book is about a young girl, Sayuri, who is sold into slavery to a geisha house in Gion, Japan. As she gets older, she must learn the geisha ways and traditions of the geisha, including: the tea ceremony, how to wear the kimono, the elaborate hair and make-up, the dancing.The writing was beautiful, and I was totally captivated by this story.My rating: 4.5 stars!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A friend of mine loaned MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA to me, and I have to admit it sat on my shelf for months. The small font, singled spaced text was far from appealing to my eye. My preference to soft cover books over hard also hindered me from reading it. Once I finally dove into it, I was swept away by a fascinating story.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is brilliantly written with amazingly unique lines, and packed full of information, giving great attention to detail. The story is captivating, and intriguing, heartbreaking and heartwarming. It reads like a biography, though in actuality it's a wonderful fictional story packed full of non-fiction material. This book will draw you into the world of a Geisha, equally sad and fascinating.Nine-year-old Chiyo and her sister were sold into slavery by their father while their mother was on her death bed. Thrown into the harsh world of the unknown, Chiyo soon realizes her only hope is to become a Geisha.MEMORIES OF A GEISHA takes the reader on Chiyo's journey from a young sister and daughter, to the aches, pains, and relentless training required to become a Geisha. Each and every character is so well thought-out you'll believe them to be real.Because the author was so detailed, I longed to see it visibly, and was tempted more than once to view the movie before I finished book. Within hours of completing the book, I watched the movie. It was extremely fast paced compared to the book, and like most great books, the movie couldn't compare, although I enjoyed it.It was great to see the book come alive, but I would highly recommend reading the book before the movie. Though you get the visual details in the movie, many of them have little meaning without the knowledge of the details behind them. If you haven't read the book, but have seen the movie and enjoyed it, I recommend you read the book. You'll be fascinated by what you'd missed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought this book in large print for my mother who is 81 years old & in a home.She enjoyed the contents of the book, but the pages were falling out as she read the book...

One from Taiwan said it was &quot;deep and dark,&quot; and I agree. I was impressed with Golden's ability to expose a culture of oppression and rigidity in pre-war Japan, without ever saying so, and in the words of a woman who must accept it. By extension, he calls into question the values of other oppressive places and times. Pretty impressive work."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a great book, I thought this novel was very beautifully writen and gets your atention from the start.

I read a lot of books--several since this one--so being still in the thrall of this story is unusual for me. Usually I don't like &quot;pat&quot; endings, the kind that you can see coming chapters ahead. I saw this one coming and I loved it. I just waited for it because I wanted the best for this very special woman. I'll never look at a kimono the same again either.

Perhaps I was just sad such a good read was over!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"....You only need to read the first sentence of this incredible story.

Honestly, this book confuses me, in that I absolutely adore it - and yet, there are many flawed aspects of it. I say: there are many wonderful things in this book, but a good reader will need to separate them from the not-so-wonderful things. In the end, it has my definite recommendation."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this in 36 hrs, many of which were spent in planes and waiting for planes. Although Spielberg has bought the screen rights for this work, I cannot imagine anyone being able to capture the subtle cultural nuances that we come to understand in the book.

So, I have decided to study cultures and humanities in my future. I hope that I will eventually be able to decrease the amount of culture shock Americans and all other people of the world experience throughout their lifetime. This book shows the life of a working woman in Japan around the 1950s and is unable to stay shut. I recommed it to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book. In fact, I couldn't put it down. I have read some people complain that Sayuri's relationship with Nobu and the Chairman are unrealistic, but I think all of the relationships and actions fit the person who didn't really get a childhood - one who was thrust in adulthood and semi-prositution.Sayuri sparkles in this novel! Arthur Golden has created a masterpiece!!!

The story of a frightened orphan girl from a poor Japanese fishing village who is forced to be a geisha at the Nitta okiya is captivating and enigmatic. It expresses the cold creulty of the world and the people who live in it. A DEFINITE thumbs up!

Very plainly and simply written. Nothing wrong with that, though the language adds no additional interest. Overly sentimental. I think you're supposed to feel sorry for her situation and cheer her toward her precious and distant love - which, of course, she gets in the end. Of course. It's a formulaic romance as far as that goes. But kudos for the research!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Fact and fiction is combined wonderfully in this tale. As a 23yo Aussie who lived in Japan for a year and spent time in the quaint streets of Kyoto attempting to catch a glimpse of a 'true' geisha, this book was wonderful in the way it brought to life, in my own mind, some of the women I had been searching for down my camera lens. From what I have experienced of Japanese culture in the 90's, I found the book to attempt an effective insight into parts of Japanese society as they must have been then. The book helped me to understand how some aspects of society have evolved to what I experienced today. I enjoyed the writers style of expression. However, I felt that there were many moments and emotions that could have been shared in the pages of this book, but weren't. I was suprised by some of the content and learnt one or two new things about Japan and the Japanese, despite going to university there! It is an interesting, 'saucy' (as my grandma would say) in places, read. There is a certain underlying historical importance to this book. I enjoyed it very much and think it is well worth reading. I also wonder what the Japanese themselves will think of this novel when it is printed in their language..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs is possibly one of the best books I have ever read. The story is told in great detail about the life of not just one but several Geisha and how their lives played an important role in the establishment of their communities and the economic stability of their towns. The story is detail oriented and very descriptive and the reading is very smooth. While reading the story I felt that I was side by side with the Geisha serving tea and sake and living their lives with them. Although the story is fiction the facts surrounding them are true and therefore the reader feels as though they are reading an autobiography of a woman sharing very personal and intimate details of her life. Although this book is written from a womans perspective I think it appeals to all sexes and everyone is able to relate to the triumphs and tragedies faced by the Geisha every day. The book is centered around the town of Gion one of the famous Geisha districts of Japan. It tells the story of Sayuri, a Geisha, and her life from the time she was a very young girl until she grows to be an old woman. Memoirs shows how a simple event that happened to Sayuri at a young age changed her life forever and affected every decision she made. Sayuri comes into contact with many other charactors each different in every aspect from the way they look to their mannerisms and actions. However every charactor no matter how horrific or wonderful plays a vital role in the development of Sayuri from a poor child, to a Geisha and finally to a confident woman. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to read something that will open theirs eyes and hearts to the story of a struggling woman wanting no more in life than to be truly happy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Gee, that novel was so informative!&quot; Well, accurate renderings of a foreign culture do not necessarily a classic make.Try Kawabata, Mishima, Tanizaki, Enchi, etc. for real insights and real Japanese literature. &quot;Memoirs&quot; is simply a good story.

I,like many others, had my own &quot;little&quot; ideas about what a Geisha really was and what they really did. But after reading this book, I came away with a totally different opinion and understanding of thier lifestyle. I found it quite sad that most of the young Geishas really didn't have much of a choice in entering this world. That decision, for the most part was made by someone else seeking to gain from the surrending of a young girl into this world. It also amazed me that so much training at such a young age went into the making of a Geisha.

Having been plucked from her humble hometown of Yoroido, protagonist Sayuri is taken to Kyoto, where she suffers several agonizing years as a maid, before eventually becoming a successful Geisha. Sayuri is a courageous heroine, that harbours romantic ideals and great hopes.Author, Arthur Golden, sheds light on Japanese culture, traditions and superstitions, while informing the reader about the Great Depression as it affected Japan. Golden brings this bygone era to life with great insight as well as imagination, and his meticulous research shows, to great effect. Memoirs of a Geisha is vivid to the point of pain, it is sometimes harrowing, but the conclusion is ultimately life-affirming. Sayuri's courage and triumph over her losses is both admirable and inspiring. Arthur Golden's use of descriptive language is beautiful, and is as effective as the storyline itself, in compelling the reader to eagerly turn the page and read on.Memoirs of a Geisha is every bit as good as readers and critics say it is.

I couldn't help but smell the blossoms and see all the nature surround me while reading this book.This book is excellent in many ways. It is truly amasing how a man (the author) can enter a woman's mind that easily. The whole book is stated from a geisha's mind and for me to accept that a male author, an AMERICAN male author, wrote this mind of a female Japanese woman is simply breathtaking.

I found myself being introduced to a foreign culture, and Arthur Golden does an excellent job of relating the reader to the characters. I learned so much about Japanese culture and the life of a geisha. \\"The author's beautiful prose took me back to a time and place of hanging lanterns, and of course, geisha. This book does a good job of showing that geisha are not prostitutes, like so many people think, but are rather dignified entertainers (Sanchez 2003, 1).\\" I agree with this quote. The author definitely has beautiful, and yet simple and easily comprehensible, prose. His detailed writing helps to bring the foreign culture alive for the reader. Also, he does dispel many common misconceptions about geisha, including the thought that they are prostitutes. He shows us the many aspects of a geisha's life. I felt very connected to Sayuri's trials, successes and experiences. The ending, while disappointing, could have been worse. The main disappointment is that the ending came off without a hitch, unlike most of Sayuri's other experiences. I expected some sort of hitch, and I was disappointed that the ending seemed a bit fairy-tale like. It amazes me that a forty-year old American male can put himself into the heart, soul and mind of a young, Japanese female and make her thoughts and emotions seem so real to the reader.

I almost cried. Never has a book unearthed a desire for me to long to know it's characters. This book was a mystical fantasy that danced rain drops of brilliance on my days making them glisten with anticipation.As each page turned I anticipated what would become of Sayuri. I anticipated what her day would weave. I became caught up in the colors of her journeys and the pains of her misfortunes.This book cheated me into believing that there was a Sayuri as it spoke of real life places and World War facts. Golden's writing had me believing, wanting and wishing. His descriptive narration had me spellbound. I want to know Sayuri. The cheat was a good cheat."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am able to give this novel a three because of the author's ability in historical fiction. The descriptions of Japan and the general workings of Geisha were quite enjoyable. The storyline, however, was very predictable and reminiscent of a V.C.

However, I'm a little disappointed that she did not accept Nobu, the man who had waited for her for 15 years. Even though he may not be the &quot;dream guy&quot;, I think she at least owe it to him to repay for all the things he had done for her.But of course, this is a matter of opinion and overall, I think this is a very interesting book as it gives us insight into the daily life of a Geisha, and not just the surface information that everyone know. I always imagine that in order to be a Geisha, all you need to do is to look and act pretty. But I was very wrong. The author did a fine job of telling his readers the different stages a girl has to go through to become a Geisha. It was also interesting to read the difficulty they had to go through in their training, the competition among themselves and on top of it all, they didn't have any choice. Like the book said &quot;You don't learn to become a Geisha, you learn to be a Geisha&quot;.This book also gives me an understanding on the Japanese culture. One reviewer summarize it all ....

It is a remarkably well rounded novel with characters that are EXTREMELY well developed. You come to care about the main people in the novel very much. It delves into pre-world war II Japan and continues on to present day. I absolutely loved the story. Expectations while I read were not left in the void, like some novelists tend to do.

Not only is it gripping (Many a night I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning, even in my second and third readings) not getting sleep because I couldn't put it down.

I don't mind simplicity, but too much of the book is like a predictable fable."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book will not let you put it down.

It is IMPOSSIBLE to put down even from the very beginning. It is the captivating and interesting story of a young girl who is sold to an &quot;okiya&quot; by her father where she learns to become a geisha. This story takes you deep into the very misunderstood and secretive world of the Japanese art of the geisha. Golden seems as if he is the geisha himself, the book is beautifully written and absolutely fascinating. Very, very good. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Beautifully written, facinating and touching; One of the best books I ever read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An absolutly beautiful story looking at not only the pretty painted faces, but the torture as well. So wonderfully written and engrossing. It was the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you enjoy getting lost in a novel, being transported to a different place and time, becoming absorbed in the characters, and eagerly returning to a book you can barely stand to leave, you will love this book. It is far and away one of the best and most enjoyable novels I have ever read.While reading the first part of the book, I thought it was so depressing I might stop reading it. Chiyo's life is overwhelmingly sad, and you wonder if she will ever see any happiness at all. I'm glad I stuck with it, though, because soon I became so absorbed in the story and had come to care so much about Chiyo that I absolutely hated to put the book down.When you read the story, it's hard to believe Golden is not a young Japanese girl. The language he uses is beautiful, spare, and most of all, poetic. Everything he describes is easily imagined because the word pictures are so vivid. And it's incredible to think of the research he had to have done to describe geisha life in such detail.If you are worried about foreign words or ideas and don't want to have to periodically flip to some reference guide in the back - it's not an issue. You don't have to know any Japanese, and Golden doesn't hassle you with footnotes, asterisks, or glossaries. No Cliff's Notes required.The ending was a bit less than fully satisfying, but it is a minor complaint, completely overshadowed by the otherwise page-turning plot, vivid characterization, and beautiful language of the story. I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My husband checked this out of the library for a weekend trip we were taking. I started reading it aloud to him while he was driving and became so intrigued that I had to start reading it too. We both had it finished before we returned home from our trip. We were amazed that a man could write such an intricate tale about a girl turning into a woman with the emotion and depth that Arthur S. Golden was able to portray."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memiors of a Geisha may be one of the best books that I've read in a long time. It is such an epic sweep of events, trailing a girls life from early childhood, through her time as a geisha, and into her old age. All of that done with tons of rich detailing, in only about 400 pages. Wow! I really loved this book.Still, as others have mentioned in their reviews, there are problems. A main problem is that the book is westernized. As I was reading I had to continually remind myself that this book was full of Japanese people. I just could not seem to set a picture of them as Japanese in my mind.Another problem that I had with this book, is that while it is supposed to be representing how all of these women are oppressed by a male dominated culture, it shows only females doing the dominating. While I am quite sure that there were men taking large doles from the geish houses somewhere, the author simply represents the geisha houses as women using other women. It can't be that simple.Some have criticized this book for being overly simple in terms of the main character waiting to be rescued from her life of bondage by her (in my mind, white, I really could not get the Japanese images fixed in my mind) hero male, The Chairman. I find this to be entirely believable, given the time that this book was set in.Which brings me to my final point about this book. All during the reading I felt partly outraged. Wondering, what is her problem? Why does she not take the man, Nobu, who obviously loves her so much? And why does she not understand her stronger position in the okiya after her adoption and start exerting some pressure for better living, like her rival Hatumomo had? Why was the author insisting on taking this book to such a cheap ending in the arms of The Chairman? Why couldn't The Chairman at least have not been married? Why did I like it so much?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha transports you to a different time and magical, foreign place as you read this mesmerizing story of a young girl entering into what is perceived as the exotic world of geishas. However, William Golden pulls back the curtain to reveal all the not-so glamorous goings on in a geisha's life. This story left me enraptured and transfixed. Truly facinating. I was sad to see it end."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am compelled to tell you right up front - this book is a visually evocative, rich and full of magnificent detail, such that you can feel the texture of the silk, almost smell the aroma of tea and sense the tightly ordered society. It was, in that regard simply one of the most transporting experiences a reader can have.From the moment one begins, it is as if you can close your eyes and see the narrow streets, sense her fears and dreams. And then it all goes wrong. Early on, one sees what the protagonist must resolve. We know the issue, and it is in its resolution at the end that I take umbrage.I came along for the ride, and found no satisfaction in the neat little happy circle of the book's ending. For all his work in creating a universe for us to live in, and based on all that had gone on, happy ever after should have been tempered - or at least distanced itself with at least some reality.I enjoyed the book, I loved being ingratiated into its society, and culture. But alas at the end, I wish it closed better than in fact it had.Read it, it's worth it, just take what moments of pleasure it provides. After you've put it down, you shall want something a little more than the denouement. Sip your tea - it will pass."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was brilliant, and beautifully written. I guess the main thing you should realize is that it is fiction, although Golden based some of it on his interviews with Mineko Iwasaki, one of the best-known Geisha of her time. When the book came out she sued him for breach of contract, he had named her when he said he would not and she said he misinterpreted Geisha -that they were not high class prostitutes as she felt they were portrayed in the novel.Whatever the situation, this is a magnificent piece of writing, and highly recommended.Sayuri's mother died when she was a child, and her father sold her into slavery -you get the impression this was done because he knew he would die soon too and wanted to make sure his daughters were looked after. They were sent to the Gion district in Kyoto and Sayuri taken in to an Okiyo (Geisha House) as a maid. Her sister was not so attractive and was sent to be a prostitute in a different district.Sayuri nearly ruined her chances of becoming a Geisha by being rebellious and trying to run away. When she realized that 'outside' there were very few opportunities for her, she decided she wanted to become a Geisha and was taken under the wing by an older 'sister' -a well known Geisha.From this she rose to become one of the most famous Geisha of all time. During this time she entertained many men -but not ina sexual way. The Geisha were entertainers but not prostitutes -they were kept women by a successful man who they would join with in a ceremony -although not marriage.Through all this she is in love with a man who appears to not know she is alive.The descriptions are wonderful, the writing colourful, I really felt I was there.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although the book is fiction, it is so well written and researched that it feels real. The reader is introduced to a young girl aged nine who lives in a fishing village, called Yoroida, on the Sea of Japan. Her mother is ill, it turns out with cancer, and her father is a simple man, a man who works hard to make ends meet and provide a livlihood for his wife and two daughters. They live in a house that is described as \\"tipsy\\" because it sits near a cliff, where the winds blow so hard it make the house appear crooked. The story is told from the perspective of Chiyo, who became a beautiful reknowned Geisha in the city of Kyoto. Early in her training she encounters an important gentleman who gives her his handkerchief during a particularly low period in her initiation. He later plays an important role in her career and life. She remembers his kindness to her throughout her training and even after becoming a full-fledged geisha, she hopes to meet him again. She does meet him during some important functions yet, he indicates no recognition of her. Only after surviving many hardships during World War II and its aftermath, does she dare speak of the past to him and then he reveals many truths to her ... Besides being an autobiography of an important geisha, the book is about survival, the indomitable human spirit. It is about romance and the strong bonds of love which survive despite many changes ... all set within the unique culture of Japan.Not long after her mother dies, Chiyo is visited by Mr. Tanaka, a local fish factory owner. He takes an interest in her well-being and it is to him she owes a debt for having saved her life ... He had been an orphan, who later inherited the fish factory from his adopted parents. He saw a very bleak future for Chiyo and her sister unless someone intervened. He arranged for them to travel to Kyoto and enter training as geisha. Although Chiyo is separated from her sister, she managed to visit her, despite threats of dire consequences if caught during her training. The reader learns, the life style of geisha is not just about flower-arranging, serving tea, playing musical instruments, dancing for a patron or wearing exotic silk kimono outfits. It is about meeting certain expectations to please a sponsor, called a 'danna', who pays all her life style expenses voluntarily. In fact, he is the highest bidder - all for the privilege and honor of paying her expenses, for which certain expectations are his reward. Specific aspects of the geisha lifestyle are kept secret and mysterious. There are strict behavioral and honor codes ... protocols ... expectations ... and monetary gifts.The whole book is a fascinating reading experience which shows the rigorous training, the cultural initiation and induction of a poor fisherman' daughter into one of the most hidden and secretive lifestyles of Japan. The reader learns to appreciate the spectacular and subtle behavior which is expected of a geisha. The behavioral and honor code is very strong ... it plays a unique role in the Japanese society. What is most interesting is how the people who accept this unique cultural role deal with the social, community and national implications of this life. The reader is drawn into recognizing how the role is natural in its particular setting ... Japan. There are many different reflections of feeling and thoughts about the role embedded within the fabric of the society in which it was born. The book is an artistic masterpiece in how the geisha lifestyle in all its myriad of aspects is revealed for the modern reader to understand and explore. This is a most highly recommended book.

I also became interested in it because in a small way, I was part of this whole phenomenon. I was hired as an extra in a scene of the movie adaptation. I started reading this novel and it was apparent from the first few pages how deep the story was going to be. I lived through the eyes of Chiyo who became Sayuri in the process of becoming a geisha in Gion. As I read through the pages, I felt all the emotions and went through all the experiences, mostly painful ones, of a young Chiyo and the turbulant years of the prominent geisha Sayuri. It's amazing how Golden, who is a Caucasian male, can submerge the reader as a Japanese Geisha in a very convincing way. As if Golden himself was Sayuri. Golden in fact puts us in Sayuri's shoes feeling all the emotions, good and bad of her world. When I was reading the last pages of the book, I felt so much sadness for Sayuri that a few tears fell from my eyes. The book covers her whole life, from her childhood life in Yoroido up to the end of her life in New York. The book was written in the manner that Sayuri was telling her life story. The story touched me and has given me the conclusion that our memories and the people we know or have known before have impacted us in some way and the memories of them and our experiences with them will become bitter sweet in our final days. I'm not sure how the movie is, upon writing this review, I have yet to see it. But I do know the book is an excellent read and will also burn in your memory with a bitter sweetness."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"\\"But now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising on an ocean. Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into wash, just like watery ink on paper.\\"And so ends this beautiful story of a woman, a time and a culture.The story begins in a small fishing village where Chiyo lives with her stoic father and dying mother. Unbeknownst to her, her father sells her into slavery to a renowned Kyoto geisha house. There she transforms from the lost little girl with unique grey-blue eyes into the famed geisha, Sayuri. She trains from the age of nine in the arts of dancing, music and conversation for the sole purpose of pleasing men.Based on historical fact and vividly written in the first person, this fictional woman tells of her life in beautiful kimonos at lavish parties with the rich and famous. But she also tells of virginity sold to the highest bidder, rivalry and treachery among geishas--and lost love.This first novel's strength is its ability to take the reader right into the private world of the geisha in 1930s, pre-war Japan. Readers from the West are introduced to this exotic setting where women appear as both pampered slaves and accomplished performers.The author's attention to well-researched detail is richly enhanced by his elegant prose. The current version of this best seller is tied into the upcoming movie based on the book. This is a novel that will translate perfectly onto the screen.Armchair Interviews says: Memoirs of a Geisha will touch you in an intimate way."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden transports you back to the 20's to a time when the Japanese culture revered the women called Geisha. These are the memoirs of on such geisha Nitta Sayuri. These memoirs follow Sayuri from her sad youth were she is ripped away from her fracturing family to her being the proprietor of a tea house in New York in old age.Sayuri, Chiyo in her youth, is adopted as her mother is on her death bed. She is sold to the Nitta Okiya, where she will one day train to be a geisha. Her sister is separated from her and sold into the red-light district on the other side of town. Chiyo must persevere the fracturing of her family, seemingly insurmountable debt to the okiyo, and the evil intentions of a geisha named Hatsumomo. With the help of a kind gesture, Chiyo finds the strength and courage to continue the path of being the geisha Sayuri. With the help of Mameha, Sayuri is able to do so successfully and to rid herself of Hatsumomo.This is a great book that should help break the stereotypes that geisha were prostitutes. Not to say that they did not have sex. This book has enough sexual content that I would not recommend this book for children or teens. It is a great story and ultimately a love story. Golden has Sayuri describe things in such a poetic manner that you cannot help falling in love with her. The reader feels her every disappointment and revels in her every victory. Golden develops the plot in such a way that causes the reader to second guess Sayuri and for her to prove everyone wrong.This is a great novel that I would suggest to any adult. Contains sexual content."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There are many great things I could say about this book, but what amazes me the most about \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is that it's a work of fiction. Arthur Golden does a marvelous job of transporting the reader to 1920s Japan, where a young girl is sold to an okiya and overcomes numerous struggles to become one of the most prestigious geishas in all of Gion. We witness how young Chiyo transforms into Sayuri despite the greedy owners of her okiya and the antics of Hatsumomo, a sadistic geisha who does everything in her power to prevent Sayuri's success. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is also a love story of sorts: Chiyo's chance meeting with the Chairman when she is a young girl is an event that shapes her destiny. However, as Mameha says in the novel, women become geishas because they have no choice, and they are forced to make massive sacrifices because of it.I absolutely loved this book. Parts of the story are heartbreaking, but Golden throws some great humorous bits into the mix for the reader's enjoyment. This is a novel that I couldn't put down: I stayed up until after 3 a.m. because I HAD to finish it before going to bed! Everyone should make sure to read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" before the much anticipated film adaptation is released this winter...I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel gives an in-depth view of Japan through the eyes of a true Cinderella. Sayuri's saga gave me a new understanding of the ways and customs of traditional Japanese culture prior to, during, and after WWII, starting with her small village and following her to one of the grandest cities of her time. This true story left me with a sense of peace, that though the storm may rage fiercely and thunder against you, someday, the winds will calm, the clouds will part, and life will once again continue in the sunshine.This narrative is given in first-person, so the reader can truly identify with Sayuri and put themselves in her shoes... or laquered zori, I suppose. The way in which she speaks has a certain poetic quality, and it made me enjoy it more. She tells the story in a way that allows even a reader without any education on the Japanese culture to understand.This is certainly a good book for those with an interest in Japanese history and customs, or anybody who believes in Cinderella stories. Thisis not your typical \\"girl growing up\\" book; it is the story of how a girl struggled against herself to become a reknowned geisha, from the most humble of beginings."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished reading this book and I still don't know exactly what to think about it. Granted the story was very captivating and the narration and descriptions certainly did feel as if I was being transported to the Japan of the 30s and 40s (although I never have been there so then again..... ) but I'm not sure I truly feel this book gives a real impression of who and what geisha really are.A good friend of mine (who is japanese) told me that no one in Japan can really give a proper definition of geisha (they seem to be too misterious even within Japan)... so how can we expect an american do an adecuate job at doing it ?As for the story, I can't seem to see why everyone says that this book is depressing... it seemed to me that Sayuri always had the best of things happen to her simply beacause she was beautiful... and she herself concludes that being sold off to become a geisha was the best thing that could have happened to her (\\"the day I met Mr. Takana was the worst and the best day of my life\\"...)In all... I enjoyed the book but I wouldn't make such a big deal about it... as for the movie... well... not getting my hopes too high either... the actress that plays Sayuri is....chinese!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was wonderful. I usually read murder mysteries so this was a change of pace for me. I don't know what intrigued me to the book but I bought it. It was beautifully written with alot of emotion and description. The book had my attention from the very first page. You feel like the main character is sitting down with you and telling you the story herself. Once I started reading I could not put it down, I had to know what happened next. I would recommend this book to anyone. Like I said this not my normal genre but I am really glad that I read this."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In Memoirs of a Geisha, Sayuri explains life by saying \\"We lead our lives like water flowing down a hill, going more or less in one direction until we splash into something that forces us to find a new course.\\" Throughout the novel author Arthur Golden leads us through all the obstacles that force Sayuri down the courses of her life. He weaves together beautiful description, detailed expression of Geisha culture, strong character development, and a love story to create a tale that is an absolute delight to read.Golden gained interest and knowledge in Japanese culture that helped him create his rich story. At Harvard he earned a degree in art history with a specialization in Japanese art. Soon afterwards he got his M.A. in Japanese history, which he used when he spent a summer at Beijing University and worked in Tokyo. During his time in Japan, he interviewed Mineka Iwasaki, a former geisha who offered him extensive insight into the mysterious culture. All of his experiences led to a riveting read.As the novel opens, Sayuri begins the story of her life, beginning with her childhood when her name was Chiyo. In one of the most poignant scenes of the novel, Chiyo realizes that her father has sold her and her sister to the Geisha culture. The two girls are quickly separated; Chiyo arrives at a Geisha house while her sister begin a life of prostitution. From this point, the story begins to delve into the mysterious, captivating world of a Geisha. Golden is a master of imagery, vividly describing everything from kimono threads to tea houses to Geisha makeup. Chiyo trains as a geisha, but her progress is interrupted by foiled escape attempts and the cruel and haughty yet breathtakingly beautiful Hatsumomo, a geisha in the same house in which Chiyo lives. When it seems all hope is lost and Chiyo is crying on the street, a kind man named the Chairman gives her the kindness she longs for. Their chance meeting acts as a catalyst for the rest of the novel; from that moment on, Chiyo is determined to become a geisha for the sole purpose of meeting the Chairman.With the help of the wise, caring Mameha and a fierce dedication to her advancement, Chiyo, whose name changes to Sayuri, becomes one of the most celebrated geisha of the time. Golden's intricate language describes beautiful dances, busy tea houses, and lavish parties. He also includes one of the most disturbing elements of geisha life, the mizuage, in which Chiyo's virginity is auctioned.Sayuri faces many obstacles; Hatsumomo is determined to ruin her career, Mameha tells her that love is not meant for a geisha, and the war keeps her from her life for years. Despite all her difficulties, Sayuri reconnects with the Chairman in a satisfying culmination of a long romance. Golden sums up Sayuri's difficult life with, \\"Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into a wash, just like watery ink on paper.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha offers unique view on a mysterious, often misunderstood world. The aspect that most surprised me was the realization that geisha are not prostitutes, they are finely trained artists that live an interesting, often disappointing life. By using beautiful descriptions, illustrating fascinating information about the geisha life, and developing captivating characters, Golden leads readers through a beautiful rags-to-riches tale that will definitely leave you happily satisfied."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I didn't want to read this book. In one way, I was like the American women Sayuri describes meeting at parties: Geisha, huh? [Unspoken: Ick, a prostitute]. I also imagined it would contain frustrating cliches about male-female dynamics and \\"those exotic Japanese.\\"But I ended up on a bus with the book after trying to return it unread to the friend who insisted I borrow it. I was hooked by the fourth page, when the narrator's clumsy sister cuts herself with a fish. Throughout the book, there's a subtle hilarity to the writing, often connected to fishing, strangely. When Sayuri's childhood friend Pumpkin describes a talking fish, despite the skeptical jibes of her companions, I felt I knew exactly what kind of woman she was, and I became quite fond of her. In fact, all of the (mostly) \\"good\\" characters in the book feel like real, likeable people.My main criticism of the book, however, is that most of the \\"bad\\" characters seem impossibly evil, in a Disney-stepmother sort of way. Additionally, the ending reminded me, in its patness, of the two or three Harlequin romances I read as a teenager. Last and least, the author gilds the Japanese-culture lily a bit. I first wrinkled my nose when geisha were watching a sumo match. Perhaps they did. But did he really have to work \\"A Tale of Genji\\" into the book?Overall, though, I'm really happy at having read this book, as it paints a fascinating picture of the challenges faced by poor Japanese girls and women in the middle of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't read much fiction these days, sticking mostly to history and nonfiction, but I made an exception for this novel since I am a student and teacher of a couple of Japanese martial arts, and I'd absorbed some small knowledge about things like geishas during my studies. And I'd heard about how good the novel was.I wasn't disappointed. I found Golden's book about a geisha during the 1930s, when the geisha tradition and culture was already dying, to be an accurate, detailed, and well written story about the life of what could have been a typical geisha. For me it's reminiscent of Yasunari Kawabata's famous novel, Snow Country, a bittersweet story about a love affair between a wealthy Tokyo playboy and a provincial geisha in a remote mountain town. Kawabata won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1968. The bittersweet quality derives from the fact that the geisha knows that although by most standards she is still young, she is past her prime and is one of the last of a dying breed.Like Kawabata's novel, Golden's novel sensitively and realistically portrays the world of the geisha during a time when it was already waning. Golden shows that, contrary to western stereotypes of geishas as ordinary prostitutes, they were highly cultured and educated, trained in music, poetry and the arts, and more than able to hold their own and intelligently converse on many subjects with their often wealthy and powerful clients.I understand this is Golden's first book. It's a fine debut by a new author and I hope it won't be his last. It will be interesting to see what he does next after such a spectacular debut.By the way, an interesting little side note here. I've studied a little Japanese, and Japanese is replete with epithets, slang, and various and sundry derogatory words relating to people's mental, moral, and physical shortcomings. One funny aspect of this is how reptiles and especially turtles come in for a lot of abuse. Calling someone a turtle, for example, means you're saying they're slow or unintelligent. And if you call someone a \\"deb game,\\" it translates literally as \\"a turtle with buckteeth.\\" But the actual meaning is a \\"peeping tom.\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Oh my!

The writing is average to above average, but was a little weak on character development (i.e. didn't get into what made the characters tick or why they were the way they were, but it was done in 1st person, so that may have been more difficult.) I really enjoyed reading it, but the ending was so Hollywood formulmatic that it made me so angry that I threw it in the trash! I can't really get into the reasons why without giving the ending away just that the book is essentially a romance, and the author is obviously a man who has no clue on what real women think or feel or are. He wrote the ending like he was trying to please women, on what women would like to see happen, but it was just the opposite for me. I gave it 3 stars for 90% of the rest of the book which was interesting because of all the information and history of Japan and the geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I think this is a wonderful book!

All of the steps that are involved in just becoming a geisha are extraordinary! although it had a slow atart, stay with it because it becomes the best novel, in my opinion, that i have ever read. The book allows for the reader to imagine the way all of the kimono looked and how the geisha looked when they were done and ready.

Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in world cultures or just anyone looking to add a few wrinkles to his brain."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I expected to be enthralled. But if you strip away all the cultural details and an occasionally lovely description, this becomes a book about a basically simple-minded woman who spends a lot of time talking about clothes, hair, makeup, and boys. I find it hard to believe that a real geisha, who is trained as an artist and conversationalist, would be this banal. The other characters were also nothing more than skin-deep depictions. Since the book was set in this century, the author had an opportunity to explore any number of interesting juxtapositions: the impact that modern Western culture and technology had on Japan, the way the Japanese were emotionally affected by WWII, ANYTHING that would have caused this book to operate on more than the most superficial level. The book screams &quot;made-for-TV-movie.&quot;"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In the beginning I was mesmerized by the haunting metaphors and sad tale and couldn't wait to find out where Golden was taking the reader. By the middle I was getting anxious to finish this book that operated on a carrot/stick tactic. By the end I found the book very disturbing and misogynist. Basically it's about a 45 year pedophile who convinces another geisha to turn a 12 year girl into a geisha so that he eventually can &quot;win her over.&quot; In the meantime, another 50+ year old man pays thousands of yen to be the first one to have sex with a minor. And all along our heroine,Sayuri, is in love with a man old enough to be her grandfather. Sayuri believes this man did her a great favor since he is the reason she is what she is: a geisha. I understand that this was part of the Japanese culture, but families selling their daughters so they can become glorified prostitutes, and older rich men willing to out-bid each other for an opportunity to have sex with a minor is creepy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs&quot; is one of the most enjoyable and intelligent books I've read in some time. It is rare to find a novel which is a joy to follow, a page turning addiction and an education all in one. This is one of them. I've always been interested in Eastern cultures, and here I find one of the seemingly best researched books on a geisha. Not only does Golden's work clear up some misconceptions and stereotypes, but it provides an abundance of information about the life of a geisha. It's fiction, but reads much like an autobiography. Even in the earliest chapters, we can hear Sayuri telling us her story, and we try to cheer her and steer her through the trials and tribulations of her young life. The reader in me was quite fulfilled through a majority of the book. The characters, with the exception of the Chairman, are very well developed, and each possesses a strong personality. This book, aside from the story itself, taught me a lesson: that sometimes the way we want a book to end is not necessarily the best ending. Those of you who have finished it may agree. I was hoping for this particular ending from very early on, but for some reason, I think now that I've read it, it might have been a stronger finish had it taken another twist. That aside, this is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling read, which I've already recommended to three of my closest reader friends."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As I read Golden's very detailed descriptions of Kyoto I felt like I was transformed back to Kansai where I lived for some time. However, as much cultural and linguistic knowledge I had of Japan, I was like most Westerners in thinking that geisha were nothing more than high-class ladies of the night. Golden's novel and careful research completely dispels this image. His description of Sayuri and her life immediately drew me into the character and I felt that I completely understood her life and hardships in her quest to be come a geisha. The technical descriptions of kimono, mizuage, hairstyles, and the day-to-day life in the okiya are very accurate (as confirmed by my Japanese roomates).Golden's only fallacy in his novel is the convenient &quot;storybook&quot; ending. For an atypical book, an ending which illustrated how much Sayuri had grown in character and fortitude would have been more powerful. Golden's novel is unique in that not many books have been written about geisha and their private world. More importantly, an American male undertook the task of writing this remarkable story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"\\"Memoirs\\" perpetrates an inexcusable fraud on the reader: it makes non Japanese readers think it is Japanese. Golden researched his book by gathering anecdotes and compiling them into a very Western story disguised as something Japanese. Most Americans trust his accuracy because they don't know better. I've lived in Japan 20 years, speak Japanese and enjoy Japanese literature. If one wishes to know about geisha, one should read English translations of Nagai Kafu stories, not pulp fiction from an opportunist who knows next to nothing about Japanese sensibilities. Golden's greatest crime, as he dares to pass himself off as an authority on Japan, is found in his completely ignoring the element of Japanese literature most central to the culture: a constant sensitivity to the seasons and their beauty. No Japanese, and especially not a geisha, would describe her kimono without reference to the relevance to seasons. Real Japanese literature is laced with seasonal references, both the conventional and the novel. Yet Golden makes almost no such references. The most striking example of this: he has a geisha practicing flower arranging (\`ikebana') using dogwood, in autumn (the season - in typical Golden style - is not mentioned but can be deduced from context, as it follows a reference to a fall month). The tree was unknown in Kyoto at the time of the story. It was introduced by America as gift to Japan in return for the sakura (cherry blossom) trees given to America by the Japanese. Even today, its blooms are not used in ikebana, but if they were, that would occur in May, when the tree blossoms, not in autumn! Three are other crimes: most of the so-called witty old Japanese sayings are Golden's own; and - most seriously - the characters are Americans in kimonos, they are certainly not Japanese. If you must read this book, please do not imagine that you are experiencing anything Japanese."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Just thought that readers will find it interesting to see what a JAPANESE person thinks about the authenticity of this book. Who would have thought? All those reviewers on the back of this book are caucasian. Not one is Japanese. Oh, yes, and the JAPANESE person with her opinion below is the woman that this book is written about. If YOU REALLY want to find out about the world of the GEISHA from a GEISHA, why don't you read her book? \\"Geish, A LIFE\\" by Mineko Iwasaki.In Mainichi Daily NewsBy Keisuke HiranoMainichi Shimbun\\"Ex-geisha takes objection to \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" \\"November 30, 2001\\"Geishas are professionals who make a living by using their artistic skills, but many people have a mistaken image of the world of mystery and shadows,\\" says Mineko Iwasaki.

In the book, Iwasaki writes without reservations about the personal relationships and complex give-and-take that go on between the women behind the ornate scenery of the \\"flower and willow world.\\" She also writes about the pride these women take in their artistic skills."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha, a novel by Arthur Golden is a captivating look into the mysterious and often misunderstood world of the geisha. Through his eloquent narrative and vibrant characters, Golden is able to paint a picture of the multifaceted life of geisha, while at the same time giving an accurate historical depiction of geisha culture.Golden's story showcases the life of a young Japanese girl that is sold into slavery during the Great Depression. At the age of nine, she is taken to Gion, which is the geisha district of Kyoto, and sold to a wealthy geisha house. Sayuri starts her life in Gion as servant in the Nitta Okiya where she is habitually tormented and abused by the powerful senior geisha, Hatsumomo. Just when Sayuri thinks that her life is hopeless, she is befriended by a beautiful geisha named Mamaha, who teaches her the art and tradition of geisha life. We watch as Sayuri grows into a successful geisha and encounters many trials and tribulations.Not only does Golden give a mesmerizing account of geisha life, but also offers the reader a picturesque view into the beautiful scenery and traditions of Japan. Vivid descriptions are given of people, places, and events as to enhance the story's richness. Down to the last detail, Sayuri is able to describe these things in a way that makes you want to know more and more. In a description of her traditional geisha dress she says, \\"Now I had to walk all around Gion in the shoes we call okobo. They're quite tall and made of wood, with lovely, lacquered thongs to hold the foot in place. Most people think it very elegant the way they taper down like a wedge, so that the footprint at the bottom is about half the size of the top. But I found it hard to walk delicately in them. I felt as if I had roof tiles strapped to the bottom of my feet.\\"But perhaps the most interesting part of Golden's novel is the comparison of attitudes toward geisha in Eastern and Western culture. Eastern thought regards geisha as well respected and beautiful, while western thought seems to view geisha as the equivalent of the American prostitute. By challenging this way of thinking, I believe that Golden successfully able to crush any stereotypical beliefs the reader may have had before reading this novel.Through Sayuri's life, Arthur Golden offers the reader the opportunity to truly appreciate and respect the life of a geisha. This is a gripping coming of age tale of a geisha that will completely absorb the reader."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really liked this book for many reasons. First of all, for it's historic content. It is clear that the author did proper research and based the details of the life of the Geisha on fact. It was a good story and a fluent read, well written without rambling prose and irrelevant descriptions, which is so common with novels these days. However, Golden did manage a very delicate way to describe events and things that held one's attention. I loved reading about the artistry of the Geishas, not just their role as prostitutes. The only reason I was tempted to give four stars is because the end was weak. Sure we all like happy endings, but the way Sayuri was set up in New York by the Chairman (hope I'm not ruining it for you), is a bit of a fairytale ending, but then, this is fiction. In all fairness, I do give five stars because of the way it was so eloqently written. It must be hard to know where to go with such a story. Would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I find it facinating that so many reviewers are calling a novel written by a Caucasian-American man a JAPANESE novel, just because of its setting. It is NOT a Japanese novel, it is an American novel with Japanese themes which could have been written much better than it was. I have also studied Japanese culture for years and I find the depictions of geisha very Hollywood-ized. He is just re-hashing stereotypes prevalent in Japan-themed books and movies of the 60s, 70s and 80s. He just writes as though all of his characters exist in a vacuum. I would have really liked to know why Hatsumomo was such a difficult woman or what caused Mother and Grandmother to be so bitter. The lack of explanation clearly shows his ability to write . . . or maybe he just got tired. I wonder why the author gave Sayuri gray eyes. It seemed as though he was trying to give this character western features so western readers could relate to her. Also, I am aware that many western feminists are discouraged by the portrayals of women in this book, they, too, must understand feminism simply does not exist in the same context as it does here in Japan. The author fails to convey the Japanese feminist elements of geisha--they are not as dependent upon men as this book leads you to believe. Please read books by Japanese authors on the same subject matter. They are more knowledgeable than a rich Caucasian man with a degree from an Ivy League university getting his &quot;facts&quot; second hand."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Only a miracle of marketing hype could have produced such rave reviews for so shallow a book. Yes, Golden appears to have done his research on the geisha lifestyle, which is (I suspect) the only reason it was published in the first place. Beyond that, it's basically a male fantasy about a young girl who can't get a man out of her head--and why? Because he once bought her an ice cream! Sayuri has all the depth of a PBS documentary narrator, and the men--particularly the Chairman, for whom Sayuri is supposedly pining throughout the book--are one-dimensional bores. Golden studied creative writing at Boston University, which seems to be at the forefront of the cookie-cutter, take-no-risks school of writing these days. (And a man writing as a woman is hardly a risk when done so poorly.) Occasionally one sees glimpses of genuine promise in this book when he just forgets the pretense and lets himself write, but this reads as if he has a stern workshop teacher looking over his shoulder, about to criticize him if he actually risks anything. A disappointment, to say the least."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although there is no real plot, I found myself immediately drawn into the story each time I picked up the book to continue reading. It was SO INTERESTING. At times I was bothered by what I felt were two-dimensional characters, however, that flatness evoked a sense of Sayuri's futile existence. She was like a leaf that had been tossed into a stream and carried away (there's that water sign).One of the great bonuses of reading a book of this type is that is provokes my interest to learn more by reading and researching a new topic."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I kept wishing through out the book that it was longer.I just didn't want it to end.

Tone reminded me of Shogun"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; by Arthur Golden was a book of extreme talent. It was THE MOST INTERESTING BOOK I HAVE READ. I have read allot of books but this book somehow surpasses allot of the others. It was a book that told a cultural tale, a true story and a dying legend. It signified the struggle we all make in our lives to read our destiny and still while we are trying to find our destiny we still never know if and when we'll reach it. I thought this book was extremely well done. It thought me something that I never knew before about the life of a Geisha and how similiar it could be to so many of our lives. Not the fact of being a Geisha, but the fact of struggling to become the best at what you do. It's also a tale of romance and somehow the irony in this book is so overwhelming, it just made the book allot more interesting. We never expect in our lives that the people we think we can trust would actually turn against us; just like Pumpkin, Mr. Tanaka and the Chairman, in some unual way did to Nitta Sauyri. She was a brilliant person and that's reason Arthur Godlen said that she had so much water in her personality it is because she never let a problem throw her; she was always the one to conquer her destiny and never let things conquer her . She carried everything by, she was a brilliant woman whose elegance,intelligence and wit was never surpassed and so frequently despised. She conquered Hatsumomo who was a brilliant character of evil and in some ways she never realized that she could hurt her best friend Pumpkin so badly they never made up. This novel is also sad because she never saw her sister again; she never said goodbye to her parents but I think she got over that because her parents sold her, they did that to her. They never said goodbye to her; they never told her where she was headed and what path to take in life. All this hate probably got to her , but in the end a smart person never lets themselves down because they know how and when to strike, they know how to bear their defeat, they know how to aspire to be better, they know what they want in life and how to get it and this is what Nitta Sayuri did. I read this entire book in 5 days I could of read it in quite less but I wanted to savor the life of someone so interesting that I regret it's over. I am very pleaed to know that a movie is coming out about it directed by Steven Speilberg. This is a great work, especially the way Arthur Golden disguised his voice to become such and old woman, he is an intelligent man with great ideas. thanks Shawn Hayden Ramsingh"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs Of a Geisha was a thoroughly delicious taste of the life of a geisha as well as that of the individual soul of Sayuri from her early training to her long term love of a person she met for only a moment who , in turn , changed the force propelling her life. Similar to the recognition of ones own desires and dreams and their fulfillment brought to mind the similar discovery contained in Bryce Courtney's &quot;The Power of One&quot;. Both novels share the maturation of the story teller through the association of both friends and rivals as the search for love and sense of self propel the characters in everyday life including education, physical growth, and spiritual growth.

I felt like I could see everything about culture that Sayuri was part of. The images of the tea houses, the town, the people were so clear and distinct. I will agree with other readers, that the book did fizzle out after the war ended. It was terribly anti-climactic, I almost felt like at 400 pages, the author was just tired of writing. However, the book did open my eyes to the Geisha culture, and the training the girls went through at an early age. I also thought it was incredible that this touching, delicate story about these strong women was written by a man. He reallytapped into the feelings a woman might feel, he really got deep into the soul of Sayuri, and wrote with such feminity that I am still astonished.

Unfortunately, being orphaned and poor but possessing an astonishing beauty, she had the geisha lifestyle thrust upon her. The true tragedy of the entire is that in the patriarchial Japanese society, an intelligent, talented woman cannot amount to more. Indeed the most disturbing part was that the main character never seems to even want more or something different. (Part of the fatalism and stocism that characterizes Asian thinking?) I don't think being a legitimate Japanese wife is any better, it doesn't seem to me that they get treated any better either. Anyone want to tell me different?The roles and views of Asian women have got to change. We are not fantasy figures or play-things to bolster the egos of weak-minded men. But it has to start with the women themselves. They need to arm themselves with higher education and earn their economic independence and demand respect from their family and society.The value in stories like this is not so much that it 'takes us away to a magical land' but that it reminds us of a time that (hopefully) is past and should be kept in the past. As beautiful and haunting as the novel is, who really wants all that back?Your life's journey should be determined by you, not others."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha works on some levels more than others; the narrator's climb into fame is chronicled with empathy, and the tale is peppered with interesting details of the time. However, when I finished it, I was left with a feeling of something being incomplete. I felt that the author was cramming the story of the geisha into the confines of a conventional western romance novel. The ending was more like Austen than, say, Tanazaki. There's nothing wrong with Austen at all, but I wasn't exactly expecting _Sense and Sensibility_-esque touches in this particular novel. Also the author's prose didn't have the sparseness that I perhaps expected. Also, the author whisked away the darker side of the geisha world with too much ease, especially with the obsessions of beauty and cruelty. This is a good bedside read but I think it's a little thin for a book discussion group (which is where I encountered it)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha, by Arthur GoldenMemoirs of a Geisha, By Arthur Golden, is a wonderful novel detailing the accounts of a young girl who begins her life as a peasant and then matures to one of the most renowned geisha in Japan. This descriptive piece gives the reader insight about what life was like not only for a maturing geisha but also for the ordinary people of Japan during times of the Great Depression and World War II, allowing a clear picture of what is happening. One becomes drawn into the story and fascinated by every element of the plot from the start, beginning with young Chiyp's tiny home town of Yoroido. Chiyo is a girl who is intelligent and pretty, but often lets her impulsive ideas keep her from seeing things clearly. As a young girl, her mother becomes seriously ill and Chiyo and her older sister are sent away to Kyoto and separated. Soon Chiyo begins her new life as a maid in her new home, an okiya, not knowing what has or will become of herself and the rest of her family. From here she experiences many ups and downs in life before beginning her apprenticeship as a geisha, sometimes letting her hopes and vivid imagination get in the way of her career. Hatsumomo, a prominent geisha supporting her okiya, fears Chiyo's unique beauty will make her more popular, and does everything in her will to set back Chiyo's career as a geisha. Before long, Chiyo is driven to run away from Hatsumomo and her new life, but gets caught. Eventually, with the help of Mameha, Hatsumomo's rival, Chiyo is able to rise as one of the most prestigious geisha in Japan. Golden's education proves that he knows about Japanese culture. He earned an M.A. in Japanese history and learned Mandarin Chinese at Columbia University and a degree specializing in Japanese art at Harvard, as well as an M.A. in English from Boston University. After also spending a summer at Beijing University, Golden also interviewed Mineko Iwasaki, a popular geisha in the 60's, in order to learn more about the daily life of a geisha. This novel shows that he has mastered much of the Japanese culture and displays his talent for writing. Overall, Memoirs of a Geisha is a thoroughly enjoyable book from start to finish that anyone can enjoy.-reviewed by Minnette B."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just couldn't put it down.

Thank god! it didn't take long to be translated into Turkish. I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Ever since my childhood, I have been very interested in the Japanese culture. This book promised to give me a peek into the secret lifestyles of one particular group: the geisha.Plot:Chiyo and her sister, Satsu, are sold just before the death of their mother. Chiyo is sold to the Nitta okiya household in Gion; Satsu to a prostitute home. Chiyo is raised to become geisha but is thwarted by Hatsumomo, the primary geisha in the okiya and a successful geisha in Gion. Chiyo's prospects of becoming geisha are ruined after an attempt to run away; her grief is further compounded when she learns that both her parents are dead and her sister ran off with a young man from her village. In the midst of her despair, she finds hope when a man known as the \\"Chairman\\" shows her kindness and gives her a handkerchief. Chiyo determines from that point on to become geisha to attract his attention.With the help of Mameha, one of the most popular geisha in Gion, Chiyo wins her freedom from debt, liberates herself from Hatsumomo's tyrannical reign, and becomes a successful, popular geisha named Sayuri.Good:I enjoyed reading about the traditions, garments, etc. pertaining to the geisha lifestyle (although I am almost positive that it has been \\"Hollywood-ized\\"). I enjoyed the competition between Mameha and Hatsumomo. Some of my favorite characters include Mameha, Nobu, and Hatsumomo. I also did not mind Chiyo/Sayuri's infatuation with an older man (she does like most young girls--myself included--and mistakes admiration for the Chairman's good character for romantic love); however, I do have reservations about the direction of the relationship (explained later). Lastly, I felt Golden did a satisfactory job writing from the perspective of a young woman. I was about 100+ pages into the story when I remembered with more than a little amazement that the author was a man.Bad:There are two reasons people spend hours upon hours over a computer or a notebook: education or entertainment. This book wallows in both and ends up accomplishing neither.First: education. The book purports that geisha are not prostitutes but fails to establish this. A majority of the book (near 200 pages) is spent on mizuage, the convention of auctioning off a girl's virginity. Mameha sleeps repetitively with her danna, the Baron. Several times, it is said that a \\"one night stand\\" is not acceptable; however, in the next breath, it is revealed that an arranged period of time with a danna involving sexual relations is acceptable (what, might I ask is the difference between a one-night prostitute and a paid mistress? Both are paid to sleep with their clients!). Lastly, Sayuri sleeps with her danna twice a week. If the sexual relations were those of passion, I might understand the situations, but this is not the case. Geisha were not prostitutes; I read somewhere that they were not allowed to sleep with men under any circumstances!Given this, perhaps the education the author intended was to elaborate on the objectification of women. In this case, the novel fairs better (although it does not provide a satisfactory outcome for the plight of women, merely a glimpse into what they are forced to put up with). After reading this, I feel sorry for women everywhere: geisha, actresses, models, singers, etc. whose entire lives are built on nothing more than their physical appearance. The geisha in this book cannot even choose to keep the children that their sexual relations produce (Mameha has had three abortions)!Second: entertainment. Authors sometimes write books to entertain, but I doubt this is why Golden wrote this book. Memoirs of a Geisha is simply not a book that will entertain you. Much of it is very depressing with few bright points. Books about heavy subjects such as those presented in Memoirs of a Geisha are not the type people will open up on a lazy evening or while reclining at the beach (at least, I'm not inclined to do so). They will read it for the prior reason (which, as I said above, is not very accurate or compelling).There are a few other areas that disturb me as a reader:1. It is frequently mentioned that Chiyo/Sayuri is clever; however, not much of what she does is clever. Most of her planning (including her scheme towards the end of the nvoel) falls flat. (In fact, throughout the novel, she really doesn't do a whole lot of doing which leads me to the next point.)2. Much of what happens to Chiyo/Sayuri is everyone acting on her, not her doing a whole lot of anything. While I can understand some outside intervention, I got frustrated for her for not actively participating in her own life more (for instance, Nobu has to come to her hideaway in order to tell her to contact Mother to be allowed back in Gion three years after the geisha districts have been reopened. If I were Sayuri and truly longing to be a geisha again as she says she is, I would have waiting a short time and written Mother about it.).3. There is inconsistency with the pacing of the novel. The first 150 pages concern Chiyo's childhood, primarily when she is about 10 years old. The next 250 pages concern from when Chiyo/Sayuri is 12 to when she is 18, mostly concentrating on when she is 14 - 15 (and her mizuage). The last 100 pages elaborate from when she is 18 to the end of her life concentrating mostly on age 30. How can a woman remember so clearly the time she lost her virginity and things from her youth and not closer to the end of her life? I can understand her remembering her final moments in her hometown, Yoroido, and other firsts in her life (first time in a hair dresser, etc.) but other things she remembers (e.g. elaborate details about kimono) are just plain odd. And why the silence on the war? Five years and all of it is summed up in about twenty pages? The book reads less like a true memoir (which has no overreaching aim and should be a concoction of unrelated or random events in life) and more like a fictional novel which is written with a purpose, the purpose being to elaborate on the young geisha's sex life and her romance with the Chairman.4. Golden makes a serious mistake: he mistakes metaphors and similes for imagery. Sometimes as often as twice in one paragraph, he will use metaphors like \\"Trying to survive in an okiya with Hatsumomo is like a pig trying to survive in a slaughterhouse\\" or \\"[they] weren't \`spending time together' any more than a squirrel is spending time with the insects that live in the same tree\\" or \\"I felt like a slab of tuna the grocer had just delivered\\". A little of this goes a long way.5. It would be nice to see more about Hatsumomo and what makes her tick. As it stands, she is just a wicked woman who doesn't want Chiyo to reduce her popularity. What happened to Hatsumomo that made her so mean and so cruel? Why was she so mean to such a young girl with nothing more than promise on her side?6. Pumpkin and Chiyo's friendship is flat. I had a hard time believing that they were actual friends. A few mentions of them talking with each other while practicing shamisen and suddenly they are Anne and Diana from Anne of Green Gables.7. Halfway through the book, Golden makes me think that Sayuri likes Nobu. However, we quickly find out she does not and is still harping on a man whose affections she should have grown out of years ago (come on! She's thirty for pete's sake!). I feel that the chemistry between Sayuri and the Chairman died many years earlier (or never existed in the way Golden suggests). And the end is so corny, so fairy-tale-ish and not at all what one expects from a memoir (life rarely comes out with \\"happily ever-after\\"s. In my opinion, Sayuri should have been infatuated with the Chairman but learns he has no feelings for her. Then, her true feelings emerge and she realizes that she has always loved Nobu.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Maybe a few d**n's, he**'s. Sexual situations range from the analogy of an eel in a cave to the description (albeit vague) of a girl's mizuage to what some might perceive as an almost-rape. All of this is a little creepy when a reader realizes that the female partner is not even 18. Hatsumomo invites a man into the maid's room and is caught after one of these encounters. Sayuri sleeps with several men as do many other geisha. Violence consists mostly of slapping and hitting.Overall:I watched the movie, so I had an idea of what I was getting myself into before I started reading. I knew this wouldn't be a light-hearted book, but I didn't realize there was so little levity (often, the movie omits items that are in the book). Besides the heavy subject matter, the character of Chiyo/Sayuri was rather dull and inactive, the pacing inconsistent, the imagery clunky and annoying (do Japanese really use this many weird metaphors and similes?), and the emphasis indeterminable. If you have the time to waste and want to read a Hollywood-ized version of the life of a geisha, this is your book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was actually quite into this book when I first started reading it. The writing is enthralling, the protagonist smart and pretty and all that. Most of all, it appears to be educational and of a higher standard than most mainstream novels. However, about 1/3 of the way into the novel, as chiyo becomes sayuri and wildly successful (as we knew she would be), the storyline became a lot shallower and hollow points in the storyline really stick out. The turning point was when chiyo-sayuri says \\"I became good at dancing because of all the practise I did at home, when the evil Hatsumomo wouldn't let me go out. It was tought, but I won in the end, so in your face, oppressive society!!\\" or some such rubbish, that the nagging feeling of this-is-quickly-developing-into-a-bad-book exploded into a horrific flashback of Chinese Cinderella and The Joy Luck Club. At once, I began to see chiyo-sayuri as the typical biographical unrealistic matyr type of narrator, of whom I've always held a scathing dislike for.Also, the supporting characters were rather 2-dimensional, lacking any real depth. Perhaps the most interesting character, her arch nemesis Hatsumomo (and as if no one saw her come-uppance coming from a mile away) could have been explored in more depth, rather than the classic jealous-stepmother type. I almost expected her to start rambling to a mirror and poisoning apples by the end of it.Her treatment of the aesthetically-ravaged, one-armed Nobu also decreased my opinion of chiyo/sayuri. Her unfathomable obsession with the Chairman was unidentifiable, and though told repeatedly that she's smart, her actions and words serve to contradict this many times. Myself, I had her pegged as dull, stupid and overly-passive. She makes no attempt to rebel, aside from the disastrous running-away-though-i-should-tell-you-now-it-will-end-badly attempt. The \\"asian girl with blue eyes that marks her as special\\" thing was an extremely weak fall-back plot for the author to rely on.Golden reduces the geisha to pretty clothes and makeup, and while I'm sure he meant to enlighten the reader of the subtle intricacies and dangerous power plays that were part of the geishas day-to-day lives, I was disappointed with how their existences ultimately came across as small and empty and essentially meaningless. For some reason, the fact that the author was not in fact female as I'd assumed, and that the story was completely fictional didn't sit right with me.All in all, Memoirs of a Geisha turned out to be ordinary and overly marketed; though rabid fans of the Da Vinci Code can rejoice, having found another mainstream novel, full of interesting facts to leech off then spout out to anyone willing to listen, in an attempt to appear knowledgeable."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I listened to this as an unabridged audiobook so my comments are specific to that.Over the years I had always meant to read Memoirs of a Geisha and have had the paperback laying around on my shelves for some time. I'd picked it up a couple of times and read the first 20 pages or so but couldn't really get into it.With the movie on the horizon, and with my preference for reading books before seeing movies, I decided to try the audio version of this. I'm really glad I did!Memoirs tells the story of Chiyo, a little girl from a fishing village who, even at age 9, is startlingly beautiful with unusually light colored eyes. She is sold by her father into service as a maid in a geisha house in Kyoto, ultimately to be trained as a geisha herself. As she grows and matures, she clashes with the primary geisha of her house, the wicked and vindictive Hatsumomo, and finds a mentor in one of Hatsumomo's competitors. With her \\"older sister's\\" help, Chiyo is transformed into Sayuri, an accomplished and popular geisha who learns to \\"work the system\\" to achieve her independence.My summary doesn't do justice to the nuances of the story. Arthur Golden draws a detailed and compelling portrait of Kyoto and pre-war Japanese society in general, and details the often hidden world of the geisha, women who are trained as living works of art, as much prized for their ability to make lively conversation, dance, sing and perform tea ceremonies as for their appearance. The mixture of exotica and the elements of soap opera--will Sayuri overcome the machinations of Hatsumomo to destroy her career before it starts? Will she ever get to spend any time with the man she is convinced she loves?--kept me listening attentively.The leisurely and detailed storytelling lends itself well to unabridged audio. I would definitely recommend unabridged over abridged, as much of the beauty of the story is in the very details of background and scenery and the nitty gritty of geisha life that would be editted out in an abridged edition.Bernadette Dunne is an excellent reader and performs the story in an authentic-sounding accented English. Her tone is perfect for the conversational tone of the story, where the narrator speaks to the reader as if in conversation, starting anecdotes with \\"You may remember that I told you about...\\" or \\"Now I have to tell you of (this or that custom). The effect of listening to this is of an intimate conversation with Sayuri-san, imparting to you the details of her fascinating life.I highly recommend both this book and the audio version of it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought that this book was written so well. It is a story about a girl growing up in Japan in and around the 1920's. She takes us into the mysterious and not so often-talked about world of a Geisha. This book does a wonderful job of getting every small little detail exact with the time and setting. The author had a very good voice, and through out the book, you feel as if Sayuri is sitting across from you at a table drinking tea. You feel like she is talking directly to you of her accounts. This book is fantastic and I highly recommend this book to anyone. Especially if you are interested in Japanese culture or would like to learn about the whole life of a Geisha. Thank you for your time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden is not a horrible writer and certain passages here are quite beautiful; the problem is that this book is not an act of literature but an act of opportunism. Writers must deal with and present either experiences or ideas or a combination of both. Ideas are in the public domain and one needs no qualification to traffic in them except for the ability to do so convincingly. This is not an issue here because Golden is not an &quot;intellectual&quot; writer and this is not a novel of ideas.Which brings us to the domain of &quot;experience.&quot; Now, I would never argue that authors must rigidly hew to the parameters of their own experience and turn out one autobiographical book after another. When writing a character-filled book in the third person, for example, an author is called upon to imagine other minds, other realities, other lives, and this exercise of the empathetic imagination can be a wonderous thing. The problem comes when an author, like Golden, attempts to write an entire novel in the first person from the vantage of a person who is completely removed from himself in time, space, culture, and gender. This does not spring from a desire for authenticity: it is, in fact, nothing more than literary machismo. &quot;Look!&quot; he's shouting, &quot;look what I can do!&quot; And it simply doesn't ring true, except to people who know even less about the subject than the author does.I am neither a geisha, nor Japanese, nor a woman, but I have lived in Japan longer than Golden has and I would wager my Japanese is just as good or better. Although Golden gets many of the factual details right, there is so much about the tone and the psychological sketching here that simply &quot;stinks of butter,&quot; as the Japanese used to say of Westerners a century ago. As a very serious student of Japanese literature, I can assure you that no Japanese would ever write like this, that is to say, like Dickens in a kimono. The novel is just too busy: too many characters, too much plotting, too much incident, and most damningly, too much naivete about the workings of the human heart. In fact, it should be made publicly known that the woman on whom Golden based this story sued him for misrepresentation and is in fact writing her OWN book to set things straight. She has her own pecuniary motivations, no doubt, but her criticism still stands. It's her life after all.It's good for Golden that so many people found this novel so ravishing and so interesting. He is a capable entertainer, and he knows the secret of entertainment: pander to your audience. Give them exoticism, but don't challenge their misconceptions. He spotted a market niche, he pulled off his high-wire act, and he's been amply rewarded. But if anybody thinks that this concoction attains the mighty beating heart of literature, let him or her think again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have been to Kyoto and was lucky enough to be entertained by a geisha in the very district the book takes place in. Being the only gaijin (foreigner), I was equally amazed by the other Japanese in attendence and their fascination of the geisha. Arthur Golden came as close as anyone could to creating a story on a subject so little know about, even most Japanese. While much of the dialog was a little too precise, a Japanese writer wouldn't have been so flowery, it hit on so many cylinders to be one of the best books written in years. It's a rather simple story that rarely, if at all, goes over the top."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I understand that there are many mixed opinions about this book and frankly I have to say that I love the book for its educational value and it's entertainment value. I lovd the characters and the way that they evolved. I can see that alot of research was done for this novel and I loved every detail of the book that just makes it so enriching. Although I truly enjoyed the novel and would recommanded to anyone, I thought the ending was too abrupt, and I really wanted to see more details about Sayrui's son and her life in the US. Read the book and decide for yourself whether or not it's worth the read because it doesn't matter if you like the book on a personal level, the pictures that are depicted through the pages of the chapters will stay with you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a very readable book. It will captivate and hold almost anyone. It is especially rich in its descriptions and love of Japanese culture. I, however, was a little disappointed in its lack of depth, true intimacy, and a everything will turn out alright philosophy. Very Dickensian, even down to its first page homage.I would recommend Ishiguro's An Artist of the Floating World for a novel of significantly greater depth and social meaning."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am amazed by the fact that this male American writer was able to write a book from a Japanese female's point of view that seems so authentic. This is a wonderfully romantic story, and takes you into a the world of pre-war Japan and the life of a Geisha. A great adventure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the sort of book that one hopes for...completely engrossing, enlightening, and entertaining. I found myself thinking about the characters during the day, and wondering what would happen next. This kind of experience is what I read books for. It absolutely transported me."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The setting and characterization are superb in this first by Golden. You could feel the stiff kimonos and quiet movements on the tatami mats. I could hear the wind and see the vivid colors and the wrinkles in their faces. No other author has been able to entrace me into a story like so, this was so realistic that it was scary.This is just one of those stories that give you goosebumps down your arms after finishing it. When the suspense and surprises end, you feel full, happy (sad) for the characters, and feel like the time spent on this massive book was worth it.This story is very memorable, whether a real memoir or not, it is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book because Arthur Golden captured the essence of the Geisha. This essence is at once beautiful, subtle, unfulfilled and lonely. So many of the admirable traits associated with Asian women are personified in the Geisha: gracefulness, control, and generosity. The very traits that many American men hope for with Asian wives (and sometimes do not find) are also present in the perfect Geisha: impeccable timing, unselfish behavior, soft spokenness, ageless beauty, subservience. All I can say is that those readers that gave this book a poor reading must not appreciate Mr. Golden's talent for captivating readers on so many different levels. Perhaps some readers need the scientific, the obvious, the crude or the formula story to feel complete."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was hooked on this book from the very first page. Golden did an excellent job of bringing the reader inside the life of the geisha, like we were walking right beside her through all her journies. I've read it twice!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This eye-opening book taught me so much about a culture that I was previously completely unaware of. I was intrigued by the lives of the characters- something I'd never want to experience- and couldn't wait to find out what happened. Oh, and it wasn't just a tedious string of facts, either. I'm in 9th grade, and I didn't find it boring at all. A great book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put this book down, but for all the wrong reasons.

I highly recommend this book to others!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In response to the person from L.A. who said he would applaud if Spielberg filmed &quot;Memoirs,&quot; I do not agree. First of all, Spielberg is an action director. He would fail miserably in the drama categories (if he filmed Titanic it would have went straight to video). Knowing him, he'd probably spend years recreating the World War in Japan and dismissed Sayuri and company. The quality of the film takes a dive when he spends the budget on blow-them-up shoot-them-down scenes instead of taking the time to find competent actors and actresses who ACTUALLY FIT THE ROLE! Second of all, Spielberg doesn't care about anything other than competition. Following Cameron's Titanic, he went on to direct Saving Private Ryan to say &quot;I can do this too&quot; but I'm sorry, it didn't work.I would encourage independent film directors to take on &quot;Memoirs.&quot; At least the audience can expect a heart wrenching, touching story filled with depth, insight, and culture, not some blockbuster that cares about winning &quot;Best Drama&quot; at the Oscars and pouts like a whiny baby when it doesn't."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was amazing. The careful detailing of each move and thought of Sayuri was so vivid, it felt as if you were part of her psyche. I could not put this book down.

I was expecting some racy, explicit sex novel, and it was not that at all. The imagery and metaphor used takes the reader so much into the story. I even had dreams about it!

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I lived in Japan for ten years and was amazed at how well Arthur S. Golden captured the essence of the Japanese culture. Furthermore, it is a compelling, page turning story! A great read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As an Asian woman I am often leery of books written about us by men and especially non-Asian men. But, this book was really enchanting. I enjoyed it not only because it's a beautifully written and told story, but, more so because it helps people understand Asian women better. So often Asian women are criticized for their demeaner; seen as weak. And yet, this book shows how truly strong we are. We are proud of our roles, whatever role that may be.

Just enthralling!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read a review that said Memoirs of a Geisha is an epic on an intimate scale. That is exactly true. This is a very intimate book, and Golden has done an excellent job of creating a very memorable and lively character in Chiyo. This is the only piece of modern literature I have read that is actually literature - yet it is also a true page-turner. There are faults in the book - the ending seems a bit rushed, and the way the book comes to its climax is so muck like a Dickens novel its almost laughable. But this is the only book I have read in a very long time that truly absorbed me, and I still think about it weeks after i finished it. There are so many things to love about this book, I dare not try and list them for surely i would forget some. Just buy the book and read it, you won't be disapointed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Chiyo and her older sister Satsu are taken away from from the fishing town of Yoroido and their elderly father when their mother becomes critically ill. Chiyo is hopeful that she and her sister will be adopted by the wealthy Mr. Tanaka, owner of the Japan Coastal Seafood Company. They are surprised when he does not adopt them but rather takes them by train to Kyoto and later horrified when they are cruelly separated from one another. Chiyo finds herself thrust into the position of a maid in an okiya (house of geisha), but she does not know where her sister was taken.Memoirs of a Geisha opens a rich new world of traditional Japanese customs to the Western reader. Although the author is an American man, he transcends the barriers of gender and culture in telling this story. He narrates his story in the first person of the geisha Sayuri while also fully developing the relationships between other predominantly female characters. His tale is so convincing that, at times, it's hard to think of this memoir as a work of fiction. The Japanese theme of geisha is treated by the author with utmost respect and understanding. It's a beautiful story which leaves an indelible mark on the heartstrings of its readers."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden sketches the delicate, slowly vanishing world of the geisha in beautiful, sometimes startling language and imagery. Most surprising - and haunting - are the tiny details embroidered throughout this novel: the smell of fish, the steps of a dance, the contents of a geisha's makeup collection, the brilliant designs swimming across an antique kimono. Though I consider this novel's fatal flaw to lie within Sayuri's overplayed love story, this book is to be treasured, nevertheless, for its wealth of emotions and stunning attention to detail."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Rarely has a book captivated me like this one. And I'm NOT easy to please. Why? One reason may be that I have lived in Japan for over 13 years, most of it just a brief train ride away from Sayuri's home of Gion. And every time I turned a page of &quot;Geisha&quot; I expected Arthur Golden to take the easy way out and deliver the all too familiar and irritatingly biased, westernized, syrupy-sweet, made-for-people- who-have-no-idea-what-Japan-is-about goo that is churned out all too often by the western media. And he never did. The simple and delicate narrative may have put some off, but I assure you that that IS how a girl of that time would think and act. A trademark of Japanese design is its complete devotion to a captivating simplicity that often produces achingly beautiful results. A. Golden seems to understand these and other often unspoken yet essential Japanese principles as he skillfully weaves together the simplest events to create a riveting and incredibly realistic story/world/mosaic. May I also add that my equally critical Japanese wife (an English literature major in college) read this book almost as quickly as I did (4 days) -something she has never done before and was equally captivated by each page. Simply put, he got it right."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A frustrating read. \\"Memoirs..\\" constantly hints at the great novel that it could be, but in the end delivers no better than a Harlequin Romance. Perhaps that's the real reason behind its immense popularity. The hype surrounding the book led me to believe it would be as moving and complex as an Amy Tam novel -- it's even written in her first-person/memoir style. But, after a promising beginning, I watched in horror as the novel devolved into the puerile territory of an historical bodice-ripper. Even its plot is lifted directly from that genre; the hapless heroine, whose innate worth is evidenced solely by her beauty (which usually presents itself in the form of an unusual feature -- extraordinary hair or eyes) and the irresistible desire she inspires in men (and jealousy in women), made to suffer at the hands of evil people who plot to destroy her because she is so good and beautiful and they are so...well, just born to be bad. Then there is the unreachable object of desire, for whom the heroine pines, and who is always a) angry with her, or b) oblivious to her. After much suffering on her part at the hands of a vast conspiracy of evil-doers, the heroine must try to resolve the misunderstanding that has kept her apart from her rich and powerful object of desire. And that, in a nutshell, is the Memoir of this Geisha. Even the much-vaunted historical detail that Golden employs is a prime feature of the romance genre; every bodice-ripper spends reams of paper describing the clothes and hair and interior decoration of its heroine's world. To be fair to Golden, he does employ richer prose and more subtlety than your average supermarket paperback, but in the end he can't disguise the fact that this silk kimono is made out of a sow's ear."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed the plot of this book - but then again, I always enjoy different spins on classic tales. It's interesting from a cultural anthropological aspect, and at the same time, that is where some of the problems stem from. In terms of authorship, the voice of the protagonist is that of Sayuri - but Sayuri is a projection of Golden's Western perspective of geishas. I'm sure he did his research, but the way the story is structured, it makes it difficult to remember that Golden is not the sole authority of cultural accuracy. In fact, the former geisha he had exhaustively researched and interviewed was quite unhappy with the resulting novel. Oh - and the whole mizuage practice - according to the memoirs of an actual geisha (Geisha, a Life - Mineko Iwasaki) - turns out to be a word that stands for a geisha's total earnings over a year. The same word is used for a prostitution practice outside the world of geisha in which men bid for some girl's virginity. Exotification and cultural fascination/missteps aside, I found his prose a little distracting from the story. It's as though he's trying so hard to be poetically Japanese in English translation, that his passages often come off as forced and overly embellished with flowery metaphors. To put it simply, he comes off as a Poser. Lucky for him, he's got a great story to tell. Defnitely read it if you're into Cinderella stories dressed up in kimonos, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I like reading books; the only problem is that I don't have a lot of time, with school, work and other activities. Needless to say there are more books unfinished than finished, so when I wanted to read something, I bought \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\" I had heard a lot of great things about this book, so I went in with hopes held high. Never would I have imagined what I was in store for. I became entranced by the creative, clever and beautiful writing of Arthur Golden who paints a beautiful landscape with interesting and unique characters that you love, hate and love to hate.You follow the life of a young Japanese girl, Chiyo as she is ripped from her family and sold into a lifestyle where every glance, word spoken, piece of exposed flesh has meaning. Where their virginity is auctioned and their existence is nothing more than being a mistress to a wealthy businessman. You experience her love, her hate, her friendships, her broken heart and her transformation into Sayuri, one of the most notable geisha in Japan.You will find yourself reading for hours, only to look up with bleary eyes and wonder where the time went. The writing recreates Sayuri's world with such faith that it is difficult to remember that this is a work of fiction; the best fiction I have ever read. So much so that I often had to look at the back of the book to read the \\"Fiction/Literature\\" label in the upper left-hand corner of the back cover. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is one of few books that I never wanted to end.

Yet, I feel very unsatisfied with the story and also feel suspicious about the motives of the author. To this day I am not trully sure I know what a Geisha really is. I guess we all need to take this book as a work of fiction and realize that we are viewing the Japanese culture through the eyes of an American author.

The fumbling Sayuri seems to lack intelligence or insight - while some may see it as simply a reaction to the constraints of her situation (plenty as they are) the protagonist does not kindle my sympathies.She also seems to only understand the world through similies (there are at least a hundred in the book). I find it funny how the similies are so 'exotisised' somehow (and I'm not referring just to the 'eel' one which everyone is so enamoured of!) Is this how a Western author might think Asians think to themselves ...? As an Asian I just find it a little artificial, and I hope not everyone thinks geisha think that way (that is a danger of such 'cultural' books).Character motivations could have been elucidated.However, the book had some entertainment value (much of it in the politics surrounding sex and the lush detailed descriptions of kimonos - an old trick of romance novels to focus on clothing) and the research makes it interesting.

She has many obstacles to overcome before she can become a geisha. As her spirit changes so does yours.

It provides a window through which the reader experiences a unique and nuanced life.I knew very little about Geisha life before this book, and I'm thankful for the rich presentation of its intricacies that Mr. Golden has provided.The story could have been far more satisfying if Sayuri could have recognized the wisdom of Nobu's perspective and learned to control her own destiny (and perhaps even love an ugly man), rather than continuing her quest for her childish dream."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is an astonishing and ingenious work of fiction. From the descriptions of her first day as a maid in the okiya, as little Chiyo from an old fishing villiage, to the day she determines to become a successful geisha, and all the struggles she endures in attempting to reach her goal, Sayuri's story comes alive. The book affords a glimpse into an exotic, provocative world where beauty, grace, and cleverness hold sway. Frankly honest and elegantly lyrical, the it gives the impression of containing the actual confessions of a successful and celebrated geisha. The reader drowns willingly in a quicksand of fascination from the very first page. 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is a brilliant, breathtaking novel of paralyzing dimensions. Golden's debut into the world of literature is worthy of being remembered for generations to come."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you are at all interested in learning about the life of a geisha, read this book.

As soon as the author reached the &quot;geisha&quot; part of his epic, he wandered into a factual textbook on geisha life, just barely maintaining a plot line to justify his sharing of the fascinating cultural experience of geisha life. And while it is indeed fascinating ( I found myself eagerly finishing the book just to learn about this unbelieveable lifestyle) ultimately the writing, story, and conclusions were unsatisfying, poorly written, and unbelieveable. What a shame, as it started with such interesting character development.

That enough should tell you how good this book is, and how talanted Arthur Golden is in writing for a woman, and a Geisha nontheless. However, not all is perfect. The beginning of the book is indeed captivating; You can almost smell the sea, hear the waves, see Chio's old crooked house. You immediately fall in love with the characters, aspecialy with Chio. Everything up untill the point Hatsumomo walks into the story is excellent. But this is one of the few, biggest flaws of the book-- Hatsumomo is a typical villain, with no motives other than &quot;ruining it for the heroin&quot;. Quite a disappointment, as the other characters are so well-written, like Chio/Sayuri's best friend, &quot;Pumpkin&quot;, who starts off as being light-hearted and amusing but reveals a &quot;dark side&quot; later on, and Mameha, Sayuri's mentor and friend, and , of course, Nobu, who is probably the best character in the book. The book somehow goes downhill after the war ends; some of the characters loose their spark, the story gets a bit dreary. But the worst part is probably the ending. I must agree with the other reviewers here on this-- the ending is overly cliche', mushy and unrealistic. Other than that, it is very informative on customs of Japan. Arthur did his research well and gives up an accurate view on the life of a Japanese Geisha.Is the book worth it? If you're interested in Japan, Geisha's and culture, you must have it. If you're interested in being captivated by a very good novel for a while, you should probably read it. It's probably not for everyone, but I liked it a lot and I did recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book transported me into another world!

Golden's story line was well drawn. His characters are well thought out and portrayed, keeping themselves steady without wavering and turning the bad guy good as so many books are wont to do. Mameha, as the rescuer, Hatsumomo as the one who makes her life a living hell make this book have so many twists and turns you can't put it down. With so much detail about Sayuri's feelings as a woman, it's hard to beleive that this book was actually written by a man!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had read Lisa Dalby's &quot;Geisha&quot; long before this, and had read extensively on Japanese culture before that, but the novel was well-done, engrossing, wonderful. As the professional reviewers noted it had a love of coincidence, like Austen and Dickens, and a sensibility of another century, but then, it was of another era. The only quibble I have is its treatment of &quot;Lizard Face,&quot; a noble man, dismissed as unsuitable late in the novel, discarded with too little explanation -- this seemed to mechanical to me. I really disliked both the protagonist amd the novelist for this dismissal of a good, if damaged, man. Otherwise, I rate this novel worth more than one reading...."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha transformed me into not only another time and place but a culture so largely misunderstood in my country. Written with insight and sensitivity the author allowed me to progressively understand the life of a young woman which was totally foreign before. An amazing read - I put it down only to sleep."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is so realistic that as I read the opening translator's note I found myself checking to make sure it was, indeed, a novel rather than a work of non-fiction. It is beautifully written, the characters come alive and the plot keeps you glued to the pages. It's also an opportunity to learn more about Japanese culture.Unfortunately, I felt that the quality of the writing declined in the second half of the book. Perhaps this is just a reflection of my personal bias toward character development over plot. But I found the first half of the book slower, richer and more satisfying. During the second half my attention was simply focused on what was going to happen next.Another weak point was the section where Hatsumomo read Chiyo's diary, in which Chiyo attempted to reveal some of her innermost feelings in code. I thought that her code was a bit transparent. It is hard to believe that a woman who was so strictly trained in the art of subtelty would be so obvious.Still, these are small arguments to make. Overall, it was a good read which I can highly recommend.If you're interested in reading another debut book by a westerner about Japan try The Salaryman by Meg Pei. It is superb! Much better than this book and widely acclaimed, too."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There aren't words for how much i loved this book.

This is a beautifully written book that will draw you into the world of the geisha and the class structure of old Japanese culture. These women were not prostitutes and it was not an easy occupation. The few who made it to the top of the geisha world could live quite nicely, but not without paying a price along the way. The movie barely touches on the content of the book. It skips over large section and makes the story of the main characters seem a lot less then their what their lives are in the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this fascinating look at a culture very different from my own. My book club read this and all agreed it was one of our favorites so far. It has an odd element of pretending to be an edited autobiography--so much so that I was convinced the protagonist was based on a real person. The depictions of various levels of Japanese life, the Geisha code, and the death of the Geisha culture during WWII are all vivid and engaging. The story of the (fictional!) personalities are equally well drawn. I'll never look at Geisha the same way."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I appreciate learning about real situations in faraway places that are for the most part foreign to me, preferably through a well written novel with an absorbing plot rather than through non-fiction. I'm a literary fiction fan, but not necessarily a scholar. If such a foreign world seems exotic and mysterious and has a sexual element to it, these elements will only add to the appeal. So in hindsight it seems obvious that anyone who wrote a quality novel about geishas would have a major success on their hands, and that's precisely what Golden accomplished."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There have only been certain books in my life that have made me feel as if I am the main character and I am living her story.

The book basically presents the biography of one geisha who through often very harsh events in her life transforms herself from the daughter of a fisherman into one of the most famous geishas of Japan. Both she and her sister are thrown into geisha houses to be taught this profession although her sister falls quickly into misfortune. Geisha houses demand strict discipline and service and have firm hierarchies that allow the use of power either purposefully or with cruelty. Jealousies and rivalries threaten the course of this woman. Once she achieves her goal, there remain tough decisions about whom she will serve. Economics and survival prevail over personal preferences and sentiment. The stability of her career is precarious as numerous events threaten to destroy it as they have for other geishas who are then often dragged into lives of prostitution. The intrusion of WWII presents other unexpected challenges and compromises to cope with shortages and lean times. A vivid and captivating book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved the story of the maid becoming a geisha.

As many have pointed out the character development is a bit one dimensional and (Beware - spoiler to follow...)I think that the story suffered in the post war years - it was not in the least satisfying that Sayuri acheived her dreamed of goal and it's very hard to believe that the Chairman fell in love with Sayuri when they met for five minutes when she was twelve and he was already an established businessman in his thirties, and that this love would endure unrequited and undeclared for eighteen years before blossoming into the perfect relationship.Sayuri's own obsession with him was a little more understandable but it would have been more satisfying if she had gained insight and maturity from her trials and come to see him merely has an important inspiration and guiding light and then gone on to find or create happiness in her own way. Several characters in the book reprimand her for never taking control of her life (most notably Nobu), and perhaps the author should have taken their advice."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden is a master storyteller. You hear only the voice of the main character, Chiryo/Sayuri. Chiryo is sold at age 9 to a Japanese boarding house, an okiya. Her mother is dying of cancer, and this gives, so they think, Chiryo a chance to have a good and educated life. Her sister is also sold, but not the same place, which the girls do not discover until they arrive in Kyoto.Immediately the harsh reality sets in, and as a reader you cannot be held back. You are pulled right into this girl's mind and share her emotions. The layers are plenty, as Chiryo desires to become a Geisha, and use her water spirit to flow through the rocky path that lies ahead of her.Once in Kyoto, she is a slave girl at the boarding house. the main Geisha, Hatsumoto, finds Chiryo to be an immediate threat with her stunning looks and cool blue eyes. Hatsumoto has no limits to her desire to ruin Chiryo's life. In one scene, Hatsumoto makes Chiryo ruin a kimono owned by a rival geisha.Chiryo eventually grows into a lovely young woman and is taken under the wing of a neighboring Geisha as her mentor, Mameha, the rival and owner of that ruined kimono. Mameha bargains with Mother, the greed-driven spinster that runs the okiya and Mameha takes on Chiryo as her protege. Under her tutelage, Chiryo becomes Sauyuri, one of the most desired geisha in all of Kyoto.But, Sayuri has desires of her own. There is no way to write a review without spoiling the beauty of this novel. The scenery is displayed with pure grace and beauty.I found it difficult to put this book down for any length of time and highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was recommended by a friend who studied Japanese...I had seen it in the shops before and finally bought it - that night I was up till 3:30 as I couldn't put it down!

Sayuri is a child, sold into a Geisha house, who must learn to survive in a highly competitive environment. As she graduates from apprentice to a skilled Geisha, we are drawn into a world that is both alien and fascinating.The author does an excellent job and the book is hard to put down. There are plenty of well-developed characters, some you'll love and some you'll hate. If I have one criticism, the plot itself is not that complex but this is more than made up for in the richness of the imagery."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Couldn't stop reading this. The metamorphosis of young, heart-broken and utterly deserted Chiyo to the highly-celebrated geisha, now lovesick Sayuri, is nothing short of entrancing.You can't help but to feel for this character as she stumbles time and time again towards her vision of destiny - her beloved, though often out-of-reach, Chairman. It is his heart that she covets more than anything in the bewildering world she must navigate. It is her endless belief that his heart alone will lift the eclipse that shadows her soul. Only the eyes of a true counterpart can see past the ornate garbs, painted cosmetics and skillful showings of a traditional geisha.The character of Hatsumomo, a rival and big sister geisha, is perhaps one of the most alluring antagonists of modern literay history. Broken-hearted and abandoned herself, it's as if she can't stand to see Sayuri so much as hope for the freedom to be loved. Once more, Sayuri's youth and the nave optimism that accompanies this youth, is a constant reminder that time is slipping for the aging beauty. What unfolds is a bitterly jealous, twists-and-turns fueled competition.I won't give away too much, but finding true love is an odyssey for Suyuri. So distant is her sense of home that it reminisces of Odysseus. From poverty to luxury and back again - rooting for her through her tribulations is what drives you on."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I still can't quite believe that an American male can so seamlessly enter the soul of a Japanese woman, and catch her world, its textures, its hopes, and its sinuous patter with such perfection.

Sayuri's life changes after second world war when the man she has always loved becomes her Danna ( A wealthy man, sometimes married, who had the means to support the very large expenses related to a geisha's traditional training and other costs.).This novel is an amazing read that brings to life, vivid and colorful characters. Being narrated in the first person, the reader feels a sense of reality to the story. Golden's ability to create clear imagery makes the novel all the more spectacular.

When I say \\"not much plot\\", I mean in the sense that a Japanese garden doesn't have many flamboyant flowers, but is satisfying to look at nonetheless. The tale flows from experience to experience, rather than racing along as an exciting, breathless story to be told. As a result, you feel like you are there with Sayuri, seeing what she sees, feeling what she feels. I very seldom weep reading a book, but this one did it to me, and wrung me dry.I am astonished this was written by a male, Western author. If women are from Venus, and men from Mars, Arthur Golden must have a time-share on the former. His writing is so heart felt, so feminine, so.....uncomfortably accurate for feelings and observations that must be universal among women .At times you want to smack Sayuri through the pages for her forced complacency and constant politeness in all situations, as well as her fixation on money, but then you realize, this is what was beaten (sometimes literally) into her during her Geisha training. And, having said that, for some reason, Scarlett O'Hara kept coming to mind as I read the last third of the book. Admirable survivors, even if not always likeable ones. And I thought \\"her\\" dry observation that Western trophy wives were not so much different than Geisha was right on the mark.A fascinating peek behind the curtain.

The story of Chiyo/Sayuri as poor child in a little fishing village who was sold to work in an 'okia' or house that trained geisha to entertain at the tea houses in Gion, on the outskirts of Kyoto, from the 1920's through post WWII Japan.This book tells of the everyday events of the geisha, their apprentices, teachers, and maids. It gives us a peak at the hardships they endured, the pain they suffered, but also the endurance they showed, the hope that kept them alive.This is a complex story: it has much beauty but does not shy away from showing us the ugliness. The petty jealousies of the geisha and apprentices and the harm they did; the politics of the geisha in procuring a sponsor, or 'dona' for monetary support; the changes that came with the coming of WWII and the inevitable devastation and the restoration after the war with the American occupation. The end reminds us that all of humanity experiences these stages in life: the struggles, the pain, the hope, and the promise of happiness.I appreciated this book.

With twists and turns at every corner, each page leaves you wanting more.It is a story (fictional) about a young girl, Chiyo, who was forced into slavery at a okiya at the age of 9 and was separated from her family and sister, Satsu, who was also sold to prostitution. The story follows Chiyo's life at the okiya, from being threatened by the successful geisha, Hatsumomo, as a young slave to her success as a geisha, under the name Nitta Sayuri, and her secret love for the Chairman whom she met as a child."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is set in the geisha district of Gion spanning one of the blossoming ages of the geisha, probably the last prosperous age we will ever see sadly. The plot of this novel is a captivating one, telling a believeable story of woman that grew up in the role of geisha during the 30s, quite a feat considering the author. Believable, I say because Golden did a lot of research, the end result being a story told in its original language, mostly historically accurate, with very good character development, but with a fairy tale sparkle that is quite obvious. Japanese culture shines through from the beautiful nature-inspired analogies in the book to the more superficial features. It is also loosley (I say loosely with caution) based on the life of an extremely popular geisha (or more accurately geiko,) that Golden spent a great deal of time interviewing, which also caused him to find himself in the hotseat later.Do yourself a favor, however. If you want to learn more about Japanese culture, do research, do not take a work of fiction about an extremely complex culture on its own. If you meet a person from Japan, do not expect them to be a fan of this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This could very well be one of my favourite novels of all time. How a man can capture the essence of a woman so well astounds me. This book was a such a feast for the senses, you could almost feel the silk of the kimono's, smell the scents upon the air and taste the flavours of life within the city. This is the type of book that you'd want to keep a copy of to re-read from time to time. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel is the story of Chiyo, a bright, pretty little girl living in Japan in the late 1920's whose father sells her and her sister into indentured servitude. Chiyo, the more attractive and intelligent of the pair, is to be trained as a geisha. Her sister Satsu is sold to a brothel.For obvious reasons, stories of girls and women trying to survive in societies where male esteem was the sole measure of a female's worth are hardly in short supply. When it comes down to it, Jane Austen's stories are mostly sugar-coated tales of women in frightening circumstances. Women and girls in Regency England had more in common with their sisters in early 20th century Japan than might be apparent on first glance. Despite vast cultural difference in almost every other area, a woman's success or failure in pleasing men and securing their support was in both societies a matter of life and death.The author has created a character who immediately grabs the reader's interest and sympathy and then places her in a precarious situation among cruel people where a misstep could land her in the gutter to starve. In that respect, this book reminded me a little of Jane Eyre, although I found Chiyo far more believable than little Jane who is, after all, given to melodramatic speeches that I doubt any child anywhere has ever spontaneously uttered.On the other hand, when the reader meets Chiyo, she meets a vividly real little girl, and as the story unfolds the narrator only occasionally intrudes with commentary beyond the knowledge of her younger self. It makes for a telling that quickly draws you in and holds you.Even within the all-female geisha \\"family\\" Chiyo is at the pecking order's bottom and quickly becomes the object of gleeful abuse by a beautiful but sadistic adult geisha who sees Chiyo's childish beauty as a threat to her position. I have rarely seen the way women sometimes seek to destroy each other with poisoned smiles and barbed words and planted rumors portrayed so well as in the wars the geisha wage against one another. Chiyo (spoiler just ahead) does survive her childhood with the help of the relatively kind geisha Mameha, but Mameha's aid is mainly a side effect of her efforts to destroy an enemy.It is a tribute to Mr. Golden's empathy and psychological imagination that he can write such a beautiful novel from such a very female point of view."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story may be fictional, but it opened my eyes to how it used to be for women in Japan, back in the 1930's .Being part of the world that has given women freedom, I find it difficult to fully understand just to what extent japanese women were subjected to the male dominance. The book pictures geishas as entertainers leading a somewhat sophisticated and luxurious life but, bottom line, they were little more than slaves, and whatever they achieved by way of comfort, was payed for in blood.Some reviewers have labeled geishas as mere prostitutes, but I think that they were not viewed as such by the japanese, simply because their culture is totally different than ours. I guess I was more shocked by the acceptance of mistresses by the wives of many of these individuals. If you are a reader that practices tolerance and acceptance of other cultures without judgement in your daily life, you can fully enjoy this book.The story portrays the life of a child sold into slavery by her parents, that ends up being one of the most prominent geisha in the Japan of the 1930s and 40s. Throughout the narrative, we see her grow, suffer, succeed, fail, and make many both right and wrong decisions, pretty much like everybody else in this world. The reader learns of her dreams, her determination not to let go of the only truly significant and meaningful thing in her life, both to achieve true happiness and to avoid becoming a bitter woman. I never felt she begged for the reader's pity, quite the contrary - she quite accepted it. Anybody would talk about how miserable they felt, if they endured what she went through.The language is lovely, albeit a little too poetic for my taste. The characters are not described in depth , but I think the picture gets through anyway, and the pace of the story is fast enough that it keeps you interested throughout.I loved this book. The fact that a man wrote it takes nothing away from the feelings (or lack of feelings) it intends to inspire in the reader. The sexuality is stark, pretty much cardboard-like, but how could she feel anything when all it was was duty? What the writer tried to achieve, I think he did masterfully."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book. I found it very entertaining, and I learned things I did not know (and put some assumptions to rest).I found I cared about the characters, especially the main character and the events surrounding her life.

Over a year on the hardcover bestseller's list, finally in paperback and jumping off the shelves, still up at the top of the list, Spielberg's new project - should be a hummer, right?? Wrong. Boring, tedious, un-engaging, way too long, overblown and unconvincing. (Besides that it was great!) Obviously the author lived in Japan, conducted meticulous research and over a period of years collected mounds and mounds of information which he wanted to share with the world, and decided that the novel was the form that would grab a reader's attention. On that score he was right, judging by its success, but for me it just didn't fly. There must be millions of people who are interested in Japanese culture, and that is what is fueling it to the top of the bestseller's lists. But as a story? As a novel? I'm sorry, but it just doesn't cut it. A good novel should keep you interested regardless of the subject matter. Even 'Bridges of Madison County' would rate higher, even though it was possibly the worst book I've ever read. Why? It had a story, and the story carried you along. This will be Spielberg's &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot;, I just know it.

The author should get good marks for what must have been exhaustive research to produce such detail. Memoirs of a Geisha is well written. But I could find little to sympathize with or learn from in any of the characters, the male characters exaggerated in their ghastliness, the geisha, when you remove the veil of artistic culture, nothing more than high priced call girls who only spread their legs for steadily paying clientele. Satsu, who fled prostitution, was the only character I could truly feel for, but she just dropped out of the story, Sayuri not even attempting to reunite with the sister she supposedly pines over, and this though Sayuri had the means and connections to find her. The characters left me empty. I found them to have little moral fiber at all, the story simply a tale of how materialistic, sometimes clever but otherwise empty headed courtesans ply their trade in Japan, the war even cast as horrible for the lack of sugar daddies and tea, having to suffer a real job, or the horror of ones hands getting rough! So what? As another reader said, it's a vacation novel, if that much, but a waste of time if you're looking for a book with any greatness."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Mr. Golden has performed a miraculous feat in becoming the voice of Sayuri, a Japanese geisha who, the age of nine, was sold by her elderly father into a life as remote from her childhood as could possibly be imagined. In a novel which brought to mind such American classics as Dreiser's Sister Carrie and Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, Golden brings Memoirs of a Geisha to us through the ears of a silent but rapturous professor of Japanese history in New York City shortly before the end of Sayuri's life. She in turn brings us, spellbound, from her native fishing village in the 1920's, to the Gion section of Kyoto in the 30's where she is carefully and strictly trained to become one of the city's top geishas-a word many Westerners, including myself, have misinterpreted. World War II interrupts her life once again and she loses most of what she has built up for herself over the years. Sayuri survives the war, however, and rebuilds her life once more. This is a book, a first novel no less, is too remarkable to adequately describe.

I've been reading it and it ain't that good. It tends to be \\"flat,\\" as some here have mentioned,yes to the blatant Cinderella motif, but imagine what a Dickens could have done with this. The writing is no more than average if that,maybe only saved by the non-fictional elements. I'm firmly convinced that this would have been much more interesting as a work of non-fiction because the author, although he's penned a long, intricate story, is not much of a novelist.Maybe that's why he quit, although he made a mint on this one.OK,reading the low star reviews have confirmed my suspicions. I had to return it to the library unfinished because it was due, and I was only semi-interested plodding through it and wondering if I'll go back and finish it. The answer is NO.

I have not found a novel that has left its mark on me like this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Author Arthur Golden takes us on a beautiful and magical realm in this culturally rich novel about a \\"geisha\\", a word that Golden insists means \\"artisan\\" and not prostitute as most would deem its meaning to be.Beautifully written, evocative and enriching, this novel is written in a way that is sure to leave the reader savoring every word, every moment. The novel traverses the path of Sayuri from a young girl, blooming into a young lady well versed in the art of seduction and enticement. We see her go from being mischievous and innocent, to being manipulative, and finally to maturing into an understanding and compromising woman. We witness her learning about the difference between love and lust, of knowing the hardships of the life of a woman who has no right over her own body to a woman who remains staunch in the face of adversity to finally change her fate, and take her destiny into her own hands.Golden never compromises the history or culture of Japan, and doesn't take many artistic liberties with the facts, thus leaving the novel to be refreshingly real - a novel that makes you feel like you've been transported into the world of a Geisha in the district of Gion. Memoirs of a Geisha is a tremendous novel, full of passion, tenderness, beauty and wonderful morsels of wisdom - and incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Before this book, I didn't know anything about geisha. I loved the way it was written, and I came to where I really connected with the characters. I kept in mind that it was fiction the whole time. I know there is MUCH to be learned about geisha, and I am happy that this book has made me begin searching to learn more on the topic. I have not seen the movie, and I'm not sure I want to, based on the reviews. I did find her obsession with the Chairman to be annoying at points..and I didn't really understand why it would be the end of the world if Nobu became her danna. I actually really enjoyed Nobu's personality. I don't know. Overall, I am giving it 5 stars. It is a beautiful book that will stick with me for awhile. If anyone has suggestions for good, accurate geisha books, feel free to comment!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was quite excited to find this book in a forgotten cardboard box at work, abandoned by a coworker who had recently been fired. I had never made an effort to purchase it or even peruse it in a bookstore, but knowing the overtly enthusiastic hype fueling its rise to best-seller status over ten years ago, I felt it must have been destiny that placed it in my hands. Sadly, it was not what I expected.I suppose the first thing that turned me off to this book was reading the little author bio on page three, which told me Golden had put much effort into learning Japanese culture, to the point of making it the focus of his college degree in art history. Immediately after I read that I read the acknowledgments, in the back, to see where he could have gotten his inspiration. I suppose in doing this I set myself up to dislike the book more than I should have.There always seems to be something \\"lost in translation\\" with stories of this nature, if they are not told directly from an authentic source. The first offense could be that Golden is a man, the second could be that he is white, and the third could be that he is a modern American. Not to say anything even remotely sexist, or racist, or nationalist against him. The fact simply remains that he could never truly know what it is to be a woman, or Asian, or Japanese during WWII, and certainly never anything close to all three at once. And so despite all his learning and research, the whole story reads so much like the shallow imagining of a life, that all his beautiful alliteration and sometimes clever dialogue ends up feeling empty.Beyond the half way point, his descriptions of materials and rooms and environments started to wear thin, as though they were space filler, thrown in to patch up the lack of depth in his characters. There is an element of humanity completely missing in this book that was desperately needed. I wanted to know how characters felt, and I was left to second guessing. Despite bringing up several \\"taboo\\" subjects, nothing ever really felt surprising or emotional. Not even one particular racy scene, in which several explicit things happen, could get me riled -- and here I thought I had an overly vivid imagination!My last thought on this book is, driving along on a smooth road may be nice, with its lack of bumps and ruts, but it is certainly uneventful."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I got sucked into the book when I read it and couldn't put it down. The author did a faultless job of researching the geishas' lives, and I felt as theough I was living in a different reality as I read it.However, I have to say that my favorite character was Hatsumomo. I know, I know - she's the mean, vindictive, alcoholic, beautiful, nasty mean girl you love to hate - but that's what makes her so delicious. Golden must have had a blast creating her.In fact, once she finally staggers out of the story, the novel loses steam. It's still fine, and I finished it, but I really didn't care about the other characters as much. Does it really matter if the Chairman gets his girl? And that last chapter seemed forced to me.What do I know? It certainly sold a lot of copies, and it was made into a film. But to me, the most interesting person in the novel leaves too quickly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book really allows you to step into the Japanese geisha culture, and experience what it must have been like - a very interesting storyline, too.

The ending just destroyed the whole geisha affect I thought. I loved the description, i love the way i was drawn into Sayuri's magnificent life but then, the ending just ruined everything. It just shows how american golden is, and it just proves that writers (americans) nowadays must add a bit of their egotism in there. I would have prefered Sayuri to stay in japan. Other than that,I found the book almost astounding, and at times disturbing."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Cat fights set up like Joan Collins versus Linda Evans, brief cultural references, and then back to more back-biting plotting and night time soap stock plots. Two stars only because of some of the facts gleaned. A huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was overall a solid book - above average and well written. The knowledge that you received regarding the extensive training and difficulties of a geisha made this book worth reading. The travels through a young girl's life made you feel for her and in the background you were cheering for this woman to succeed. I couldn't put this book down.At the same time there were some things that were missing. That the author is a man and the main character is a women is typically a problem. For example, there is a part of the book that describes the woman loosing her virginity. To her it seemed almost a giggling matter. Yet to the average woman it was an insecure and painful experience. The woman didn't tell us what first time sex felt like, and I think it's because a male author cannot adequately describe it. The second problem has to do with the asian culture. Only someone who has an American/asian family understands the male/female dynamics and how it really stinks for the female. That you are not a son is one strike. You start in the negative and have to work your way to the positive side. It is also a culture that seems to thrive on pain and difficulties. Your best is never good enough. It didn't seem that the author actually felt the anger the woman must have felt due to the sexism (or maybe it is because I am American and she was not therefore the woman didn't understand that it could be any different). Regardless, this book made me glad that I am American. I do not respect the asian culture any more or less after reading this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put it down until I threw it across the room on page 417.

The story seemed to me simply a vehicle to convey information about a Geisha's world. The research was obviously the point, not the characters.

Although this is a work of fiction and not in fact a true memoir this is still a very well written novel and one that I would highly recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Where to begin!? First of all, this book should've been called \\"About a Chairman\\" because at some point that's all we ever hear about. The book starts off well enough talking about Sayuri's childhood and the poverty she was brought up in. Out of nowhere her luck changes and she's immersed into a new world where she has to sink or swim. I should've stopped reading at this point and go on with my life thinking this book would follow that ascending path.. . but oh no, I didn't.ENTER THE CHAIRMANI honestly don't get the reviewers that say things like \\"it was so fascinating I couldn't put it down!\\". How BORING must your life be to utter such a thing? Jesus! If you've spent your life reading the likes of Vogue, Cosmo and Esquire then yeah, it's pretty fascinating. But let's get back to the book, shall we?THE CHARACTERSOf all the characters, I have to say that the least boring one was Hatsumomo. Although we are expected to see her as the antagonist right from the get go, she would sometimes be unpredictable and downright nasty. Actually, she manages to shed some light on the role Sayuri plays throughout the book when she names her \\"Little Miss Stupid\\"; good one Hatsumomo! The book goes on talking about the oh-so-tragic episodes in Sayuri's life when suddenly... she meets The Chairman! The book then falls into a downward spiral and we are dragged along hopelessly. One reviewer said it best when he said something like: \\"whenever she talks about The Chairman, we feel like when a friend talks ALL the time about a girl he likes; we can't help but roll our eyes everytime he talks about her\\". There you go! And it's not just the constant nagging about the Chairman this, and the Chairman that... it's also the poor and corny way the author talks about it. Half the book is mined with senseless analogies like \\"whenever he looked at me, I felt like a butterfly on a blossoming flower\\" or \\"he touched me, and I felt like a wet towel under the scorching heat of the sun\\". What??CATCHER IN THE OKIYA??Call me crazy, but at some point in the book I felt like I was reading \\"Catcher in the Rye\\". If Holden Caufield had been a japanese girl in the 1930's and sold to an okiya... he would've been Sayuri. \\"My life in this okiya is... phony!\\" In case you're wondering, I hated \\"Catcher\\" as well. Anyway. The book provides no insight on what life was as a Geisha, it's actually misleading. I don't know how people can say \\"it's so well documented!\\" Are you a Geisha? or do you have a degree in Japanese history? For all I care that research was a waste of time for we are not given even a glance at it. All we hear about are what the hairstyles were used back then and a thing or two about kimonos. \\"Pearl Harbor\\" might even be a better reference on the subject!The corniest part of the book is by far the ending. No, I won't go into that here so don't worry. At last I could put down that silly book and give it back to its owner (a girl, of course) who thought the book was \\"fascinating\\" and \\"highly recommendable\\". Deliver yourself from the silliness and senselessness of this book... if you don't, have your eye drops ready for you'll be rolling your eyes every two pages. Reader, you have been warned!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After hearing so much praise of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" I found that it did not live up to all the hype.First, The characters in the book are too extreme. For example, Hatsumomo, Sayuri's archnemesis, is a genuinely \\"evil\\" character, with no other side. She's always out to get someone and to wreak havoc on Sayuri's life. Of course, this is completely unrealistic. Sayuri and Mameha, however, seem perfect in every way.Second, the plot was very weak. In this book, the main character Sayuri has been pining for the \\"Chairman\\" since she was a little girl, and ends up with him in the end. The book is basically about her exploits as a geisha, and what she does to win the Chairman's heart. How often in life do women actually end up with their childhood idols? And to finally be with the Chairman, Sayuri betrays people who cared for her.On the other hand, I must compliment the author on his writing style. The whole time I felt as though a Japanese woman was telling her tale, instead on an American man. I also learned a lot about the career of a geisha. However, this does not make up for the unlikable, unrealistic characters and the weak plot."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It only promotes people's misunderstanding/ misimpression towards Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you read the stories of Geishas told by Geisha, you'd realize that he took liberty.

That said the book itself is well written, with a good plot, and a good story, the only problem is that this is the memoirs of a Geisha, a book that travels back and forth through time at some points, a point where she's telling her story, and another where she's enacting her story like a little girl. The voice is unrealistic, it's bland, and said with little emotion, and strict description. A novel that only got praise through its subject, and not it's way of telling the story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I can't jump on the 5 star bandwagon here and say I loved it because I didn't. I thought the book lacked any authentic emotion. The characters were shallow and at the end of the book I didn't care about them. In fact I was relieved to part company with their vapid existence of drinking, gossiping and illicit sexual intrigues. The book so often lapses into \\"instruction manual mode\\" that it became a tedious read about half-way through. Golden did his research, but meticulous research doesn't necessarily make for a great work of literature. It certainly didn't in this case. The ending was the greatest disappointment. It fell flat with a loud, echoing \\"THUD\\"!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden's novel provides a detailed description of the life of a geisha, opening the door on an aspect of Japanese culture I knew nothing about. His descriptions are crisp and his writing style is often poetic. As such, readers will no doubt find it a fascinating and flowing adventure into a different world. The journey is made through the eyes of the female protagonist, Sayuri, who is recounting how she came to be a geisha. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to become emotionally involved with the characters, especially Sayuri. While I would have to reread the novel to give it an informed feminist reading, my casual reader response was one of offense. Sayuri's character lacks the nuances of a woman's perspective, and as such her character remains flat. For example, while Sayuri spends much of her time dwelling on a man she doesn't know (waiting to be saved by him), the demise of her family, the loss of her sister, is quickly explained, dismissed, and left emotionally unexplored. Further, for a novel so centered on a community of women oppressed by a male culture, the lack of any authentic female bonding being honestly conveyed is a critical flaw. The memoir narrative style may serve as an explanation for a certain emotional detachment that holds the listener/reader at a distance, but, because this is a world foreign to most readers, more emotional resonance was needed to give the story lasting impact."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had many people recommend this book to me, all of whom raved about it... I borrowed a copy of the book it sat on my desk for a couple of days. When I finally picked it up to read it, I could not put it down. The first thing I did after I finished it (which was in the very early hours of the next morning) was look on the cover to find out the author's name, so I could begin recommmending it to my friends. To my complete amazement, the author was male! I couldn't believe the absolutely amazing job he did of potraying a female. The only not-so-great part of this book was the confusing names.

It was almost as if Golden had a limit to the amount of pages he could use and had to tie up the ending really quick. It completely threw off the gentle pace of this book. These types of fast resolutions work well in Hollywood, but leave a reader feeling rooked.To make it worse, I read the entire book under the assumption that it was a real memoir. Although I was suspicious after the wham bam thank you ma'am ending, I was crushed when I realized it was all a fiction.If Spielberg decides to do the movie, I think he will show us just how great this book could have been."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What a historical novel.

Golden leads us too carefully in the beginning of the novel, but as soon as he rolls the paper door open, he pulls us into the life of a geisha.

I never thought that I could be so fascinated by what happens in the life of a geisha. Either way, I wondered why Golden didn't choose do to a biograhpy-straight out. I don't think that it would have taken anything away from the story, unless he was really concerned about the identity of Sayuri and others. Also Golden should have either went all the way with why Hatsumomo, Mother, etc were so bitter or left them alone. Because Hat' is such a huge part of the story, I felt that the reader needed more. It may not have hurt to have their voices in the memoir-thus not making it a memoir any longer. But he has so much about Mameha-that the others including the Chairman need the shared space so that the work could be more effectively pulled off. War-time was a little flat and needed more spark, but would one expect a geisha too know much about war, afterall they are really concerned about men and beauty. Nonetheless, who can forget Chiyo, Satsu, Pumpkin and the others.

Though it is a fictional novel, it's told like a memoir of a famous Japanese Geisha. The story starts out like this. When Chiyo is a young girl she and her sister are taken from the Japanese fishing village they live in and brought to Kyoto, a famous Geisha district. And when Chiyo and her sister are separated Chiyo is left alone in a Geisha house defenseless to the cruel and conceited Hatsumoto and tough leaders of the house. Miserable and lonely Chiyo has no idea that she will one day become Sayuri, a famous Japanese Geisha that people will talk about for years. Memoirs of a geisha is not only a fascinating story filled with a colorful cast of characters and a brilliant story line but it is also historically satisfying and accurate. If you've ever wanted to learn about the customs and practices of the Japanese Geisha, or just want to read an amazing book, read this. I swear you will not be disappointed. I only hope Liza Dalby (the only westerner ever to become a Geisha) does a good job in creating the movie.

It was mysterious, it had real characters that draw emotions from the reader. It makes you glad, upset or worried about the outcome and the daily lives of these unusual characters.

This author, Arthur Golden, portrays the life of a geisha through stories that a dear friend of his tells him on her deathbed.He was inspired by the stories of these young girls that had experienced similar incidents. Although Mr. Golden is a Caucasian male that has only visited Japan a few times, he has a way of telling the story as if he were there in the first person.

The bad: it's little more than a Cinderella tale, the ending is weak and boring, and it does not explore the complexities of a human being existing only as an object of beauty. It also set up characters or situations, but doesn't follow through: Example, her sister. Why have her sister at all? Nobu has such a wonderful role in Sayuri's life, then he just disappears without hardly a word. The book just doesn't connect well.The good: It has wonderful characterization. Hard to believe it was written by a man. Sayuri, if a little more calculating than a lot of women, is realistic as a female. Other dynamic characters: Nobu and Hatsumoto. And it is very educational. I knew nothing about Geishas before reading this. This book shows enough of Japan to be educational, yet is not as disorienting as some books about Asian cultures. Still, I couldn't help feeling that I was being spoon-fed Japanese culture.. but it was enough to wet my appetite. Also, it has beautiful imagery: Example: The part where the ruby was compared to a splotch of blood.

If you want to read positive reviews, read the other reviews since I agree with many of them: the character is rich, the authentic descriptions of the geisha life is exoticly captivating, down to the last silk sash. However, the bad part is the ending: the novel does not end...it just stops.

However, he failed to capture the emotions of Sayuri, the Geisha whose memoirs we are purportedly reading. This novel may be a stereotypically love story if one ignores the age and social status difference between the geisha and her love interest (sponsor). Or it may be a story of abuse of women in Japan. It may even be an outsiders view of what life is like as a geisha. It is not an insider's view of what it feels like to be a geisha as the title implies.

My existence was as unstable as a stream, changing in every way; but the moth was like a piece of stone, changing not at all. While thinking this thought, I reached out a finger to feel the moth's velvety surface; but when I brushed it with my fingertip, it turned all at once into a pile of ash without even a sound, without even a moment in which I could see it crumbling.\\" Page 107.This passage is an example of the beautiful imagery and style of Arthur Golden's writing in Memoirs of a Geisha. In one passage alone, he has made you feel as though you could reach out and touch the moth, and at the same time has conveyed a deep meaning about this girl's life described in this scene. This type of writing is seen throughout the book, independent of the plot, which captures the reader's attention from the beginning to the end.The plot of Memoirs of a Geisha involves the story of a young girl, Chiyo-san, who grew up on the countryside in Japan, and was tragically separated from her sister and her family. She was taken to be a maid in the big city of Kyoto, and although this work was hard, she was promised to be taught how to become a geisha one-day. This hope kept her spirit alive through much torture from the geisha she lived with, Hatsumomo. When she was finally allowed to train to become a geisha, she finds that it was not at all what she hoped it would be. She had to spend endless hours in teahouses entertaining men she didn't care for and pretend she was having the time of her life.In plotting out this story, Golden wove in numerous symbols with different meanings, such as the handkerchief that was given to Chiyo by a chairman. This symbolized hope for her throughout the novel, and no matter what she encountered, she would look at the handkerchief and feel a little stronger. The moth in the above quote symbolized what Chiyo wanted her life to be like - containing stability and not uncertainty. Interpreting these different symbols is another intricate part of this novel, although they make it somewhat less believable that it was written by an old geisha.This novel is written in first person, with Chiyo telling the story of her life. She gives accounts about her life and her place in the world that are vivid and realistic, although it is a little hard to believe that an old geisha is intelligent enough to write this novel. Still, the fact that this novel was, in fact, written by an American man (author Arthur Golden) is hard to swallow. Not only did he have to cross barriers about culture and race, but crossed an even greater barrier of gender so far as going into detail about Chiyo's first time with a man. Like many other geisha, she was auctioned off to the highest bidder for her virginity. There is also description about the large, twenty-foot long Kimono robes that the geisha were required to wear and the hairstyles that were so difficult to create that the women would have to keep them and not wash their hair for weeks at a time. These are just some of the many exciting parts of this novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Being captivated by the story, and yet learning lessons about life and culture at the same time are part of the beauty of Golden's novel. It will remove any ideas one might have about the so-called romantic life of a geisha, or other myths about these mysterious women. Although it could be argued that this novel drags along in some parts with so much detail and observation of every little thing, this is part of what makes it so captivating. All this detail could also have helped make it on the New York Times' \\"Best Seller's list\\", and on my personal favorites list."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memiors of a Geisha is a great read. It is the type of book you read and love, but also the type of book you give as a gift. I found Memoirs astonishing in its credibility. After the first few chapters, I completely forgot that it was a work of fiction. It was only when I finished the novel and was confronted with the picture of Arthur S.

Is it \`\`literary\\"? If not, then why does the narrator always speak in vaguely poetic tones? Perhaps it's because the narrator is a geisha, so this is how she was trained. If that's the character's true voice, then why I feel as though there wasn't anything real behind the text? Why did I feel like the author was trying to give me a lecture on Ancient Japanese Traditions? And why does it seem that these Lectures are so low-quality?The translator appears at the beginning of the book, then disappears, never to serve any purpose. Was this just another of the author's attempts to be literary? Again, he seems confused.I rarely believe that the author's background makes him incapable of rendering accurate portraits of his characters. Here I do. Here's an American male who spent some time in Japan, writing a story from the perspective of a Japanese geisha. It all seems so academic: let's construct a portrait of the geisha - maybe just so that we can combat the perception that geishas are high-class prostitutes - and wrap it inside fiction so that it will sell well. The result is often confused.If anything comes out clearly, it is that the author wants to display life as a stream carrying us to our destiny, even though that destiny may be nothing like we had planned. The narrator proceeds through various struggles in her life, all of them like vortices in a stream (as she herself might call them). She conquers each of them, of course, and eventually wins - as we expect her to. Along the way, one of her only enemies is vanquished. Never do we feel as though she has won some war; instead, she's merely conquered one of the little stumbling blocks that life has thrown before her. This is a book about little conquests that doesn't try to be about anything more.Along the way, I must give the author credit for telling a very compelling story. It's written simply enough, and the little battles are sufficiently captivating, that I tore through it. If you're looking for a quick, engrossing read, this book is for you.The thing is, I was looking for more, and I don't think I'm out of line in suggesting that the author's tone suggested it *would be* more. Like I said, at points he wants to be \`\`literary,\\" but he never follows through. The result is that I felt for at least 300 pages as though I were reading a soap opera, and was constantly trying to ask myself what was so much better about reading this book than watching television. Maybe the presence of more Japanese words.And at points the book is downright creepy: here's a middle-aged man describing the sex lives of teenagers with more than the requisite amount of salacity. I really felt as though the author were enjoying the sex himself, and it made me feel rather dirty to be reading it. Keep in mind that I had just finished reading Nicholson Baker's book _The Fermata_, which is nothing if not pornographic, so it's saying a lot that _Memoirs of a Geisha_ was uncomfortably sexualized. (And yes, I realize that one of a geisha's main tasks is sexual. The author's creepiness is still a fact.)I guess I'm feeling ambiguity about having read a book like this and having enjoyed the read, but feeling as though there were better uses of my time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha has quickly become one of my favorite books that I have read several times over. It breaks through all we believe is morally right and socially acceptable, to make this young Geisha become a part of the reader. Arthur S. Golden writes in such a manner that the protagonist's hopes and fears easily become the reader also feels for her. Her internal and external struggles with what she knows to be true and what she is being told to do and except are brilliantly portrayed throughout the entire novel. I believe that all people, despite the different circumstances of our many different lives, feel sympathy and perhaps a sense of being able to relate the Chiyo in certain instances of her life. She comes alive on the pages. Memoirs of a Geisha is an enchanting novel about a young girl's coming of age in a subculture of the Japoneses' prized Geisha. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has ever struggled with finances, family, love, or life."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Some geishas have been very successfull. They really rescured companies by cheering up and entertaining. They helped to maintain very difficult and detailed relationships. Some of them quit their geisha carrers with happy endings. They usually do not show their existance to public no matter how they worked hard to solve the problems. I, as a kyoto native male, like this book very much."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was disappointed by this book. In terms of giving me insights into a geisha's life, I think it delivered. But the plot development was lacking and I could not relate to the main character. The main character falls in love with a chairman after a brief (and I mean, very brief) encounter with him, I mean he doesn't even remember her. She becomes almost obsessed with him and the plot is driven by her quest for his love. Basically, I don't like it that she was into this Cinderella character where everyone around her was either ugly, mean, or vengeful and she was all pure and beautiful. Give me a break. I can't relate to characters like that. They should be flawed, not all self-congratulative, the best in dance, the best in wine pouring, the best this and that. It gets boring after a while. The only I liked were the geisha details, but I'm sure I could have gotten that from another book. It was not worth reading over 500 pages for that in this disappointing book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm about 3/4's of the way through this book, and am slightly disappointed. It's definitely not the kind of book that you can't put down. Nothing very exciting happens. However, it is an interesting view into the life of a Geisha and how the system works. I'm finding Sayuri's constant &quot;poetic&quot; comparisions to situations and feelings slightly irriating (can't remember any at present!). So, it is an informative and interesting read so far, but nothing gripping."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book was definately a page-turner and I was never bored when reading it. It held my interest and many of the writer's descriptions were breathtaking. However, there were some flaws in the book as well. It seemed to almost glamorize slavery. And with the exception of Sayuri's relationship with Mameha, all the women in the book acted as enemies towards each other.Basically, the book is flawed by the author's unquestionable acceptance of patriarchy. The setting of the book is a world in which women exist as pleasure items for men with little or no say in the direction of their lives---and the sense when reading it is that the author has no problem with this. The female characters are almost always passive, except when they are trying to to appease men. I had thought Mameha had broken the passive female character mold when she asked Sayuri to be her little sister, but even then we find out later that Mameha was not acting on her own accord at all.Despite all this, I did enjoy the book and found it difficult to put down. The ending was a bit contrived and fairytale-like, but after seeing Sayuri suffer so much, I was glad for the happy ending."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After reading some of the reviews written about this book, I was under the impression that it was going to be an unforgettable classic impossible to put down. Sadly, I invested in the book and was disappointed. I found the writing mediocre at best, and some of the sexual content irrelevant and tacky, not adding to the storyline at all. Although I did enjoy parts of the book, I found much of it predictable and repetitive. I found myself emotionally un-stirred by the characters in the story, and the antagonist was just so unrealistically evil and cliche, I was never shocked or surprised the whole duration of the book. (Small lie, there's a small surprise at the end with pumpkin and the Chairman...but not enough of one to revive the book...)Perhaps all the hype about this book lead me to raise my standards regarding the book, and that's why I find myself so supremely disappointed after reading it. I give the author credit for the research I'm sure he poured into the novel, all he needs next time is some more feeling, realistic characters and some real writing, the whole book reads like a crappy romance novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"\\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" is one of the most dull books that I have ever read. It doesn't live up to the reviewers' promises of being erotic and intruiging. Most of the book revolves around the childhood shenanigans of the lead character, Chiyo/Sayuri. Like Anne of Green Gables, she manages to get into scrapes and amusing dilemmas one after the other. Some situations are so horribly contrived that they belong in a children's cartoon program. Our brave little heroine, Chiyo/Sayuri, is treated cruelly by the evil villains she encounters. Most of the secondary characters seem to exist only to make Chiyo's life difficult, and I found this hard to believe. Still, the book is written in a serious and dry manner, as if the reader is expected to believe such ridiculous one-dimensional characters and zany situations actually exist in real life. Yeah, right.I learned a lot about the role of a geisha in Japanese culture, but if I had known their work was so boring, I would never have been interested in geishas in the first place. As Chiyo/Sayuri explains, geishas aren't prostitutes or little tea servers, as we in the west believe. Instead, they go to exciting parties where they make small talk with guests, sing and play musical instruments, and drink Japanese beer with slovenly businessmen. Boring. If you're looking for an erotic, exciting book, look elsewhere. If you must read this book, please refrain from operating heavy machinery afterwards."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book held my interest more than any book in a long time.

I have had it on my wish list for some time, till my fingers, itchingly clicked on the \\"add to cart\\" button.Its a very touching storying of a little girl torn from her family at a very young age, sold by her parents (father) only cause he knew that he and the mother would not be alive long enough to take care of chiyo and her sister satsu.

The joys and pleasures she had to relinquish to become this world known Geisha. The love she must make to have a better life for herself and for those she loves. The love she must deny herself, just to make a living in this world all shown, during a time of war and despair.When I read Memoirs of a Geisha it was hard for me to put it down. The words, the structure, and just the storyline, had me memorized. From beginning to end I was enthralled to the books, captivating writing. My eyes never ventured from those pages. Arthur Golden did a wonderful job at making the reader feel the pain, the love, and the joy, that is strung through out the entire novel. I could actually feel the shudder of the roof tops as the military planes flew over her head during the war. I could almost reach out and caress the silk of her kimono, that lays ever so gently on her moon paled skin. I could taste each of the salty tears that ran down her cheeks, many a times. Arthur Golden can really bring his story's into reality. Making this book so alluring to its readers. This is why I highly recommend Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The thing that stands out most about Arthur Golden's marvelous first novel is the intricate, intimate detail. If you did not know the author was an American male, you would easily believe this was by a real geisha dictating her memoirs to a friend. Sayuri truly lives through this retelling of her memories. She is a real person. Her first-person narrative aches with emotion, is bright with humor, and is painted with wisdom. Golden gives us a genuine glimpse into a heretofore totally secret world.The story is about a young girl named Chiya. With unusual blue eyes, the pretty Chiya and her more plain-looking sister are sold by their poor, widowed, fisherman father to a geisha house in Gion. The geisha in residence is the beautiful but wicked Hatsumoto. Hatsumoto feels threatened by the child because if Chiyo grows up to be a beautiful and accomplished geisha, Hatsumoto could lose any chance she has of being \\"adopted\\" by the okiya's owner, thus assuring her future. Hatsumoto seeks to crush the girl's spirit.Through determination and sheer luck, Chiyo eventually does become a geisha and takes the name Sayuri. But she longs for the one thing she can never have - the heart of an older man called The Chairman who befriended her briefly as a child.The novel is long, and moves slowly. It spans forty years, from the 1920's to the 1960's. Chiya does not grow up until the second half of the book.The only thing I did not like about this book is who she ended up with. I would have chosen someone else, and was very disappointed this did not come to pass.Wonderful chick lit, or great for anyone interested in Japan or the geisha world."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a very well written love story which described the life of a woman and a geisha in pre-war Japan. It had all the elements of intrigue, suspense, love, and longing.

It sucks you in immediately, and you wont be able to put it down. It is beautifully written, it has a fascenating plot, and it really shows a different way of life, showing that geishas are NOT prostitutes. I personally prefered the earlier parts when Chiyo is younger because of the tension with the evil geisha Hatsumomo, but the whole book is fabulous. My only complaint is Chiyo/Sayuri's (she changes her name part way through)obsession with the Chairman. I wanted her to end up with someone other than who she does. I wont name names because a lot of the draw is finding out who her final danna is. If you want to see what world war II Japan was like, this isn't the book for you, they skim over WWII. This is an amazing book, and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the combined Chairman obsession and her ending up with the one I didn't like."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The most glaring problem with this book is that Arthur Golden doesn't know the meaning of \\"less is more.\\" Every other paragraph is spent in painful detail, and you flip pages wondering when he's going to get the story back on course. And the story itself is nothing more than a watered-down Cinderella in the Orient: poor girl wins suitor against pathetic odds.This book is terribly predictable. So much time is wasted on insignificant details (like what color stich was on what color kimono or what hair pin was worn on which geisha's head), that the author loses sight of the characters themselves.If detail and dry stories are your thing, this book is perfect; but if you're looking for a good story with solid, well-defined characters, you're better off to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THIS BOOK.

It's filled with pedophilia, pornography, immorality, treating women like objects, like slaves, etc.The film was pretty good, but it's been a shock when I found out in the book that Sayuri was only 15 y old when that old doctor had sex with her.In conclusion, avoid this book.

This book provides tremendous insight onto culture and life of Japan, and taught me so much about Geisha. But this book was a great story too. Sayuri's story was so well written, I thought that this tale encompassed so much of her life and made her seem very real. I was so disapointed in the ending though. She gave Nobu, who had been her benefactor for so long and saved her from the war, the short end of stick, so to speak, and ended up with the chairman. That was lame, there just isn't another word, such a typical-american-mushy-romance-novel way to end it.

Breathtakingly sad without being melodramatic, Memoirs tells the story of a young Japanese girl ripped from her peaceful fishing village to virtual slavery in the hustle-bustle of Kyoto's geisha district. Told in the first person, her tale reveals a young woman quickly becoming sophisticated beyond her years who in the next moment seems as nave as a schoolgirl in the ways of love.

So far, I am thoroughly enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs in an outstanding work that allows readers a glimpse into a culture that is mysterious and fascinating. With touching characters and beautiful language, Arthur Golden creates a world that enchants the reader and keeps the pages turning. The most wonderful aspect of this book is the brilliant use of metaphors that incorporate Eastern philosophy to convey feelings and emotions of the main character, Sayuri. And the descriptions of Kimonos, landscapes and physical features were equally wonderful.However beautifully rendered and well researched this book is, it seems as though Mr. Golden often found himself searhing for a concrete story line. Rather than simply following the life of Sayuri, he turned it into her personal quest to obtain the love of a character that is never even developed and the reader can not feel. Constant references to the Chairman become extremely annoying by page 300. But since this book is told in first person, developing other characters with whom the main person has limited contact may be difficult. But then again, I found myself wanting to know more of Mameha, Hatsumomo and Pumpkin as well. And what happened to Satsu? Perhaps Mr. Golden was just more concerned about telling Sayuri's story, often at the expense of other characters who were just as interesting.And approaching the end of the book (the last 30 pages), I really could not see how the story would be wrapped up. Then, it came to a conclusion rather abruptly. The author found closure, but he found it quickly and without suspense. Not a particularly strong ending to a good book.Still, I recommend this book to all people, especially those who have always wondered about the life of a Geisha. It is truly outstanding in that capacity. 4 stars. This book is as beautifully written as a Japanese haiku, but doesn't quite hit the mark."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Aurthur Golden has truly completed a masterpeice, a work of art.

An elegant first novel.I personally was immensly engrossed. &quot;memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is by far one of the best books I've ever read. I would recommend this book to any. It accutaly seems as you are conversing with a beautious Geisha of alluring translucent, pallid eyes,&quot;chatting over a cup of green tea&quot; her speaking of her life begining as a fishermans daughter not begining as a kyoto Geisha which she soon comes to be. &quot;Memiors of a Geisha&quot; a book of an artisan and not a prostitute as many westerners may assume.

However, I kept scratching my head when the plot was trite and too many thin similies were used. As for showing the world of the geisha, I was most intrigued by Hatsumomo and Mamaha but still felt these characters were not built to my satisfaction; the bad cop was too bad and the good cop was too good. It was Mr. Golden's first effort and unfortunately completes my experience for this author. I felt like it was basically a harlequin romance veiled as a high-brow novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"At first I was transported by the young girl's fate in being sold to become a geisha and her original resistance to this destiny yet as she begins to actually succeed the more she seems to surrender to her fate. In fact her success seems to be the very opposite of what we would nowadays term as success. Somehow as she wilts in her destiny so does the novel itself. What originally had begun as an encounter with fate is gradually reduced into giving up all control of life in the hands of others more experienced than the book's heroine. In the same way the novel seems to lose steam about halfway through its course. Transported at first by the words of this novel into a diferrent world I eventually found myself struggling to read the novel merely so as to finish it. However I did particularly enjoy the steady use of language so as to betray the origins of the heroine as a fisherman's daughter. In essence the book's heroine is more convincing as a young girl than as a young woman which is rather a pity since the same character is somehow abandoned in so far as her development in a persuasive manner is concerned."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After much procrastination I finally read 'Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. I certainly regret not reading it sooner. I cannot recall reading a book with such an original topic coupled with such vivid story telling. The Author must have spent a painstaking amount of time researching Japan and its culture for this book. I was also impressed by his ability to provide first person narration with a woman as its main character.I thought a Geisha was the equivalent of the American prostitute. I never imagined that in order to become a Geisha one must train extensively in the arts, culture, conversation and customs. In order to become a successful Geisha, one must also possess tremendous wit and ingenuity. The main character Sayuri may have had a number of unfortunate circumstances in her life, yet she refused to become a victim. She maintained poise, strength and determination.With the authors vivid description you often felt either compelled or sometimes repulsed and disgusted.

The first half of this novel, admittedly, was engrossing as we learn of the intimate details in the life of a pre-war geisha and come to know Sayuri and her struggles to find meaning to her life. But its all down hill after that, and it would have served the author well to quit right there as he seems to have run out of steam and relied on the contrived Hollywood ending allowing Sayuri to fall into the arms of her long-time idol, whom we actually know nothing about (except for one sentence that says he is married!) and live happily ever after jet-setting between Japan and New York. You spend 400 pages getting to know her only to find out that she is a big disappointment.Was this maybe the intent?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am an extensive reader, and yet I have never read anything like this before. It's unbelievable. I can't put it down, it's so real. This book is the prime example of originality.

A thoroughly delicious read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Looking at the many positive reviews of Arthus Golden's&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; I was shocked at the level of positivefeedback. Golden is a good writer, drawing stong, sypathetic characters and flavoring his descriptions with lots of detail about the Geisha life, using the narratorial strategy of having an aging, Americanized Geisha tell the tale of her childhood in Japan. However, Golden often dissmissed important aspects of Geisha culture and life, dismissing the important or even central aspects of singing, dance and sexualized behavior. Instead, Golden offers an excruciatingly detailed memoir of personal catfights, typical growing-up feelings, and a romance-novel sensibility instead of the insightful look at an obscure aspect of Japanese culture. As I read, I was shocked at how often important aspects of the culture were dismissed by a narrator so deeply invested and interpolated into the Geisha culture that she could hardly have resisted speaking of them--one can only assume that Golden would rather have his character dismiss the details than have to do his homework to write a decent novel. I invite other reviewers to think about what they learned about Geisha culture and Japanese culture from this novel; what they will find is that they know an awful lot about how young women forced to compete socially and sexually in any culture at any time will behave. Golden could have changed only a few details, called this &quot;Memories of a Nevada Bordello&quot; or &quot;Memoir of a Roman Slavegirl&quot; or even &quot;Space-Geishas of Mars&quot; and the basic content would remain the same--because there is so little truly insightful cultural detail in this ultimately schlocky romance."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Everyone in my Book Club raved about this book (I may now have to find myself a new Book Club). The writing was bland and simplistic and the book was far too long for the simple story it was telling. The characters left me cold; there was not a sympathetic one among them. The women were all scheming and duplicitous; the men unfaithful to their families and driven completely by the basest urges.

Hiding behind a woman's persona, a geisha in this case, the author's glossy treatment of characters are insufferable.

Save your money..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This has been one of the best books I've ever read.This may sound like the statement of a simpleton, but I really dislike extolling the virtues of a great book - picking it apart (the hows and whys) really take away from the pure beauty of the novel. The overall mood gets chopped up.I will say that Golden did a fabulous job - plot, voice, character development - all of these were beautifully wrought. Memoirs of a Geisha is a tableau of human feeling, the joyous agonies of love and the flourishing spirit of one woman, Sayuri.Why is everyone so surprised that Golden pulled off a 'female voice' so well? He's a writer, and a writer, in all respects, should be versatile enough to execute what is thought to be difficult. A writer feels, and Golden feels best.Read this book!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved Memoirs of a Geisha. The book truly transports the reader to the time and place. I'd write a different ending however (stop here if you haven't read the book)... one where Nobu does become Sayuri's danna, and sets her free somehow. As an american woman I got frustrated (as Nobu was) with the Geisha idea of a woman's value being based on her ability to attract a powerful old man, even if it was culturally accurate. The Chairman nonsense was tiring, and in the end proves that beauty IS only skin-deep. I couldn't buy the notion that she was so enamored for so long without so much as a ten minute conversation between them. Nobu was a more noble and worthy man, as far as the entire cast of male characters went."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is very easy reading. I could not help but laugh at some of the remarks only a Yank woman would say. As if the author had no idea about their language. I have read other Geisha books, studied Japanese and know people who live in Kyoto. This book is very American it's no wonder all the mindless Yanks love it!! It is a wonderful story no doubt of the struggle of a young &quot;Geisha&quot; woman. I read it in 5 days. It was a nice change. It's almost the same as if a Geisha would read &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot;. It's almost laughable. The whole Chairman ordeal was very tiring. And Hautsumono's character was eliminated too easily and without a boom. In fact the story was not even about Geisha at all. Only about 2 women trying to bring another down for treating one of them so badly. Sounds like elementary reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Don't believe the hype! The effort that went into creating this book is admirable, but this is a shallow exploration of a geisha's profession and of a woman's mind. It's crammed with details, but they don't add up to much. After finishing the book, I felt I had learned very little about the geisha arts. What was Sayuri learning in that school all day long? The narrative contains an abundance of cheesy metaphors and at times reads like bad haiku. The central romance of the book is implausible -- Nobu is a much more compelling love interest than the two-dimensional Chairman, and any woman as &quot;clever&quot; as Sayuri supposedly is would recognize this. To see a male novelist writing from a woman's point of view successfully, try She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb -- not Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had read this book and I found it very thought provoking,as how a simple peasant girl can turn into a beautiful geisha and multi talent entertainer in a few years of time.The author had beautifully detail about how the geisha put on their elaborate kinomo,the make up and not able to wash their hair for a shocking length of a week as due to its complexcity.and a girl's virginity had been priced to the highest bidder make it a very interesting read,the writer is clever in detail about some taboo or supersitious of being a geisha.some of the description of sexual part was so beautiful plot and detail that before you had finish reading the book,you might want to reread it again and again.it deserved a five stars.A must read"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is beautifully written where the reader is taken to a world of the geisha.

It's a definet must read!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden is an amazing novel. It tells the story of a girl named Chiyo and her life becoming a Geisha. Originally born in a poor fishing village, her dying mother sells her to an Okita, or Geisha house, so Chiyo can make a living as a Geisha. She encounters many hardships such as fellow Geisha, Hatsumomo, who literally tries to destroy Chiyo.The novel is amazingly detailed and, although written by a man, it sounds like it was written by Chiyo herself. I recommend this book to more mature audiences or readers who are interested in either Asian arts or Ancient taboo arts. Although nowadays Geisha is a taboo art, back then it was considered a form of art and entertainment and some of the luckiest girls were able to become Geisha. This novel also gets into the nitty-gritty about their lifestyles, traditions, clothing, food, and every little aspect of their lives.While I was reading this book I was also reading To Kill a Mockingbird. I made a small, if not non-existent connection between the main character, Scout, and little Chiyo. In TKaM Scout is pressured to be more girly. Chiyo was born and raised in a poor fishing village and had nothing feminine about her, but is forced to become one of the most beautiful and graceful creatures in Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I know nothing about other cultures. Being Hispanic, I know the Mexican culture very well. I picked this book up as my want to learn about other cultures grew. After page one, I was hooked. The trials that poor Chiyo goes through to become one of the most sought after geisha in Japan, were heartbreaking. The closer I got to the end, the less I wanted it to finish. 5 stars Mr. Golden... You've opened my eyes to a new culture and I thank you for that."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is so good, you wont be able to put it down for a second. The culture and writing along with the story line are so impressive. The movie and the book are so good, but this book is just wonderful.

She's not the only one who wants to read it again. I intend to purchase a copy for my own private bookshelf.This is one of the most amazing books I've read this year. Mr. Golden has an amazing ability to transport his reader to another culture and bring that world to life. His writing is tight and the descriptions are fresh. This is the type of novel that will absorb you completely. If you've not read, it's worth the $10.17 to buy it new. You'll want to keep this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was recommended to me several times before I actually read it. Big mistake.

This book is a total offence for Japanese women like me as some close minded ignorant western males still view Japanese women as being &quot;geisha&quot;. Remember: 1) the author is a western MAN who depicts almost like European and Americans during imperialism. 2) Geisha whom he got many details from sued him for fabricating the truth and disgracing her name 3) He is not Japanese and didn't live in Japan long enough to know Japanese 4) the audience was not intended for Japanese but English speaking western who hardly know about Japanese"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book sophomore year of high school, and viewed it as a waste of time. I am only reviewing to warn people who might be fooled by the pretty movie trailer and think, hey, I should check out the book this is based upon. For the record, I am white, and do not pretend to know much about Japanese culture. Unlike Arthur Golden.First off, Sayuri is the most soulless, most annoying, most unsympathetic character in the world. In the beginning of the book, she is awesome: obstinate, clever, endearing, etc. But then she meets the Chairman and falls head over heels in love. Now, when a girl falls in love in real life she tends to ramble on about it. And then her friends roll their eyes and try to divert the subject. That is EXACTLY what this book is like. Page after page of Sayuri rambling on about the old guy she loves, and you, her \\"friend,\\" rolling your eyes and skimming through it until you get to a good part.Nevertheless, you plod through the pathetic 2d characters and stereotyped villains (poor Hatsumomo, I want to like her just because she is so used by the author) and glaring misrepresentation of Japanese culture. You try to care as Sayuri describes geisha hairstyles. You try to not think about the total flaw of logic in a geisha, who is NOT a prostitute according to the author, selling her virginity. You keep going, valiantly, through the purple prose and disgusting attempts at sounding properly Japanese. You try to ignore the fact that the author references NOTHING about this being in 1930's Japan, quite possibly one of the most interesting historic periods in a country, ever.Then, things get worse. The book hits WWII in about... a few paragraphs, if I remember correctly. You're like \\"Um, okay.\\" It's like a flash-foward. We get page after page about kimonos, but nothing about something actually epic.And then the ending comes. My personal theory is that Golden got sick of writing, so he just inserted a happy, completely illogical ending that makes you want to rip the book in half, and wonder if the person who recommended it secretly hates you and wanted you to waste several hours of your life. The ending is SO BAD I CANNOT GET OVER IT. For my project pertaining to this novel, I wrote a letter to the author telling him why the ending was such a horrible idea. If the novel hadn't started sucking earlier, I would say that it ruined the entire book.Really, the only thing it has going for it is its locale. If it were set in modern America, people would rightly think it's just some dumb Oprah's Book Club release. But because it's set in Japan and the author did 15 years of research it's a masterpiece. Give the man a Pulitzer! Give me a break.I beg you, don't waste your time. If you have to find out about it, watch the movie because at least it looks pretty. The book isn't even well-written; it sounds like one of those people trying to be deep but failing. Read a book by Gail Tsukiyama, because she has a better grasp of Japanese culture and history than Arthur Golden ever will.Seriously, this is like setting a story in 1930's Germany and not paying any attention to the politics at the time. Putting in historical context could have given this novel a well-needed touch of depth... but, nope, Sayuri's too busy talking about how sexy the Chairman is than about how Japan invaded China."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"None of the reviews I've seen--professional or otherwise--address this novel, and its attendant popularity, in feminist terms. That is to say, in terms of how it presents the relationships between women and men, women and women, and what women have a right to expect in those exchanges. And when we talk realtionship, we talk power.In this novel, power over women resides, unquestionably and always, with the male at the head of his particular power structure. Therefore the Chairman wins out over poor old scarred whatever-his-name-is, and because he always will, our heroine is his.The women in this world who gain power are women who care nothing for one another. The proprietess of the house is ready to throw our heroine out at the slightest provocation; the senior Geisha in the house exploits her at the first opportunity; her fellow apprentice, Pumpkin, turns on her after being left behind. Yes, women can be that way, as can men, and they did live with extreme pressures. Still, I know women, being one, and I know that somewhere in that world women would have found friends.When she reminisces, complacently it seems, in her New York apartment, her conquest of the Chairman seems to have superceded anything else in her life. She is happy simply because the Chairman deigns to visit her. And supports her, in the meantime. This is a life?And yet it is presented as a story of triumph. Surrender your life to the right man and Nirvana is yours.I can see why Arthur Golden found the subject matter so attractive. Can some woman out there write the sequel?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"i had read this book years ago for school and fell in love with it and the inside look at a culture i had no clue about. i just finished reading it for the second time and now remember why i had loved it. i know there is a movie coming out shortly about the book and that was why i wanted to re-read it. the story moves so quickly so there's no time to get bored or feel like it's being drawn out. you can't help but root for Sayuri, the main character. the most captivating thing to me is just how insightful the book is on a topic i never thought twice about. it makes me want to read other books on the subject to further my knowledge.the one thing that was somewhat disappointing was that if you read the translator's note at the beginning, you truly think this is a story told by the aurthor's old friend, Sayuri, the main character. therefore you believe the story is true while reading it! then when you get to the end and read the acknowledgements, the first sentence reads \\"although the character of Sayuri and her story are completely invented, the historical facts of a geisha's day-to-day life in the 1930s and 1940s are not.\\" am i the only one who read the story thinking it was true because of the translator's note at the beginning?? what a disappointment to read it really was just a ficticious novel.don't get me wrong. it's still one of my top 3 favorite books!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. Golden has created a very nice story. He depicts a little understood group of Japanese women, providing a detailed insight into their mysterious society. As a way to view a culture one may be curious about, the book is very good. I know little about Japanese or geisha culture, so I cannot vouch for the story's authenticity, but Golden seems have a solid background in the area, and although a reader should probably, as many warn, be careful to avoid generalizing to Japanese populations as a whole, the view into the life of a typical geisha seems reliable. This is the main way I liked the book-an vivid picture of a fascinating group of people. As for the story itself, there are probably better books written on the same subject. Although it read fairly fast, I couldn't stop comparing the sometimes over-flowery language to Jane Eyre. The story, with the beloved heroine being wronged by everyone around her, but eventually coming out on top, was also similar. Towards the end, the book fell apart. Golden doesn't seem to have planned an ending; rather, it seems like around page 420 he decided he wanted to stop writing, and ended the story as quickly as he could, leaving loose ends, and an improbable and unfitting conclusion."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Don't believe the hype on this one. This novel reads like it was written by a North American man trying to imitate Danielle Steele. The heroine remains devoted to a man who gave her a handkerchief; she betrays the man who truly loves her; she sees men only as instruments to her own ends. She comes across as a vacuous shallow person and she's one of the better written characters. Don't waste your time with this book - there must be better ways to learn about Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's not the worst book I've ever read but still, I did not like it at all. I did not care at all for the main character. I found her to be totally materialistic and incompetent and totally narrow minded. I wanted to choke her. The minor characters I found more enjoyable to read about... Pumpkin (as she grew up to be crass and blunt I totally enjoyed every page she was in), Nobu (great character who wasted his time on stupid main character) and even the \\"bad girl\\" Hatsumomo (there's usually always that enemy role in a book right?)... at least she had life in her even when her evil deeds made her have that stereotypical bad girl role. All the talk of Kimonos and various makeup and the whole \\"Chairman this\\" and \\"Chairman that\\" and everything just made me roll my eyes. This girl knows nothing of importance but that chairman. I just wanted to say, Just STFU already and slap her so she can get back to reality. I couldn't stand the main character. I did not feel any \\"heart\\" in her at all"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is not a bad book. Arthur Golden knows his stuff, and the Japanese culture jumps out from the pages. The book starts out well -- little Chiyo is sold by her father to the Nitta okiya, where she struggles to live with a sadistic housemate named Hatsumomo, and also to become reunited with her sister, who's been sent somewhere else in the district. This first part of the book is filled with a good forward plot and plenty of emotion.But after that, things settle down. From then on, the only things that push the book forward have to do with selling her virginity, becoming adopted by the Mother of the okiya, and basically earning approval among men. Golden gets caught up in describing everything single about geisha life, and it's TOO MUCH! Descriptions down to the color of thread of the different kimono every night. After first trying to visualize these kimono, I gave up and skipped over the descriptions. Too tiring. I want a story. Also, the entire book is based around conversation; so much so that I found Sayuri (Chiyo) to be overcome by dialogue and appear 1-dimesional. It's also peppered with meaningless metaphors, such as \\"I could no more have stopped myself from feeling sadness than you could stop yourself from smelling an apple that has been cut open on the table.\\" What the heck?I struggled to finish this. The only thing that kept me going was Sayuri's odd attraction to the Chairman. Golden's writing is great if you want a history lesson, but I wanted to learn and then get on with the plot!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"While Mr. Golden's prose holds up pretty well after 400+ pages, the story of Chiyo/Sayuri, the geisha, does not. For a memoir (fictional or not) to be worthwhile, the subject must have led an interesting life. While the portrait of the geisha 'trade' and life in Japan during the period treated is certainly interesting, the experiences of our heroine are pretty dull.Yes, there are personal rivalries, power grabs, and lots of emotion. But frankly, other than the unorthodox setting (the Gion district of Kyoto), there's nothing compelling about this story. After 250 pages it dawned on me that geisha are, in fact, prostitutes (consider the relationship between a geisha and her 'danna') despite everyone's claims that there is somehow something more subtle and nuanced about their profession.Left me disappointed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"...Meaning, I am not enamored of this book. It was overlong, silly, poorly written, repetitive, it had cardboard characters, and was nothing but a soap opera which happened to be set in early 20th-century Japan. To top it off, the sex scenes were gruesome and boring.I was hoping this book was better than the movie (which I saw first), but it wasn't. Also, why glorify the lives of women who were basically just high-priced prostitutes, who sold their virginity and selves to the highest bidder?Real Japanese culture could never be as dull as this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Acceptance. Companionship. Conversation. All of us--men and women alike--yearn for these things in our lives, though they are elusive and our experience of them can be fleeting.In Arthur Golden's debut novel Memoirs of a Geisha (1999), we are let into a geisha's perspective on the Japanese men of means who pay for even very brief experiences of these things. In the West, our first thought when we hear the word geisha might be of prostitution. Yet, Golden's story of Nitta Sayuri, one of Japan's most celebrated geisha, presents a world far more complicated than that.Nitta is a young girl from a poor fishing village who is sold into slavery in 1929 to a renowned geisha house in Kyoto. She is nine years' old. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion--the geisha district of Kyoto--with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists' streets.There she learns the arts of a geisha--dance and music, wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair, pouring sake to reveal the inner wrist. These are arts as much as they are forms of seduction and business details. She also competes with a jealous rival for men's attention and the money that goes with it. Acceptance, companionship, and conversation are commodities for sale in a highly stylized business setting, and there's an eager market willing to pay for these things.In itself the geishas house is a cultural norm as well as a culture's acknowledgment that ordinary life is not fulfilling. Of course, this is a world in which daughters are sold--sold--into the business of companionship. The spiritual emptiness of ordinarysociety that is embodied in the very existence of the geisha house pales in comparison to the truth of abandonment that helpless young girls such as Nitta experience. Perhaps she, too, welcomes the artifice of her world as a relief from this awful truth.Nitta with her unusual blue-grey eyes is beautiful beyond compare, and her beauty serves her well in a world where appearances are everything; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love, always elusive, is scorned as illusion.As World War II erupts and the geisha houses are forced to close, Sayuri, with little money and even less food, must reinvent herself to find freedom on her own terms.Memoirs is a story of the hunger of the heart. The novel compels the reader to think how our basic human needs to be accepted by someone--sometimes anyone--are very often not met in our day-to-day worlds. In this way, Memoirs can be read as a tragedy. On the other hand, the fact that Nitta can and does reinvent herself--and give voice to a story that is both unique and universal--makes this a story of hope."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this for book club and can I say I just love this book. I didn't know what a geisha was and this explained things to me. I felt really sad that so many young girls where taken from their families and some where treated good but some where treated badly. I felt like I knew exactly what this girl was going through and the saying what comes around goes around was true for Hatsummomo. I felt chiyo/sayuri how she felt her love for the chairman. Can't wait to see the movie amd compare to the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I absolutely love this novel. Being obsessed with Japanese culture and having been to Japan myself, I gobbled it up in instants. The imagery is imaginative and poignant, the story stays with you for months, and you are left only wanting more. You are taken on the journey with the main character-not observing her journey-which is underscored by its \\"memoir\\" format.However, there are a few reasons why it did not get a full five stars even though it is one of my favorite books.First off, it did not truly make me think. It was a wonderful story and filled my head with a lot of new information, but it seemed to be missing a universal message. Sure it does tell us the merits of determination and always pushing forward, but it was not anything new to me.Then there were the similes and metaphors. Boy were there similes and metaphors. It felt as if there were two on each page and they began to get cumbersome about half-way through the book. While figurative language is beautiful, it does get to a point where it is overdone. I just felt there are other ways to paint a picture.While I may have seemed to have focused on the negatives, I must point out that these are the only negatives. The overall \\"amazingness\\" of the story overshadows any shortcomings. I got to learn about a specific part of Japanese culture I knew little about while being captivated by a fantastic journey.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is a real page turner, riveting. the movie was slow, beautiful visually though.

It's a beautifully written book with a lot of detail and culture infused into it. The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because the ending was too rushed for me.

Otherwise, it's definitely still worth reading and I do consider it to be one of my favorites even with that flaw!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What a life! What a culture! What an author! This book is amazing. You will be thinking about this story long after you have put down the book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book started off brilliantly but I must say the one thing that made me upset was the book pretends to have a real translator's note which leads you to believe the book is non-fiction. It isn't real but it was very well written and after reading a few chapters I knew at once that the author had help from a true Geisha. I found things in the story that I could tell were true Japanese and helped me understand some of the actions of my Japanese friends.Japanese humor for one was something I never quite connected with unless I was sitting with the person. Their faces may not make many expressions but they have a way of looking at you to show that they are being silly. How amusing it is to see someone making a joke and using his or her face as the punch line. This is only part of understanding their culture but it made me realize something in my own culture, we never put ourselves in debt for someone's effort.Without giving away too much of the story, it's about a girl who gets sold into slavery but in a way it's much better than the life she would have led without it. It goes through a journey of her explaining not only her life but also the way fate is involved in everyone's life. If you've ever felt depressed or in a situation you simply could not get out of, then you can relate to this story. It's not an easy story to stomach but I recommend this to all adult readers."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Well, I understand why they picked this up as a movie now. I received this book as a gift and have to say I was a bit disappointed. The story was captivating, really...but also a bit contrived. It was not especially well written. I continued to read it only to find out if it ended how I though it might...and it did. Perfect for a box-office hit!To be fair, Golden did an amazing job with his research. I am not an expert on pre-WWII Geishas, but the details felt authentic, and I did learn a thing of two about this fascinating culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the very first line, I was hooked and immediately transported back to the early 1900's in Japan. The attention to detail is so captivating. My eyes were opened to a culture I knew very little and gave me a desire to learn more. As a mother of 3 young boys, you can imagine how difficult it is to find time to read. Each night, after I put the boys to bed, I began reading. I finished the book in 3 days. Author Golden is truly graceful and poetic writer. I would gladly read anything he writes."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What a lyrical and beautiful book. Honestly, I mostly read non-fiction but I was swept away by this story. It felt so real and the characters completely captivated me. It makes complete sense why so many people have loved this book. I believe it will have an impact on anyone who picks it up. The setting was almost mythical in its feel. I could sense the foggy winters and perfect springs. I think a novel should transport the reader to another world and present characters who the reader can really relate to, whether they be contemporary or ancient. This book did just that. This is really a 5 star effort.I look forward to reading more of Arthur Golden's books, although it will be hard to top this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The mark of a truly remarkable book is wanting to read it again and again. I have read, and re-read, Memoirs of a Geisha over and over. Whenever I have an especially long train ride to face, I bring along my battered, dog-eared copy. Opening the book to any page transports me back to the beautiful and exotic world of Sayuri, richly pained by Arthur Golden. I know that there has been a lot of friction recently over whether the stories in this book were true or not. I believe that the author's intent was merely to provide a historically-based character of FICTION...and that Sayuri is merely a combination of hundreds of geisha that lived in Kyoto over generations. Regardless,the book is a fascinating, uplifting, wondrous journey that I simply adore and recommend to a new person almost every day. If you have not yet discovered &quot;Geisha&quot; - do NOT waste another day. This is, quite simply, one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of those books that you remember long after you've read it, and then when you see it on the shelf have to read it again. Once you start reading, it sucks you in and you can't put it down. It holds true to the japanese culture, to the poetic style of writing that you can find in many modern Japanese works -- the descriptions of the sea, or of a tree seems to hold true to the way a geisha might think. Although as for the characters, it might have been nice to know more about some of the more influential people in the book (I thought they would clarify Hatsumomo a bit more).It's beautiful, and I learned a lot from reading it.

I could not put this book down and did not mind some sleep deprivation in order to finish it as soon as possible.Sure, this wonderful effort will not win a Nobel Prize for literature, but Mr. Golden's novel is a close second to Tanazaki's &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; (another must read).Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"For anyone who has the slighest interest in Japan, the history of it or Geisha's, this book is fabulous.

Every page was filled with beautiful detail and language. Chapter after chapter continues this journey of a young girl becoming a woman. It's possible to read 4 or more chapters in just one sitting; I know I did. Don't be surprised if an hour or so goes by and you're still reading, because the plot just captivates you.

It shows the inner and outer struggle of a girl that justs wants to survive. Its shows her progressing from a young child to a women, and it talks about the role she is forced to play.

It made me cherish the life I'm living now. I want to thank Arthur Golden for taking me somewhere I've never been berofe, Japan. Also, to thank him for inventing such real characters that are very remarkable, and how they each beautifully symbolize something. I felt cruelty of life each time it took me away from the book, for I never wanted to stop reading it. I wish that everyone who can should experience the pleasure of the book as I did. I recommend it to every adult."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found the book to be amazing and fascinating. What started out as just another Lit assignment, left me mesmorized. I spent the first half of the book thinking it was non fiction. Arthur Golden's tale is just too emotional and detailed to be fiction. I highly recommend this read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What makes this book so special is how richly it reveals details of the characters lives. Subtle details which create a vivid sense of time and place create for the reader a rich tapestry of places, people and culture. The story is fascinating, at times cruel and tragic, but very readable. If you are interested in Japan, it is a must. For others, it is worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was very well written, never boring. I read it quickly, and enjoyed it thoroughly. It seems to have been very well researched. The details lend a realism to the story that makes it difficult to believe it's not an autobiography. The characters are so real. The author does an excellent job of contrasting what seems on the surface to be a privileged life with the darker, sadder side of geisha life. It is as much the reality of Geisha that they are pampered, privileged, and respected, as it is that they are bought and sold, and lack ultimate control over their own lives. But throughout the story we learn, as Sayuri is learning, that there are means for gaining control over one's life and destiny. Such means require wit and cunning. Learning such means is the art of Geisha as much as tea ceremony, or any other craft."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought this was a great book and definitly would recommend it. It transports you to Japan in a time not too long ago, but so culturally different you'd think it was a different world. Very easy to read, the kind of book you can't put down. A few forced metaphors but all in all a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This story was awesome! I didn't put this one down.

It shows how different Sayuri's world was and at the same time how similar to ours...I would give it 6 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book took hold of me at once and never let me go. It's the story of Sayuri, a girl from a poor fishing town sold by her desperate father who ends up one of the most prominent geishas of Japan before, during, and after World War II. The story is told as the recounting of Sayuri's memoirs by a New York University history professor.Sayuri's world is a world where young children are bought and sold, a woman's virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder, and people's lives go unacknowledged lest the illegimate birth cause \\"complications\\". Sayuri simply must agree to what her elders and rich benefactors decide.Therefore, to have any \\"choice\\" in this world, a geisha must resort to subtle manipulation and hidden agendas and that is the strength of the story. Sayuri learns these ropes from her geisha mentor Mameha, herself a prominent geisha, before plotting a course for her own life. Sure, Sayuri is a little vain and cunning, but those are indeed important qualities for a great geisha to have.The story is a little neat and convenient, but this book is more about the world of geishas and how one geisha skillfully copes with this world. And Golden expertly draws the reader into this world."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Just didn't do it for me.Romantic story? I don't find old desperate men swooning over a girl who's paid to be with them particularly enchanting..Evidently Geisha's become skilled at the art of manipulating people... particularly men... in order to get what they want. The best are described as skilled conversationalists.... at least in in the genre of locker room gossip stories.Its difficult to sympathize with the so called heroine in any way... from willing to sleep with the minister to get what she wants (or doesn't) ... to a lack of recognition that her sister worked as a prostitute... to her materialistic preoccupation for her clothing, kimono's and appearance. Supposed to be a happy ending, but I feel sorry for her...Admittedly, the Japanese perspective and conditions during the 2nd world war was interesting at times ... and there is some value put on knowing what a Giesha really is. Overall, I slogged through the whole book, rarely interested in reading the next page."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is an insider's look at Kyoto's famed pleasure quarter, Gion, and the geisha who make their living there. It is based on the life of Nitta Sayuri, who rose from rural obscurity in pre-war Japan to the life of expatriate socialite ensconced in a suite in the Waldorf Towers in Manhattan. American Arthur Golden retells the story of how Sayuri is sold with her sister into Kyoto's legendary \\"water world\\" of the night.Following the premature death of her mother, Sayuri's fisherman father feels he has no choice but to sell his daughters. There begins a journey that will change her life forever. Her less attractive sister is consigned to a low ranking brothel; Sayuri, after many fits and starts, becomes the most sought after geisha in all of Gion. Golden tells her story of exploitation and enchantment, power and the abuse thereof, in a flowing and lyrical style."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Personally, I'm more of a visual based learner. When it comes donw to stories, I like them being shown to me rather than told cause language has nuances and you can describe something that might completely fly by somebody's head but with visuals it's simple and to the point. But this book was surprisingly addictive as I finished the book in record time(for me at least).Chiyo is a young girl living with her sick mother, and teenage sister and father. Soon the parents get too sick to look after the girls so they're \\"adopted\\": Chiyo's sister Satsu by a brothel and Chiyo into a geisha house. Geisha's are not the japanese equivalent of a prostitute, but they're called artists. Think of them as more like educated mistresses. And we follow her story as she goes through some really tough spots, a bitter rival and having her virginity up for sale.That last part is a part of a geisha's career. In one paragraph, Chiyo(later renamed Suruyi)'s mentor/friend Mameho tells her that men like to have sex, even some who do nothing but figure out how to have it again. And it's very special and important if a girl's virginity hasn't been taken yet and that event is called a mazouage(or something, forgot spelling). She uses the metaphor of an eel and a cave. The eel likes it if the cave was unexplored so to speak. It's a really curious part in the book when she uses it because it's not even erotic or memorable the way it's written. Even Chiyo has an attitude of \\"that was it? all that money and interest in that?\\"The characters are nicely written. One that I was glad popped up now and then was Pumpkin, Chiyo's friend in the okiya(\\"geisha house\\"). It gives Chiyo an opportunity to have experiences that can be shared with someone else. Chiyo is well-developed and I actually felt sorry for her since this was her world basically. Matsumomo, Chiyo's rival, on the other hand is well-written and certainly a b**** but other than the fact she doesn't want a rival, she's not that fully developed.This was certainly a surprising book since I only got this because the store didn't have any of the Sin City books but wow, I finished it in 2 days. Even Anna Karenina, one of my favorite books, was finished in a week. May be longer than 2 days for you but it certainly caught me off guard."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After hearing and reading nothing but wonderful reviews of this book, I purchased it second hand and began reading right away. The author quickly envelops the reader into Japanese society and customs circa 1920s. While at time the poetry of the author's writing style can get a bit long, it enrichens the book as a whole. I found myself staying up until 4am flipping through page after page wondering who would be her danna, what would happen with Hatmumomo,and how she climbed her way to be a respected geisha. This is clearly a book that needs to be read before the movie is released and I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys Japanese culture and history. If I ever I visit Japan and see a geisha, I'll instantly think of Sayuri."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My awareness of Japanese culture and more particularly the secretive lives of the Geishas is next to nil. Yet, this carefully crafted book manages to provide a well laid out plot of fictional ingenuity which is fascinating and enthralling.Picked up the book after hearing a lot about it.

More to notice is the choice of words and stylisation which brings out the colors of Japan in all vivid hues.Great work."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An exciting, tantalizing, erotic and enchanting saga of a girl with beautiful eyes. The story revolves around her exotic eyes which mesmerize, galvanize the beholder and eventually open all doors for her happiness. Chiyo-Chan, shy, insecure country bumpkin, who was sold by her father when she was six years old metamorphoses into a beautiful Geisha, Nitta sayuri. It is a tale of making of a Geisha, well researched, taking us into far corners of this mysterious, forbidden world. In the end we come out quiet satisfied and yearning for more. We learn all about rivalries, infighting, vying for patrons, bidding for mizuage, tea house parties, intricate details of garments they wore, and of course those gorgeous kimonos.Chiyo- Chan comes a long way from a tipsy house on a mountain top in remote town in Japan to Waldorf Astoria on chic Park Ave. In New York. She encounters numerous hurdles, beginning with separation from her sister to sustaining cruelties of a jealous, petty, resident geisha, Hatsumomo, to various men in her exciting, exotic geisha life.

Forced into becoming one because of her beauty, she learns the arts of a geisha and how to captivate men, like revealing just a touch of the inner wrist while pouring tea. In a world fraught by jealousy and hatred, plotting and scheming, Sayuri learns to survive especially from her jealous rival Hatsumomo who lives at the same okiya. She is not very much different from a doll that is sought after by men, has her virginity sold to the highest bidder and is not allowed to make any decisions except what kimono she is to wear. It is a beautifully written tale thats described richly in detail, so you feel as if Sayuri is taking you through a tour of her life. There is so much more meaning interwoven amongst the words, that would be lost if you just read it for what it is on the surface.Reading it more than once is definately recommended to pick up on the nuances and hidden meanings."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book provides an in depth look into geisha culture, while also entertaining you with a great story.

I read the entire book then read about the author. It is shocking to me that it is written by a man. The detail that went into describing what Chiyo is going through I thought could have only been told by a woman. Was I ever wrong!This book is going to be a classic. Meaning that I know one day I'll have a daughter and grand-daughter that will read it. I bought the first copy in paperback and went back to get the hard cover. It's not one that I want to sell or trade at the used book store.I too thought I knew what a &quot;geishas&quot; life was like. History did not educate us. The lifestyle that you read in this book, makes our every day lives seem planets away.I didn't mind paragraphs starting off &quot;If you don't know......&quot; I actually was so mesmerized I didn't even notice.I would love if the author would write a follow up. I want to know what happened later for Chiyo. Then again when Gone with the Wind was followed up by Scarlett it was ruined.

Elaborate descriptions of Geisha and their way of life. 2.) The effect of WW-II and economic depression on Japan. 3.)

Iwasaki claimed that she welcomes Golden with open arms and explained to him about the world of Geisha off the records. However, Arthur published this book not long after. I have seriously and thoroughly enjoyed the book. It has thought me about the ways, hardships, and gave me understanding about the Geisha clan. Iwasaki also mentioned in the article that Golden had painted wrong pictures of Geishas to readers. I, however, found the book has thought me to think of Geisha in new light and also brighter light. Though the figures in the book are made up, the settings of the Geisha clan and the ways of Geisha are well carried across to readers. The main character, Nitta Sayuri aka Chiyo-san, was a strong character and with lots of quality that one can admire and develop respect for."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book provided a fascinating account of a very unique part of the Japanese culture - that of the Geisha. It provided vivid detail about lives of Geishas that were hard, peculiar, manipulative (to the extreme), bazaar, exotic and stunningly beautiful at the same time. It certainly sparked a keen interest in me about the rich and contrived Japanese culture.I was partly intrigued and partly disappointed at the author's almost stereotypical treatment of some of the material. This characteristic is particularly apparent in the author's depiction of men. The men in this book were either God-like figures with heavenly appearances that spark armor or strange looking creatures whose peculiar physical treats and personalities invoked disgust. The portrayals of many of the geishas in this book were less apparent but equally simplistic. They were either stunningly exquisite or ugly in some ways to the extent of grotesque. To me, such drastic depiction of most of the characters in the book borders on exaggeration and compromises believability of the work. I cannot help but wondering whether there were hidden messages in such treatment that eluded me.The vast account of the details of the main character, Sayuri's life as a geisha revealed the extensive research behind the work. It is remarkable for a Western scholar to amass such rich and in-depth material about any aspect of a foreign culture, let along that of the highly secretive lives of geishas. But the construction of the characters in this book also was plagued by simplicity and stereotype. The author spent most effort to create the inner world of the Character Sayuri. But even this character felt, thought, and behaved almost the same when she was about nine or ten as when she became an adult. You cannot really tell how she progressed psychologically throughout the book. The rest of the characters turned out as contrived as puppet in a puppet show. Hustumomo was depicted as the master of menace, cruelty and manipulation. Mameha, a near saint with all the right connections. Mother, the Japanese version of a shrewd miser with all the typical heartlessness and gross looks. Every character carried a message without any depiction of a matching inner-world in this book. As a result, these characters turned out to be merely two-dimensional and had a hard time to convince me that they were actual real people that lived as geishas. Without constructing their complexity as human beings, the book failed to bring them alive. They appeared just like the geishas when they put on their mask. You cannot tell what they were, how they looked. They were fakes.Maybe that is exactly what the author tried to convey. Maybe that is the hidden message that I missed. But as a person who was raised in another Asian culture, I expect a lot more subtlety and complexity than the book was able to deliver."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha's strengths are its story and the window it opens on the world of the geisha, which is fascinating.

The story is rich in detail but leaves enough to the imagination (the racy parts were especially good at this). Its Western form and stilted English dialogue remind me of period pieces from the Victorian Era; its narrative flow is Japanese enough to evoke that contemplative Eastern way of thinking. I sympathized with Sayuri's helplessness but also admired her way of handling her situation. She sometimes seemed like a reworked version of a dumb blonde (if you're looking for a novel about female empowerment, this definitely isn't it), but I suppose that's what happens when your specialty is entertaining men at parties...(Warning: a small spoiler?)When I first read this in high school, I had gripes with the ending, like many people do.

I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book a year ago and ive been obsessed since the book is stunning i couldnt believe that a man (a young one at that!) could write like this it was astounding! this book is one of the best books i have ever read i found my copy at a second hand book shop down south and when i got back home i had to buy the hardcover i also bought liza dalby's book &quot;geisha&quot; and it was also very good but could not compare to &quot;memoirs&quot; i also bought a large book of pictures also the name escapes me though ? this book is a classic and will be loved for many years to come my favourite chapter by far would have be 27 it had such an eerie feel to it....but it was a great book and i hope everyone will enjoy as much as i did"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Of course this book lives up to the reviews it has received - both from popular media as well as personal recommendations. It is a story of a particular life, and in it, a story of life. The Japanese way of looking at things - or rather, the author's rendition of the Japanese way of looking at things - is striking. Remarkable in that it is written by an American male born in 1957; unusual in its choice of narrator, especially for the pre- and post-war period it covers; sensitive; told without judgment; universal in its pull toward the unknowable: What is my destiny? How is it that my destiny is fulfilled? Why do some people seem to achieve theirs, most others don't? Why is there so much pain in achieving one's destiny?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was not only enjoyable to read, but educational. It tought me about a culture and a time I will never get to experience."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Nitta Sayori was sent away by her sick parents to an Okiya (Geisha House) in the district of Gion. Her older &quot;sister&quot; Hatsumomo is causing her lots of trouble, and is trying to force Sayori away. Sayori finally becomes the apprentice of a great Geisha, and a enemy of Hatsumomo. Together they drive Hatsumomo away from the Okiya, and Sayori is fanally free of her suffering, and becomes one of the greatest Geisha in Japan's history. This novel is an exiting, romantic, adventurous novel. It always leaves you wanting more. Golden does a great job showing the life of a Geisha living in the 1940's. You will feel as if you where almost there. Above all this is true story, which makes the tale even more moving."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have read some of the negative reviews preceding this one and they seem to be cliche reactions of western readers trying to understand one aspect of Japanese culture. I am by no means an expert on Japanese culture, but I am familiar enough with Asian thought and practise to understand that this provides an accurate description of life as a geisha. I noticed that one reviewer was concerned that the word love was never mentioned in the book - I don't know how much more ethnocentric (and dogmatic) you could be. Just because the subject matter is different and somewhat alien to most western readers doesn't discredit the work. In fact, I was quite impressed with the subtlety and accuracy in which it was presented."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden's novel provides a detailed description of the life of a geisha, opening the door on an aspect of Japanese culture I knew nothing about. His descriptions are crisp and his writing style is often poetic. As such, readers will no doubt find it a fascinating and flowing adventure into a different world. The journey is made through the eyes of the female protagonist, Sayuri, who is recounting how she came to be a geisha. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to become emotionally involved with the characters, especially Sayuri. While I would have to reread the novel to give it an informed feminist reading, my casual reader response was one of offense. Sayuri's character lacks the nuances of a woman's perspective, and as such her character remains flat. For example, while Sayuri spends much of her time dwelling on a man she doesn't know (waiting to be saved by him), the demise of her family, the loss of her sister, is quickly explained, dismissed, and left emotionally unexplored. Further, for a novel so centered on a community of women oppressed by a male culture, the lack of any authentic female bonding being honestly conveyed is a critical flaw. The memoir narrative style may serve as an explanation for a certain emotional detachment that holds the listener/reader at a distance, but, because this is a world foreign to most readers, more emotional resonance was needed to give the story lasting impact."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm going to write a rather short, to the point review here. I don't feel comfortable writing the kind of review that breaks down a book into technicalities, because I don't think reading a review of that nature is very helpful.I've had a keen interest in geishas most of my life. I'm not really sure when it started, but I always found the concept rather fascinating. As I grew older, I began to realize how skewed the Western view of a geisha is, and that many people didn't equate them to anything more than a prostitute, which couldn't be farther from the truth!Though I've known about this novel since it's release, I only just picked it up on a whim. I'm really glad I did, it was a very enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to most people who are curious about geisha and their responsibilities and duties. I think that it rather inadvertently does a fabulous job of explaining this.Beyond that, this is - at the core - a love story. Not the kind of love story that I think easily qualifies as one. It's a love story at the core, but you find yourself focusing on so many other aspects of the story for the majority of the novel. There is so much heartache and suffering in this book, and yet you never find yourself feeling down, and every page you are still filled with hope for this wonderful character, and you want so much for her to succeed.Though this novel does include a lot of description on the life of a geisha, it's not like reading something technical, or reading something out of a history book. These details are cleverly presented in it's rightful place among story. Most of the characters are fascinating, and the story was wonderful, no matter how simple it was.My only complaint was that the end felt rather abrupt. Not to say that it wasn't a *good* ending, but you felt like a few more chapters would have done good to winding this story down. It was like building up a pot of water to a boil by keeping it on a slow, steady heat. And when it finally reaches a rapid boil, suddenly snapping off the heat and walking away, rather than letting anything simmer.All in all though, I still give this a 5 out of 5, because I found it really enjoyable."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of my most favorite books of all times. I believe it will one day be considered a classic. The author draws you in from the first sentence, and the book is hard to put down. However, as much as I loved this book, the ending is not my favorite. I believe the author goes against Sayuri's true character at the end of the book in her treatment of Nobu. Read the book and you will understand."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A truly fantastic book but it did take me a while to get into it. After the first 50 or so pages though I couldn't bare to put it down!

It really is a fascinating look into the life of a geisha. This was the first 'memoir' type book that I have read, and I honestly couldn't put it down! I can't wait for the movie to come out!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The beginning of this book seems borring for me but after awhile I really enjoyed read this book and couldn't stop myself to read it. The story inside this book can make you cry,happy, angry and curious at the same time. You really can't guess what is the end of the story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a wonderful book full of emotion and life journey. I loved the development of each charactor, but I felt the ending was a bit abbreviated. While reading it I found out that the movie is being released Dec-05, so I cannot wait to see it then. As for the book, I wish the story had continued a bit further. Great read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books. Although I do not normally take interest in learning about lifestyles and cultures around the world, I have to say this book has changed that. Before reading this book I thought that a Geisha was just a pretty Japanese woman in a pretty outfit. Wow....Not only was the story line in this book fantastic but I loved to learn the history and the way of life of the Geisha women. I am now on a quest to read other books that can offer as much without making me fall asleep. I highly recommend this book to anyone, male or female!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am not to one to enjoy books about culture but when starting this book i found i could not put it down! Arthur Golden tells the compelling story of a young girl ripped apart from her family and forced to live the life of a geisha against her wishes. This book introduces the reader into a whole new world that is fascinating. Arthur captivates the emotions and draws you into the characters life through the tragedies that this young girl endures."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This fiction is written in a style that makes you feel as if you are watching history unfold. Arthur has managed to use his years of Japanese history to adequately portray the young japanese spirit of a geisha. This story is amazing and is a must read that is impossible to put down once you begin on its magical journey. It is a tale of personal growth, and personal power. Life through the eyes of a geisha is a unique perspective you share as its reader."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was good because it presented the details of a geisha's life from the perspective of someone who actually lived the real deal.1. Reading Ease-- This book was light and the fact that it was 500 pages is made to seem more like it was 200 pages.2. Character development-- Again, excellent. Some of the remarks that the characters made in the book very witty and worth underlining/ keeping in memory. It is interesting how strong the characterizations were even with the limited narrator's point of view. There were no larger than life characters (see any Ayn Rand book for an example).3. Historical detail-- This, too was very good but not such that it made the book overwrought with detail. There are a few extras that he might have mentioned, such as the Japanese habit of using a person's name instead of \\"you\\" as a way of being less direct. And also the way of talking around things instead of coming straight to the point. I could also have done with a bit more detail as to *why* the okiya and the geisha were interdependent.All in all, a very good read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Once I started reading this story, I couldn't stop. It's about the life of a young Japanese girl named Chiyo, how she went from being raised in a small town called Yoroido by her old, depressed father to how she became a successful geisha they call &quot;Sayuri.&quot; Through her life she has found and lost friends, been manipulated and humiliated by Hatsumomo, the geisha as cruel and sneaky as a snake, you can experience her triumphant moments and cry with her through her tough times. The only people she really found trust in since she was literally torn away from her famiily was Pumpkin and Mameha, and the one true enemy would have to be Hatsumomo (she may be beautiful on the outside, but inside she's a horrible, nasty, evil creature). Nothing in this review will make sense to you if you've not read the book yourself, so read it, I highly recommend it, it's absolutely magnificent!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I admit that I didn't know much about the life of Japanese geisha during the first half of this century and this book provided minute details of every aspect of those girls' lives (true or false, I couldn't tell). However, I can't say that I could sympathize or even feel sorry for them for living the kind of life they were forced into. They were but a bunch of self-centered females whose main ambition in life is to rise to the highest level of their male-pleasing profession.This book (or rather this narration of events) documents the lives and &quot;hardships&quot; of geisha in their quest of learning the secrets of the trade and how to always be at the beck and call of their male &quot;customers&quot;.I don't think Mr. Golden succeeded in dispelling the notion that geisha are not girls working in the world's oldest profession.At the top of the list of things that I really hated about this book is the metaphors. It seems that Mr. Golden is unable to write a normal plain interesting sentence without inserting attention-distracting metaphors.I felt that the writer himself got tired of this work of fiction. How else would you explain his hurried closing chapters?A place among the best-seller list's top ten and almost 800 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars. If that's not over-rating, then I don't know what is. The lesson I learned after reading this bland and metaphor-infested documentary: never believe the best-seller list again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It reminded me of another boring soap opera with an extremely predictable ending. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As someone who lives in Japan, this book was an incredible lesson on the Japanese culture and history. The Geisha's life is perceived as a prostitute/mistress in American literature. I even discussed the book with my Japanese friends and they also learned many new things about the life of a Geisha in the middle 20th century.The story was very entertaining. Golden's descriptions were magical and I could see and smell the streets of the Kyoto region. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This year for my birthday, my wife gave me a fistful of cash and &quot;permission&quot; to spend it at my local bookstore. Eager to capitalize on her generosity, I grabbed up an armful of recent releases: &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; (John Irving), &quot;Charming Billy&quot; (Alice McDermott), &quot;Bear and His Daughter&quot; (Robert Stone), &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; (Arundhati Roy) and &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot; Admittedly, Arthur Golden's novel was the one I was least looking forward to reading, since Oriental culture does not hold a big appeal for me. I set &quot;Memoirs&quot; at the bottom of the stack and read other things. However, once I got around to Golden's tale of a Japanese girl rising from Dickensian circumstances to become a star geisha, I was hooked. Golden's prose is...well, golden. He packs his language with compressed metaphors that go right from the page, through your eyes, into your brain and on down to your heart. Consider, for instance, these sentences: &quot;He was quite a peculiar-looking man. In one corner of his mouth was a giant mole like a piece of food, and his eyebrows were so bushy they looked like caterpillars that had crawled down out of his hair and gone to sleep there.&quot; &quot;Memoirs&quot; is filled with beautiful language like that. While I agree with some other reviewers that the pace of the novel sags a little at the end, if you hold on and stay to the last page, you'll be rewarded with one of the finest closing paragraphs in recent literary history."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had heard a lot about this book. From the public, I heard nothing but good things. From my mom, she said drastically overrated. So I read for myself. &lt;insert a HUGE yawn here&gt; The characters had about as much flavor as water, and they could quench anything. This sort of thing happens all the time in any country. Don't waste your time. Read a Japenese business strategy book before this one. Moral: Always listen to Mom!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had read/heard a lot about this book. As with most books that are heavily 'hyped'....it failed to be as good as expected. The main character, Sayuri, is quite self-centred....those around her share this characteristic....and they ALL seemed to be bent on 'getting' each other....why this is interesting I have NO idea. It occurs in ALL cultures...has since the beginning of time...and will continue to DO so. Give it a miss. You'll likely do better reading something ELSE about Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although I had the thought of &quot;Memoirs,&quot; as being a true story while I was reading, I kept doubting it each time I read a section. This book may of disappointed a lot of people, but overall I think it was quite enjoyable for the most part. I've read so many reviews, but I think people aren't giving it enough credit. It was surprising that Arthur Golden could write from a girl's to a woman's point of view so well. I thought it almost unbelievable, but that's what you would call a regular writer. I loved the metaphors and descriptions. I truly believed I was there. Maybe people with a more understanding of Japanese culture didn't exactly think everything was true, but who is Golden trying to gain attention from? The Japanese culture majors or the regular reading people. You have to understand that's why its been on the best book reading lists for a long time. But the reason I'm giving it four stars isn't because how well the book was written but how disappointed I was at the end. I was made to believe that this woman, Sayuri had a totally different purpose and would understand that life wasn't always perfect, however her life was made to be exactly that. It seemed like a fairytale at some point because everthing that happened to her was &quot;perfect.&quot; I don't know if this was his intention of writing to the readers to make them believe that there are happy endings and fairytale stories in this world, but this was part of the reason I knew it was false. The end did make you want to say, &quot;this is it,&quot; because it truly didn't sum up the book if you ask me. To sum up my review I thought this book was good and I do suggest people read it and gain their own opinion of it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book kept me engrossed to the end. I could not put it down; stayed up all night reading. A wonderful insight into the life of geisha. I could almost feel the pain and hardship of Sayuri. She seemed so real, it was hard to remember that the book was fiction. Wish the ending had been as rich and detailed as the rest of the book. Overall, it was great!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found myself experiencing many emotions as I read MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA. There is great value in learning about other cultures and by studying occupations that do not exist in your own country. The challenge is to keep an open mind, not to get caught up in the misconceptions and disbeliefs in our own traditions. I kept remembering anecdotes and examples in THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION about the problems that traditions, disbeliefs and misconceptions cause. We are fortunate to live in a society where flexibility and change are considered good and where books like THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION are valued for teaching how to identify our &quot;stalls&quot; and make rapid progress, both personally and in business. And yet, I found myself in awe of the training , arts, self-control and social skills that geishas must learn. There is beauty in some of that tradition that we would do well to remember. Combining some of these skills with today's knowledge of achieving the best possible practices for important activities would help us improve both business and society."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Like most Westerners, my impression of &quot;Geisha Girls&quot; was a demeaning one.

I love learning about other cultures outside of my own and this book brought me into another world that I may have never known otherwise."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"For someone who knew a little about Japanese culture, it was very informative and kept me interested. The book was written in such a way that read like a autobiography which made it seem all the more real."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book really put me into the time of Saturi's life. I too found myself believing that Sayuri's story was that of a real person. I never before had interest in the geisha life, but this book sparked my interest and held it until the end. A great work of fiction!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden has hit pay dirt with this masterpiece. An insightful, curious, and caring look into the mysterious world of geisha, Arthur Golden peels away the ignorance and labeling that westerners have covered the secretive Japanese profession. Although it sinks at times into a near melodramatic prose, the book's protagonist is interesting, insightful, and enjoyable. Her witty anecdotes and thoughtful mannerisms in speaking make Memoirs of a Geisha a delightful and unstoppable read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"First off, alot of you gotta lighten up, no book is as bad as some of you are saying this is, thats just ridiculous, I mean come on,your acting like its the downfall of society,lighten up.I'm not trying to tell you how to think or what to do , just telling you how i feel, despite how little you care, besides theres no such thing as a bad book its just not your style. Anyway...I enjoyed Memoirs of a Geisha very much. It didn't really fit into any common genres like horror, mystery or suspense, it was just a good story, and I sometimes have trouble finding books like that.It was fiction so obviously not all compleletly acurate, but since he spent so many years researching Geisha i'm sure its valid enough(though obviously not valid enough for some). I'd get so involved into the story itself,I became attached to characters or ( I know this sounds dumb)even took sides with them. All in all it was a very good book and I'd definitly recomend it to someone. Especially if their into asian culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book hooked me from the beginning. Golden writes with a very elegant style that's very well suited for a story of this type. However, the plot was just too convenient, especially the cutesy neat ending that reminded me too much of those dandy Japanese packaging."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a fantastic book- I finished it in a day and a half.

I had trouble putting it down. The life of a Geisha always seemed so interesting to me and it shed light on the stereotype. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A lot of effort went into this novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was difficult to put down at times."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is very good. Golden brings to life a world where a girl is virtually a slave, existing only to entertain men and be as popular as possible. Although it does not give the reader a very good idea of general life in Japan at the time, the world of the geisha is vivid.It is a story about a girl named Chiyo, who later takes the geisha name of Sayuri. She is sold to be a geisha by a family aquaintance, without her knowledge or consent. Most of the story is about her earliest years of a geisha, and how she deals with the enmity of an older geisha, Hatsumomo. Hatsumomo almost puts an end to her career, but a rival of Hatsumomo saves Chiyo and trains her to be a great geisha.This book is a page turner, and Chiyo is a sympathetic character for most of the story. The first half of the book is wonderful, but it begins to go downhill later on. The writing is excellent all the way through, but the story loses momentum. After Chiyo's nemesis causes her own ruin, there is nothing driving the story except for Chiyo's love for the Chairman, who she barely knows.While she makes a charming child, Chiyo never really grows up, and we don't see her as being as cunning as a mature geisha seems to have to have been. The ending was also a disappointment. It was very fairy-tale style. I won't say more because I don't want to ruin it for you.This book is definitely recommended. Despite a few flaws, it really is a well-told, well-written story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I love everything about this book: the storyline, the characters, the cultural setup, the writing style...I'm not going to make any detailed comments because I think you should read it first.It's definitely one of those books that you just can't wait to see the ending of and yet don't want it to end so soon."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Why is a middle aged white guy from New England writing about a young, Japanese Geisha during WWII? About 1/4 of the way through the book this conflict becomes painfully obvious by the stagnent, docile, stereotypical over-emotional female reactions that Golden burdens his character with.Why doesn't Chiyo ever give her opinion? She couldn't possibly be that ambivalent towards the U.S. bombing her country to smithareens. Her character is built up to a woman who perseveres, fights for glory, but then becomes a spineless tool when it matters.What is with the superficial, two dimensional relationship with the Chairman? It is not believable, and by the end of the novel I was shaking with rage at being cheated by this fluff.It's unfortunate that the ending was so idiotic - &quot;I'm wonderful, you're wonderful, everything is wonderful&quot;. That's a climax? What a let down.Nevertheless, I have to give it 3 stars. I could not put it down. If you are looking for a mind-numbing soap opera to fritter your days away, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I purchased this book from C.Vander Ven. The book was in good condition. It is a really good book that I have enjoyed reading immensely."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"No doubt about it, this is, by any standard, a book that excels through its sheer readability. Nothing could be more entertaining and engaging than Sayuri's struggle to survive as a geisha after being sold into slavery by her own father. We really care about this character, and that's the test of a good book. However, this book does have its problems, as others have noted. The main one seems to be an unfortunate difficulty that crops up over and over again when a male author tells a story through the viewpoint of a female protagonist. Namely, there's something fundamentally passive about Sayuri. Everything happens TO her, and everyone acts ON her. She never truly does anything except to react to what the other characters are doing. This is the same problem that marred Wally Lamb's &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; and Callie Khouri's &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; screenplay. A passive female character does seem more appropriate in &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; but it still gets annoying."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Thoroughly engaging historical novel (??) based on scholarly research and insights into Japanese culture you won't find anywhere. And you don't have to read it for all the interesting detail it contains-you can't help but read this book and learn what an erroneous stereotype most Westerners have of Geishas as some kind of prostitute-which, by the way, they are not.A great read, one I couldn't put down!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It was a little difficult to get into this book in the beginning, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down.

I,like many others, had my own &quot;little&quot; ideas about what a Geisha really was and what they really did. But after reading this book, I came away with a totally different opinion and understanding of thier lifestyle. I found it quite sad that most of the young Geishas really didn't have much of a choice in entering this world. That decision, for the most part was made by someone else seeking to gain from the surrending of a young girl into this world. It also amazed me that so much training at such a young age went into the making of a Geisha. Memoirs of a Geisha is a very fascinating read because you will both learn and enjoy at the same time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a wonderful story.

I have read many informative books on the subject of geisha, and this has been one of the most accurate accounts of their lifestyles.

Arthur Golden writes in beautiful detail about Sayuri's childhood home and her new surroundings in Kyoto. The author had a manner of writing that completely pulled me into the story and I felt as thought I was Sayuri's companion in her many adventures and could truly feel all her thoughts and emotions. From the book, I was surprised to learn how geisha lived their lives in fierce competition with each other and how they were so highly respected in society and even by family members. The love story in Memoirs of a Geisha between Sayuri and the Chairman was romantic at first but then it seemed to drag on for too long at the same pace that it became boring. As many other reviews have said, the first 3/4 of the book was very good but the last 1/4 was too &quot;Hollywood&quot; and left me with the feeling that the book, or at least the ending, could have been better. However, notwithstanding the ending, I would still highly recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A beautifully written novel. However, the lyrical nature of the text does not make up for the flawed plot - throughout most of the book she is &quot;in love&quot; or &quot;obsessed&quot; with one man that she had a chance encounter with when she was 10(?) years old...found it difficult to believe that she could carry a torch for so many years for someone she met once as a child.The item that really got me was her absolute betrayal of Nobu in the end. Yeah, she eventually got what she wanted, but she had to sell her soul to get it.All in all, I'd have to say the way she turns out in the end left me feeling a bit down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"One of THE best books I have ever read. A battle between wanting to read on and on, and not wanting it to be over. What is Golden's next story? Could absolutely visualize the characters in my mind and kept thinking &quot;this would make a great movie&quot; Can't wait for Speilberg to get moving on this project!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a lovely book full of colorful metaphors. I felt as though I was walking through life with young Chiyo/Sayuri. I learned a great deal about geishas through this story, and didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memiors of a geisha by Arthur S. Golden was an absolutely breathtaking and captivating piece.It captures you page after page in the life a geisha. The best part of the novel I would have to say is all of the detail that he puts into the piece. The detail makes you feel like you are right inside of the story and that you are not left with any questions on what is going on in the book.Also what is so captivating about the novel is that the whole story seems like a true account of a real giesha which makes you wan to read cover to cover on what will happen to her . On the whole it was beautiful piece that had suspense , passion , and wonderful detail all brought in to one great novel that once you start to read is very hard to put down ."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I can sum up Memoirs of a Geisha in a simple word: Breathtaking. I would literally hold my breath as I read every word, knowing that the next sentence would be even better than the last. I was amazed that a man, Arthur Golden, could so completly understand the complex inner workings of a woman as well as he did. There were times that I actually forgot that this was a work of fiction written by a historian. Instead I lost myself in a world so different from my own, yet still utterly captivating. I know that I'll be the first on line to buy Golden's next novel!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was fantastic. I've never seen the movie, and I'm glad I read the book first. It was so incredibly heartbreaking and beautiful. It's a must-read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was easy to read and kept me turning the pages.

I picked it up at the airport for a long trip. I could not put this book down. It was fantastic!!! Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't think I knew enough about Japanese culture, and this well-written, beautifully depictive novel certainly paints a picture that fills that void very well."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Honestly, this is one of my favorite books. I read it my senior year of college and neglected all of my academic work for a week because I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In Memoirs of a Geisha, by Arthur Golden is a story about a girl from Yoroido that is taken away from her mother and father. A man named Mr. Tanaka takes Chiyo and her older sister, Satsu, to Gion were they are sold to two different households. Satsu is sold to a \\"house of pleasure\\" and Chiyo is sold to an okiya, where she serves the geisha of the household. While living in the okiya, Chiyo serves Hatsumomo-san, the geisha of the house. She also receives harsh mistreatment from the geisha and is buried under a mountain of debts that the okiya must pay back. Soon, Mameha, Hatsumomo's rival, makes a deal with the head of the okiya. Mameha made a deal to teach Chiyo, renamed as Sayuri, a geisha's traditional education. After the lessons, Sayuri soon entertains at some of Kyoto's most elegant teahouses.This book was filled with sorrowful and interesting thoughts. This book was sad because Chiyo and Satsu were taken from their home in Yoroido and then separated from each other in Gion. This story was also sad when Satsu ran away without Chiyo when she fell off the roof. Another reason when this book was sad was when Chiyo received the news that both her parents were dead and that her sister was gone. When World War II started to become an event in the story the plot started to become sad. A part of the story that was interesting was when Mameha started to teach Sayuri how to become a geisha. The words that described the lessons and teahouse performances were some of the best parts to read. Overall this was a fascinating book to read. This book had interesting twists in the plot that I never would have foreseen. I thought this book was an example of Japanese entertainment, but it had an odd twist to the culture. Although I found it odd that a non-Asian man researched a geisha for several years and wrote a book about a piece of Asian culture. I suggest this book to mature females."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Absolutely fantastic. What could I possible add that others haven't already said? Everything good you have heard about Memoirs is true. It is unforgettable and extremely well done."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The author has an amazing way of describing the setting and how the characters are feeling. This book grabs you from the moment you pick it up and you are wondering throughout what will happen to Chiyo. Memoirs is amazing and should be a recommended read for all. I loved it and so will you! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"this novel blew me away with its story and characters. I honestly believed the story was written by a woman rather than a man and that the author could have been the narrator. it was the best book i have read in a while."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was extraodinary. Although the story of Sayuri is fiction, it has every element that the story occurred in history. Arthur S. Golden researched the backgrounds of the life of a geisha. I, as a reader, was overcome by such awe. I have no words to describe this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story of Chiyo/Sayuri was absolutely breath-taking. Golden did a fabulous job writing this novel. His use of metaphors &amp; long descriptions of the scenery &amp; objects is what made the love story so much more enthralling."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden takes you into a novel that reads like an autobiography. I feel I'm a more informed person for having devoted the week I invested in reading this gem. I couldn't put it down and literally took every free moment I had to continue the sheer joy of his writing. A great bargain when purchased from Amazon!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this book emensely. Some may call it &quot;flowery&quot;, or too much like a fairy tale, but I couldn't disagree more. The author writes gracefully, and simply enough to carry you through without rereading difficult passages, but at the same time is thought provoking. You will fall in love with Sayuri, for her character is one we can all in some way relate too. True, it was difficult for someone who knew nothing about the life of a geisha beforehand to understand everything, but that only made me want to learn more-like any good book should. I definitely recommend to anyone, from as picky a reader as any!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is absolutely amazing to look back on the last fifty years for women the world over and see the changes that have taken place. This historical, yet fictional story tells of one woman growing up in Japan during WWII, but it speaks for all of us who have grown up in this era. Remarkable and intriguing. How did Arthur Golden acquire such knowledge about how a woman thinks??? I'd like to meet him!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As I followed Sayuri through her challenges and obstacles I grew to know a strong character but, even more so, learned of a culture and lifestyle I knew little about. I found this book to be very well written, witty, and direct. My only disappointment was in the ending which took on a fairy tale element and seemed rather unrealistic."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I finished this book after just purchasing it two days ago. I could not close the book. Every page I came upon was entrancing and the words suddenly gobbled me up. I have read two other books-The Joy Luck Club and The God of Small Things this summer and they haven't fulfilled me with satisfaction as I got by reading just the first chapter of this remarkable novel. I praise Goldman for his meticulous research on the life of a geisha. His imagery, the metaphors, and similes in the novel are amusing. His main character, Sayuri, is an enduring creature. All around I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"You won't be able to put this book down. The first time I opened it, I told myself I would start at 7 pm then go to homework at 10 pm. I didn't stop reading until 1:30 am. The whole way through I felt like I lived every moment with Chiyo/Sayuri and every second I read this novel I felt as though I had escaped to a completely different world. As a reader all your senses are inundated but not to the point of obfuscation. The amazing sensations coupled with a great story and characters one can identify with in all levels of emotion make this novel a must get. Geisha is my favorite book and there is no way to reiterate what this amazing novel has to offer without doing it a dishonor. Now go, read, and live!!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found the writing and the plot of this novel to be quite lovely and engaging. However, I was very disappointed by the ending. The main character has lived her entire life for a man and has taken no pride in her great accomplishment as a sucessful geisha. She claims to have lived in misery before getting the Chairman, yet she lived a very pampered life throughout the depression while others suffered poverty and starvation. She has suffered and overcome so much, yet she only claims sucess for herself when she betrays the man who was kindest to her and becomes the mistress of a man who is way to old for her anyway."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is great reading material.

Other than a rather predictable ending, a thouroghly engrossing read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"this book read very well, meaning it captured my attention and held it throughout the 400+ pages, which is an accomplishment in itself. But i simply didn't like the main character (Sayuri) enough to truly enjoy the book. that isn't to say i didn't like the story; no i found everything quite interesting and very realistic. The problem for me was just an aversion towards the heroine, who i thought gave up her real identity to devote herself to the pursuit of an infatuation. maybe i'm judging her too harshly. after all, it's only a novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"One of the best 3 books I have ever came across. The author provided very fine details not just into how the giesha's 'world' operate and also into an individual's innermost thoughts. I especially like the ending which I thought would be bleak but ........."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; one Friday afternoon while buying textbooks. By Sunday morning, I was finished. The story was sweeping, engrossing, funny....truly a book you couldn't keep closed. You feel sorry and happy for Sayuri, the protagonist, all at once. The other characters are well-defined, and you feel as if you're living in Sayuri's okiye getting a bird's eye view of her life as a geisha. Read it... you will be totally hypnotized."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book so compelling and hard to put down. It was a most interesting story of a culture that I really don't know much about. I tried to read it slower so that the story wouldn't end but I was so wrapped up in it, that I had to keep reading. I read it during my vacation and found that I was thinking about the characters and the situations throughout my vacation."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs is a fantastic book regarding a little-known part of Japanese culture. Golden,a very capable author, weaves story and history. One is very involved in the life of his characters. In a strict culture, this book has many suprises. One of the best!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although this book was a little hard to get into, once I got through the beginning of it, I could not put it down. The whole culture surrounding geisha was completely foreign to me and I learned an incredible amount about the geisha lifestyle by reading &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot; The story begins by describing the life of a young girl sold by her parents in hopes of becoming a geisha. The girl's life is a roller coaster ride drenched with heartache, revenge, and finally triumph. I won't spoil the ending but I just want to say that this is the best part of the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a true privledge to read. Such a beautifully told story. I honestly could not put it down! Felt a true privledge to see into this secret life. Truly a wonderful read for men and women. It is as if I lost a friend when finished the book...more more."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a wonderful read! You really care about the characters, and the historical details (1930-present) include the Japanese side of World War II. The plot centers upon a poor girl from a fishing village, and the fateful people and events which catapult her to become one of the most famous Geishas in Japan. It is a fascinating book, and I still think about the characters several weeks after reading it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Even though some say this book gives some misconceptions about geisha life, I thought it was a VERY interesting story. Well worth the money, thats for sure. Even if you don't know anything about a geisha, buy the book anyway. You'll be drawn into the story and you wont be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel ranks within my top five novels of all time. Not only is the story captivating and engrossing, it's very well written! The prose is neither cumbersome nor abstruse, and I love the metaphors Sayuri uses to describe things and people (I can't think of any offhand!).It is the story of a poor Japanese peasant girl named Chiyo who is whisked away to a geisha house by a well-meaning but thoughtless village bigwig. She is accepted into a Kyoto okiya, or geisha house, and put to work as a servant girl while she attends geisha school. The condition is that if she can prove she has what it takes to be a geisha, she will not have to work as a servant any longer; if, however, she fails in her geisha studies, she will remain a servant for the rest of her life.Chiyo gives the geisha thing a go but is not really successful at it: Not only does she pine for her family and her old life, but she also is tormented at every turn by Hatsumomo, the principal geisha in the okiya who, but virtue of her status, holds the power of life and death over Chiyo. A thwarted escape attempt from the okiya effectively squashes Chiyo's geisha aspirations. She is removed from geisha school and forced to live out her life as a servant.Until one day when a chance meeting with the Chairman defines Chiyo's destiny. She makes the only choice available to her to improve her quality of life: She puts her heart and mind into becoming a geisha. Fate plays wonderfully into her hands when Mameha, Hatsumomo's hated rival, takes Chiyo under her wing and molds her into one of Japan's most famed geisha.Renamed Sayuri, Chiyo is the talk of Kyoto. Even Hatsumomo, her tormentor, is slowly and gradually vanquished by Sayuri's increasing power and fame. The only part of Sayuri's life that saddens her is her unrequited yearning for the Chairman, a man she loves whom she believes she can never have and who, as far as we can tell, regards her as just an acquaintance.The story picks up momentum as it races ahead to World War II. While it doesn't disappoint in its description of how Sayuri and her geisha peers survived during this dark time in history, the action and excitement level off after this. Though it continues to be a fine story, things work out a little too conveniently in the end. But, all in all, a very fine and entertaining effort.Like SHE'S COME UNDONE, the reader will marvel that this story was written by a man peering through a woman's eyes."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As Golden begins his novel narrating as the young girl Chiyo-chan, the reader is immediately drawn into the life of this poverty-stricken Japanese girl. The details are exquisite, down to every description of kimono. Reading this novel is like stepping directly into Japan in the 1930s; the characters, setting, and ideas are presented in a clear and concise manner. It is not like an ordinary novel, but more like a life story.Although geisha do not exist today to the extent they did in the 1930s they are still quite interesting to study. The things they had to do are shocking at times, and Golden accurately describes these situations with perfect, but not offensive, detail.I am now reading this book for the second time. The first time I read it, I was getting ready for a trip to Japan, and the novel was suggested to me as a good insight into Japanese culture. After reading it, and visiting the country, I was entranced. Japanese life is so different from Western life, and I now have a great respect for it. This book, if not read for insight, should be read merely for pleasure. There simply are not enough words to describe its elegance."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had been recommended this book time and time again, but to be honest, I am not a big fan of [Asian] culture, and wasn't all too sure I wanted to read it.So, one day I was in an airport, with nothing to read and saw this book just waiting for me.... well... it will at least give me something to do on the plane, I thought, and got it..... I will never regret reading it!Simply put, I loved this book!!! It had a very well developed and believable plot, it had enough malice to make me mad, romance to make me happy and funny episodes to make me smile.This book just lays down a road into an unknown and secret world, and lets you walk it yourself, experiencing everything, from the sweetest smells to the most horrible sights.I was very pleasantly surprised by what I read and I found the book constantly pulling me in, letting me experience Japan, Gion, and being a Geisha....All in all, a very entertaining and satisfying read, five solid stars."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought the book at LAX on my way to NY for a Thanksgiving holiday with my in-laws and I tell you, it was better than bringing along my best friend. On the long plane ride, after long days spent socializing, it was wonderful to fall on the mat at the Okida and just lay there and watch and listen... you can HEAR every raindrop this author describes, every whisper spoken in the late night. I've never read a book that so delighted my senses. Ironic, for all the sensual pleasure it gives, it is not a sexually explicit book. What is also rare is that you fall in love with all the characters from the very beginning - even the antogonists (which are numerous). I agree the ending was a bit rushed and disappointing, but it did not spoil the delightful experience this book was. It was more disappointing that it was over."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book had me gripped up until the last 10 pages, one of the most crucial areas for any book to hold the reader. And it failed! Oh, Lord...But first. We begin with a beautiful story that is one part history, one part mystical exploration of Japan. The culture of the geisha is rich and beautiful, full of ritual and custom, and you learn so much fromt his one novel! From the concepts of karma, to superstition, to the roles of men and women and the adapation of Japan from backwater nation to powerful, modern entity.And it's a good read. It grips you and holds you; Chiyo -- who becomes Sayuri -- is a fascinating character with both virtues and flaws. However, he desires, in the end, damn the book to a rushed ending. I would get it for the read--but know you will probably be dissappointed in the end. It would be a five star book, easily, if the ending would have been less rushed and contrived."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"While interested in the topic I resisted reading this book for a long time because it seemed so hyped that I imagined it to be a mainstream appealing heart wrencher. Well, the kudos this novel has received are amply deserved; it is a fascinating and rivetting book.Before reading this I knew virtually nothing about geishas and their role in Japanese society. In telling his tale Golden introduces readers to both a distinct niche in antibellum World War II Japan as well as that culture's social mores.Besides providing an ethnography of sorts, this is a engrossing and satisfying novel, very reminiscent of works by Dickens such as &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Both men and women will find this an engrossing and satisfying read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was a wonderful read. My wife was the one who pestered me into reading it after her, and I gladly thank her for the nagging. It was very hard to put this book down. The story was interesting and the flow never slowed or jolted. This is definitely a book to recommend to adult readers interested in the old-world workings of the Japanese society from a peasant's point of view."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Like sushi, this book is foreign but delicate and sweet, leaving its delicate taste in your mouth long after its gone. And, like sushi, once you get started, you just can't get enough!Golden's view of the world of the geisha draws us in with its intimate detail, but Golden never wallows in the landscape, preferring to focus on the women at the centre of his story, who are drawn both in graceful bold strokes and in elegant, satisfying detail.After a debut like this, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Golden can come up with next."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"On numerous occasions it seems as though words cannot express the terrible suffering, pain, and confusion that are persistently required to achieve progression in life. Arthur Golden's remarkable novel, Memoirs of a Geisha, is a fascinating story that causes the readers to understand the depth of struggle that a particular geisha endured on her journey to success. This stunning and authentic biography shares the life of a Geisha working in Japan during the early 19th century, and it made me feel as though I was actually experiencing the narrative itself. Sayuri-san was a remarkable woman who experienced much adversity on her voyage to becoming a geisha, and many hardships after achieving her goals as well. As a young girl, Sayuri lived in the little fishing village of Yoroido, Japan. At a young age, Sayuri lost her mother, and in an act of desperation, her ill father sold her to a man who then brought Sayuri, although she was extremely reluctant, to a place far from her home where she would begin the training of a geisha. In the early 19th century, the position of a geisha received an extreme amount of respect. After facing many obstacles, Sayuri became successful by virtue of of her outstanding competence, her exceptional beauty, and her hard efforts. This book demonstrates how an incredible young girl develops bravery and courage while working to achieve the goals that have been set before her. I found Golden's novel to be fascinating and entertaining. I greatly enjoyed this book because it was interesting and well written, and any person who is of a mature age should take time to read this novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The authors writing style is very enthralling, like being sucked into a time warp and taken on a delicious ride. I was at the point were I would havae to read the book at stop lights on the way to work."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs&quot; takes the reader to another world that few know of, and even fewer could tell of as well as Golden has. Now that I am done with the novel, I want to learn more about the geisha.I look forward to Steven Spielberg's film adaptation."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When i frist bought Memoirs of a geshia i kept it in my bookshelf for a while thinking it was dull. But one day i picked it up and started to read it and i was in another world!

I was entranced by the world of the geisha and could not get enough. I look forward to reading books of this quality."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Having just finished the last page of &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; I feel as though I have just lost something I cherished. I will truly miss reading this book. Every moment I could steal away, I engrossed myself in this beautifully written story of survival,sacrifice and success. I love Golden's style. I found myself reading several sections over again, just to admire the writing and imagery. I've already recommended this book to everyone I know, now I am recommending it to everyone else."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I fell in love with this book! I found it captivating and moving. Arthur Golden's brilliance as an author shone through in this his first novel! I loved the concept of writing this story as if it was a real geisha's memoirs. I'm very interested in learning more about Japanese culture now as well. Thank you Mr. Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in the same way that one might enjoy watching the TV movie of the week. It was fun and provided the opportunity to learn more about Japanese culture and the life of a geisha. However, I felt somewhat cheated by the hollowness of her romantic attachment to the Chairman and by the lack of any serious questioning of the values of the geisha herself."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was mesmerized with every page! I was engrossed with every experience Sayuri encountered. Golden couldn't have perfected it any more. The language that he uses in this book vividly captures the Japanese culture. This book is one of the best I've ever read. I'm anxiously awaiting for Golden's next novel!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed Golden's book. It will have you rooting for the undredog. More importantly, Golden's book transport you to another time.

It'll give you a better perspective of geishas and their life in general."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A great Novel, although I am not at all a Novel reader.You feel sympathy toward Chiyo-chan who later becomes Sayuri, and you wonder throughout the story whether or not life would eventually bear some happiness to her.I thought that the close was terrible. We heard nothing about Nobu-san after the incident with the Minister and nothing about Pumpkin after her little trick. Moreover, the end of the life-long yearning for the Chairman was not illustrative enough. It took only 2 weak chapters (out of 35) to end the book.The chapters have no names, which I found dull. For example, had chapter 22 been called the Hakone Party; the reader would have been more curious and read on."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I felt so ripped off reading a story written by Arthur Golden that he supposedly got from a \\"real\\" Geisha.. (A man writing about a woman's profession should have been a red flag to me right away) But then find out he embellished and wasn't even writing a true account at all.. Mineko Iwasaki's book (the woman he ripped off) does tell the real story and it's a shame he twisted her words. I wonder if she won the lawsuit against him... And also can't believe how boring and unrealistic the film was that was made about this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book, while beautifully written, is a farce for any kind of historical fiction. It almost caters EXCLUSIVELY to Western audiences to further their erroneous belief that they are prostitutes.He takes up way too much time describing their kimonos and less time elaborating on their customs. This story is nothing more than an exoticised Cinderella that catered to Western audiences -complete with grey eyes to add to Sayuri's Japanese heritage. Americans who don't know much about the history or life of a Geisha (which is very few - you almost have to take classes to even learn a SMALL BIT of this stuff), will love his delicate flowery prose-like fiction, but for people like me, I'm completely and utterly appalled that people would sit here and enjoy such fluff.If you want a BETTER view of a top Geisha, Please, read Geisha: A Life. While at times it may seem trite and egotistical, the valuable information is still there.This gets a 1 out of 5 - and I gave it that one simply because I like his style of writing. The plot has so many holes that it's like a colander, and the historical accuracy is almost non-existent. If you want a fashion show, go right on ahead and read it, since that's all that Golden seems to think that the world of a Geisha is - Sex, Parties and High-fashion."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I completed reading this book a few days ago & enjoyed reading the story of how one geisha became to be, as it is a mysterious culture of historically rich Japanese society. However, I was never really emotionally attached to the storytelling. The book reads like a man telling the story of a woman as she reflects on her experience. Additionally, with respect to the story, I'm not insensitive to her childhood situation and understood her eventual acceptance to want to become a geisha/party-girl/mistress versus the alternative, while discovering an object for her affection in a loveless profession. But I did grapple with my monogamous American female values which conflict with My-greatest-aspiration-in-life-is-to-be-your-concubine status.I'm not saying I agree with the character, but I certainly understand her need to convert chicken sh*t into chicken salad."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved reading this book and have passed it on to many of my friends and family to with my highest recommendations. It takes you to other time and another place and is such an enjoyable read.The ending felt a little rushed but that was probably because I never wanted it to end."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When you read about Mineko Iwasaki's reaction to this book you are thrown so off center. How do I get dreamy and absorbed in a book when the principal source says the author got it wrong and is left angered. Reading this story now will be like walking on a rotted floor--- you just don't know where the holes are."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I greatly enjoyed the descriptions of the kimonos.Also, this is a light, entertaining FICTION. By this, I mean it is Arthur Golden's fictional take on a historical period in Geisha history. I definitely would not consider it a classic by any means. The turns in the plot were actually fairly predictable.As a person trained in writing, I was taught that one should always take the route people can't bear the characters to take. This creates tension and drama. In Memoirs of a Geisha, the events take the popular route that would make most readers happy, and therein lies the lack of drama.I think the argument that Golden is not a Japanese female in the early 1900s is not entirely valid, since by definition, fiction involves a large degree of imagination. Salman Rushdie wasn't around in 6th century CE, but that didn't prevent Satanic Verses from being a fantastic work of art.I definitely noted a lack of transparency in several passages throughout the book. When certain Japanese things and Japanese people were described by the Japanese narrator as smelly or disgusting, and American soldiers (during post-WWII occupation in Japan) were described - without the slightest hint of bitterness, even after her cities have been bombed and loved ones killed - as wonderful happy people whom the Geishas greatly enjoyed laughing & dancing with, abandoning all their formal training and tradition, then it becomes apparent that it is an American white male holding the puppet strings to these characters all along.I do believe this book will do more good than bad. For those who care to explore further, Memoirs of A Geisha will easily fulfill its duty in introducing readers to both Japanese and Geisha culture. All they have to do is to dig a little further into the works of Liza Dalby, Iwasaki Mineko (whose interviews with Golden formed the basis of Memoirs of A Geisha), Sayo Masuda, and also of interest: The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon.For those who are content to read this FICTIONAL account and complacently treat it as truth, well, there's no rescue for them."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesPLEASE NOTE: I am reviewing the audio version of the book. As such I can not be certain all names and locations are spelled correctly.Chiyo is a young child of a fisherman who is sold into slavery at the Nitta okiya (geisha house) when her mother dies. At first she fights her fate, unwilling to be separated from her father and sister, but the excess of \\"water\\" in her personality, represented by her grey eyes, and a chance encounter with a kind businessman soon helps her to flow along in her new life.Chiyo, determined to someday be worthy of a man like her \\"chairman,\\" grows in the ways of a geisha as she trains long and hard under the experienced Mameha, one of the most popular geisha in the district. But a vicious rivalry with Hatsumomo, the infamous but cruel sister geisha in her okiya causes many hurdles to overcome. However, Chiyo, who takes the new name of Sayuri on completion of her training, fights through it all in a desire to succeed, never letting go of her vision of winning the affection of her Chairman.The extensive research is fully evident in the story and the details are so rich it made me feel like I was seeing everything first hand. However, it does come across as stilted in many parts. I also didn't buy the whole love story of Sayuri for the Chairman. I did not feel the emotion there and the Chairman was very two-dimensional, flat and uninteresting. Even though I knew how things would turn out, I couldn't help but hope it would go differently. I felt there was far more of a connection between Sayuri and Nobu, the Chairman's right hand man, who was developed more fully and had a much stronger personality.Memoirs of a Geisha is brilliantly written novel full of such vivid imagery you can't help but fall into the story, experiencing the golden era of the Japanese. The story is told by Sayuri, in her old age living in New York, revealing her life story. As such, I would have thought the audio version of this book would be absolutely wonderful. What better way to \\"read\\" the life story of Sayuri as she narrates, then by listening to it? Unfortunately that was not the case. Bernadette Dunn came across as very dull and monotonous. I felt more like a robot was telling the story than the person who actually lived through it. Granted, her performance was likely meant to convey the feeling of a very formal and traditional woman relaying the story of her life, but that's not how it came across.I didn't get any sense of feeling out of the performance as you'd expect when someone is talking about such life-altering and emotional events in her life. As such, I never really found myself liking Sayuri. She was so far removed from everything, and very selfish in many ways. That was really all the depth I ever got out of her persona. Even when she reaches these long sought after dreams, I never felt like she enjoyed them, or even deserved them.Memoirs of a Geisha is a thoroughly engrossing look into the sometimes glamorous, sometimes fiercely competitive world of the Japanese geisha. Unfortunately it remained very impersonal, and left me untouched, even when I reached the end of the novel.Kelley A. Hartsell, January 2007.

Sudutive and overwelming. I would definatly recommend this book to EVERYONE! I ended the book still wanting to read more, i hope they make another one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha provides striking detailed descriptions of the life of a Japanese entertainment worker before and after World War 2. Golden's research is immaculate, as he describes a place and life he could never have seen or experienced. For that alone, the book is a great read for anyone interested in Japan. The story itself is weaker - after a point, the self-absorbed ramblings and snipings between the Geishas loses it's story. The interesting morality plays much be infered with an open mind, as the surface presentation (like much in Japan) is only a small reflection of reality."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"One of the most captivating books that I have ever read, Memiors of a Geisha draws the reader in with a power that few books possess. In this story of a young girl taken from all she has ever known, transplanted into a new culture, and expected to conform to semmingly ridiculus rules, the reader connects emotionally with the Suyari. Arthur Golden does a wonderful job of recounting the ficticious life of a geisha with vivid detail. Little is overlooked in this story, every action and every word and every person later connect and intertwine with one another. Suyari's love for the Chairman may appear to be the infactuation and desire of a lost little girl's heart, but, as the story progresses, that love evovles into so much more than that. This story proves, among other things, that love is blind and can surpass the boundaries of age and time. A marvelously written book, I recommend this to anyone willing enough to allow themselves to be absorbed into story, for that is exactly what it will do."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a 13 year old girl who lives in the suburbs of San Francisco, California. I never knew much about geisha until this book. My mom read it before me, and raved about it, so I decided to try it. I was reading up to 200 pages a day, highly engrossed in this book. Some parts could have had less detail, but I am greatful to this author for the parts that had, possibly, unrealistic hope, but hope none the less. I would suggest this book to any body i think could handle it. All around, my favorite book ever!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Hmmm...wish I enjoyed this one as much as everyone else did. The pacing is captivating and the characterizations superb throughout the book. The beginning is quite enthralling and momentum is built nicely. The level and attention to detail is exquisite.BUTAs is the case with most literature it's the ending that spoils everything. Or in this case not even the novel's ending (which is fair) but the epilogue. You see the author would have us believe from the prologue of the book that the story is non-fictional. But it is entirely fictional. So you as the reader have read this story believing that this could really happen, only to be swindled by the author at the end.The book is a fascinating look at Eastern Culture, and most people will enjoy it immensely. If you are like most people bully for you. Buy this book and enjoy to your hearts content.But alas, the beaten path is not for all, and if you are like me, then skip this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is definitely my favorite book. My initial reaction to a friend's recommended of this book was that it would probably be boring. How interesting could a geisha's life be? After storing this book in my desk for over 2 months, I reluctantly picked it up and started reading. To my surprise every spare time I had was devoted to what was to occur next in the story. What I loved most was the way that I felt as if could relate to the main character's life. Although the book was written by a man, I thought that he really understood a women's heart. I cried, laughed, and truly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A great book, amazingly well written. It takes you into a world of reality, and at times you don't even know it is fiction. The book is great and beautifully detailed, the reader can almost picture exactly what is going on. Full of vibrant information that keeps you reading. I love the book and can't wait to read another one byArthur Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a book-club choice and thus was not a book that I probably would have read on my own. Although I am glad I read it, it can't say it will be listed as one of my favorites. I agree that the writing style is repetitious and very slow at times. I tried to go with it and absorb the culture of the place and time, but found myself getting annoyed with the main character. I tend to be the type who gets annoyed with female protagonists who are reactive instead of proactive and I know, considering the culture that Sayuri lived in, she had little choice, but I still was annoyed. I was more interested in what happened to her sister, who apparently manages to escape a life of prostitution.I also felt the author made two mistakes with his writing. First of all, in the prologue he takes on a different persona and writes about interviewing the fictional Sayuri as an older woman in New York and the story grows from there. Then, in the acknowledgements at the end, he talks about the actual former geisha that he, as an author, interviewed for the story. Why not acknowledge that meeting first and then begin her story? Why the fictional meeting with both his name and Sayuri's changed, when there was an real meeting to write about?Secondly, in the first half I could've sworn I was reading a Japanese Charles Dickens. I kept waiting for Sayuri to go up to her owner and ask pitifully, &quot;More gruel, please.&quot; The second half (post-WWI) was definitley Margaret Mitchell with a Japanese Scarlett O'Hara vowing never to go hungry again, complete with her Rhett Butler-esque hero.Agian, I would never recommend against reading Geisha, but it's not one I will keep in my bookcase and read over &amp; over. In fact, I've already donated my copy to the library for it's monthly booksale."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I came to the end of this book I felt cheated. I didn't realise until the end that this book was a novel. The error was my own but the title and the introduction (named by the author as Translator's Notes) created and maintained the deception. It reads like a biography and, perhaps, in that form, one could excuse the shallow characterisation. At times the writing is long-winded. As a male I found some of the long detailed descriptions of the dress and make-up of the geisha to be tedious. However, despite my disappointment, the novel gives an apparently authentic view into the life of geisha and is an easy and diverting read. I would not rate it as fine writing or profound literature but nevertheless, a good book for a wet holiday weekend or a long aeroplane journey."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the moment I began reading this book I could not put it down.....I took it everywhere with me, even to work. One day sitting down in a cafe a waiter approched me, with a tear in his eye.....explaining that he had himself read this book and he had in fact sobbed whilst reading the ending.......I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone, it is easy to read and very touching....The only disspointing part of this book is that it had to end....I felt I could read on and on forever...."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of those rare novels that has altered the world as I see it. I agree with many of the reviewers that the author treats his heroine with unbelievable empathy, and captures perfectly those quiet qualities we might assume of a geisha- loyalty, fragility, grace, submissiveness, pride, humility...at the same time hinting at the complexity of her thoughts, and understanding (and acceptance) of her place in the world.I would have wanted the story to end differently, but I'm glad that it didn't- this was not an epic romance, and a bittersweet end (an unsatisfying end at that) is consistent with the overall thread of the story.There are passages in this book that are pure poetry- uncontrived and unforgettable. Absolutely one of the best reads I've had in years."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's the first time in 6 years that I'm trying to read a book in English that I am actually capable of doing so....

I was so untouched by the film--though beautifuly rendered--it lacked depth and I can't help but say there is such an incredible difference in depth, in range, in the richness of the prose here--there is just no comparison.Sometimes a great book is just too good to try to render on to film--sometimes it works, but why does it seem that the lesser works of fiction end up making a better movie? There is so much verisimilitude in the renderings of the time period, the place, that it seems this should be a real memoir. Accolades to this author and it's been almost ten years since this book originally came out; let's hope there's another to follow. The best writers patiently work on their next books--So recommend along with MIDDLESEX, and LIFE OF PI."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I can't believe I put off reading this story for so long. I want to go back and read it all over again.

I knew little to nothing about the Japanese culture, or their traditions. Even so, I enjoyed the book. The change from Sayuri's troubled childhood to majestic adult Geisha life was brilliantly written, always leaving the reader in an unsure suspense. Her hardships and tricky friendships demonstrated the hard life she was living masked by a layer of white makeup.I would recommend this book to anyone who either has an interest in historical fiction, is interested in the Japanese culture, or especially for people who have yet to learn anything about traditional Japan during the Great Depression and Second World War."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Honestly I would have never touched this book if it weren't for the movie promos; but I am very glad that I read it before watching the movie. From the first page, you are seduced into this world that's quite exotic to us Westerners. It leaves the reader in awe, and yet, somehow this world--as well as that of a geisha--- doesn't seem too strange or foreign. I am not going to go on about the plot of the story, since many reviewers have done so. There are many great things about this novel that makes it quite a wonderful debut (and also some flaws, which don't outway its strong points btw).THE POSITIVES: Arthur Golden weaves us through the life, customs, and culture of Japan and the geisha life more descriptively than any book I've read. The characters aren't cliche or cooky cutter Asian characters; he makes each of them unique and interesting thorughout the whole novel. And as thin and somewhat hackneyed the plot is (you don't necessarily have to be a literature buff to get the idea of the story or a genius to figure out the ending...), he actually purveys a lot of heart and symbolism into the character's life and the events that happen in it.THE NEGATIVES: I am not being negative for the sake of trying to find something bad in this book (I didn't give it 5 stars for nothing!). But there were some things that I distracted me while reading. For one, I love Chiyo/Sayuri's narration. It shows a woman who's poetic, strong, and innocent, but not independent and interesting. For the most part, the great things that happen to her are from the doing of other characters looking out for her, not because she did them on her own. It makes me wonder what she would have been like if she didn't have certain people hold her hand throughout her adversity. Quite frankly, to me there was nothing interesting about this character other than her silver blue eyes.Also, I think the biggest complaint that most readers have is the ending. I for one felt that the ending was WAY TOO PREDICTABLE, and was too much like a Hollywood happy ending. Even the most turmoil parts of the story (such as the Depression, the war, and the closing of the geisha houses) seemed to be so brief and not so bad that you feel as if nothing happened at all.Overall, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. No debut book is perfect, but I have to say that Memoirs of a Geisha is close enough to be an exception. Very few novels of this time period, race, and culture have captured readers like this one. If a book like this can make people appreciate or get a glimpse of another culture, and respect it for what it is, then it's truly something worth reading and acknowledging regardless of its flaws."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I wouldn't say that the book was erotic or sexual. Not at all. The main character actually avoided going into details and would describe some situations very generally because she just couldn't not mention them due to their importance (like the \\"mizuage\\").The book was more like educational, describing Geisha life-style, habits, communication, rules - something that I didn't know before and found it useful and interesting. It's true that somewhere in the middle the book starts to drag, but on the other hand you're still intrigued. Toward the end things get surprising. You can identify yourself in the story however your life goes: time passes, things change, people come and go, but you keep up with it all. Also it expands your view when learning about other cultures - their customs and values. And it makes your heart ache when you read how much the main character had to endure. After reading a book, you realize how much there is available that we don't even notice!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"How do I begin to give such an outstandingly good and captivating novel it's proper due in just a couple of paragraphs? I don't know if it is possible but I will certainly try if it means that someone who would normally have no interest in a book like this pick it up and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did! I began reading \`MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' by Arthur Golden for my next book club meeting and the first two days or so I keep putting it down for one reason or another...a ringing phone...a crying baby, whatever but by the third day I was completely enthralled! I found my self plunking my son down in front of an episode of his favorite cartoon just to steal a few minutes of extra reading time.\`MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' is the story of Nitta Sayuri a very famous Geisha in her day who we now find living in New York City at about the age of seventy and dictating her story for transcription. She takes us back to a time long before she was a geisha to what it was like growing up her little fishing village of Yoroido and to how she ended up in one of the most popular geisha districts in Japan. This story unwinds itself in a manner that will have you believing that this is a non-fiction book and will keep you mesmerized until the very last page. The language is beautiful if not funny at times and Golden incorporates a lot of facts about life in this part of the world in the 1920's - 1940's that many people would never have been inclined or interested to know about. If I could give this book ten stars I would, it deserves each and every one of them!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished reading Memoirs of a Geisha and i'm impressed with the way Mr. Golden has captured the life of a Geisha in his novel.

I don't think any movie could do this book justice."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The enticing story of a woman in time and the culture in MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA by Arthur Golden ends with words of elegance: \\"But now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising on an ocean. Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into wash, just like watery ink on paper.\\"In the small fishing village, Chiyo lives with her apathetic father and dying mother. Unknown by Chiyo, she is sold into slavery by her father to a Kyoto geisha house. She transforms from the lost girl with striking grey-blue eyes into the famed geisha, Sayuri. From the age of nine, Sayuri trains in the arts of dance, music, and conversation -- all for the sole purpose of men's pleasure.The MEMOIRS are written in the first person, and based on historical fact. The 'fictional' woman tells of her life, as she attends opulent parties, in beautiful kimonos, mixing with the rich and famous. Her virginity is sold to the highest bidder, there is constant rivalry amongst the geishas, and often -- lost love.The novel takes readers into the private world of the geisha of pre-war Japan, in the 1930's. Western readers are transfixed to the exotic setting, and the appearance of women as pampered slaves and proficient performers. Arthur Golden's richly researched detail adds to his gracious prose.

This book had a calming effect on me, but not because it was dull. Far from that, this book was a wonderful story, tying the characters together in one way or another. I have to admit that I didn't particularly care for many of the male characters in the book, with the exception of the Chairman, but I do understand the paternalistic (see, I didn't say chauvanistic) era this book discusses. The description of the kimonos in the book were very detailed -- even those readers with no imagination should have no problem visualizing the beauty of the clothing, the hustle bustle of the environment, the atmosphere at the tea party. It's nice to read a book that is not replete with profanity or violence or sexuality, but is still able to convey sensuality. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book!!!! It kept me fascinated and until I read the back cover, I thought I was reading a true memoir. The descriptions flow like water and the similes are so real. A must read for someone who needs a break in the day to wind down and just enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"For the most part, this is a very absorbing book. What I found most refreshing was that almost all of Golden's characters behaved in ways that seemed consistent with their personality rather than just performing actions for the sake of the story. The level of detail provided about the tricks of the geisha trade was also quite good. However, as the summary at the top of this review points out, the ending is just horrible. It almost consigns this otherwise fine work to the title of &quot;Bland Romance.&quot; Needless to say, it was a real disappointment after an excellent, riveting first 400 pages."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Looking forward to Golden's next nove"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully written book. It is sensuous and utterly feminine, and delves into a culture that is mysterious and yet fascinating. That Arthur Golden is not Japanese nor a woman is a real testiment to his writing abilities. I cannot wait for Mr. Golden's next book. I LOVED THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA was a non-fiction book until I was about halfway through it. I didn't read the book jacket beforehand, but about halfway through I took out the book's jacket and read it because I thought it was a true story.Yep, it was THAT good and realistic."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Couldn't believe this book was written by an American Man!!! Arthur Golden captures the essence of Sayuri. You can see her, feel her emotions. You are taken in by his poetic writing. Not only do you get a chance to share the twists and turns of Sayuri's life, but you are given an opportunity to learn ancient customs and way of life for the geisha of Japan. I really loved this book!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I couldn't put it down. It was one of those books where you can't wait to read more of it, yet you hate that your reading it so fast.I know so many reviewers have said this, but it really is amazing this book was written by a man. The detail he goes in to describing the way gisha apply their makeup, the details of their clothing, etc.This book is an exceptional read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was hard to beleive it is a fictional account, the voice and persona of the characters rings so true."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was devine. How a man could write this I'll never know. I could hardly believe it was a work of fiction it rang so utterly true. You'll read it in one sitting and be wishing for more."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"and it gave me insight into a culture that i knew little about . . . what i find particularly amazing was that the book was written by a guy, in that it really &quot;sounds&quot; like the thoughts of a woman . . . for readers looking for a change of pace, this is something to check out."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was one of those books I couldn't put down but didn't want to end. Golden brings you completely into a closed world so that you feel as if you are walking alongside the characters, feeling both their pain and joy. The story covers a broad expanse in terms of time, geography, and emotions. Golden keeps it moving effortlessly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. This book shows us that slavery is not just middle passage. Once you read this book no matter what your views of a Geisha girl were be it: Prostitute, Artist or Entertainer, the bottom line is the struggles they go through whether sold into it or born into the life of a Geisha it is a form of slavery. This book truly opened my eyes and I have the utmost respect for the few remaining Geisha that continue to entertain in a standard few can touch. I was amazed at how Arthur actually made you feel each characters sorrows and joys. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have read many books about culture but this tops every one that I have read. I have never known that it was so hard to be a geisha, having to go through all that training, suffering, backstabbing, love, lust, respect and the war. Having to portray a different personality in front of others is a really hard thing to do. This book has made me understand not only the culture of Japan but also the true life of a geisha."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},J={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],q={key:0},j={key:1};function C(s,e,n,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",J,[(t(!0),o(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",j,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",q,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const H=u(x,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-b02f136c"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/26.md","filePath":"drive/26.md"}'),E={name:"drive/26.md"},N=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{O as __pageData,N as default};
