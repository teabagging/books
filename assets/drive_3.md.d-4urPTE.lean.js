Judy Alter's MATTIE features a heroine who in many ways resembles today's youth; she merely dresses Mattie in frontier clothing and turns her loose in a pioneer setting. Many have made good adventure stories out of such fare. The recent TRUE GRIT accomplishes such. In Alter's seasoned hands our gal Mattie will do much more than have adventures, although she surely does that. In overcoming substantial barriers, the child becomes a young woman, discovers the gifts of the mind, apprentices to role models who teach her, and steps into maturity knowing who she is without the benefit of a man by her side, although she could have had the obligatory leading man usually found in such stories.The opening of the novel catches the attention quickly, reveals terrible troubles, hints at more to come but leaves it at that. If you want to know more, you'll have to wait for the first person narrator to reveal the plot in her own time and way.There's no need to comment on plot. Jacket blurb and comments of others can fill you in on that. And no one should give away the ending, but some reviewers do. Too bad.I have been a fan of Alter's writing for many years, and I'm always struck with the way she reminds a reader of whatever is going on in the world even as she presents her casts of characters firmly rooted in the past, usually in the American West. Most are told in first person and that also lends immediacy and personal acquaintance with the female lead character.I'm delighted to see her books appear on Amazon and available for Kindle. Just wish some film makers would take a look at her titles and make a movie. Disney would be the best. The pitch for movies reminds me that her books are visual, filled with landscape, hardships, simple pleasures, danger, but alwlays with a heroine who in one way or another suceeds on her own terms."},{"Title":"Mattie","review":"This was a book about the first female doctor in Nebraska.

Clark's &quot;Faith And Saving Faith&quot; is perhaps the best book written on the subject of the nature of saving faith. In this book Clark exposes just how ridiculous much popular thinking on faith is. The much used and abused distinction between &quot;head faith&quot; and &quot;heart faith&quot; is here demonstrated to be unscriptural, as Clark conclusively demonstrates that in Scripture there is no distinction between the heart and mind (see pages 67-77 under the heading &quot;Charles Hodge&quot;). Clark takes the classic theological understanding of faith as being divided into notitia (knowledge), assensus (assent) and fiducia (trust), and exposes it as the logical nonsense it is; since fiducia or trust is a synonym for faith, it therefore cannot be one of faiths components. I unreservedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Faith and Saving Faith","review":"Unfortunately, reasoning and thinking skills of this quality are not to be found in contemporary pop authors. This book touches on many things, but foremost it is a linear logical critique of the ideas and doctrines of men in a historical context. Clark moves through history with a critical eye on faith and saving faith exposing the lack of logic and clear thinking on the part of specific individuals in regards to saving faiths definition. His position is one in which, to believe propositions (facts) about someone is to believe in them. There is no more to it than that. Thus, rendering the concept of easy believism empty and meaningless. Also, it's a sort of prophetic warning against the descent of popular christiandom into anti-intellectualism, which at this point is an established reality. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to enlarge their understanding of these issues."},{"Title":"Faith and Saving Faith","review":"There is scarcely a time when a generation can boast of being free from the influence of previous thinkers. Our age is no exception. Neo-orthodox theologians, enlightenment philosophers and various vain ideologies all direct the steps, or at least seek to direct the steps of those in the Church. Our culture absorbs these ideas, and our minds are susceptible to their errors. It might be objected that the concept of faith, a most central element to Christianity, could fall prey to the influences of the world. But it has. And Gordon Clark is quite prepared to demonstrate this reality. As such, his book \\"Faith and Saving Faith,\\" first and foremost, defends the view that Christian faith is assent to Biblical propositions. Christian faith is not a mystical encounter with a Person, nor is it an emotional experience of the heart. These false formulations, or conceptions of faith, flow, in part, from the cultural milieu of our day; a day that has been profoundly affected by the past. Again, faith is, by definition, \\"assent to understood propositions.\\" This is the central thesis to Clark's monograph.In order to unpack his thesis, Dr. Clark explores a range of thinkers on the subject, most of which are theologians. Each person has a particular strength or weakness that is used as a springboard to discuss and bolster the author's contention of what Biblical faith is. Our objective here is to explore Dr. Clark's presentation highlighting those aspects of the discussion which serve to illuminate the author's thesis.We begin in the realm of secular thought. Dr. Clark considers contemplation of generic and secular belief to be important, insofar as many Christians teach nonsense because they are \\"unacquainted with professional studies of sensation, mind and belief.\\" He therefore examines Blanshard and Price. Price serves his purposes for defining faith by virtue of introducing a distinction that should not exist, namely, the supposed difference between believing \\"in\\" something and believing \\"that.\\" As he works through Price's considerations of the subject, Dr. Clark insists that the one collapses into the other. This is to say that if one believes in something they must also believe things about that something; hence you believe that X is a, b, or c. At the end of the day, the secularist cannot speak with certainty of the subject, for his over-arching position results in skepticism. It is therefore the place of revelation to sort these things out for us. Nevertheless, we must not be illogical as we handle the Biblical data, nor should we fail to properly distinguish categories and carefully define terms; to this end secular philosophy can prove to be beneficial.Roman Catholicism is considered next. The whole idea of implicit faith is explored, with special attention focused on Thomas Aquinas. The fundamental objection with Roman Catholicism doesn't reside in their formal definition of faith, for they actually have a good understanding of what Biblical faith is, but the major contention resides in their conception of faith without knowledge- implicit faith. Dr. Clark notes that a person cannot observe a doctrine or obey a command unless he has knowledge of it. He says, \\"Faith is strictly limited to knowledge.\\" And again, \\"No one can believe what he does not know or understand.\\" If we are to assent to something, that something must have content. The very notion of assent presupposes propositional content. If we are devoid of knowledge, then we are necessarily devoid of assent unto knowledge- lest we assent to the doctrinal formulation of implicit faith, which is rather strange.Secular constructions of faith and Roman Catholicism are, predominately, preliminary considerations before the author digs into the Biblical data and investigates the halls of Reformed theology. He believes that the Reformers, with their robust view of Scripture, are in a position to adequately handle the issue of faith. They \\"not only appealed to Scripture, as opposed to the secularists, but to sola scriptura, as opposed to the Romanists.\\"In this respect, the Reformers are explored at some length. But it isn't merely their views which are taken up; Dr. Clark assembles a wide array of Biblical passages to demonstrate that faith is assent. He argues that the Biblical data reveals that faith has two distinct meanings. He says, \\"Sometimes it means the mental activity of believing... while the second meaning, namely, the propositions believed...\\" In all cases, so far as he is concerned, the fundamental and exclusive meaning to faith is assent to propositions. Chapters five and fifteen are largely devoted to examining the evidence for this assertion- examining it in terms of the raw Biblical data.The halls of Reformation history serve to support his contention. He interacts extensively with such thinkers as Calvin, Hodge, Warfield and a host of other worthy men. With most of these individuals, there is a tendency to speak of faith as assent to propositions, but they will muddy the waters with ambiguous terminology or undermine this fact by seeing faith as trust in a person as opposed to propositions. This harkens back to the classic threefold division of faith as knowledge, assent and trust. The idea of trust introduces, according to Clark, an alien element to the essence of Biblical faith. To assent to something is to believe something. Trust and assent touch. Warfield will speak of pregnant faith, Manton will speak of consent as some kind of trust and Hodge's empirical epistemology will lead him to postulate various strengths to faith, but they fail to understand, according to Clark, that such language is ambiguous and unnecessary.Another tendency with which Clark takes umbrage is the notion that we trust in a Person, not in a doctrine. John Owen's serves as a good example of this line of thinking. Owen's wants to maintain that the object of faith is not the promise of forgiveness, but instead he maintains that it is Christ Himself that is the object of justifying faith. Clark responds, \\"When we believe a man, we believe what he says. Nor does it help Owen's view to insist on the Scriptural phrase, believe in Christ, as something essentially different from believing Christ. As we said before, believing in a man may indicate a willingness to believe what he will say in the future as well as what he has said in the past. But belief must always have a proposition as its proper object, and therefore must be assent.\\"Another major point that Clark wants to emphasize is the oneness of heart and head in Scripture. The data overwhelmingly teaches that the head and heart are one; the heart means the mind, the intellect and the understanding within a man. It is therefore a mistake to speak of believing in Christ with one's heart in addition to one believing Christ with their minds. This is a false dichotomy, and one that will provide fertile ground for misunderstanding. We should not conceive of believing with the heart as insisting on an emotional element as a necessary ingredient to the volitional decision. Emotions sometimes accompany such decisions, but it is incorrect to separate the heart and the head and to introduce emotional elements as necessarily concomitant with the will.The sum of Dr. Clark's contention is that the 20th century is quite anti-intellectual, and this has impacted the way in which we think of faith. If one closely examines how belief and faith is used throughout Scripture, it will become apparent that faith is assent unto propositions. And \\"there seems to be no other conclusion but that God justifies sinners by means of many combinations of propositions believed.\\" This is what Dr. Clark argues for.For myself, I find his discussion to be helpful, but too simplistic. It is helpful in the sense that he has adequately defined faith, but I think he overstates his case. When he looks at James 2, which he admits is a challenge to his contention, he simplifies the issue in that section of Scripture to accommodate his thesis. Faith is assent. True enough. But a holistic view of a repentant sinner's disposition in conversion will want to talk about \\"pregnant faith.\\" In an attempt to describe the vibrant work of God in the sinner in contradistinction to those who have a dead, creedal faith, we labor to find terminology which will describe the difference."},{"Title":"Faith and Saving Faith","review":"Gordon Haddon Clark (1902-1985) was an American philosopher and Calvinist theologian, who was chairman of the Philosophy Department at Butler University for 28 years. He wrote many books, such asThe Holy Spirit,Trinity/Trinity Papers: No. 8,Sanctification (Trinity paper),The Incarnation (Trinity Paper ; No. 23), etc.He states that \\"A person cannot 'observe' a doctrine or obey a command unless he knows it. Faith is strictly limited to knowledge.\\" (Pg. 21) Commenting on James 2:20, he writes, \\"Clearly James means a belief of some sort; and the only belief James mentions is the belief in monotheism. Islam therefore would be a dead faith.\\" (Pg. 33) He adds, \\"Belief is the act of assenting to something understood. But understanding alone is not belief in what is understood.\\" (Pg. 51)He asserts that \\"the Romanist writers, even though they believe that the Bible is infallible, use it insufficiently and often misinterpret it by reason of tradition, papal pronouncements, and what may be called fallacious scholastic arguments.\\" (Pg. 29) He later adds, \\"Evangelicalism excludes the Romish doctrine of implicit faith. Hence justification cannot depend on our assent to all revealed truth. Justifying faith must be an assent to some truths, not all.\\" (Pg. 55)He concludes on the note, \\"Faith, by definition, is assent to understood propositions. Not all cases of assent, even assent to Biblical propositions, are saving faith; but all saving faith is assent to one or more Biblical propositions.\\" (Pg. 118)While controversial, Clark's opinions on this difficult area of theology are always interesting."},{"Title":"Beast In The Jungle (volume 17) (Notable American Authors)","review":"If you're prone to lazy reading this is not the book for you.

For readers with serious tread wear, Mr. James is a pleaseure to be tasted again and again.I am going through James for the third time. It has not been (nor was it ever) a disappointment. I read James in my 20s, again in my 40s, and now again (hopefully not for the last time!) in my mid 60's. There is this singular great thing about good books: whatever your stage in life, you get something illuminating from them, and as your life's perspectives change, new things are found in even the most familiar work.For someone now batting in the 8th inning of life, \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" offers me a particularly apt (and painful) lesson. It hurts, and it hurts big. Few people under 40 (perhaps even 50) would feel the full measure of poignancy that this story so tellingly and so convincingly portrays.One does not glide through Henry James without effort. His works do not read like pop fiction, so if you are a little short on attention span or a little apathetic in taking the time to stand back in awe of a magnificent literary edifice, then you'd better stick to the top 20 fiction bestseller lists for your entertainment. James is also entertaining (if you like to laugh and cry at the tragic, sad, flawed, but often exhilaratingly upbeat human spectacle), but James' entertainment demands (and reveals) a great deal more than from the \\"standard\\" popular authors.Do yourself a favor and read this short story."},{"Title":"Beast In The Jungle (volume 17) (Notable American Authors)","review":"Readers who know Henry James but can't take him are unlikely to be converted to him by The Beast in the Jungle. Those of us who adore his way of writing are in consequence their polar opposites, James's style being one that could have been designed to polarise opinions. Whether there is much middle ground, and whether many readers occupy it, I have no way of knowing, but I doubt it -- I guess if you know his work in the first place you are likely to be either with him or against him.I suppose my reason for writing a review, even such a short one as this, is to try to flag up this extraordinary piece of work by an extraordinary genius to any newcomers on the block who have an inkling that it might be their cup of tea. I don't propose to 'sell' The Beast in the Jungle to anyone at all, but presumably I can at least say that it is hardly more than a short story in length, and that if you lose your investment you will not be losing very much. I need to say something about the style, quite obviously after what I have just said above; and then draw attention to the story itself and its denouement, which for me is powerful in the extreme.James's sentences are like great elaborate sculptures, worked on with patience and concentration. There are other things in English prose that they resemble to some extent, but not many. Mr Gladstone's orations come to mind, but what I am most reminded of is no less than Paradise Lost in the length and the 'periodic' structure of the sentences with their elaborate subordinate clauses. However I can reassure you that James's idiom is at least 'genuine' English. Samuel Johnson and T S Eliot both alleged that the diction of Paradise Lost was nothing of the kind. Whether they were right or wrong, you will at least not find that kind of Beast lurking in wait for you. Long ago the study of classical Greek was still not uncommon, and any who can still read the speeches in Thucydides will probably get the same experience as I did, having to retrace, both there and here, the clauses in their elaborate relationships to check what follows on what.I only identified the Beast at the same instant as John Marcher does in the story, and I was hardly less torn apart by it. I could have been another of its victims if things had not gone right. The whole story with its unspecific allusions flashed back through my head, and I had to reflect what great storytelling I thought it had all been. The ending could not have been what it is but for the way the earlier story is told in those great convoluted pronouncements. How does it sound as if it might appeal to you or at least excite your curiosity? If you miss an experience that might affect you in the way it affects me and others, you risk the vengeance of another (albeit lesser) Beast."},{"Title":"Beast In The Jungle (volume 17) (Notable American Authors)","review":"This book is okay... I mean, if you like reading about selfish, egocentric males who are obsessed with themselves, you will love it. The only way I could tolerate it was to read it from a queer theory perspective and it was only slightly interesting."},{"Title":"Beast In The Jungle (volume 17) (Notable American Authors)","review":"\\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" is the most effective sleeping pill you are likely to find anywhere. I challenge any reader to go through this text in one sitting and not falling asleep or, at least, not to experiment a tremendous mind-numbing feeling. Of course, I haven't read all the books in the world, but I dare say that this is the most boring piece of writing ever conceived by anyone. I find it very hard to imagine something more awful than this. It's absolutely impossible, unsurpassable.Henry James' style is so artificially conceited and pompous that you have to ask yourself if the trash he used to write wasn't a very calculated joke after all or if he's just trying to take the reader for a ride (a ride into a world of dullness and boredom, that is). The supposedly \\"psychological insight\\" of James is just a mere exercise in nothingness, the highest form of pretentiousness in its purest expression.In this short???-story (James wasn't very strong on things like \\"precision\\" and \\"conciseness\\"), the terrible fate that seems to be in store for the main character after pages and pages of monotonous text, turns out to be that \\"nothing is to happen to him\\". Pathetic and childish. In my opinion, \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" is the greatest proof that James was a dreadful writer (not to say \\"an insipid donkey\\").Actually, James is so comical as to excite parody. In the old days H.G. Wells likened his prose to an hippopotamus pushing a pea and Ambrose Bierce said that James' work would benefit if someone took the pain to translate it into English. I personally agree with the two of them but, you know, many things that in the past have been judged as \\"ridiculous\\" or \\"stupid\\" are considered today, through some arbitrary process known as \\"reassessment of literary figures\\", as something pretty relevant and sophisticated. That's life, isn't it?.\\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" is a poor story that serves James as an excuse for writing a lot and not to say anything significant. Completely worthless. In case I had to choose, I'd prefer to read a telephone directory instead.Of course, this prime example of literary incompetence is regarded as a masterpiece by many scholars.Well, each to his own..."},{"Title":"The Renaissance: Renaissance (Journey Through History)","review":"The Journey Through History series consists of six books written for young readers that are designed to encourage their interest in the study of history. What is interesting about them is that they were originally published in Spain (\\"Edad antigua\\"), which provides for a slightly different perspective on the past that you get from American historians. \\"The Renaissance\\" is the fourth volume, following \\"Prehistory to Egypt,\\" \\"The Greek and Roman Eras,\\" and \\"The Middle Ages.\\" What authors Gloria & Oriol Verges do in this series is to follow groups of children during a specific period as a way of touching on topics of historical interest and significance.So we begin with a couple of young children who get to listen to poetry in their own language (instead of Latin or Greek), check out the achievements of Leonardo da Vinci, and look at books being printed with moveable type. Each of these topics is covered in a two-page spread consisting of an illustration that covers more than one page and several paragraphs of simple text. Other pages are devoted to the Vatican, the sculptures of Michelangelo, and Christopher Columbus. This allows a nice transition to a couple of young kids living in one of the great Native American cultures, before returning to Europe and other aspects of the Renaissance.The back of the book includes a guide for parents and teachers that focuses on the various topics covered it the text from Humanism and the idea of the \\"Renaissance Man\\" to what was happening with religion and literature as represented by key figures such as Martin Luther, Miquel Cervantes, and William Shakespeare. There is not a lot of details here, but young readers will get a sense for some of the key defining elements of the Renaissance. Consequently I find these to be nice little supplemental volumes to the study of the Renaissance for young students in grade school. The focus is on defining elements of the culture and reinforcing those. Students can get more details from other sources. The final pair of volumes in the Journey Through History series are devoted to \\"Modern Times,\\" and \\"The Contemporary Age.\\" All six of the books are written by Gloria & Oriol Verges, with Carme Peris illustrating the even numbered books, including this one, and Maria Rius providing the art for the odd numbered volumes."},{"Title":"New Testament, No. 3: Luke (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture)","review":"This entire series is fabulous.

It's not a method book on improvisation but it can be used as one. Jerry Coker points out that all of the jazz great musicians are not pulling musical notes out of the air to improvise. Their solos are truly well thought out music compositions. Jerry Coker points out that in order to create or play an improvised solo you do need to know what you are doing. Throughout the book he has shown excerpts from various solos of very great jazz musicians, such as Charlie Parker, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Kenny Dorham just to name several. He has also shown analyses of full solos by some of these great musicians. What Jerry Coker has done is taken this book to explain the various elements of any jazz solo and presented them in a way that any intermediate level musician (possibly a beginner) could understand. I think this book is for the musician that is at an intermediate level in music or jazz music theory to benefit from it. Mr. Coker has identified many improvisational elements that goes into creating musical jazz solos from aural and written analyses of solos. For example, the number patterns, scalar patterns, 3-b9 melodic motion, target note enclosures, 7-3 melodic resolutions, linear harmonic generalizations, the difference between musical quotes and musical licks, bebop scales and more chord related scales and why they work for certain types of chords, bar-line shifts of linear harmony. Mr. Coker tactfully explains each element and how they can be connected to make good melodic sensical jazz music. He has created exercises along with a play-along CD to help the aspiring jazz musician.This book takes the mystery or mystique out of the solos of the jazz greats. It IS possible and probable for any dedicated musician to reach that stature. In the past my lesson teacher would always tell me to play my scales and chords for solos...and I did. But nothing was making any musical sense. After studying this book, my solos now make jazz musical sense because it has musical shape and substance.My final word is that I believe that no musician will be disappointed after studying this book."},{"Title":"Elements of the jazz language for the developing improvisor","review":"This book took my jazz improv to the next level. After practicing scales and standard patterns in all keys I needed ideas to craft more sophisticated solos. This book offered a lot of insight into the nitty gritty of creative, melodic soloing. The text is comprehensive and the exercises are easy to master. Transcriptions from recorded solos by many Jazz greats show the validity and heritage of the licks and principles described. Certain licks and treatment of common chord progressions should be ingrained in one's playing so that one can fly over them without having to think. This book will show you tricks, examples and deliver insight on how to achieve this. I would recommend this book to anyone who is proficient on his/her instrument and wants to get a better understanding on how to play bebop. I am glad I bought this book and I believe no serious Jazz musician should be without it. You can't go wrong with Jerry Coker :-)"},{"Title":"Elements of the jazz language for the developing improvisor","review":"This is not a method book but a useful text laying out essential elements of jazz improvisation, and an excellent reference particularly useful for the aspiring jazz improviser seeking the scope for practicing.The double CD contains numerous examples to illustrate each of the improvisational elements which the famous jazz educator groups into 14 chapters.

Other books that I looked at recommended buying large expensive materials (such as an electric grindstone and a full workbench) but this book starts you off with just the bare essentials and allows you to work up at your own pace."},{"Title":"The Saints' Guide to Happiness","review":"Robert Ellsberg's ALL SAINTS was well received by many Catholic readers and deservedly so. The biographies found in the first book are well researched and his selection of famous and not so famous Christians (and in a few cases non-Christians) is interesting. Ellsberg once again turns to the well known figures in Christian history in his newest work THE SAINTS' GUIDE TO HAPPINESS.In Billy Joel's song \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" he has the famous line \`I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints; the sinners have much more fun.' Joel's assessment is a somewhat popular misconception of the saints. In many cases we view saints as long suffering men and women who hardly see the joy in life. Ellsberg would not agree with this misconception. Using the writings of many of the traditional saints of Christian history, as well as leading religious figures who are not officially recognized as saints, Ellsberg shows that many of the saints strove to love full and vital lives while on earth and were not simply concerned with enduring life on earth to merit the joys of everlasting life. Ellsberg uses Aristotle's definition of happiness as a springboard, that happiness is not merely a feeling of joy, but rather the fullness of life. Saints lived lives to the full, whether it was through their ministry, their interactions with others, the ways in which they endured hardship and suffering, or the way that they died. Throughout the book the reader sees that Ellsberg has great admiration for his subjects and sees their lives as examples of how we can live our lives.The book appears to be a self help book, but it is not a book that gives the reader answers. Rather, it presents the significant aspects of our lives: being alive, work, loving others, suffering, and death, and presents the saints as guides who can assist us as we navigate our own lives.The book is a rather easy read. Ellsberg's writing has a nice flow to it and the book is well organized. Readers can easily sit and read an entire chapter, or read the book slowly in a reflective manner. The hardcover edition of the book has a ribbon which serves as a bookmark, which makes it easy to use as a devotional tool."},{"Title":"The Saints' Guide to Happiness","review":"When Robert Ellsberg's All Saints was reviewed on the campus of Adrian Dominican Sisters, book orders flowed from our well-seasoned readers in the spiritual life. Now with The Saints' Guide to Happiness our community was ready for more substance from Ellsberg, and we have it.This latest work translates the lives of the saints in ways that are helpful, and most importantly, believable to our everyday experience. The eight 'Learning to' chapters offer something for everyone whether we are content with our lives, or living with boredom, or even find ourselves suffering and burdened by doubt.Half the book is taken up with two chapters-Learning to Suffer and Learning to Die- addressing some of the most urgent questions of today in how to put together happiness with suffering and death. After reading those two chapters, one of our members whose illness once took her to the edge of death said, \\"After coping with a life-threatening illness ...you get a clarity of vision and you don't waste time on small things.... The Chapters on suffering and dying in The Saints' Guide to Happiness speaks much to me... I love this book and will keep it with me and read it from time to time so that I get some more encouragement in the 'hard parts' of life.\\"The Saints' Guide heightens our sensitivity \\"to the way God is present in our lives.... The path to happiness is rooted in the place where we are, and not just some holy place somewhere else.\\" Ellsberg's words have found a warm home here in Adrian as he has preached to the preachers a good word!"},{"Title":"The Saints' Guide to Happiness","review":"It is not so much the great amount of interesting information about some very special (but also very normal) people that makes this book worthwhile, but rather the slow and patient vision of true happiness that it weaves. The chapters of the book are structured as lessons to be learned not in order to reach some eventual place of happiness but to lay hold of it now: Learning to Be Still; Learning to Relinquish; Learning to Work; Learning to Suffer; Learning to Die... What is so life affirming about this book is the overwhelming assent to happiness and to its pursuit embodied in persons whom we usually take to be super human in their efforts at self-renunciation. Yes, these were disciplined men and women, but they were also driven by and in pursuit of a Joy that they discovered as the true essence of their human lot. I like the way the book slowly and engagingly transforms our usual, narrow, paltry, notion of a happiness dependent on comfort to one founded on that inner certitude (which can exist even amidst suffering) that we are traveling, slowly but surely, on the path we were meant to travel. And along the way we meet some pretty inspiring fellow travelers not as different from you or me as you would first think."},{"Title":"The Saints' Guide to Happiness","review":"Robert Ellsberg deserves sainthood himself, for putting this wonderful material within easy reach of the lay public -- without losing the depth and nobility of his subject.

With the saints as role models, Mr. Ellsberg guides the reader through some of the more difficult avenues we experience as human beings... forgiveness, love of neighbor, love of self, realizing death as the ultimate human experience...I have purchased and given away several copies of this book - all received with many thanks from friends and family - and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Saints' Guide to Happiness","review":"A very good read...

It helps that Robert Ellsberg was personal friends with at least two of the stars in this book, Henri Nouwen and Dorothy Day. For those mourning the loss of the great Catholic spiritual writers in these harsh days, they can look to Robert Ellsberg. I want many more books from him. He keeps getting better and better. The positive editorial reviews above have it right. This book will make an incomparable Christmas gift. I am right now rereading it from the beginning.

Yet today many people do not know who she is.This book, which is based on Amanda Frisken's doctoral dissertation takes a detailed look at the most important period of Woodhull's career while glossing over the periods before and after. Another interesting aspect of the work is that it uses primarily the reports published in men's illustrated newspapers of the time, called sporting news, as a source. Other sources are used to provide a rich and detailed picture of Woodhull's life, beliefs, and activities, but the unique perspective of this work comes from this original use of these popular newspapers as a source for images and opinions about Woodhull.There may be better biographies that look at her whole life, but for those interested in Woodhull's impact on the USA, this is a great book to read. Included are her free love sexual philosophy, her campaign for president of the United States, her brokerage firm on Wall Street, her newspaper, her influence on American socialism, and her leadership of the Spiritualism community. There are tons of footnotes, but the text can be read without reference to them so it has relevance to both the popular and the scholarly reader."},{"Title":"Victoria Woodhull's Sexual Revolution: Political Theater and the Popular Press in Nineteenth-Century America","review":"While I've just learned of this book, I applaud the writer for investing time on the subject of Victoria Woodhull. She was the first woman to run for US President in 1872. However, she believed in \\"free love\\" not in the practice of sexual encounters but defined as \\"once one falls out of love with their respective lover or husband, one should be free to explore other love relationships.\\" If Woodhull had encountered the sexual liasions some writers have penned, she would have fallen to the social sexual diseases and unwanted pregancies.I recommend anyone interested in Victoria Woodhull to watch the first and only documentary, America's Victoria, Remembering Victoria Woodhull. Captivating and revealing interviews include feminist icon, Gloria Steinem. Woodhull's own words are spoken by actress Kate Capshaw. A new DVD to be released in 2006."},{"Title":"In Defense of Informal Logic (ARGUMENTATION LIBRARY Volume 2)","review":"The author is a professor at University of Oregon whose work shows the influence of the once-famous Wittgensteinian and ordinary language bent of that department. The essays are thematically related by their use of examples from outside philosophy and by their resulting undermining of logical theory. Issues taken up include the following: Has logic understood what arguments are? (no.) How does taking arguments to be series of statements one of which is allegedly supported by the others affect how we do logic? (it leads to incompetence in recognizing arguments.) Is the dichotomy between rhetoric and logic a false dichotomy? (yes, though each and both have strengths to offer in dealing with arguments.) Why do illiterates do so badly at logic? (the researchers who document these results have not understood the limitations of the logical models they use.) Can critical thinking be taught? (not as traditionally conceived.) Is logic applicable to other fields than logic? (Mainly, if at all, by transmogrification of arguments and inferences into purely logical entities.) Have we other ways available to think about argument and disputation? (Zhuangzi offers a radically different way to think of disputation as transforming we who engage in it.) This book is uniquely engaged with fundamental issues at the foundation of logic and critical thinking. Its main result is to call into question as overreaching most of the purported accomplishments of logic, and to call readers back to a careful rethinking of how we do work with arguments."},{"Title":"Kalamazoo, the Place Behind the Products: An Illustrated History","review":"The interesting, ignored and often times forgotten aspects of the history of Kalamazoo, Michigan spring to life in this richly illustrated work. Larry B. Massie and Peter J. Schmitt provide a unique perspective in this volume dedicated to the history of Kalamazoo. Known for the Upjohn Company and its miraculous medical creations, celery, the first pedestrian mall in the United States and for its institutions of higer learning, Kalamazoo was home to many other industries and individuals. Kalamazoo produced everything from cars to carriages, cigars to stoves, paper to plastic and corsets to caskets. The use of historical timelines, advertising materials, artwork, photos, letters, journals, government documents and other ephemera allow the reader to travel back in time and experience life in Kalamazoo as it unfolded. The authors bring the earliest pioneer stories and spirit to life as well as the current development and future of Kalamazoo. As an alumnus of Western Michigan University with a degree in Public History and a Kalamazoo area native, I am pleased to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the historical, social, cultural and political development of midwestern towns. After reading this volume, enjoying its eye pleasing layout and diverse illustrations you will come to believe the popular slogan &quot;Yes! There Really is a Kalamazoo!&quot;"},{"Title":"Kalamazoo, the Place Behind the Products: An Illustrated History","review":"This book makes the history of the products of Kalamazoo seem so real. So much great research and the finding of so many great illustrations, make this book well worth the price. As a former Professional Photographer I wondered if the little knowen company that produced the great Packard Shutter would be mentioned. Sure enough, there is a nice story about the shutter and it's importance in the photograpy industry. When a company folds, little is ever writen as to why. This book explains what happed and why and what took it's place. There are nice little stories and pictures of surrounding villiges like my home town of Comstock.

Joseph Epes Brown treats the subject in a factual and down to earth way, not romantisicing. This book is a fascinating insight into the Spiritual way of the Oglala. It explains about the Oglala's attitude to those who shared the earth, their mother, with them. He explains Mita kuye ayasin - we are relatives- and how the animal spirits could help a man through life. He has a good descriptive set of chapters about the main animals and what they mean to the Oglala. He also shows which animal had which qualities and how these responded to male or female. This is only a book for those who are wiling to accept and to learn. Those who have lost the way will not read it properly. They certainly will not understand it. This book should be read, not with the two eyes of the head but with the Chante Ista, the single eye of the heart. A very enjoyable and informative book."},{"Title":"Animals of the Soul: Sacred Animals of the Oglala Sioux (Earth Quest)","review":"Yay! I love this book!

I was looking for a clear and concise description of animal totems and how they related to the life of the Sioux. I was disappointed as it appeared the author never did quite get across the specific meaning of the animals and their relationship to man. The background material was good as well as the information on dances and ceremonies. Dr. Brown seemed right on the edge of a wonderful definition of the animals but just was not able to get the meaning across."},{"Title":"Animals of the Soul: Sacred Animals of the Oglala Sioux (Earth Quest)","review":"This book is not a comprehensive study of all Oglala beliefs but is a great overview of their main ceremonies and the meaning of the animals they worshipped.

A great book for students of social history."},{"Title":"Savage Pellucidar","review":"&quot;Savage Pellucidar&quot; was the seventh and final volume in the Pellucidar (&quot;At the Earth's Core&quot;) series of Edgar Rice Burroughs, which makes it the third longest ERB series behind the adventures of Tarzan and the Martian books. What we have here are three novellas that were originally published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1942 (&quot;The Return to Pellucidar,&quot; &quot;Men of the Bronze Age,&quot; and &quot;Tiger Girl&quot;), along with a fourth (&quot;Savage Pellucidar&quot;) that was published later.&quot;The Return to Pellucidar&quot; has David Innes, the Emperor of Pellucidar, finally settling an old score with Fash, the King of Suvi. &quot;Men of the Bronze Age&quot; actually has to do with their efforts to find both Dina the Beautiful, who flew off in Abner Perry's balloon, and O-aa. This continues in &quot;Tiger Girl,&quot; where one of the damsels in distress is rescued, with the other being saved in &quot;Savage Pellucidar&quot; (and Abner planning to make a submarine).This brings the Pelluicdar adventures, which have taken place over 40 years at the Earth's Core while 150 have passed in the world above, to a close. &quot;Savage Pellucidar&quot; is a below average ERB adventure, following the standard pattern (the hero has to find and rescue the woman he loves), but there is nothing really new in terms of the wonders of Pellucidar. You can put this one in the ERB pot-boiler category."},{"Title":"Savage Pellucidar","review":"A paradox, a paradoxWe've heard in flocks.But not quite like this paradox.Edgar Rice Burroughs died in 1950. The first Hugo was awarded in 1953. Yet one year, a Burroughs story was nominated for a Hugo-- and I do not mean for a \\"retrospective\\" Hugo. It competed against a number of modern short stories. How did this come to pass?In the early 1960s, in the midst of a \\"Burroughs boom\\" among book publishers, Burroughs's son Hulbert discovered an unpublished novella in a safe. The story was the fourth of a series of Pellucidar stories that appeared in _Amazing_ between 1941 and 1942. (The others were \\"The Return to Pellucidar,\\" \\"Men of the Bronze Age,\\" and \\"Tiger Girl.\\")The new story, \\"Savage Pellucidar,\\" was published for the first time in the October, 1963 issue of _Amazing_ to a certain amount of fanfare. It was nominated as one of the best pieces of shortfiction for the year. (And was beaten by Poul Anderson's \\"No Truce With Kings.\\")The four stories were assembled into a \\"fixup\\" novel in 1963, _Savage Pellucidar_, the seventh and last Pellucidar book. I have a certain fondness for it because of its unusual publishing history. But honesty compels me to say at the outset that it is really not a very good novel. It features Abner Perry, David Innes, Dian the Beautiful, Hodon the Swift, O-aa the cave girl, and the cannibal who is _not_ named Dolly Dorcas as they bumble about from one aimless capture-and-escape episode to another. The villain, Fash, is a bit smarter. But not much. The traps he sets (and which the heroes fall into) wouldn't fool a normal nine year old child.Sometimes Burroughs compensates for such faults by a kind of mythical, dreamlike dazzle to the setting. But myth is best done with a poker face, and _Savage Pellucidar_ is written strickly for laughs. It does not tap into the world of dreams, and it shows us little that is new about Pellucidar. There is a certain good cheer to the stories that is somewhat mitigating. (They were, after all, written just before World War II, and have the optimism of the day.) But _Savage Pellucidar_ remains the weakest book in the series."},{"Title":"Race the Wind! (Willow King) (No. 2)","review":"This bok was totally awesome too.

Now that Katie has gotten past the challenge of saving King's legs, she is faced with more. Cindy's cousin Camela has just come to the stables, and Cindy forces Camela on to Katie. Camela is different because she is blind. Katie tries to help Camela overcome her fear of horses. Also, now that King is ready to be ridden in races, Katie wants to be the one to do it. Just one prob, there is a new jockey, Mark, and he feels that he would be much better suited. Katie has to decide whether she should try for a jockeys licence, or not. As Camela's Irish granddaddy used to say, &quot;Don't worry about your haystacks being blown away when they are tied down&quot;."},{"Title":"Race the Wind!

Katie faces the challenge of getting Willow King to the Kentucky Derby, and helping her new friend, a blind girl named Camela, deal with her own special set of problems. Katie learns a lot about having faith in herself, and in the end, what it takes to be a true champion."},{"Title":"Race the Wind! (Willow King) (No. 2)","review":"I read Willow King with excitement, hoping that it would not be like all the other racing books published, in which 13 year olds are racing horses (let's hope this never happens). I was happy to find that it was not, although I thought the role of the trainer of Raging Wind was a little bit of a racing book cliche. Excitedly, I picked up Race the Wind, expecting it to be just like the first book. What I found was one that was much better. Chris Platt has stepped it up a notch with this novel. Katie, Jason, John and King are working towards going to the Kentucky Derby. This book introduces two more characters, as well. Camela, a blind cousin of Cindy's who is deathly afraid of horses and is &quot;dumped&quot; on Katie to entertain. The next is a handsome new jockey called Mark. Katie develops a slight crush for him and Jason of course has something against him. Mark leads them through many adventures and helps teach Katie so that she can get her jockey's license. This book was great--it truly shared the ups and downs of life as a jockey and horse lover. I recommend it to anyone who likes horses."},{"Title":"Race the Wind! (Willow King) (No. 2)","review":"This novel, sequel to the original story of Willow King, I strongly recommend to anyone interested in horses. It is the story of a young girl who comes from behind with her horse Willow King to go for a million dollars in the famous race at Belmont, the Kentucky Derby. It shares her feelings as she trains to be a jockey despite the discrimination and hard work involved on her way to the top. Despite everything, she works hard to achieve her goals while dealing with her uncertainty and strenuous training. I recommend this book and the original to everyone as a truly moving and heartwarming duo of the world of women jockeys."},{"Title":"Race the Wind! (Willow King) (No. 2)","review":"Arter reading the firse one about Willow King and Katie, I just had to read the second one and was not disapointed.

She works super hard and eventually, makes it to being a jockey. While in the mean time, meets Camela who is Cindy's cousin who is also blind. Together, they are able to learn a bit from the other."},{"Title":"Race the Wind! (Willow King) (No. 2)","review":"This was a great book!! I absolutly loved it! I think that it deserves 5 stars more than any other book. It is about a girl named Katie who wants to take her horse Willow King to the Kentucky Derby and ride him in it. Katie is a girl thet was born with one leg shorter than the other. In the 1st book, Willow King is born with crooked legs and is going to be put down. But Katie knows how he feels and saves him and turns him into a race horse. Along the way (in the sequel) she meets a blind girl Camela and has to deal with Mark, the jockey who wants to ride Willow King in the derby. I also reccomend the 1st book, Willow King.

The book gives a good account of America's most ignored frontier.Dan HigginsTulsa, Oklahoma"},{"Title":"The trial of the witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus","review":"One of the great benefits of having a Kindle is that one can read old books for free. Included in that would be a book such as \\"Trial of the Witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus\\" (TWRJ) by Thomas Sherlock. The book was written in 1729 in response to the deist Thomas Woolston. Sherlock presents the case in a court room setting with the gospels being tried. Woolston takes one position and Sherlock another before a judge. Sherlock disposes of Woolston's arguments as well as giving the positive evidence.The reader could be surprised to see that some modern controversies are still showing up and even answered beforehand. For instance, this book was published nineteen years before Hume's \\"Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\\" and yet already, Hume's argument is dealt with. If we are to judge everything by our own experience, what of someone who lives in a tropical culture and is told about such a thing as water freezing and becoming solid? It will be outside of their experience and they have no basis to accept it other than the personal testimony of someone who says otherwise. (Note also these cultures would not have access to television or internet)Also, it is my opinion that back then, Christians faced off against better arguments. Their opponents were far more informed. This is different from today where one can just be stunned at the ignorance of people like the new atheists in the areas of philosophy, theology, and biblical studies.Sherlock's presentation in this work is quite strong fortunately which leads to the next conclusion. The opponents had better arguments, but fortunately, so did the Christians. Sherlock shows that for Woolston, explaining the Christian account of reality is quite difficult, and this even without much of our modern understanding of how the biblical world was an honor-shame culture. It is a wonder to think about what Sherlock would have said if he had been around today and imbibed himself of some of what we've learned since his time.Some arguments back then were seen as bizarre ipso facto. Would that they still were. Consider this on page 33. \\"...if the argument be good at all, it will be good to prove, that there never was such a man as Jesus in the world. Perhaps the gentleman may think that this is a little too much to prove: and if he does, I hope he will quit the argument in one case as well as in the other; for difference there is none.\\"Yes. The idea that Jesus never existed was seen as ludicrous. If only such thinking was around today, but unfortunately internet atheists regularly buy into this idea. Some will say that they think that He did exist, but it's possible to build a convincing case that He didn't. Oh wait. It's not just internet atheists any more. Dawkins on page 122 of \\"The God Delusion\\" says it's possible to build a serious though not widely supported case that Jesus never even existed. On page 127 of \\"The New Atheism\\", Victor Stenger says that we know Joseph Smith existed, but we cannot be so sure in the case of Muhammad or Jesus. In \\"The Portable Atheist\\", starting on page 430, Ibn Warraq, an ex-Muslim, starts an argument for the case that Jesus never even existed.Tell any of these guys that ID is serious science (A case I'm not arguing for here.) and you'll be laughed to no end. Yet here these non-specialists come out and make the case that the Jesus myth is serious history. Perhaps the advice on page 4 of TWRJ would help. \\"He is but a poor council who studies on one side of the question only.\\"Ultimately, the case will come down to Sherlock's greatest proclamation in my opinion in the book. On page 15 he gives the challenge to Woolston. \\"There is therefore here no medium: you must either admit the miracle or prove the fraud.\\"And today, the challenge still stands. Someone must admit the miracle or prove the fraud, and it looks like the fraud side is lacking even more today.In Christ,Nick PetersDeeper Waters Christian Ministries"},{"Title":"The trial of the witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus","review":"Pro-arguments are solidly built.However the counter arguments are weak and artficial.

The basic theme is that humans have colonized the planet Mercury, and life is hard. The protagonist has established a strange friendship with one of the local life forms, which is a being that is essentially an electromagnetic field. There is an excellent story here, and I very much regret that this one has long been out of print. Come on, Amazon, let's get cracking on getting this one out again, perhaps on Kindle. If you find it, buy and read it. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Battle on Mercury","review":"Even though the science is outdated, I still enjoyed the book.

This is an excellent book for those researching the same."},{"Title":"Creativity And The Mind","review":"Three PhD's whose specialty is cognitive pyschology put together a summary in 1995 of research on creativity. It makes very interesting reading because this cognitive research approach can control variables and determine what are the actual causal factors that lead to creating great ideas or products.It easy to read and contains lots of good footnotes and discussion about what makes a practical good idea. I would have given the book a 5 if it had organized and discussed the techniques more. I had to work hard to pull out and organize their main recommended techniques. However, I'm glad I bought the book.This book is recommended for those who want a background on creativity from researchers... and that is somewhat easy to read. If you are looking for a list of creativity techniques to immediately apply, you might find this book to be interesting but not enough of a cookbook... although they do offer some great ideas. Many of the ideas were proposed by others, but these authors show some of the research behind why they work.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"},{"Title":"Revenge of the Rainbow Dragons (An Endless Quest Book, 8506)","review":"I got this book at the age of 13 when it was first released. Since then, I have found a second copy at a used book store and have kept both copies in my home ever since. These days, I read them aloud to my children.While I was one of the many kids who loved the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books as a child, this book was the rare title that followed the same formula and bettered it so much that it alone was enough to make you want to toss all the others into the garbage. Sadly, it was the only one of the &quot;Endless Quest&quot; books that was this good, but the one good one was a powerhouse.As the young wizard apprentice Jaimie, you and your two best friends, a talking fox and a talking owl (simply named Fox and Owl) have come with wizard Pentegarn to settle a problem with the three wizards currently ruling in the now-tattered rainbow castle. But you have been tricked, so while Pentergarn fights for his life you, Fox and Owl have been sent to another area entirely. It's up to you to get back to Pentegarn and help him.Rose Estes is a natural for this sort of storytelling. She has a strong, mature style in her manner and handles the layout of the entire book with lots of intelligent planning, yet keeps the slightest suggestion of a child's fairy tale present just enough to keep it lighthearted (she eases the dark mystery of the cloud castle's tempting table by presenting its food and drink as &quot;cookies, cakes, ice cream and candy&quot;, for example). And there are some genuinely humorous moments both clever and refreshingly original for this sort of book, such as the antics of Fox and Owl in the enchanted library. And Harry Quinn's illustrations are among the best I've seen in fantasy literature.If you stumble across this one, trust me--you will adore it and will read it again and again as much as any of the fairy tales you loved as a child."},{"Title":"Revenge of the Rainbow Dragons (An Endless Quest Book, 8506)","review":"Like the other endless quests books, it is up to you to decide the hero's fate and the plot. It was my favorite endless quest book as a child, mostly because I love dragons. It's fun to read and different from the other books in Sci-fic."},{"Title":"Luis Caballero: Paintings and Drawings","review":"This book is richly illustrated with beautifully coloured reproductions of many of Caballero's paintings. Mostly they show the male, wounded, in a sort of ecstasy of pain. They are powerfully erotic, but in the distanced way that we see in Bernini's St. Theresa. Caballero, however, uses paint, not marble, so the paintings are hotter, more immediate. Edward Lucie Smith's essay, all too brief, convincingly sets Caballeros' work in the context of a brutal South American experience, and in world art generally. Caballeros' death from the results of AIDS adds a poignancy to this stangely moving book."},{"Title":"Luis Caballero: Paintings and Drawings","review":"The paintings of Luis Caballero are now in the realm of shrines or altars to the plagues that merged as one in the form of AIDS in the 20th Century. These paintings and drawings are not grotesque: these works are packed with the immediacy of facing a finite life whether that terminal state is due to disease as in the artist's case or to other horrors such as wars, brutality, homophobia, random acts of violence. Caballero was a brilliant draughtsman and captured so much movement in his line that the figures, though languishing, still maintain a quality of constant movement. Edward Lucie-Smith adds his usually fine comments to this monograph. This is one collection of art that goes beyond just being art to being an homage to the artist's plight. And isn't that what great art is, afterall?"},{"Title":"Italian Picture Word Book (Dover Children's Language Activity Books)","review":"Easy to read and work through.

I was delighted when my Mother told me that my nephew approached her and said, \\"Where's that Italian book that Zio got me?\\" She said they sat and learned words together and colored the pictures.

But there is already a separate book called \\"The Encyclopedia Of Rock, Pop and Soul\\". So I would have preferred this title to remain focused on the folk and blues traditionalists.Also the essays, which range from a couple of paragraphs to several pages, are most typically a short biographical account mixed with a summary of record releases.

My Master's studies in Psychology have taken me into a different sub-genre, but I have kept not only the draft version, but a published version of this book as well. I have loaned it out to students and friends who are dealing with abuse and they have found it invaluable.

In describing the areas, the author explains the directions and difficulties that were endured getting to the actual site. There is history about the towns and the author also notes the cause of a towns' demise. There are wonderful anecdotes from old-timers and some humorous tales of the author's travels. It is a book that makes for good reading, but not one that may be easily referred to during traveling, so reading and taking notes or marking pages is helpful. There are descriptions of the roads, but not all directions are clear whether some of these roads are accessible without a four-wheel drive vehicle. Many good photographs, but all pictures are in black and white. It does however make this reader want to get off the couch to travel and explore."},{"Title":"Ghost Towns of the Northwest","review":"This is an absolute great book about searching out and exploring all kinds of abandoned towns in the boonies of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. The author explores a total of 62 ghost towns. It would be of interest to history buffs, explorers, and off-roaders, as well as nature lovers. It's interesting, even if you never venture out your front door. Weis is a great writer, with a light, lively and humorous style as he recounts the ups and downs of back roads, dirt trails and encounters with locals as he tracks down these lost worlds of the west. And Weis is also truly an outstanding photographer, with dozens of dramatic black and white photos here to prove it. We've all heard about a handful of \\"tourist attraction\\" ghost towns, but this author, after checking out a few of those, goes way beyond and finds all kinds of ghost towns that truly have been forgotten. Reading this book is truly inspiring, encouraging readers to go out and explore and find their own lost towns with their weed-filled roads and teetering buildings, and perhaps a few odd characters lurking about. Weis gives tips for how to study topograhic maps to discover old town sites and what it takes to get to them. This book really strikes a chord in the heart of all would-be explorers and western history buffs. This is truly an enjoyable book, mixing light history, exploration, and just plain fun. It includes maps, and lots of great info. Who knows what has become of these ghost towns since this book was written? Weis' book makes that a question most people who read it will be hankering to explore."},{"Title":"Ghost Towns of the Northwest","review":"Received this book just before going out West on vacation. We were able to easily locate an unused part of an old wagon train trail near the area we were camping. So with metal detector in hand and nothing but this book and a county map, off we go. Using the landmarks and county roads referenced in this book, we found a two-track trail that our four-wheel drive pickup could handle. This lead us to an abandoned town that was not visable from any of the roads. There were 4 buildings still standing, including the livery for the Pony Express riders. Also, an old gravesite marked with a historical placque and stone markers identifying this as part of the Oregon Trail. This was the highlight of our trip and out teenager is now hooked on HISTORY!

The writing is entertaining and informative, including some accounts with \\"current\\" locals--and the pictures are great. The sole reason for not giving the work a 5 of 5 is that it is a bit dated; the current state of these locations are not what they were when the work was published in 1971. Some of these towns have disappeared entirely since the author's visit, reclaimed by nature or the land owners where the properties once sat, and other towns have undergone revitalization, making them a lot less ghosty.However, as far as history, story telling and a black & white glimpse of northwest ghost towns, you won't find many guides better than this."},{"Title":"Chernobyl: The Forbidden Truth","review":"Chernobyl: The Forbidden Truth is about the inadequate care of the victims of Chernobyl, the inadequate immediate response to the accident, the inadequate records-keeping of the investigaters, and the continuing cost in human and animal suffering caused by this tragedy. Dr. Gofman's foreward is an important addition that ties the book's litany of problems together with a description of what should be done instead regarding investigating the exact size of the calamity. Millions of Curies of various radioactive substances were released (some long-lived, some not so long-lived), but no one really knows where it all went and who is absorbing a dose right now. This is, however, a chronic problem with nuclear activities around the world, and not limited to Chernobyl.In particular, Gofman's NINE ESSENTIAL RULES OF INQUIRY should be required reading for everyone involved in such research. It outlines important requirements for all such testing. Gofman is a Professor Eme! ritus of Medical Physics at the University of California at Berkeley. He is a co-discoverer of Uranium-233 and isolated the world's first &quot;working quantities&quot; of plutonium at Robert Oppenhiemer's personal request for the Manhattan Project during WWII. Since that service to America he has continued to research radiation and its effect on human health and is referred to as &quot;brilliant&quot; by even his adversaries.His comments belong not only in the foreward of this important book, but they also belong pasted to the desks of every nuclear scientist who ever tried to answer the question of just how low a level of radiation is actually &quot;safe&quot;.Perhaps if/when they find an answer to that question Gofman's comments will no longer apply, but that day appears to be far off, when our best &quot;research event&quot; ever in the field of human radiation experiments (at least, the best &quot;research event&quot; since Hiroshima and Nagasaki) is as poorly han! dled as it was -- and is -- being handled, as is made clear! in Alla Yaroshinskaya's monumental book."},{"Title":"Chernobyl: The Forbidden Truth","review":"Ms. Yaroshinskaya's telling of her struggle to publish the truth about the Chernobyl disaster ranks among the best of this type.

The book would have been improved by its omission."},{"Title":"Chernobyl: The Forbidden Truth","review":"This book contains the best description yet of what exactly happened at Chernobyl.

An individual who had the appropriate civil service rank was appointed director of the facility, even though he had no understanding of a nuclear reactor, and had never worked at a nuclear power plant. (The bulk of his experience was in large transformers for long-distance power lines.) He simply marched in and demonstrated his authority by giving orders to the reactor operators until he had created a meltdown. By the time that the district manager arrived - horrified - and took over, the damage was done. This basically parallels the experience at Three Mile Island, where the \\"suits\\" harassed the operators into geting the plant online (several months before it should have been) before a certain deadline, in order to satisfy the depreciation rules in the tax code.The technology is perfectly safe; the danger is in allowing poorly educated jerks to be in charge."},{"Title":"Mad's Don Martin Comes on Strong","review":"For many years, Mad Magazine was the shining example of sarcastic humor for adults. It was apolitical in the sense that everyone was fair game and there was no paid advertising because the publishers felt that it would restrict their range of targets. Young people also enjoyed the magazine, I was fortunate when I was in middle school that one of my friends would bring his copy to school and allow me to read it. Even the creators of the magazine were satirized in the pages of Mad.This book maintains those high (or as the publishers would say low) standards of humor. It is often stupid and ridiculous, yet it is filled with dialog that sometimes has subtle and double meanings. Unlike many of the other books from Mad, this one contains no storylines that were framed in a historical context of current events. Therefore, the modern reader can easily appreciate the story. Given what passes for humor in the modern world, this book and the others like it are shining examples of good, clean fun."},{"Title":"The philosophy of a future state","review":"Although Dick's science is obsolete, his speculative reasoning as to the existence of God and what is in store for humans in the future (heaven) is intriguing and tantalizing. Dick combines science and religion in ways that make science fiction writers today seem banal and unimaginative in comparison."},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"This book is one of the most interesting political autobiographies I have read (and I've read many of them). I must confess that interest was intensified due to the fact that I worked in the House of Commons during her tenure in office, and indeed worked during the 1987 General Election for two Conservative Members of Parliament (David Amess of Basildon and David Evennett of Erith &amp; Crayford--yes, I know, you've never heard of either of them).This is actually the first volume of Margaret Thatcher's books to be published; the prequel is 'The Path to Power' and there is a follow-up, 'The Collected Speeches', but for those interested, 'The Downing Street Years' is the book to have.It begins with the 1979 General Election, and carries forward to her resignation as Prime Minister a decade later. In this volume are her perspectives on all the various Cabinet intrigues, shuffles and reshuffles; her attempts to find civil servants and other helpers who were not of the old guard but of a new mentality, often asking, 'Is he one of us?' by which she meant, not is he a Conservative, but rather, will he get something accomplished, is he a do-er?Thatcher's perspectives on the various scandals and inter-Cabinet fighting makes for interesting reading -- she is candid in her likes and dislikes among her Cabinet colleagues. Her final row with Geoffrey Howe, who delivered a scathing speech in the HoC that mostly prompted the leadership crisis, is enlightening. (I've not seen his version, if one exists--it would be good to compare the two sides.) She was very disappointed at the end when she thought she had the continued support of the party, but each of her ministers and 'friends' told her in turn that while he supported her, others would not. She saw the writing on the wall, and after having won the first ballot for party leadership but not by a sufficient majority to avoid a second ballot, she resigned in favour of John Major (whose autobiography, recently issued, is also well worth reading, particularly for his comments about how Thatcher tried to maintain a controlling influence over him from behind the office).You might be tempted, if you're not really into politics and not reading this for scholarly purposes, to skim over various minor issues that are gone into great detail. Historians are appreciative, but I seriously ask myself how many non-political scientists and historians will read through all the detail of what are now minor bits of history?In all, a brilliant career, the first woman head of government in a major Western democracy, and well worth reading on the whole."},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"If you're interested in how a strong-willed conservative would deal with an ingrained socialist government (not to mention society), give this tome a look-see. Very well written, brutally honest, with just enough of Lady Thatcher's dry Brit humor to spice things up. As another reviewer has pointed out, though, if you're American and unfamiliar with certain British lingo, be prepared to scratch your head on occasion. Favorite quote from the book: &quot;It was not long before the conversation turned from trivialities-- for which neither Mr. Gorbachev nor I had any taste-- to a vigorous two-way debate. In a sense, the argument has continued ever since and is taken up whenever we meet; and as it goes to the heart of what politics is really about, I wouldn't have it any other way&gt;&quot;"},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"Lady Thatcher gives very detailed insights into her eleven years as the British prime minister. It seems like she covers everything that happened in those eleven years in her political life, she is 100 percent a politician. However, she doesn't give out any details about how her marriage with Denis must have been influenced by her incredible workload. She has written a very detailed account of her years in power, and it takes quite a while for those interested to swallow the 800+ pages. It is well worth it though, because it is often very interesting and Lady Thatcher has quite a sense of humour. I recommend this to everybody who has any interest in British or international politics in the 1980s."},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"Highly interesting and exhaustively detailed first-hand account of the first female UK premier. In the 1980s, Britain could arguably be defined by three things: Diana, Pop music, and Margaret Thatcher-- it is refreshing to see the least showy of the three recall her memoirs. Although the Iron Lady's sometime turbulent relationship with the Queen is hardly ever mentioned. In fact, Her Majesty barely appears at all...in that case, you will have to consult a biography for her infamous debacle with the Queen over the Commonwealth. Still, highly recommended...even if you need to take it's mammoth size in small doses. A great read."},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"I thought that this was a very interesting biography of an most unusual modern leader. Lady Thatcher gives a very detailed account of her 11 years as British Prime Minister, devoting a generous amount of space to the Falklands War, the Troubles in Northern Ireland, her dealings with a wide variety of foreign leaders, and her tackling of major domestic problems. While I found the book interesting, I had difficulty with some of the terms that Lady Thatcher uses, as I am not familiar with the finer points of British politics."},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"I thought that this was an interesting autobiography of a most unusual modern leader.

While I enjoyed the book, I had difficulty with some of the terms that Lady Thatcher uses.

Thatcher led the UK out of the \\"pit\\" of socialism (and closed a few pits too!)Sadly the world lacks Politicians with conviction when we need them more than ever. This book will restore your faith in the fact that real politicians DO and WILL have an opinion. Love her or hate her she DID change her times...and sat down to write about how she left her mark. The creed of Thatcherism will not die and just look at New Labour, she even convinced the left to move to the right!"},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"Nothing does more to broaden one's philosophical outlook than a vicarious thrill ride through the life of a British politician. With ease, Thatcher and the 'expert wordsmiths' who assisted her (sherpas, she calls them)managed to integrate a crash course in the workings of the country's eccentric political system into a confrontational, articulate memoir of a tenacious leader and, I daresay, cultural icon of the previous decade. Her dismissal of her reputedly glacial relations with the Queen does not, I'm afraid, bear close examination, and why precisely she saw fit to give Chancellor Lawson such a free reign with the money supply defies explanation. Nevertheless, it's a delightful read and an eye-opening experience for youthful, over-ironized individuals like myself. With Margaret Thatcher, what you see is what you get. How refreshing."},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"As a Brit, I don't need to be tutored in the political vocabulary of Great Britain; however, Americans might find the book difficult to read, partly due to their lack of knowledge of the British government and its M.O., and partly due to the sheer size of the book. It is quite long."},{"Title":"The Downing Street Years","review":"It is a huge book but the content is boring, I suggest looking elsewhere for an informative and interesting biography ."},{"Title":"Anton York, Immortal","review":"I was looking for this book for many years. This is a classic for me because as I remember, this was my first non-cartoon book. Science fiction adquired its name with this text."},{"Title":"Look What You Can Make with Craft Sticks","review":"This book is really great for kids. All the projects are very simple and the instructions are very easy. I use this book for the class of art and the students of fifth grade love all the crafts."},{"Title":"Look What You Can Make with Craft Sticks","review":"Hey, readers, craft sticks are fun! My kids loved 'em, my grandkids love 'em, my students love 'em - they've always been favorites around here! There are cool new ideas in this small, user-friendly book. It may contain a couple of your old favorites but you're bound to find something new, too."},{"Title":"Look What You Can Make with Craft Sticks","review":"This book is a great asset to my Nanny craft collection. I love it, and it gives me more ideas for the children I Nanny."},{"Title":"Look What You Can Make with Craft Sticks","review":"NOT WORTH PURCHASING. Over priced for what little it has to offer. Too simplistic. A poor excuse for a craft stick project book."},{"Title":"Look What You Can Make with Craft Sticks","review":"My kids 3 & 5 love to do crafts from this book. It's not a monster book with 500 crafts, so it's easy for them to look through it and pick something out. Doable crafts for young children. Also, they give you a list of materials to have on hand in the front of the book."},{"Title":"Look What You Can Make with Craft Sticks","review":"I was disappointed with this book. There are not many craft ideas that I would attempt with children, especially a group of children. I originally bought this thinking I could use some ideas for our Bible School classes or for one of our Girl Scout outings. I was hoping for some ideas that were a little easier. Most of these you have to stay with your child and do it with them. Today parents have to do so much homework with children that it would be nice if they could have a few craft projects that they could do by themselves or with a friend after school for pleasure. There are some ideas here but I am going to use only 4 of the projects. If you like to sit and do this with your child and in most cases, do this for your child because it is too hard, then buy the book. I found much more fun ideas by searching Google for popsicle crafts."},{"Title":"Look What You Can Make with Craft Sticks","review":"Kelly loves children, Kelly knows writing, and it shows in her latest work. The craft ideas featured here are creative, and the wording of the book will appeal to younger children. It'd be a good idea to jump on this book now, as I genuinely believe Kelly Milner Halls is going to end up being nationally recognized as one of the most gifted children's authors around."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This is a wonderful series--one of Linda Chaikin's best, though she could have wrapped things up in the third novel much better. The first book, however, is almost perfect, and I couldn't put it down. The story is complex enough without being confusing, and it's much less complicated than Chaikin's \\"Heart of India\\" series. The story is compelling and exciting, and as usual, Chaikin inserts many historical facts about the time period that kept me interested and made me want to learn for myself about the Caribbean in the early 17th century.The characters are written so well that you can almost see them, and each character is developed and given plenty of backstory. The romance is amazing; each interaction between Emerald and Baret left me holding my breath, and their conversations and sarcastic banter often made me laugh out loud! The best part about the romance, however, is how gradual it is. Too often in Christian romance, it's \\"love at first sight\\"; the characters seem to love each other from the first page! Baret's love for Emerald, however, is extremely refreshing, as there's another woman in the picture, and he's often very unsure of how he feels about everything. You hardly ever see that kind of scenario in Christian romance these days, so I was pleasantly surprised with the relationship between Baret and Emerald and how it progressed.This is definitely the best book of the three...it goes a little downhill from here, but overall, this is a great series, and one that should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I believed this book to be one of the most outstanding books I have ever read! It is amazing how this author captivates you in the way she writes. She makes the world of buccaneering come to life. I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure and romance!!!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I've read all of Linda's 4 trilogy series and they were all great! Miss Chaikin is a excellent writer who captures the reader right off. She somehow sweeps you right off your feet with her touching romances. And would you believe it! ; there is no sex or vulgar language. The way she brings God into her stories and how he affects the main characters is amazing! Baret and Emerld are two unforgetable people. Emerld is a beautiful young lady who uses her gift God has given her to work on the plantation slave school and translates songs. Baret is a dashing rouge who becomes a Buccaneer in order to find his father who he still believes is a live. Linda's books are so enrapturing I feel like I'm being sucked into each one. After reading this book and the two that follow I can't help, but wish I could fall in love with someone like Baret."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I'm always searching for Christian authors that write novels with depth, yet be entertaining. This is the first book by Chaikin I have read, and I truly enjoyed it. The book premise based in the 1600's in Jamaica is refreshing as well. I admit I was skeptical about this book because the cover looked so ridiculous, however, I have to say that the Buccaneers Series books are among my favorites."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"A great start to a series! Intrigue, danger, and adventure are woven into an well-developed plot. Emerald Harwick is quite an inspiring woman who faces hard times in the tropical island of Jamaica; being rejected by her aristocratic family. Baret Buckington, a viscount turned buccaneer, is on a quest to find his imprisoned father though declared dead. Emerald is desperately trying to escape Port Royal with her fiance and cousin Minette. Emerald's father has other ideas regarding Emerald's future and Baret has a part in that plan. What I really hope for in these series that Baret will find his father and Emerald find someone to love and help her deal with the family's obvious rejection and defend her mother's reputation and her own. It leaves you hanging at the end and desperate to get the 2nd book in the series!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I love pirate romance novels, and it was refreshing to read one that didn't have the gratuitous sex that is so common in a typical romance novel. The story line here is also much more interesting, interwoven as it is with historical fact. I did note one historical error that somehow got by the editors: Emerald finds a portrait miniature of her cousin Lavendar on Baret's ship; she later refers to the painted miniature as a photograph (p. 116) -- and we know photographs weren't invented until a couple hundred years later. But overall, this book was enjoyable; I look forward to reading the following two in the series."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This book is one of my favorite books ever. Its historical accuracy and intrieging love story are truely amazing. I have read this book three times and enjoy it the same if not more each time I read it. Mrs. Chaikin is my favorite Christian author and has influenced my life greatly through her many fabulous novels. I check the shelves at my local book store weekly for a new book. Thank-you. She has made many dull study halls at school come to life with her adventures."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"Well first I have to say one thing. The review at the top was just a little misinformed. Emerald plans to marry Jamie, not Baret, and her father's not brutal! Anyway, this book was awesome. I am so glad I bought it, it was definietly worth the price I paid for it. Miss Emerald Harwick, the granddaughter of a French pirate, tries to elope with a servant and finds herself sort-of-kidnapped on a ship full of pirates greedy for lost treasure! The captain of the ship, Sir Baret &quot;Foxworth&quot; Buckington, is the usual dashing, buff, black-haired pirate whom all the women love, and Emerald seems to have mixed feelings about him. First she loves him, then she hates him, then she loves him... get the picture. Well anyway, I absolutely loved this book and I'm dyng to read the next one. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I love coming across great books like this and being totally blown away while reading them! Linda Chaikin has definitely been added to my list of favorite authors. I love also, that this is the first book in a series of three, meaning there's lots of time to get to know the characters even better and to anticipate what's coming! Book one, Port Royal, gives just a glimpse of the coming romance between Baret and Emerald. The story line is so well written, with plenty of excitment and action. I love pirate stories and this author has obviously done much research. Cannot wait to read the rest of the series and then check out Chaikin's other titles!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I highly recommend it, and would give it more stars if I could. It is a story of romance and adventure. It's great Christian fiction."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This book was a beautiful romance full of adventure.It has it all; drama, romance, action, adventure,and even comedy. I would advise anyone who enjoyed this book to also read Captive Heart by Linda Chaikin, and anyone who hasn't read this book should.I couldn't put it down the first time I read it and still can't today. So if your looking for a good book this is the one!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for: romance, intrigue, and believable characters. However, I was surprised at how much I loved it! Not many authors can pull off the exotic setting (pirates, Jamaica, hundreds of years ago) and still allow the reader to relate to the book. I can't wait to read the next books; thank you so much, Linda Chaikin!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I love how the author encorporates history into the story line. This is definitely worth getting and reading. You will get sucked into the story line."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"Port Royal is the first book of Linda Chaikin's Buccaneers series, and the series is super terrific. One of those that I read again and again and alternately imagined several variants to the written ending. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This is one of my favorite series by Linda Chaikin. In any Chaikin novel you can expect to find deeply developed characters, an intriguing and unpredictable plot, finely woven details, a hero who is captivating, a heroine who is strong in spirit, and a love story that ends the way you want it to but is full of twists and turns along the way. There is passion without sex and action and suspense that keeps you up til sunrise. Even the third time through the same book.This book meets every criteria I've come to expect from this phenomenal author. The story is well researched and includes details about slavery, politics, and the peerage written smoothly into the pages.Barret...Fox.... what a guy. He is the type of hero girls dream of. Rich, righteous, handsome (except he has a mustache... but I just pictured him w/out it because that's not my thing ;) and witty. Emerald is young, clever, and loyal. It is fun watching the two interact. Sparks fly from the start with these two.I have read the paperback version of this book 3 times in the last 5yrs but have not read it lately because I'm spoiled by my kindle. Imagine my delight to find that a kindle edition has been released!!! I eagerly await the kindle edition release of MORE of her early works!!!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This is by far my favorite series, I love the history, the suspense, and the overall believability of the characters. I also really like the fact that the people aren't \\"perfect\\" and have to overcome spiritual and mental obstacles as well as sword fights and witty dialogue."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This book is exceptionally well written. I was completely enthralled. It gives you a great perspective on the historical happenings of the day. Emerald is an exceptional girl with wonderful character, and Baret is an exciting adventurer. You won't be able to put this book down, it is wonderful!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"Baret and Emerald are thrilling charactors. You wouldn't want to put this book down. This is an exciting book. You'll love it! Way to go Linda!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"The Buccaneers series was the best series I have read in a very long time. I am not over exaggerating to make it sound better then it was...I was totally enthrawled in it and couldn't put it down. The second and third books only get better. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is needing a good romance, some adventure, a little sorrow, a lot of smiles and laughter, or just a flat-out wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"This is the most captivating book! To follow Emerald through her struggles and finally realize who she loves. this book is exceptionally well written. Linda Chaiken makes it seem as if you are right there in the middle of the action."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"I found &quot;Port Royal&quot; one of the most captivating stories I have ever read. The heroine had her own identity in every sense of the word. She was brave, a bit stubborn, and feminine. I enjoyed the fast-paced action and sweet yet &quot;un-mushy&quot; romance depicted in the novel. I have only one complaint; the story should not have continued into a third novel. Books 1 &amp; 2 were wonderful, but 3 was a bit of a let down. Overall, they were entertaining and fun."},{"Title":"Port Royal","review":"After reading all 3 books in the Buccaneers series I couldn't believe it was over. This story hold the readers attention til the very end. The reader becomes involved in the story. Of all the words to describe this tale, intrigue and amazment are two that come to mind. I recommend this book to any lady,or anyone who enjoys adventure, intrigue, and only the most romantic of romances."},{"Title":"More Paperwork","review":"As used book, a bargain, but if you payed full price, that was just too much. I expected more, more alternative thinking, not just a portfolio book."},{"Title":"Moving Windows: Evaluating the Poetry Children Write","review":"This book contains over 300 poems and prose poems, that Jack Collom has collected from poetry workshops that he has led, as a visiting poet, in New York City schools. Collom presents his students' work (the student's year in school follows the name) and provides a brief commentary directly following each piece. The majority of poems are written by third through sixth graders. This is a tightly packed book, pieces are wide ranging, and I often felt I was reading an anthology.Each chapter contains a good number of poems produced from specific exercises, ie: Place poems (ask the student to write about a place they know well); Acrostic poems (writing a word vertically and use its letters to begin lines); Lunes (simplification of formal haiku, one counts words: three/five/three) William Carlos Williams imitations (This is Just to Say, included in the Appendix). A teacher could certainly use many of Collom's exercises in class or workshop.Collom's critiques of the poems are very brief. While I understand not wanting to clutter an already packed book, I would have liked to read some more detail instead of just one-word sentences as: \\"Bop\\", or \\"A wildflower\\"I would not necessarily consider this a theory book. Those wishing to learn the elements of poetry and how to critique a poem would not learn much. Collum's brief comments are merely glimpses into the poem - his lack of description will not leave the reader with a new found appreciation for evaluation of the written form. That being said, there is a peculiar enthusiasm for teaching to be discovered in this book as the works included are a fantastic way to rediscover the language of the child. In the end, many of Collum's one sentence critiques are overshadowed by the brilliance of his students' poetry."},{"Title":"Gun fodder;: The diary of four years of war,","review":"A well written Book, written by an Author who knows his craft. It did lack a little depth in a way, because it was written by an Officer, one of the chosen, who's path was selected the moment that he opened his mouth, so consequently saw the war from the saddle while his 'Servants' and men ate mud, slept in mud, starved and were punished.This does not mean that he wasn't a brave man or that he didn't suffer hardships, but much of his tale revolves around him reporting events rather than suffering the horrible deprivations that were the western front."},{"Title":"New York's Bravest: Eight Decades of Photographs from the Daily News","review":"By far,some of the most historic photographs of the FDNY. Just enough commentary to allow the photos to speak for themselves. A must for all Firefighters!"},{"Title":"New York's Bravest: Eight Decades of Photographs from the Daily News","review":"Patrice O'Shaughnessy and Shawn O'Sullivan are both New York Daily News Photographers and as such have compiled a tremendous aray of great pictures of New York's firefighters at work and at play.These pictures span eight decades from the early 1920's to the present. They traverse a wide array of emotions from a group of firemen posing with a woman whose baby they helped deliver to a son visiting his dying father in the Burn Unit. There are also a tremendous amount of photos that show the FDNY at work and these are incredible in that they show such a consistent theme of self-sacrifice and personal discipline, tempered with the fun-loving, zest for life that these men have exhibited throughout the years.This is a GREAT piece of photojournalism. 9-11 may have made this book more poignant, but it's the rich historical pictorial that makes it a treasure."},{"Title":"New York's Bravest: Eight Decades of Photographs from the Daily News","review":"I bought this book for my firefighter son for Christmas. He was very impressed with the photographs and how they were arranged. The photos chosen represent the dangers of the profession and the heroism of the men who choose this career. They also portray the brotherhood and camaraderie that develops among the firefighters, not only in New York, but everywhere. This was money well spent!!"},{"Title":"New York's Bravest: Eight Decades of Photographs from the Daily News","review":"This product is 100% recommended, I loved it and met all my expectations.Is invaluable history and reflecting each image."},{"Title":"New York's Bravest: Eight Decades of Photographs from the Daily News","review":"This book is filled with great photos that capture all the emotions of firefighting in New York City. Although there is not much text, this book is filled with stories. A photo is worth a thousand words as the saying goes.

Like the other reviews state, the pictures show the great heroism and bravery New York's Bravest show everyday. I found it especially interesting to see pictures of fires that I have read about in other books about FDNY, \\"The Last Men Out\\", in particular. You can't go wrong in adding this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Jane Doe","review":"...I only gave this one star because you cant go any lower. Come on ...While interested in the first few pages I soon became aware that this was not a book for me. Are we really supposed to believe that this girl falls in love with a man that has been sleeping with her mother for years?...GROSS. Other issues in the book make me think it is seriously lacking in the Values Department... Not worth the time in my opinion. Try Tami Hoag - Ashes to Ashes... Or Michael Prescott."},{"Title":"Jane Doe","review":"When Frank Keegan wakes the day after Valentine's Day with a massive hangover and bloody scratches on his face, he's at a loss as to how they got there and what he did the night before. No amount of effort brings any sense of memory, so he has no choice but to struggle on about his business, which includes a game of bowling opposite the police chief and her team.Abby Hooper is the controversial new police chief who has just beaten Keegan out of the job. She's young, qualified and enthusiastic and facing sexist opposition from at least half the town. That half doesn't include Keegan who, in spite of the fact that he has just broken up with her mother, likes Abby very much.When fishermen find the nude body of a teenage girl at water's edge by Keegan's dock, all signs point to Keegan as her murderer. As the story progresses, Frank learns facts he doesn't want Abby to know and Abby becomes more suspicious of Frank.Here's a cliff-hanger story that is full of surprises and should keep you glued to the tape deck until you find out just what did happen. Characters are deftly drawn . One of the problems with tapes is that men must read women's voices credibly (and vice versa). Richard Rohan handles that problem nicely."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I've read almost everything Mr. Saul has written. Oddly enough, I only recently came across this one, his second published novel. It certainly has a terrifc premise, and our hero, Peter Balsam, is likeable; also conflicted and vulnerable, which makes him perfect fodder for the wonderful mind of Mr. Saul. How exciting to come to a new town and start fresh after a rash of failures, whether the priesthood or his subsequent marriage, or the certainty of his future. Peter Balsam comes to teach phychology at a parochial school, almost unheard of by the set-in their ways populace. Angry nuns, weird old priests and closed-minded townspeople greet him with suspicion, but the kids love him, so glad to be given a chance to learn something new during their \\"formative years\\". Well, chaos ensues, as would be expected, and the next-to-lead character, Monsignor Peter Vernon, Balsam's old school chum, creates lots of confusion and plot twists that carry the reader to a satisfying conclusion, though not the one you'd think. Or...it would've been unexpected had I not read so much Saul before. It was very enjoyable, and if you're new to Mr. Saul, check this one out right away."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This book grips you from the very start and never lets go. While its a fast pace horror novel regarding suicide, and religious fervor it also tackles other topics such as abuse of power, sexual hypocrisy and the church overall. I got a bit upset when the sexual element was introduced; thinking Saul was making a judgement call but as the story progressed it redeemed it self. It also has one of the best and realistic endings I ever seen in a novel of this type. I am glad Saul had the good sense to end it in the way he did. A great audio book from the first CD to the last. The reader did a good job though his female voices needed some fine tuning at times. Still a great listening experience. I'm off to buy another! This book contains 5 CDs and is read by a single reader."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish the Sinners is a thriller concerning a rash of suicides and religious fervor sweeping through a desert community (the heat is symbolic on many levels). On another level I think it is a very personal book for Saul, usually a very impersonal and highly structured writer. This is due to the tensions regarding sexual orientation issues with the lead adult characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"John Saul is a master of horror story telling. His stories cause shivers up and down your spine, butterflies in the stomach, and the uncontrollable urge to keep reading. I am deliberately keeping these reviews vague so as to not spoil anything.Punish the Sinners is a bizarre story, set in the backdrop of a private Catholic high school called St. Francis Xavier High School. When Peter Balsam begins teaching a controversial psychology course, he notices that the children in this school have been very well indoctrinated in the attitude of the whole village (Neilsville, WA), which is very much a small town filled with very religious people.However, something isn't quite right at the high school and Peter is determined to find out what it is. There are strange rumors, whispers about a dark secret society. And then the children start dying ...This story is just creepy and I loved reading every word. Don't miss it if you are a fan of horror.Saul writes true horror, so don't expect any happy endings here. But DO expect to be thrilled and chilled. Don't miss this great story."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This is the first novel I have read from Saul and I admit I was impressed. From the first page it hooks you in and keeps you there. The ending was not typical and much of a surprise. Overall really good book, along the lines of Stephen King novels, which have that eerie and mysterious flavor to them that make them such good thrillers. I look forward to reading more of John Saul's work."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"A typical Saul thriller that his fans will enjoy. The plot centers around a Seminary dropout- turned teacher who is asked to teach at a stuffy parochial school and finds himself in the middle of a rash of teenage suicides and other evil goings-on. A typical fast-paced Saul thriller that lures you in quickly and keeps you there. The ending was different than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise, but I wish Saul had cleaned up some of the loose ends. All in all, a quick, easy read that Saul fans will enjoy."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This is the best book Saul wrote, it's great. I read it a few times actually and each time I couldn't leave it and move on with my life, like doing something for school or something. It touched me, the subject is very well built, so are the characters. Peter Balsam, and old childhood friend of Peter Vernon (now the Monsenior) is asked to come and teach psychology. He is an outcast in a relligious society and relates only to another oucast, a divorced woman. Prejudice coming from religious ideas is a great background for the Monsenior who finally came with a plan how to punish the \\"sinners\\". He is a very disturbed character and if you are a smart reader you'll get the idea why he is as he is. He is by no means the common religious fanatic, he's more. You enter a world of dark, creepy secretes hidden under a mask of peace and God. It's so usual for saul to do this, paint a perfect picture and turn it into grothesque, showing the true evil. I like that he's not a writer that ends books the way most do, he doesn't make it sweeter than life is. I hated this book, I threw it on the floor in rage when I finished it. But I loved it too, believe me. I understand it, it has a certain logic. Oh, you have to read it to see what I mean. If you didn't read Saul before - this is the best and the most evil book I'd say. Ok, let's say, the most evil from the pleasant ones. \\"The right hand of Evil\\" is the most evil. I am 22 and still it gave me nightmares. It wasn't believable and it was kind of distgusting like also \\"Suffer the children\\". Morbid. I would relate it to \\"Comes the blind Fury\\". It's about fury, but at a more unconscious level, I don't suspect that the evil character realizes hos rage so well, he can't controle it, it's madness and yet a perfect plan, so cold, and so calculated. It's brilliant! Great, grrrrrrrreat book."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Peter Balsam has come to Neilsville to teach a class in psychology at the local high school.

A good sophomore effort for Saul. Evil priests have a special place in my heart. A few scenes could have been spiced up and made more interesting. It could have had a better ending as well. It seemed as if Balsam just gave up.--author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish the sinners delivers an interesting but ultimately unsatisfactory suspense story centering around a Catholic school in a small town. While the story initially raises some interesting questions about theology and Catholic doctrine, Saul eventually forsakes those topics completely in the pursuit of a ridiculously far-fetched tale of obsession and mind-control. There is literally no character development whatsoever, and Saul goes a step worse in drawing on multiple character stereotypes: the sinister priest, the disbeleiving psychologist, the popular jock, the picked-on \\"ugly girl,\\" and more. If Saul had done anything memorable with such characters, it might be worthwhile, but this is simply unacceptable. To top off the frustration, the ending is simply atrocious, and does nothing to conclude the story; it feels like a bad horror movie where the killer is still alive at the end (though that is somewhat of a recurring theme in Saul's work). Not recommended at all."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"If you are a John Saul reader, you do not need a review. You know how good he is.

He does start the stories pretty well, but the wheels don't just come off the wagon, they fly off at light speed! Relaxation therapy? The musty odor of semen? Monsignor's huge organ? The characters are as flat as a postcard and the plot is outlandish and not just improbable but ridiculous.Someone please explain to me why 1)Balsam would have ever chosen to stay on in the first place considering the treatment he recieved from the beginning and 2)why would the Society choose this guy when there had to be a zillion other weaker-minded types they could have recruited to drizzle their, uh... religious fervor... all over."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I READ THIS BOOK MORE THAN ONCE!JOHN SAUL IS THE BEST WRITER!THIS BOOK IS SO CAPTIVATIING!

The first book (The Saints of Neilsville) plods along with a laughable predictability. The second book (The Society of St. Peter Martyr) picks up the pace and things really start to get creepy and strange. This section unfortunately relies too heavily on descriptions of all sorts of sexual acts. I'm not sure if I should laugh or be insulted. The two books take the plot on an unexpected tangent. Just as things seem to be petering out (excuse the pun), it picks up speed with the same frantic pace of some Stephen King novels. The last twenty pages then take a huge and wonderfully surprising tangent, earning this book a higher review than I otherwise would have given it."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I am a big Saul fan and was not disappointed by this story. I have read all of his books."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This was definitely in the second group. A long, slow build up to basically nothing, no mystery, no resolution, nothing more horrific than a secret undercurrent of homosexuality in the Catholic Church (imagine that!). Writing is at best completely unremarkable, but often clumsy and repetitive. Why is this book still in print?"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I've read two books by John Saul (I'm reading them in order of publication).This story dealt with suicide. There was blood due to the suicide methods, but nothing in the sense of \\"blood and guts\\", except for the opening scene. The story did revolve around Catholicism. Catholicism has always been a focus in horror films and such. This story by no means was a jab at the Catholic faith, but just this specific fictitious church in the story. The author I felt did a good job with character development. He slowly peeled away layers of the story to reveal the plot. It wasn't as \\"intense\\" as I might have liked it to be, but still was enjoyable and kept my interest throughout. John Saul does a good job with keeping the plot mysterious to the reader. I'm looking forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"The thought that comes to mind when I think about Punish the Sinners is how shocking it is. The novel starts out like many John Saul novels with an outsider being menaced by something possibly supernatural and the level of menace and fear is as high as Saul's other books but the degree of violence from this book really did surprise me (especially the sexual violence). This is a very dark novel and explores issues that might cause discomfort to those who live sheltered lives and have similar outlooks on life. The suspense itself will have you jumping at shadows. Throughout the entire novel I kept feeling an overwhelming sense of dread and foreboding. I always felt like there was something out of the corner of my eye that I missed when I read it. The book will shock and scare and what more could one ask of a horror novelist such as John Saul?"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I have kind of been on a John Saul kick as of late, and decided to give one of his older novels a try. So picked up a used copy of Punish the Sinners. I found the book to be... slow. There are shocking moments, and some very grizzly violence towards the end of the novel, but none of that really picks up until 3/4 of the way through. The rest of the novel is one character's inconsistent struggle with his faith. I say inconsistent because his motivations and feelings really don't flow from chapter to chapter, but instead seem to jump randomly to fit the story. With the exception of one very shocking and wonderfully tasteless revelation and sex scene, the book is almost boring and repetitious. The characters never seem to fully develop, with most of the teen girls being interchangeable, and our lead character seeming like a different person from chapter to chapter, and sometimes from page to page. While it's not a total train wreck, it basically becomes a very mediocre small town soap opera.So based on the first third of the book I would only give this book 2 1/2 stars. Then the last third begins and the whole book changes. Characters begin to kill themselves, and the stakes are raised, and suddenly the book becomes very entertaining. The \\"supernatural\\" aspect of the novel takes over and at this point I couldn't put the book down. I won't give anything away, but I will say that ending shows that Saul is capable of creating some almost stunning, and yet violent imagery as the body count begins to rise. In the last hundred or so pages John Saul's talent begins to shine through. It's just a pity that it takes so long for the book to get going. So long in fact that I'm guessing most readers will have already given up.Then there is the ending. I will just say that I was surprised at the choice John Saul made, and looking back at it now, the final pages seem to give the book a much welcomed nasty edge.Do I recommend this book? No, not really. There are so many better books, including ones by John Saul, that I just can't tell anyone to spend money on this one. If you can get a cheap used copy, then maybe, but otherwise skip Punish the Sinners and find something better. If you are looking for a John Saul novel try Faces of Fear or The Manhattan Hunt Club. John Saul has done better, and you the readers can do better as well."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish The Sinners is escapism at its best. Sauls weaves a sad tale of suspense and intrigue. Readers will find the opening funny and almost instantly chilling. Sinners exposes Saul's ability to craft a story that exposes the delicate almost fragile nature of children. This is the catylist for the evil that prevails. If horror has a first name, this book may just be the middle name. This is a must read. FYI..there is one part of the book that is sure to have you cringing or puking. Either way, you will be moved by this horroring tale."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"To date, this is by far the best *and also the first) John Saul novel I have read. And based on other reviews, I think that sentiment is shared by a lot of other readers. Had I not had other commitments, I probably would have read this cover-to-cover. All in all, I think it took me two days. If you are looking for a quick escape - read it. Too bad, nothing else by John has even come close to this one....."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"After reading &quot;Creature&quot; a few months back I had some doubts about John Saul. Well, i don't know about his later work, but this one was good. Peter Balsam goes to Neilsville to teach a psychology class at a parochial school, but soon finds some of his female students are killing themselves for no apparent reasonother than the fact that he showed up in town. Finding out why the girls do it is mainly what this book is about, and it had an unexpected ending, which is rare in most stories I have read as of late. I also couldn't find too many loose ends thatweren't tied up, although there were a few, which led to 4 out of 5 stars. All in all, a fine read."},{"Title":"Renaissance Poetry (Blackwell Essential Literature)","review":"I am reviewing this anthology after having just completed teaching a college-level class in which I assigned this text sight-unseen. First the good: I chose this text after viewing the table of contents on-line, and although the selection is very scant, the collection at least (1) leans toward the \\"canonical\\" in its selection (2) includes poetry from the sixteenth AND seventeenth centuries and (3) groups the poetry by poet, roughly in chronological order--three criteria that are annoyingly hard to find in the available selection of anthologies currently in print.Now the bad: Unfortunately, the many shortcomings of this anthology far outweigh its strengths, and are not readily apparent until you have a copy in your hands. Most obviously, the edition is physically very small--almost a pocket edition, at about 4 inches wide. This would be okay except that the typeface is likewise TINY, around the equivalent of 9-point Times font. This makes for VERY strenuous reading of already-difficult texts. In addition to all of this, the text lacks ANY sort of footnoting, annotations, or commentary with the inexplicable exception of the Spenser selection (the only selection viewable, incidentally, on the Amazon website). Even the annotation here is extremely insufficient and it is as if Mr. Wu simply gave up his already-meager effort after this. It is certainly not as if the poetry gets any easier after Spenser; on the contrary, an abundance of archaic vocabulary, obscure topical and political references, and subtle classical/biblical allusion throughout the selections make some sort of annotation absolutely necessary if it is to be at all accessible to the lay reader or student. Finally, for a text that is so sparse, small, and minimally edited, the list price seems exorbitantly high. This magnificent poetry deserves better!

I felt inspired after reading this book, just in time for the beginning of a new semester, and 50 new students!"},{"Title":"The Vocation of a Teacher: Rhetorical Occasions, 1967-1988","review":"How do I begin to describe the power of this book? I was at the Oulu library (Finland), spotted an attractive paperback whose title promised something more than light intellectual fare, and I proceeded to read the first page. I must have been there, standing in the middle of the library, absorbed, for something like 30 minutes solid before my wife (who'd been anxiously searching for me) tore me away me away from the most fulfilling \\"conversation\\" I've had in yonks. This happened to be my first and most formative encounter with Booth's delightful, witty and utterly engaging manner. I'll never forget it. The powerful insights coupled with a disarming style is one of the many features that has made Booth a favorite among my intellectual friends (in the form of books). Anyone who reads a single page of this fascinating book will recognize that he or she is in the presence of an accomplished rhetorician. It is a pleasure and an inspiration to \\"dialogue\\" with such a writer-thinker, deeply engaged as he is with a subject that he loves so passionately and shares so eloquently."},{"Title":"The Vocation of a Teacher: Rhetorical Occasions, 1967-1988","review":"In addition to more seriously theoretical works such as The Rhetoric of Fiction and The Rhetoric of Irony, Booth has left us with many essays that deal with the practical aspects of teaching literature and writing. This book is one of the collections of such essays. In this regard, Booth in this book can be grouped together with Gerald Graff and Robert Scholes, who have more recently published books on closely related topics (English as a discipline, teaching English/writing).I cannot but suspect that Booth is somewhat unjustly under-appreciated among teachers of English. In the Pedagogy/Teaching Practicum class I was in, for instance, Booth was never even mentioned (except by me) while both Graff and Scholes were read and discussed seriously. From my experience of reading all three, however, I am sure that, as far as the \\"ideals\\" of teaching composition classes is concerned, Booth offers the most helpful and insightful ideas.One essay, originally a speech given to the freshman class of the University of Chicago in 1970, \\"What's Supposed to Be Going on Here?,\\" is especially noteworthy. In the space of 9 pages, Booth succinctly delineates the goals and methods of liberal education. What he suggests is specific enough to be readily applicable in any freshman composition classes, and yet at the same time, is so widely encompassing to be read as a moving statement on \\"the aim of education.\\"I began teaching a year ago and have taught three composition classes so far. Whenever I felt lost and had the need to remind me of what I am teaching and why, \\"What's Supposed to Be Going on Here?\\" gave me the help I wanted. His brilliance is in giving such clear and specific definition to the ever-so-vague term \\"intellectual freedom.\\" To him, it is simply (of course, is it really that simple?, we may ask) our ability to truly carry out converstations with other minds. We learn to read and write to cultivate this ability, that is, to know what others really mean and to give others what we want to mean. In this definition of \\"intellectual freedom,\\" intellectual independence comes from the keen awareness of dependence and interconnectedness of ideas. This was something I often mused about since I read it. It would be food for thought for me for some more while as I continue teaching."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare, considering he wrote this little gem of a comedy in a mere 14 days for the Virgin Queen, pulls off a play that proves both witty and fun. Unequivocally, The Merry Wives of Windsor makes for a more enjoyable play if seen live. Nonetheless, reading it is the 2nd best thing.Sir John Falstaff is once again such a fool - but a lovable and hilarious one at that. Having read Henry V - where Falstaff ostensibly had met his end - I was pleased to see him so alive(pardon the pun) in this short, albeit clever play. It is no surprise that The Merry Wives of Windsor enjoyed such a long and successful stage run during Shakespeare's day and continues to be one of his most popularly staged plays. Recommended as a fun break from the more serious and murderous Shakespearean tragedies.\\"Why, then the world's mine oyster,Which I with sword will open.\\" - Pistol"},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"This play is odd in that critics hate it, but theater companies love it. Harold Bloom's contempt for this play is so great that he refused to discuss it in his book on Shakespeare. But, unlike some of Shakespeare's less popular plays, Merry Wives is performed frequently in Shakespeare festivals across the land.You really have to see this play to understand how well it works on the stage. Played by an energetic cast it is hilarious situation comedy and easily understandable by people unfamiliar with Shakespeare. When Falstaff says at the end, with deadpan delivery, \\"I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass,\\" it brings down the house. Just reading the play in your living room, you will probably miss much of the humor.Shakespeare was a man of the theater.

One scene I could not forget if I tried is when Ford feels bad for suspecting his wife, is humiliated in front of everyone, and apologizes.Only a bit later he finds his wife was with Falstaff and she has another arranged meeting with him!

Sir John Falstaff is one of the greatest comedic characters in all of literature and does not disappoint in this play.'The Merchant of Venice' is great if you are looking for a 'Comedy' with meaning and social significance, but if you simply want to laugh your butt off you have to read 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"Among critics, this is arguably their least favorite of Shakespeare's plays but with audiences it is a perennial favorite. Also, Giuseppe Verdi chose it as the basis of his very last opera, Falstaff. So there must be something in it.Sir John Falstaff, the lovable rogue from The Henriad cycle of plays, needs money and he intends to get it from a rich wife. Just to be sure he gets something, he attempts to woo two women rather than just one. Never mind that both women are already married; this is not a problem for the shameless Sir John. He sends love letters to both women but puts them in the wrong envelopes, so that each gets the one meant for the other. OK, these middle aged women might be a little starved for affection from their husbands but they aren't stupid and they would have seen through Falstaff's ruse anyway.His mistake however does give them the chance to have a little fun at his expense. Falstaff appears at one woman's home to press his suit. Her husband arrives unexpectedly, and Falstaff hides in a basket that is then carried out. It's a bit heavy...Falstaff and his ridiculous plan provides the comic situation, the confusion that ensues provides the slapstick, foreigners with Welsh and French accents provide ethnic humor. And in the end, Falstaff receives a well deserved lesson.There is nothing wrong with this play, it's a very good, very funny comedy and as close to pure comedy as Shakespeare gets with the exception of The Comedy Of Errors. So why don't critics like it? Probably because they expect more from Falstaff. He fears getting caught by the husband but that does not keep him from courting his wife. He offers no catechism in this play about the evils of adultery or of the dark side of love, unlike in Henry IV Part One where he cautions the audience against how honor in war leads to injury or death. The fat man in this play offers us a barrel of laughs but no wisdom at all.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Merry Wives\\" is generally loathed by scholars, and loved by audiences. The reason is not hard to detect. It is a non-serious and very funny play. Shakespeare wrote low comedy farce. GASP!First off, the 3 star rating means as compared to other works of Shakespeare. I don't feel it fair to compare him to other writers. For the other writer's sake!\\"Merry Wives\\" is a fast paced romp that would be much better to see than to read. The first act of this play frustrated me as reading no Shakespeare has done before. The play is his only comedy set in (Shakespeare's) modern day, and in England. As a result it abounds with archaic English colloquialisms and regionalisms that mean nothing to the modern American reader. You will have to look at the explanatory notes often while reading this play. The reader's frustration will be added to by the inclusion of a French character, complete with accent, a Welsh parson, also with accent, and a servant lady who speaks with malapropos and misunderstandings most of the time.If you can get over that hurdle, you will find the play picks up steam and humor in the last three acts, and there are some truly comic, and often vulgar, moments. The groundlings must have howled with delight at this play.Many critics hate this play because they say the Falstaff of \\"Merry Wives' is a shadow of the character Shakespeare created for the Henry Four plays. He is. But I guess my question is, so what? Shakespeare created Falstaff and he can use him however he sees fit. To me it seems a minor quibble, and I am not sure I understand the passion it engenders in some people.Take \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\\" for what it is, a lighthearted farce, meant as a diversion for its viewers, and leave all the academic baggage at home. You will be glad you did.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

(Also back are Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym.) Some scholars such as Asimov feel that this Falstaff: \\"...bears no resemblance to the Falstaff of the \\"Henry IV\\" plays.\\" Well, Asimov was right, but Shakespeare was trying to do something very difficult. (Recreating an artistic moment. It may not be impossible, but it is not far from it either.)Well, onto the play. Shakespeare cleverly combines 2 plots. Anne Page is a young girl whose parents want her to marry someone other than Fenton (whom she loves). But Shakespeare adds a new twist. Her parents are not in agreement here. Her father wants her to marry the nice enough slender, while her mother wants her to marry the eccentric Dt. Caius. (So the Romeo, Juliet, Paris triangle isn't exactly repeated.)Moving on, Falstaff enters, and he intends to woo Anne's mother and Page's wife not out of love, but in hopes of increasing his fortunes. Well, even Falstaff's friends Pistol and Nym are repulsed by this and Pistol warns Ford, while Nym warns Page. While we may see the adult Pages as the 'wicked parents' who wants Anne to marry someone other than whom she loves, Shakespeare expands their characters by having mutual love and trust. (A great marriage! The not so bright Othello could have learned from Mr. Page!) So, we can see that the Page marriage is happy and successful.On the other hand, Ford is not so sure of his wife to say the least. He plans to disguise himself and encourage Falstaff to go ahead. (So he can catch Falstaff and his wife in the act.) Lady Ford has plans of her own though. We know that Lady Ford and Lady Anne are trying to teach Falstaff a lesson so to speak, and we can only imagine what is going through poor Ford's mind when Falstaff reveals his plans to woo Lady Ford AND Lady Page. Ford goes through some comical jealous rages, but unlike the so called 'noble' Othello, Ford DOES NOT lay an abusive hand on his wife, and it is hard for us to not feel at least a little sorry for Ford. (We can only imagine his frustrations when he feels bad and thinks he was wrong about his wife, only to realize that his wife has another scheduled meeting with Falstaff!)Well, keeping with the comedy, no one really gets hurt, and Ford is willing to admit he was wrong about his wife. Now it does seem after all the humiliating events Falstaff went through (such as being thrown in a river and being beaten) Falstaff would have learned by now. But such is comedy. The Pages and fords decide to subject Falstaff to one more practical joke.And of course there is the matter of who Anne will marry. (Fenton whom she loves, Slender whom her father loves, and Dr. Caius whom her mother loves.) In a bit of \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" nostalgia, Falstaff suffers one final slapstick moment, but all is resolved, and young love triumphs. And in the often found theme of reconciliation, all of the characters (including Falstaff) enjoy a happy gathering."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"I certainly don't agree with many of the reviews of this play. To me it is one of Shakespeare's funniest. I truly enjoyed it. One of my favourite Shakespearean characters is Falstaff, and he appears in a number of Shakespeare's comedies. He makes an appearance in this one, and he is wonderful. The scene of this play is in Windsor, England. The play follows the merry wives in their interactions with their husbands and with their families and servants. This play is unique too, because we see Falstaff in love in this one. This may be one of Shakespeare's lesser known comedies, but it should be read and enjoyed. Don't let some of these reviews stop you from the sheer enjoyment of this play."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"Book Report The Merry Wives of Windsor The Merry Wives of Windsor is loved by many people in the world because of the plentiful expressions, skillful characters' description and the natural laughable. It is not only a common comedy, but also a signpost from that we can see many things of the Elizabethan age when the author-William Shakespeare- lived. And this is one of the few works that he composed by himself, in other words, there are no any source to create it. The reason of coming into existence about this is unique and interesting. When Queen Elizabeth watched one of his historical plays (Henry the fourth), she was very pleased with John Falstaff in the play, then she ordered Shakespeare that he would make John be a hero and have him love in another play. It is said that the beginning of the story. There are lots of characters in the play as the other Shakespeare's works. The whole content is, Sir John Falstaff falls in love with Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, but the two mistresses make plan of ill-treating to him to refuse his love and to show their faithful and virtuous hearts to their husbands. Meanwhile, Fenton(a young gentleman), Slender(a country justice's kinsman) and Doctor Caius(a French physician) are all in love with Anne(daughter of Page and Mistress Page), and they think for wining her love respectively. At the end of the story, after Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Page and others make plans and ill-treat to Falstaff in the woods, all of them get reconciled with, while Anne Page get married with Fenton, and come to an end with joy. Besides them, some people who have strong personalities appear on the stage. For example, Mistress Quickly(Caius' servant) has a ready wit but a little stupid, or Sir Hugh Evans(a Welsh parson) who always speaks in rural accent but it makes us fanny and he plays an active part at the end of this play. We could see Shakespeare's genius in this play for there has many puns and unique accent which used by Hugh Evans. And it bring more cheerful mood to the play and laugh to the audience. Shakespeare described many men who is jealous of their wives or lovers in his works, and one of them is Mr. Ford who appears in this play. He has faith in his wife's affair and it brings some troubles. When this work was written, a woman generally could not get married to a man if he was not permitted by her father. However the times went by, many Pulitans came to insist that men and women could get married only when they loved each other. Fenton has also the pulitanical view for marriage. It was a new thought and I think Anne Page was attracted to his such way of thinking as well as his other good points. Also at that time in England, there was a tendency for every people to criticize about things which were against the social morals through passages of caricatures. For example, it was a fashion of the time for women to wear trousers but people criticized it, or they criticized for jealousy and affairs. In this play, John Falstaff is ill-treated by everyone and has a terrible experiences, and that's because he is immoral and unfair. Like these, this comedy has several points, and we can see the cultural features of the Shakespeare's period. Although I have ever read his works, I thought this one was very interesting and I came to like it the best. The character's personalities are made full use and I could see the author's abilities from that, too. The mistresses play active parts and they are very cheerful, livery and merry just as the title is. I think it made the audience(especially women) enjoy to watch, and the merriness of this play has been one of the most big reasons to attract people even nowadays."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"Legend has it that the Queen herself commissioned the writing of this play, saying she wished to see a comedy in which Falstaff, her favorite character from the histories, falls in love. Shakespeare, naturally, did a masterful job, crafting not only a comedy with plenty of belly laughs in it (literally), but also a play about women in power for the ultimate woman in power.I saw this play performed recently and it brought home to me how much it really is about the character of Mrs. Hood. She is written to be a sexually powerful, or powerfully sexual, character. Powerful enough to justify her husband's jealousy despite her trustworthiness -- for if we are to receive him as one of the \\"good guys\\", we must be able to sympathize with him. Powerful enough to justify Falstaff's return again and again. He is a fool, but a lovable fool, so again we need to be able to sympathize.This is not Britney Spears sexuality. This is Mae West/Marilyn Monroe sexuality. The kind where she could be doing the most vulgar thing -- eating a cheeseburger, for instance -- and the men around her are still aroused. And she is in full control of it, even as it causes chaos in the men around her. If an actress can bring this to the role, this play sings, it swings, it sparkles and flies. If this is missing, if she is simply a normal woman, the counterpart of Mrs. Whatever, the jokes are strained, the pacing slow and the whole thing feels a bit washed up."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"When rating Shakespeare, I am rating it against other Shakespeare; otherwise, the consistent 4-5 stars wouldn't tell you much. So if you want to know how this book rates against the general selection of books in the world, I suppose it might rate four stars; it certainly rates three. The language, as usual in Shakespeare, is beautiful. Still, it's far from Shakespeare's best.For one thing, this is one of those cases, not uncommon in Shakespeare's comedies, in which the play has suffered a great deal by the changes in the language since Shakespeare's time; it loses a great deal of the humor inherent in a play when the reader needs to keep checking the footnotes to see what's happening, and this play, particularly the first half of it, virtually can't be read without constant reference to the notes; even with them, there's frequently a question as to what's being said. At least in the edition that I read (the Dover Thrift edition) the notes frequently admit that there's some question as to the meaning of the lines, and there is mention of different changes in them in different folios.But beyond this, as an overweight, balding, middle-aged libertine, I object to the concept that Falstaff is ridiculous just because he is in fact unwilling to concede that it is impossible that a woman could want him. Granted, he's NOT particularly attractive, but that has more to do with his greed, his callousness, and his perfect willingness to use people for his own ends, to say nothing of his utter lack of subtlety.Is it truly so funny that an older, overweight man might attempt to find a dalliance? So funny that the very fact that he does so leaves him open to being played for the fool? Remember, it isn't as though he refused to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer; he never GOT a &quot;no&quot;. He was consistently led on, only to be tormented for his audacity. Nor is he making passes at a nubile young girl; the target of his amorous approaches is clearly herself middle-aged; after all, she is the MOTHER of a nubile young marriageable girl. And given the fact that she is married to an obnoxious, possessive, bullying and suspicious husband, it is not at all unreasonable for Falstaff to think that she might be unhappy enough in her marriage to accept a dalliance with someone else.If laughing at fat old men who have the audacity not to spend the last twenty years of their lives with sufficient dignity to make it seem as if they were dead already is your idea of a good time, you should love this play. I'll pass."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arkangel Shakespeare)","review":"The Merry Wives of Windsor is loved by many people in the world because of the plentiful expressions, skillful characters' description and the natural laughable.

However, I did enjoy the book. My favorite part was the setting - the rural English countryside in Autumn. The descriptions of the landscape was lovely and it really gave a somewhat haunting feel to the story. The history was well done, and I also liked the sideline romance which always seems to take place in an Ann Stuart. However, I wasn't overly crazy about the hero. He wasn't nearly as good as Simon from \\"Lord of Danger\\". He didn't seem like he had all that much kindness to him, even deep down. You kept expecting him to do something to win you over, and it never came. He really was a little mean! Anyway, I say read the book and enjoy.

But Lizzie is drawn to Gabriel in ways she cannot explain, even though she is warned by him to be wary of even him.Dark magic, druid cults, ghosts, dancing in the moonlight and yet another of Anne Stuart's famous mysterious men, that is the formula this novel.

It was good and had lots of potential, but it wasn't as dark, disturbing, or charasmatic as her novels normally are (in my experience). I was disappointed because there was no mystery either (you knew everything about everyone from a very early point in the novel).It was, though, a nice read. If you're looking for mysterious, soul-searching, and charasmatic, I would recommend Ritual Sins and Nightfall as my favorites."},{"Title":"Prince Of Magic","review":"This book has been in my wish list for quite some time, and I had such high hopes for it. It was a major disappointment. Gabriel was sexy, but self centered and a jerk. Lizzie was an 'ordinary' girl. That's what the author referred to her as. 'Ordinarily pretty', 'somewhat pretty', 'plain'. And, every character in this book hated Lizzie's 'horrible' red hair. The romance between the two was mediocre. All in all, not the best by Anne Stuart!!!!"},{"Title":"Prince Of Magic","review":"This is the first novel that I have read by Anne Stuart and it wll be the last. I borrowed it from the library and I'm very glad that I didn't actually buy it. First Ms. Stuarts writing style is in my opinion just okay. You never really get to know much about her main characters. Everything about them is superficial. For example Lizzie was sent away in discrace for dancing in the woods. Well other than her love of the forest what else do we learn about her? Nothing of her hopes and dreams or anything else. I thought that Gabriel was just about to worst male chacter that I have ever read about. Shallow, selfish and comsumed with sex. No wonder he couldn't make it as a priest!! He thinks he is just about the best most skilled lover there is becasue well after leaving the church he spent 5 years sleeping with 100's of women in London and well he learned a lot. The \\"love scene\\" between Lizzie and Gabriel was no love scene as far as I'm concerned. Lizzie was a vigin and he showed her as much care and tenderness a john would show a porfessional. He seemed determined to show her that he knew everything about sex in just one night. She woke feeling sore, scratched, sticky...not my idea of a romantic night of love. The Druid cult twist and the ghosts of two dead monks plus the lack of connection betwen Lizzie and Gabriel made in my opinion very dull reading. I had to force myself the finish it with the hope that it would some how get better. It didn't. Why Lizzie fell in love with Gabriel I will never understand. He never did one thing to deserve being loved by her and his declaration of love at the end of the book seemed added just because it is expected by the readers of romance novels. I think that this book would have been better classed a fiction and not romance."},{"Title":"Prince Of Magic","review":"I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with this one, though it wasn't, by far, the worst novel I've ever read. Based on the other Anne Stuart novels I've read (which, actually, aren't many) I was expecting something much darker and mysterious. I was turned off by the Druidic rituals and whatnot, but that's just me. I liked some of her other novels enough that I'll continue reading more, but this was definitely not a favorite."},{"Title":"Mastering Visual Basic 5","review":"This is an excellent book: clear, easy to understand presentation, good choice of topics covered, a lot of sample program codes, very few errors.

For whatever reason Asimov used the pen name Paul French, but the books were later republished under Asimov's own name. Asimov strove to create plausible and action packed adventure stories. He also wanted his writings of space travel and planetary bodies to be factually correct and consistent with known science. In later editions he included a preface for each book to explain what aspects of scientific knowledge had changed in the intervening years and what factoids from that book are now known to be wrong. Asimov never dumbed down his books or condescended to his audience.Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids is book 2 in the series. A group of pirates has taken refuge in the asteroid belt, making commerce and transport difficult for anyone trying to go past Mars into the outer solar system. The problem is that no one knows where in the asteroid belt the pirates have their base. Space Ranger Starr concocts a plan (against his superiors' knowledge or wishes, kind of like James Bond) to fly to the asteroid belt and use his ship as bait to locate the pirate base and destroy it. Meanwhile he learns that the leader of the pirates is the man who killed his parents.\\"Pirates\\" is the first Starr book I ever read (even though it is #2 in the series), and I never read it until recently, as an adult. I had no problem understanding what was going on even without having read the first book. As an adult I find this book to be enjoyable light reading. Nothing special, but it is exciting and entertaining. Best of all Asimov never asks you to suspend disbelief and just go with it. He tries to make all of his books conform to the known universe, and this one is no exception.But Asimov wrote this book for children, and I think that is where it would really shine. I read a lot of adventure and science fiction stories as a kid - Tom Swift, Hardy Boys, Three Investigators, Choose Your Own Adventure, The Hobbit, and even a bit of Robert Heinlein. I think I would have loved the Lucky Starr books as a kid."},{"Title":"Lucky Starr and the pirates of the asteroids (A Signet book)","review":"I grew up reading the Lucky Starr series and though it's been twenty-five years or more since I've even seen one, I can remember practically every word.

Not one of the better Lucky Starr books, albeit the only one grounded on astrophysical science with which Asimov still felt entirely comfortable after 25 years of additional observations.

It is a very poor reproduction of an old book, page for page, except that half of the pages are too dark to be even remotely legible. It is literally a page-by-page scan of an old document.

Therefore, it may have deefects such as missing pages, erroneous pagination, blurred pages, missing text, poor pictures, markings, marginalia and other issues beyond our control...\\" this is putting it mildly.

The proofs are somewhat difficult, the examples are limited. The proofs for the most part are succinct, the exercises are fairly challenging in general. I just dont like how there are inconsistencies they show two column proofs on congruent triangles then on proofs of parallelograms, they dont have two column examples the examples just give it in paragraph written form, if they are going to say use paragraph, or two-column that would be nice. they expect the reader to assume. they cut a lot of corners, which is not the key to learning in my book, I give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Hypnotism,","review":"Remember the movie \\"KIM\\" (1950) with Errol Flynn and Dean Stockwell (KIM) as Kim sees the broken pot being put back together?

It is important to keep in mind that these are conversations rather than interviews such as those conducted by Robert J. Emery in The Directors: Take One and its sequel, The Directors Take Two, as well as interviews conducted by Richard Schickel in The Men Who Made the Movies. It is also worth noting that Bogdanovich is himself a distinguished director of films such as The Last Picture Show, What's Up, Doc?, They All Laughed (a personal favorite of mine), and Texasville. As a result of his own background, Bogdanovich's questions and comments reflect somewhat different interests and perspectives than do those of Emery and Schickel.I rate all of these books Five Stars but probably enjoyed reading Bogdanovich's book the most because the conversations ramble along somewhat messily, as most of my own conversations tend to do, and also because Bogdanovich is more actively involved in the interaction than Emery and Schickel are. As a reader, I feel as if I were really an eavesdropper as 16 directors casually share their opinions, information about specific films and actors, gossip, \\"war stories,\\" and overall evaluations of their careers' various successes and failures. At no time does Bogdanovich seem intrusive or manipulative. Moreover, perhaps to an extent he did not realize when writing this book, he also reveals a great deal about himself...much of it endearing and some of it admirable. His passion for film making and his appreciation of the great directors are almost palpable. Readers' interests about various directors and their respective films obviously vary. I include myself among those who are die-hard film buffs and so I enjoyed reading every chapter and every word in each chapter. Indeed, each conversation was for this amateur \\"gourmet\\" a feast to be consumed with delight and, yes, gratitude."},{"Title":"Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors","review":"I wonder if we (the movie fans) appreciate that we have two of the greatest film historians ever still with us today? Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese not only make movies, they also have gone to great lengths to give us insight into those who came before them in filmmaking - Scorsese with his personal journey through American films and Bogdanovich with his insightful interviews of Welles, Ford and the long list of pioneers he included in this massive volume. Here we are given more than 800 pages of interviews, some of which are fully developed and others which are but snipets of interesting careers. We should be thankful he included the snipets with the others, because in many cases these are the only true looks we have into these men who led today's young filmmakers to find their way. From Allan Dwan to Chuck Jones, Bogdanovich explores with his interviews what was behind the eyes of the men who did many things in filmmaking for the first time and with distinction. He includes some who were there when filmmaking was in its infancy, and some who started in television and moved to movies. The length and some of the lesser-known names among the subjects at first gave me pause in tackling this book, but I surprisingly found each of the interviews interesting and now count this among the best (among many) reference books I own about movies. I've gone back to it several times when viewing some of the films these men have made, and that, for me, makes this a valuable posession."},{"Title":"Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors","review":"You can spend years going to film school, or you can read this book! Bogdanovich does a great job with this collection of interviews of great film directors. Not only does the book give you a good inside view of the craft of cinema, but it also acts as a history book of the film industry.This book would be good for the serious indie director who has bet his/her credit cards on their dream or even the special person in your life who stays up until 4am watching the Turner Classic Movie channel.There is something here for everyone as there is a wide range of directors who work in a wide range of styles. There isn't a genre that isn't touched in this book - from Hitchcock on Horror to Chuck Jones on cartoons. What's great is that Bogdanovich captures insight into directors that are no longer with us (like Fritz Lang who directed Metropolis). Since the directors tell their own stories, you don't get the Hollywood hype filter.If you had to buy one book on film this year, this would be it!"},{"Title":"Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors","review":"Bogdanovich's book has joined Bach's &quot;Final Cut&quot; and Dunne's &quot;The Studio&quot; among the dozen or so absolutely essential books on film, whether for the professional or the casual fan. It's a treasure trove of opinion, technique, and just plain gossip, and even the most ardent film lover will close the book at the end with a double-handful of movies they haven't seen and now can't go another day without. Bogdanovich is kind of a strange authority for this, but the respect he gives his interviewees, coupled with extensive knowledge and a clear desire to give equal space both to the heavyweights (Hitchcock, Hawks) and the now-forgotten (Dwan, Louis) makes this a hands-down MUST READ."},{"Title":"Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors","review":"Peter Bogdanovich is a film director who loves cinema, and enjoys talking about it. \\"Who the Devil Made It\\" is a book that includes conversations between him and 16 renowned film directors. These interviews are quite different and were made at diverse times, but have in common one uniting theme: cinema. I already knew something about some of those directors, for example Alfred Hitchcock or Fritz Lang, but I hadn't heard a thing about others that aren't so well-known to the general public nowadays, for example Josef von Sternberg. In all cases, though, after reading these interviews I ended up learning more about their lives, experiences, and general philosophy regarding cinema.The name of this book is taken from a reflection made by one of the directors Bogdanovich interviewed, Howard Hawks, who when asked what kind of movies he liked, promptly and passionately answered \\"I liked almost anybody that made you realize who the devil was making the picture... Because the director's the storyteller and should have his own method of telling it.\\"I cannot help but agree with him, and that is the reason why I recommend this book to you.

Each director interviewed (obviously some more than others) provides invaluable insight into the nuts and bolts of film directing. Bogdanovich has compiled with this book, an indispensable historical document that does much to inspire, educate and guide any aspiring film director.I particularly valued Alan Dwan's insights into the importance of communicating character relationships into the narrative. I have incorperated much of the late director's invaluable advice into my attempts at stage direction.All in all a must have for anybody interested in directing or gaining insight into the creative process."},{"Title":"Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors","review":"Bogdanovich interviews film directors from across the spectrum.

Worth a read or several, definitely."},{"Title":"Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors","review":"I have to give this book only 4 stars due to the overbearing writing voice of Peter Bog. The guy tries so hard to make sure the reader knows that he's had a close personal relationship with the great directors that it's painful to read. He also tries to put himself in this group as a director, for example, when he remarks on a play that a few of the directors in this books have staged, noting that he, too, has staged this play.Really, it's not what he's saying, it's how he's saying it.Anyway, if you can tune out Bogdonovich, the rest of the book is okay."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"There are three subplots in this novel that intertwines around the life of attorney Arthur Winner. Sometimes interesting, this book is a chore to read as Cozzen's style is, well, wordy and ornate.There is a scene where the central character and his sexually-repressed wife are in the sack (\\"Her.\\" \\"Him\\", \\"Her\\", \\"Him.\\" )...the instructions on how to program my VCR were more stimulating. Give me a break.Maybe by today's overly PC standards this book could be considered mildly racist and bigoted, but I fail to see where. Catholics do take it on the chin, however.This was almost a good novel. John Cheever does this type of thing much better."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"Just as there are some works of plastic and painterly art so atrocious you just have to stand there and marvel at them, so this bestselling warhorse from the 1950s is a gob-smacking stunner. So marvelous it gets 2 stars rather than 1 (Amazon.com doesn't allow you less than one).From the Time cover story on Cozzens we learn that this book was years in the making, and had been percolating in dribs and drabs since about 1930. This long gestation period may account for the book's lack of pulse and animal spirit--the sort of narrative drive that grabs you by the collar and demands that you turn the page, no matter how bad the characters or subject matter. But what sort of fetus do you end up with after a quarter-century? Trite subject matter, half-baked themes, and half-conceived characters.And yet the thing was a bestseller. Must've been the title.Delving into the the substrata of the novel and Cozzens's own biography, I gather that the novel took seed as a diatribe against religion. Narrowing his focus, he naturally took off on Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. Cozzens's driving vision, the thing he wanted to mock and bludgeon, was a picture of churchy old biddies who talked about things like the Trinity and the Holy Ghost...instead of Manly Things, the kind of stuff Harvard freshmen circa 1923 might talk about--you know...Science...and Literary Criticism...and Modern Thinking, you know...and Will There Be Another War?The author's notion of a churchy biddy is herein caricatured as the uni-dimensional Polly Pratt, a wealthy Catholic lady who appears to have no function whatsoever other than to walk out on stage, stand next to a decaying stone fountain, and spout God-bothering drivel for a few pages, while the author (codenamed Arthur--geddit?) listens and smirks.The remainder of the novel is just so much cornstarch and bromide: sub-John O'Hara recitations of small-town Pennsylvania scandal among the country-club set."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"By Love Possessed is one of those gassy, 1950's faux Henry James stinkers about small town life that only a middlebrow critic could love. They did love it, (mostly because it was so pompously unintelligible, I suspect)and because in the 50's people still dutifully read what they were told to read, the thing sold a lot of copies. It's awful. The prose style is this baroque AND roccoco mess, which takes three read throughs to even begin to understand, but unlike a difficult text that a genius like Faulkner might put together, good old Cozzen's text doesn't yeild up any gold for all that digging. It's a stale story about a lawyer whose most interesting action was an affair years ago. NOTHING HAPPENS in this book until the very end, and by then, you couldn't care. Less. Worse, most of the characters are astonishing bigots. There are so many pages devoted to how the hideous Catholics are taking over the country that you begin to suspect that you are listening to Cozzens himself. In fact, you are. The man WAS a hideous bigot. There are anti=Jew, anti-black, anti Irish diatribes that go on for pages and pages. How did this crap get printed? Ah, the power of the middle brow critics in 1950's America. Think they have lost their power? Not entirely. We have them to thank for David Foster Wallace. Oh, and it isn't a coon that gets run over in the road, RE the earlier review -- it's a opossum! And yes, it is the high point of the book. BLEEEEEEEEEEEECCHHHHHHHH!"},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"My review reflects the summary I gave. Cozzens is a racial, nationalistic, religious bigot. He is a smug, pretentious writer. He does not improve with age. Book is worthless."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"I'm not surprised that By Love Possessed has received such polarized views from readers. It's not an easy book to digest: it has a baroque, almost arcane style and features views of race, religion, and homosexuality that are quite uncomfortable in today's age. Yet it is a novel that I cherish.Cozzens' novel covers 49 hours in the life of Arthur Winner Jr., a small-town Pennsylvania lawyer who has prided himself for living his life according to a strict regimen of reason and yet finds all those around him seemingly throwing their lives away to emotion. Rape, suicide, jealousy, and greed mark the behaviour of his friends and relatives, much to his consternation. Not until the end, when a deep secret is revealed, does Arthur Winner realise that an emotional reaction is sometimes the only recourse to an unreasonable situation; indeed, it may be a neccessary reaction.Because of its style and conservative stance, I've always been surprised that By Love Possessed was such a huge bestseller when originally published; perhaps its title and small-town setting confused readers that it was another Peyton Place (which, ironically, it replaced at #1). But it IS an incredible book, very influential (just read anything by Scott Turow), and a must read for those who want to understand the mindset of the middle-class American male in the mid-20th century. Personally, I find Cozzens' prose fascinating--the more a book makes me reach for the dictionary the better. And as a gay man, I take less offense at Cozzens' occasional prejudices than I do with those politically correct readers who only blindly see bigotry and not a man truly trying to understand the world around him."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"I was 17 when I read this book the first time, and it blew me away. I went about quoting it and recommending it to friends for years. Ironically, I read it as a highly intelligent affirmation of love.When I was in my 20s, I read it again and was aghast. Suddenly I saw it for the conservative, insular 1950s sort of book that it is. And worse, I saw that the central theme is that we ought to be suspicious of love because it can possess us and cause us to behave irrationally.Now I'm three re-readings past that, and maybe I'm ready to put Cozzens in perspective. It isn't a giant of a book that deserves the close attention I've given it, nor is it merely a period piece that can be dismissed as dated bigotry. If you can't appreciate a book that is tainted with the dated morality of an earlier time, you don't deserve the pleasures of reading a novel like this one that is so insistently intelligent and interesting.Ultimately, the star of By Love Possessed is the interior monologue of the central character (although the voice of Julius Penrose is actually closer to the heart of the novel than is the voice of Arthur Winner). What a fascinating voice that is. Robustly intelligent, skeptical, humorous, bold, sympathetic but knowing . . . it is a voice that takes ultimate delight in understanding human beings and pondering (often with an ironic smile) why they do what they do.A liberal who basically believes in love, I have that voice stuck in my head, and I long ago realized I would have to accept it as part of me. This brilliantly plotted novel gives that voice countless opportunities to make deliciously perceptive comments on the human comedy. Then--as befits such a smart reflection on human nature--the voice itself is dumped on its butt and shown to be bumbling and self-deluding.A great book? Nah. A great read, I'd say, and in a few years I'll enjoy sharing those astonishing 49 hours with Arthur Winner again. I improve my ability to see people with each reading."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"First of all, Cozzens remains an impressive manager of his material. Multiple plots and personalities weave tightly through the work, and just when you think that the novel is nothing but a big pile of disconnected pieces, Cozzens turns just a couple of corners and the whole things snaps into place in a stunning moment of revelation. It's masterful craft, and both emotionally and intellectually moving.On top of that, Cozzens manages to write for grownups in a world where compromise, settling, and just muddling through are sometimes as heroic as it gets-- sacrifices must be made, and it's NOT always a bad thing. If you find Steinbeck a tad too mushy, Hemmingway too mannered and ballsy, and Fitzgerald too melodramatic, this underappreciated author may be for you, and this novel is a great place to start."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"This book combines a number of uncommon qualities that will reward the patient reader: it is beautifully plotted, with no loose ends or errors in continuity; it is based on meticulous (but not flaunted) research into the subjects depicted; and it realistically portrays aspects of modern life that rarely draw the attention of serious novelists. Here, as in his other major works, Cozzens focuses on people's jobs -- how we make it through the day, dealing with the unattractive challenges life throws at us. Admittedly, his outlook on many topics is old-fashioned (something he acknowledged), but he generally appears to be someone honestly trying to look at the world as objectively as he can. (If one reads his major works in chronological order, it becomes clear how this striving for objectivity enabled him to grow beyond many of the prejudices of his class.) A priceless view of one aspect of modern American life."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"James Gould Cozzens is an outstanding author who writes fairly-long, serious books which address important issues regarding the myriad stresses of human life.

Characters drawn from life. In fine detail and with surprising sudden humanity."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"By Love Possessed chronicles an eventful weekend in the life of Arthur Winner, leading attorney and citizen in the small town of Brocton. No grasping uncouth Snopes, this Winner serve as living proof that virtue is not necessarily its own reward. When lesser lawyers offer a quid pro quo, he deigns to accept only with silence.The novel's narrative frame begins and ends with Amor Vincit Onmia, frozen forever and eternally ambiguous. The intriguing characters surrounding Winner in this modern Man of Lawe's Tale range from pillar of legal acumen with something to hide to an unfaithful wife converting to Catholicism to a precise drunk who becomes a victim of petty theft. In the end, one wonders if the most important character in By Love Possessed is not the raccoon that freezes in Winner's headlights and is run over with only a thump to mark its passing.The high point of By love Possessed is a masterly courtroom scene that strikes at the heart of what it is to be a parent. The novel is full of murder and suicide (intentional and unintentional). Events between the sexes range from a first date to a distasteful allegation of rape. In the end, when an untimely death reveals legal matters best left in darkness, Cozzens concludes that self-interest conquers all, at least in the world of small-town privilege.By Love Possessed moves through so many beginnings and endings that the novel seems somehow complete by its end, although all loose ends are left hanging. Read this book; it certainly does cure nostalgia for the 1950s."},{"Title":"By Love Possessed (Crest Giant, No. T326)","review":"By Love Possessed isn't the easiest novel to read: the style is involved and detailed.

The BBC has pulled out all the stops to provide top actors having fun with the Tintin stories, plus great sound effects and appropriately exciting or scary background music. The voices are quite different from the video taped stories, and so offer a completely new interpretation. And whereas the video tapes focus on visual presentation and pretty much treat the audio as a given (fair enough), these audio tapes fully exploit the possibilities of sound. Tintin is played absolutely straight, but the other characters are somewhat camped up, to provide entertaining parodies of themselves (for instance, the East European baddies have accents worthy of a Bond movie). Be aware that the accents are all very British or are British versions of foreign accents; but very clear recordings would make them easy to follow for most non-British English speaking listeners, I'd say. The stories follow the books more or less; the title 'unabridged' may mislead, as to compress the stories to a half hour each, much has been chopped out - consequently the stories rattle along at a fast clip. What have been added are touches of humour absent from the originals, such as an evil doctor describing Tintin as having signs of mental disorder which include 'infantilism, delusions of grandeur, a dog lover, and plus fours'. I bought these tapes for my 6 year old daughter, but we both enjoy them equally though in different ways: she for the plot and the escapism of the stories, me for the subtleties of the interpretation and the humour. These tapes are a steal at this price. Next stop: volume 2 for me."},{"Title":"Six Adventures of Tintin","review":"These audio cassettes are wonderful. The actors do a terrific job bringing Tin Tin to life. My eight-year-old son loves listening to them while he plays or cleans his room or is in the car.

Her point is to establish that women were always there in &quot;rock.&quot; [Hershey's use of the term &quot;rock&quot; is elastic enough to include Mariah Cover and Celine Dion among others.]The full title of her book is We Gotta Get Out of This Place: The True, Tough Story of Women in Rock. After reading the book, you may feel the full title of the book should be: We Gotta Get Out of This Place: The True, Tough Story of Women in Rock and the Clothes They Wore And the Way They Did Their Hair and Makeup.If you're interested in hearing about the evolution of the Ronettes hair, then this is the book for you. Hirshey also manages to get Ronnie Spector on record discussing the very important musical issue of &quot;eye liner&quot; at length.Hirshey appears defensive early in the book when she explains that clothes and make up are so very important. Why even James Brown has told her about the first outfit he wore on stage. That may be so but neglects to mention the outrage of Rolling Stone readers when Hirshey's Rolling Stone Interview with Tina Turner graced the magazine in the eighties. Readers used to a comprehensive discussion of the musician's recordings (past and present) were distressed to find nothing on music but everything on clothes. Hirshey breathlessly panting over the skirt Tina wore to Live Aid demonstrated the obvious limitations of her reporting. Surely, any other RS interviewer bringing up Live Aid might have asked about the humanitarian nature of the concerts themselves or about how you connect with an audience when you are one of many performers and your on stage time is so brief.Leave it to Hirshey to focus on Tina's skirt and set the record for all time worst Rolling Stone Interview. (One wisely left out of the book The Rolling Stone Interviews: The 1980s.)Her focus on fashion at the expense of music should cause her to feel defensive when writing a book on music. More to the point, her glaring lack of music history should embarrass her. I stopped counting factual errors in this book after I reached one hundred. But I was left with the clear impression that Hirshey knows little about popular music (rock, pop, soul or whatever).More importantly, I was left wondering whether or not The Atlantic Monthly Press bothers to employ a fact checker?Two examples out of a over a hundred:1) On Dusty Springfield, Hirshey tosses out that the &quot;finest example of what would become known as 'blue-eyed soul' was her 1968 album, Dusty in Memphis.&quot; That will certainly be &quot;news&quot; since Dusty in Memphis came out in 1969.2) Writing on Carole King, Hirshey notes the song writing partnership with Goffin at the beginning of King's career. Hirshey's wrong that Goffin &amp; King wrote only for girl groups.(Even if one omits later hits for The Byrds, Aretha Franklin and the Monkees, the fact remains that from the start Goffin &amp; King wrote for Tony Orlando, Bobby Vinton, etc as well as for girl groups.) But more distressing is the fact that three times she mentions Goffin and never once gets his first name correct. His name is &quot;Gerry Goffin,&quot; not &quot;Jerry Goffin.&quot; A Rolling Stone contributing editor should know better.A larger issue is the coverage of women. Please note, there's no evaluation of music, no serious discussion on anything. She does &quot;shout outs&quot; -- as though she were writing a gossip column (Rolling Stone's Random Notes?) and not a history on women in music. While &quot;giving her props&quot; in this book supposedly on music, she can shout out three songs co-written by Valerie Simpson but never manage to name Simpson. The Mamas and the Papas are also ignored (Cass Elliot gets two shout outs -- both having to do with her weight). While ignoring these and other women in a book supposedly about women in music, she manages to work in multiple shouts outs to Elvis, Johnny Cash and James Dean. (Dean qualifies for this book how?)A book concerned with establishing the fact that women have always been a part of popular music needs to do a better job covering the women; and when setting history right is the goal, a writer needs to have the facts right. Hershey fails on both counts. Anyone with even a basic understanding of popular music in the last forty years will find this a frustrating read as Hershey mangles facts and ignores a large number of women who contributed to popular music to instead note the &quot;importance&quot; of Marlon Brando wearing blue jeans."},{"Title":"We Gotta Get Out of This Place: The True, Tough Story of Women in Rock","review":"This is an admittedly subjective history -- a chronicle of Hirshey's experiences covering everyone from the Supremes to Marianne Faithful for Rolling Stone. Filled with cool stories, neat lil tidbits, and priceless quotes from the divas we have all come to love.Arranged by decade, it is a good overview of women's music.

Although there are many interesting clips [from the author's magazine interviews over the years], the book does not hang together. It appears that the author attempted to weave the stories together into some kind of themes, by decade: but there is really no &quot;greater insight&quot; provided. I would have preferred to read an anthology of more in-depth commentaries on a few female artists. I also found Ms. Hirshey's ornate writing style to be difficult reading."},{"Title":"We Gotta Get Out of This Place: The True, Tough Story of Women in Rock","review":"What a disappointment!This book is a complete waste of time and money, and if you are looking for a &quot;true, tough story of women in rock&quot; you've come to the WRONG PLACE.It says nothing of any substance about Women in rock, makes all sorts of references to non-female acts, and skips around through a bunch of nothing subjects.There are no discography's in it, no chronilogical list of women's accomplishements over the past decades, no anything.It rambles on and on, places labels on this and that, jumps around from unrelated non-topic to unrelated non-topic.The only think this book has going for it is the picture of Courtney on the cover.Don't buy it; it's a waste of money.

Her We Gotta Get Out Of This Place is entertaining (I, for one, found it good enough bathroom material), and the truth is our love of trailblazing women in the music industry will allow us to get through the most prosaic accounts of these women. What that means is that it takes some time to adjust to Hirschey's real goal, one that's far less ambitious than the book you might think you've gotten into - it's merely a survey of the women who've made one advancement after another in the constantly shifting haze of pop culture. Hirschey comes at this goal admirably enough - she dazzles with stories of Bessie Smith's early diva antics or Whitney Houston screaming \\"My girl Mary [J. Blige] - she knows how to tell a story!\\" It's a natural instinct to want more from the book, I think, which has to do with its \\"then this woman came out and she was great\\" repetitiveness - people expecting an Easy Riders, Raging Bulls of the music industry will need to keep looking. Still, it can't be denied Hirschey's fluid eloquence carries this exiguousness fairly far - at the point of her fascinating, sobering talk with Lauryn Hill, you're happy you stuck around."},{"Title":"We Gotta Get Out of This Place: The True, Tough Story of Women in Rock","review":"i thought this book was average. it had alot of info about many,many,many different women in the music world circa1920s(bessie smith) to 2000(missy elliott). there are no extremely long bios with extremely detailed facts. itis more about interesting tidbits about various singers/groups. i thought it gave general information as a wholebut,left alot to be desired. maybe the author should have taken each chapter and devoted a few pages to eachsinger and/or group? also i would have liked seeing more photos of these women. as it is, there are only a fewphotos at the start of each chapter. overall,it was interesting but,the narrative jumped all over the place."},{"Title":"We Gotta Get Out of This Place: The True, Tough Story of Women in Rock","review":"I love this book. I enjoy Hirshey's writing and I like the way she humanizes these iconic women. If you're looking for an encyclopedic recounting of the facts regarding recording dates and the correct spellings of collaborating artists, this book may baffle you. Like a rock and roll artist, Hirshey lays out her impressions, thoughts, and explanations with no other purpose but to please herself with the crazy, mixed up reality that is performance art.

The text is reset in modernfont but uses the original spelling, it includes retransciptionsof prefatory material, title pages and even advertisements!Most importantly original pagination has been indicated.Thouroughly recommended.

While the price is expensive, the amount of lore you get in this book makes it worth it. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Alchemical Works: Eirenaeus Philalethes Compiled (English and Latin Edition)","review":"The practice of alchemy has been perennial for all of written history, woven through one civilization and into the next, often tying them together. It is a science, a philosophy, a mystery, and a quest. The very word connotes a magic transcending our limited beliefs about the laws of nature. It was used as a tool of charlatans, who did much through their deceit to destroy the reputation of the science. Much more often it has been the field of study for great minds. C.J. Jung spent his last twenty years illustrating its value in framing the workings of the subconscious through alchemy's rich use of metaphor. Sir Issac Newton poured over Philalethes' tracts, finally preparing what he thought to be Philosophic Mercury in 1675.The essence of alchemical writings has been consistent through the centuries, while the details have been inscrutably and defiantly deceptive. Philalethes is called the last great alchemist in print. This collection presents a treasure map for many uses."},{"Title":"Alchemical Works: Eirenaeus Philalethes Compiled (English and Latin Edition)","review":"Altho' our Gold is not so oft revealed here, for it is in many other works delineated, yet the other most secret aspects of the Work are freely, if not always clearley, given to the Sons of Art. On the Secret Fire and its preparation from the Fountain, the attendant signs are described in the Fountain of Chymical Philosophy, p. 511-513. Take heed and note that it rises as a smoke, and is a sublimed salt, not a water, tho' it is so styled, and from a water derived. Then too, the proportion between the Man and his Wife is given many times, but most so on p.217-218. Remember, it is the number of eagles made in the rectification of thy water from the fountain that determines its internal fire; and this, in turn, determines its proportion to our Gold, old Adam, which is the powder of the highest body we commonly know. To this I will add that there is a third component, oft confused, and that is the Bond of Mercury; for this, see p 348-350 which joins the dry powders of the Man and his Wife. If you know the Fountain, then you know this common universal Mercury.Thus far have I gone, and then some, but not to the end; yet all the signs have been seen, including the Net which catches the Stars, seen in the preparation of the sublime secret fire.If thou hast found these words, then take cheer, for all my experience hath shown me that I was guided to this point, as must be you."},{"Title":"Alchemical Works: Eirenaeus Philalethes Compiled (English and Latin Edition)","review":"This is one of the greatest 17th century works on Alchemy, Hermetic and Rosicrucian philosophy there is. But before you shell out the $450 know that the book is also available under the title The Works of Thomas Vaughn, translated by A. E. Waite. Eugenius Philalethes is the name Thomas Vaughn used in his writings.

Frank and Joe are asked to investigate a series of fights occuring in Shantytown, a beach settlement on the outskirts of Bayport, but, soon become involved in a bigger mystery when a local bank is robbed and their friends, Chet Morton and Biff Hooper, disappear. This book was quite good; lots of action with an interesting plot. The beginning of the revised edition is much more exciting than that of the original; however, the second half of the original far exceeds that of the revised edition in terms of excitement and suspence. The original and the revised editions are essentially two different stories, as they are only similar in their basic plot (Frank and Joe's search for Chet and Biff); therefore, I would recommend reading them both."},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"This review concerns the original 1928 edition. Chet and Biff take Biff's new motorboat, the Envoy, on a trip down the coast, but when they fail to return, Frank and Joe try to find their missing chums. The book is slow to start and it isn't until chapter 11 that it really starts to get interesting; however, from that point on, this book probably has one of the best endings of any in the series with lots of suspence and excitement. Unfortunately, as with the previous volume, at the end of the book, the criminals are caught without much of an incident which detracts from an otherwise terrific ending"},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"These books are absolutely delightful on audio tape. I grew up reading all the Nancy Drew books but, true to stereotype, never read any of The Hardy Boys. As the mother of two little boys (first and third grade) I began exploring these in our read-aloud time every evening. The boys LOVE them but the whole series (50+ books) is a bit more than I want read as an adult and a daunting quantity of material even for very advanced readers so I was delighted to come across these audio tapes. Bill Irwin does an excellent job of reading the books, treating their slightly dated language and manners with complete respect. The tapes are unabridged although still only two tapes long. My only gripe is the wait for the series as the publisher appears to be releasing only two books every six months or so!"},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"While the book was very enjoyable it did not keep my attention as the other books in the series have. Chet and Biff, mistakenly identified as Joe and Frank Hardy, have been abducted. The Hardy Boys spend the book searching for them, but their searches are very repetitive. They begin in Northport, then to Shantytown, then home to Bayport, back to Shantytown, another clue leads them to Northport, they run back to talk to the sheriff in Bayport who in turn sends them looking for more clues in Shantytown, not to mention a couple of runs out to \\"hermit island.\\" The mysteries they solve along the way are minimal and the supporting cast of friends, including their relatives, take on a very minor role compared to previous novels."},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"I think that The Missing Chums is one of Franklin W.

So then there's a bank robbery and then their best friends Biff and Chet are kidnapped. They meet Alf at Shantytown. It's action pace with danger at every turn. One minute they jump overboard a ship to helping their friend after he fractures his ankle sliding down a steep hill. They have to trust their instincts in this suspenseful mystery. Can't say more or I'll reveal the end. Read The Great Airport Mystery( Hardy Boys #9) or The House on the Cliff( Hardy Boys #2). Also read the Harry Potter series. This book was a very suspenseful book. It's very adventurious and a very good book."},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"Thus far each of the first three books in the Hardy Boys series has increased the drama and complexity of the stories. The fourth book raises the ante once again by having at least four, apparently different, mysteries.At the beginning of the book the boys take their new boat, the Sleuth, out on the bay. While they are cruising on the bay another boat nearly rams them. They would have chased the boat but the steering on the Sleuth broke, and the boys ended up going around in circles. It turns out that the boat that nearly rammed them had a purpose for doing so, that we do not discover until the end of the book.Soon after, the boys prepare to go to Callie Shaw's costume party. Frank likes Callie romantically and she is a recurring character in the Hardy Boys stories. They encounter another mystery as it appears that men in Mr. French's costume shop appear to be threatening Mr. French.Returning home the boys frighten their Aunt Gertrude with their costumes. Aunt Gertrude is yet another recurring character in the series. Soon the boys are off to the costume party on their motor cycles. On the way they realize that the bank is being robbed. They follow the criminals until they lose them at the docks, where they hop into a boat and escape into the fog.After notifying the Coast Guard, the boys gain permission from Chief Collig to search for the criminals in the Sleuth, but the boys discover the Sleuth has been stolen! The boys search for the bank robbers in Tony Prito's boat, the Napoli, but are unable to find them in the thickening fog. The boys return home, explain to their father everything they saw at the bank and during the chase, and then head out to the costume party.The next day the boys awaken to learn that Chet Morton and Biff Hooper never made it home from the party. The boys not only have to learn who stole the Sleuth, but where their missing friends went, and who robbed the bank. As the story develops the boys learn that expensive radios that may have been stolen are turning up. Lastly, a hermit on a tiny island with a shotgun threatens the boys.The Hardy Boys face many mysteries and yet the author managed to clearly explain how the mysteries did or did not relate to each other. Each of the first four Hardy Boys mysteries were quick, enjoyable reads, and I would recommend them for children in the age range of about eight through whatever age the series holds their interest. Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"Written in 1928, Aunt Gertrude makes her debut in this volume. The plot is an excellent one, never quite equaled by the other volumes. The book begins in innocence and coasts through the first 10 chapters. From page 110 onward it is difficult to put it down if you are reading it for the first time. The Sleuth plays a prominent role and the mood is tense throughout the latter chapters. The revision in my mind was excellent. I truly loved both books and although the revisions lost the appeal and liesurly pace that the originals had, the revision of this book excedes the early chapters of the original. The latter chapters of the original were better than the revision. Both were excellent. Original: Rated A.

At the point where Biff and Tony have disappeared, and Frank and Joe announce they want to pursue their two friends, Aunt Gertrude chimes up and puts her foot down. Two boys have gone missing, she says. Now two more boys want to go searching for them -- and likely will end up missing themselves. So then, two more boys will have to go seeking the Hardys, and then two more, and so on... until there are no longer any boys at all left in Bayport.I hope the Hardys had a large house, because a little bit of Aunt Gertrude certainly would go a long way. Mrs. Hardy must have been a genuine angel, to tolerate her husband's know-it-all, overbearing sister just showing up and dropping in all the time, to stay for visits of indefinite duration."},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"This is not only Dixon at the top of his form, this is English literature at its most brilliant. I thought that The Disapperaing Floor would be Dixon's masterpiece, but I was wrong. The Missing Chums is the forgotten gem of 20th century writing, on a par with Joyce, Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald. Dos Passos. Of particular interest here are the characters Chet, Tony and Iona; what other novelist could have written them so vividly, filled them with such life! The town of Bayport is Dixon's microcosm of the universe, its good and evil, its love and hate, heaven and hell. What Dublin is for Joyce, this village is for Dixon. When all is said and done, I feel that Missing Chums will be ranked with Gatsby and The Sun Also Rises.

This book was one of the first that I read and it introduced me to the fact of communication that language evolves over time. I was approximately 10 years old at the time and the title puzzled me for I had never heard the term \\"chums\\" before. I was able to use the context to determine what it meant but I asked my teacher about it. She told me that the words used changed over time with new ones being created and others falling into disuse.The book was published in 1928 and while it is a typical Hardy Boys adventure, the tone is consistent with the time. Fenton Hardy is on the trail of a criminal gang and in order to force him to cease, members of the gang decide to kidnap Frank and Joe. However, they are not terribly efficient for they kidnap Chet Morton and Biff Hooper instead. The Hardy boys and their remaining chums search for the missing boys and via their powers of deduction and some luck, they are able to find and rescue them.The other significant aspect of this story is that it introduces their Aunt Gertrude. In this story she is depicted as an extremely shrewish woman, constantly complaining and criticizing. Fortunately, in later stories those characteristics are mellowed out and she is portrayed as a much more tolerable woman.The very early Hardy Boys books are a lesson in the history of adolescent male adventure stories. They are often knocked unconscious and the women tend to be submissive or shrewish as depicted by Mrs. Hardy and Aunt Gertrude."},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"I would highly recomend this book and series.

This gets them involved into not only the Shantytown fights, but also into investigating the bank robbery as best they can. After the party, the brothers learn that two of their friends, Chet Morton and Biff Hooper, were abducted on the way home. Another mystery! Frank and Joe frantically look for clues so they can find their friends (not to mention the other mysteries).This is another solid offering in the Hardy Boys Mystery Series. It is my understanding that the revised edition has been dramatically altered from the original, though it shares the abduction of Chet and Biff. This is not one of my favorite stories of the series, but like the rest, it is an interesting story and works several different storylines together (my favorites are the ones that can stick with one plotline for the entire book). \\"The Missing Chums\\" is recommended, like the other books in the series, for children of all ages.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"The Missing Chums (Hardy Boys, Book 4)","review":"Item was shipped expediously and received in great condition.

Sayers. I'm sorry I read it. It is slow moving and unbelievable. I couldn't even finish reading it because it was so terrible. Not a good mystery."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"\\"Clouds of Witness\\" is the first novel by Dorothy Sayers that I have read. I was an avid Agatha Christie fan in junior high and high school and haven't really read much of the mystery genre since. However, I was recently recommended \\"Clouds of Witness\\" so I picked it up.\\"Clouds of Witness\\" follows Lord Peter Wimsey, an amateur detective who lives in Britain, as he tries to clear his brother Gerald, the Duke of Denver, of murder charges that have been brought against him. The victim is their sister Lady Mary's fianc&eacute; Captain Denis Cathcart. Cathcart is found shot to death one night in the garden of Riddlesdale Lodge where the Duke of Denver, Lady Mary, and a group of others are staying. Gerald refuses to supply an alibi for the time of the murder and becomes the prime suspect and his sister's testimony does nothing to help him. Wimsey, with the help of his \\"confidential man and assistant sleuth\\" Bunter and his friend Detective Inspector Parker gather clues and follow leads in an attempt to discover who killed Cathcart. To solve the mystery, Wimsey must discover exactly what his brother was up to at the time of the murder and what it is that his sister is hiding. Along the way there are lots of red herrings and twists and turns in the investigation.The writing in \\"Clouds of Witness\\" was good with great descriptions of the Duke of Denver's trial. There were a lot of British colloquialisms in the text that in my opinion helped establish the atmosphere.Overall, I enjoyed the book, although I find it a bit hard to get into. I would've preferred for the plot to have a quicker pace. It just didn't pull me into the story immediately. The plot was suspenseful and wasn't predictable, which is very good for a mystery novel since you don't want to guess \\"who-dun-it\\" within the first few pages. However, the resolution was a slight disappointment."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"This is not a review of Dorothy Sayer's writing; it is a review of the terrible edition being sold to the unwary. This is not a published paperback, it is a printout inserted between covers. There is no publisher, no copyright information, nothing to even guarantee that this is Dorothy Sayers' writing. The cover is ugly and has nothing to do with the story. The layout of the pages is ugly and hard to read - and comes with word processing typos such as fractions and question marks within words. There is no way to tell from the Amazon listing that this is a printout, not an actual published book. And the price is outrageous for such a piece of junk. Save your money and buy a used paperback elsewhere. My order of \\"Whose Body?\\" was the same. I am now afraid to order paperbacks from Amazon because they don't identify these printouts in the listings."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"I purchased the paperback from Amazon and am responding to the physical book I received, not the story. Beware! The \\"product description\\" is deceptive and very confusing. Presumably, the novel is out of copyright and has been reprinted (badly) by someone and that is what is being sold. The reprint has such terrible printing (tiny [10-pt?] type and huge [triple] linespacing between paragraphs) it is virtually unreadable. Perhaps it is a print-on-demand copy. Rightly so, no one claims to be publisher, only that it is \\"made in Lexington, Kentucky.\\" I am returning it immediately. A shameful knock-off!"},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"My negative review is solely with respect to the edition that I purchased, not the story. Unfortunately, this newly printed version of the paperback is a poor substitute for an older used version of this paperback. I should have known from the images on the book cover which had absolutely nothing to do with the story, given that I have read the novel before and simply lost my original copy (the front cover showing a flapper in a nightclub; the back side of the cover showing a hand holding a knife -- despite death having occurred in this story by revolver).The copyright having lapsed, it apparently allowed someone to print up the book at will, and what a regrettable job they did. The font size is on the small side (although there are huge spaces between paragraphs), new chapters do not necessarily begin on new pages, and occasionally one finds an odd character (such as a capital O with an umlaut) which I have only seen appear when text is dumped from one word-processing program into another program without care for editing. It does not make for an easy read -- despite being an entertaining read.The story is a great Lord Peter Wimsey novel, and I recommend it to all -- but not in this edition. Despite having just purchased it, I will donate this copy to my local Goodwill and buy another REAL copy of the book."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"I enjoy Dorothy Sayers as an escape during stressful times. This is my second novel by Sayers, but I'm an Anglophile from way back. If you like Downton Abbey, Masterpiece Theatre type atmosphere, you'll like Lord Peter, his intelligent and protective butler, and their world of crime-solving while enjoying the finer things in life. Good claret, tramping the moors, Burberry coats, knowing old ladies... Sayers takes me away from today's worries. The trains always run on time, there's always a cheery fire in the grate, and except for the occasional dead body, illicit affairs, and cheating card players, life is good.Well, most of the time.The touches of realism do have parallels to today's world, though. A former Major, Lord Peter is a World War I vet who suffers from bouts of what we now call PTSD. His experiences in the Great War haunt him, and his butler, Bunter, his former Sargeant during the War, takes particularly good care of Peter during this episodes. Sayers handles Peter's \\"shell shock\\" in a sensitive way.If entertainment and escape is your goal, Sayers will not disappoint with Lord Peter. I plan to read more in the series."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Lord Peter Wimsey must find the evidence to clear his older brother, Gerald, the Duke of Denver from the charge of murder. The victim is the fianc&eacute; of Gerald and Peter's sister, Lady Mary Wimsey.There is much conflicting testimony amongst the witnesses, and Lord Peter, ably assisted by his faithful manservant Bunter and Inspector Parker, does his best in an effort to save his brother.The book is well written, and well paced. There is a trial in the House of Lords, something most readers have perhaps heard of, but never have read about in any great detail. We read of the Wimsey family (Lord Peter, the Dowager Duchess, Lady Mary, and the Duke of Denver), and their friends (the Arbuthnots and others), in an excellent depiction of what life was life in the upper-crust families after World War I.I'd recommend this book, and any of the Lord Peter Wimsey series. Also recommended is the TV adaptation starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"This is a Lord Peter not to be missed! We have him in the bosom of his family when eldest brother Gerald, Duke of Denver, is accused of murdering his sister's ex-fianc&eacute;. (The sister in question had not yet been told she was an \\"ex\\" before the murder took place). The Dowager Duchess Mary makes an appearance and is all things to her hard-luck daughter and two so-different sons.The setting is a hunting lodge in Yorkshire where Gerald has invited a group for shooting. Though they are clearly roughing it, servants and surface propriety abound. The time is in the early \`20s and much emphasis is placed on the bravery and experiences of the Great War. Gerald is discovered at 3 am standing over the body of the late Denis Cathcart, Mary's erstwhile fianc&eacute;. Mary exclaims \\"O God! You've killed him!\\" in front of guests Col. and Mrs. Marchbanks, and Mr. and Mrs. Pettigrew-Robinson. (Those names made me feel as if I was playing a game of Clue!) Lord Peter is wired to come home from Corsica in hopes he can clear up the matter.Lord Peter's task is made more difficult because clearly, no one is giving a true account of either the happenings or their alibis. Mary, a formerly healthy girl, takes to her bed in a suspicious case of nervous hysterics. Gerald believes it is enough that he has told officials he is \\"innocent.\\" It is no one's business but his own where he was at the time of the murder. It is important to keep in mind that among this aristocratic family \\"honor\\" to one's family, a lady's reputation, or a promise may be more important than life itself. Somehow they all think they will muddle through.There is much tramping about in the cold and the wet, marching over moors to not much effect. Lord Peter has a marvelous exchange with a dour Yorkshire farmer as if Lord Peter had walked into a Thomas Hardy novel. The uncouth and brutal farmer has a beautiful terrified wife. Peter keeps up a lively conversation trying to stay ahead of the dogs being set upon him.The climax of the novel is the Duke's trial. A Duke cannot be tried by just anyone. The King must appoint a Lord High Steward, and he must be judged by his peers. This involved all the peerage of England getting out their ermines and robes to participate in the trial. It is richly described and a delight.The conclusion is somewhat a letdown to the reader, but Lord Peter and family are quite satisfied that their little spot of trouble is over, even if all the questions are not answered. Of course, I need not even say that Bunter was flawless."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"For Lord Peter Wimsey, playing detective seems to be just that - a game - until his brother is accused of murder, and the murder of their sister's fiance at that. Detection in this case is not a game nor is it straightforward, for Wimsey's factfinding missions may do more harm than good. \\"Clouds of Witness\\" is an intriguing spiderweb of a mystery that comes full circle but is just a little on the disappointing side in terms of solution.While on vacation on the continent, Wimsey learns that his brother Gerald is accused of murder while the family was relaxing at Riddlesdale Lodge in the country. The victim is one Denis Cathcart, the suave and debonair fiance of Wimsey's younger sister, Mary. Wimsey steps in to help the local police who have badly bungled the inquest and desires to clear his brother's name, but his obstinate brother won't defend himself. He continues to hide something about that night - not the quarrel he had with the deceased or the fact that Cathcart claimed he and Mary were no longer engaged - but something that would certainly provide him with an alibi. It is Wimsey's unwelcome task to uncover this secret and to discover who had a motive in killing Cathcart, since suicide is out of the question. Was it Mary's previous boyfriend, a socialist loudmouth the family disapproved of? Was it the foul tempered husband from the nearby farm who believes his wife is unfaithful? Was it Gerald? Wimsey and Parker follow clues and lack of clues to Paris and America, braving life and limb to solve this intricate crime.The answer is suprising and it isn't. \\"Clouds of Witness\\" is a delightful read, full of Sayers' trademark intelligence and keenness for puzzles. For fans of Lord Peter Wimsey it is interesting to meet more of his family and for them to be shown in a less than flattering light. Even though I enjoyed the book and think the solution is fitting, I couldn't help but wish for a different version after so many diversionary clues and such strange behavior of certain characters in the story."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"This was the second Dorothy Sayers' book I've read. After devouring my first introduction to her and her protagonist, Lord Peter Wimsey inWhose Body?via my kindle, I immediately downloaded this second book.Sayers' brilliance (educated at Oxford) shines in her books, and Lord Peter's wit infuses the book with joie de vivre. I can almost hear Cole Porter music in the background as I read, as Sayers is writing in the 1920's and 30's and captures the spirit of the times.My favorite aspect of her writing, as a history major, are the ironic comments of her characters, particularly Lord Peter. A favorite example of these in this book is when his sister, who is part of the landed aristocracy, goes to a Boshevik \\"Workers Meeting\\", Lord Peter quips something to the effect, \\"Why Mary has never worked a day in her life!\\" Of course, we, the readers, know the misery Bolsheviks in the form of Lenin and Stalin caused in the years ahead, so Sayers mystery gives us a vision of the naivete of her contemporaries and the age, not knowing the impending doom of the Russian Revolution, mass murder of 35 million Russians and Cold War.Mary indicates that she wants to be saved from a life of endless polo parties, garden parties, bazaars etc. and you couldn't help but think of Princess Diana who wanted to escape eventually from that fate, too, and find meaning and purpose.The plot takes place in Wimsey's brother's country estate, unlike WHOSE BODY which is centered in London. It's fun to have the change of setting and see Wimsey and his quotable mother and family in both environments. I read the books partly to hear what fresh observations come out of their mouths.If you like Sayers, or Golden Age mysteries, this is vintage Dorothy Sayers and the Golden Age at its best and most quintessential."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers writes many non-fiction books however among her best is the Lord Peter Wimsey series. I came to this series sort of though the back door. My first taste was the BBC productions with Petherbridge as Lord Peter that can now be found on DVD. So I read all of Dorothy's books containing the relationship of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Now it is time to go through the whole series.Lord Peter returns from Corsica. To find his older brother the Duke of Denver practically accused of murder. What is worse is his brother is not talking. So it is up to Peter to find out what happened and clear his brother.In the process he puts his foot in it and practically gets all his relatives and friends accused. As with all Sayers' stories nothing is simple there are overlapping plots and foolish deeds, as if Peter can not figure them out. On the side we learn a little about English society and ballistics."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Even though _Whose Body?_, the inaugural adventure of amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, was pretty good, it was a rather bald narrative. This second outing is far more subtle and far more interesting and it brings the author's glass to bear on the Wimsey family in all its huntin', shootin' glory. Peter is on holiday in Corsica following the strain of the case in the first volume but is called back home when his brother, the duke, is arrested for the murder of Capt. Cathcart, fianc&eacute; of Lady Mary Wimsey, sister to the two brothers, at his hunting lodge. The Duke, even though he's theoretically facing the gallows (which he doesn't quite seem to comprehend), refuses to provide himself with an alibi, having been somewhere and doing something he oughtn't at the time of the shooting, and it takes a good deal of digging by Lord Peter and his friend, DI Charles Parker, to discover just what that is. Meanwhile, Lady Mary -- who has her own plans under way -- having come upon her brother standing over the body, and having totally misunderstood the situation, commits perjury in court to protect him. And because she's loyal but not very bright, she only digs him in deeper. In fact, there are a number of quite separate plot-lines here (plus a couple of judiciously selected but believable coincidences) but Lord Peter eventually manages to unsnarl them all and come up with the proof his brother needs (and doesn't seem to want). The solution to the murder may not be what the reader expects, either. The trial scenes in the House of Lords are especially cinematic and I think the characters of the two main defense attorneys are especially well done, and not at all comic. By the way, readers of Sayers's novels often assume she was a fan of the British aristocracy. This is far from being the case; she actually was highly critical of the hereditary upper classes, as demonstrated by the shallow, narrow-minded, self-satisfied characters of the Duke of Denver and most of his cronies. Lord Peter is very much the exception to this, which everyone who knows him seems to recognize -- whether they care to admit to it or not."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"&#34;Clouds of Witnesses&#34; introduces Lord Peter Whimsey, younger brother of the stuffy Duke of Denver-idle, rich, and decptively lazy.

A contemporary of Agatha Christie, Sayers' stories are set during the same time period, but her writing is better, her characters more completely developed and her plots are deeper and more satisfying. To put it aother way-Christie is like afternoon tea and cakes, and Sayers is the full course meal!

And it is an unusual trial indeed since members of the British nobility who were charged with murder, during the era of Lord Peter Wimsey, had to be tried, not at the Old Bailey, but rather by the full House of Lords!The Duke of Denver, (\\"Jerry\\" to his friends), has purchased a small hunting lodge on the edge of the moors and his guests are in for some bird shooting. But on a cold, rainy night, the Duke's prospective brother-in-law, Lady Mary's dubious gold-digging fiance, ultimately becomes the victim of an apparent murder.At the inquest, one lie after another is proffered by the Wimsey family and the jury brings in a murder indictment against the Duke for his clear skullduggery in the matter. Lord Peter is away on an extended vacation to the European continent but rushes to his brother's aide when he hears of the fiasco. Lord Peter then teams up with his Scotland Yard pal, Inspector Parker, to find the real killer and thus free his brother -- but Lord Peter gets shot for his trouble!WARNING TO READERS -- SEMI-SPOILER AHEAD!!!Now, the most compelling caveat of this Sayers entry is the fact that, in this one, the stogy Duke of Denver (Jerry) is having an affair with the wife of a very nasty character, a farmer who also happens to be the Duke's neighbor! If that were not enough, Lord Peter and his lawyer make every effort to get the Duke off the hook without disclosing to his wife that she's been cheated on, and they SUCCEED in that devious endeavor!!! I mention this as Sayers treats this indiscretion in a notably cavalier manner and many women readers might not exactly savour this particular caveat of the book. These days, we are not surprised by similar writings but, in the 20s, Sayers was clearly breaking new ground, sort of in an anti-feminist way.I enjoyed the book, all around, but it's far from being Sayers' best work. If you are new to this renowned author of British mysteries, you might want to read either \\"Whose Body?\\" or, \\"The Unpleasantness at the Belonna Club\\" first. They are her two best, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Sayers is one of my favorite mystery authors, and Petherbridge's portrayal of Whimsey one of my favorite childhood memories -- it was the series starring him on Mystery that got me reading Sayers in the first place. I snapped up this audio the instant I found it, and only wish that they had allowed him to do it unabridged. Fans of the show will appreciate Petherbridge's ability to mimic his co-stars voices with unobtrusive smoothness. Newbies will enjoy the fact that he is one of the few male narrators who can read a female character without a single grate on the nerves; he somehow feminizes his voice without sounding false or fakey.

His creator was Dorothy Sayers, one of the first women to receive a degree from Oxford University.Wimsey is a complex yet agreeable character, a peer of the realm who has a witty, urbane facade which can slip to reveal a steely resolve as well as a tender and sometimes fragile psyche. \\"The essential Peter,\\" Sayers once wrote, \\"is seen to be the familiar figure of the interpretative artists, the romantic soul at war with a realistic brain.\\"In this second of eleven Lord Peter books, the accused is Lord Peter's brother, the Duke of Denver, suspected of murdering his sister's fiance after discovering he is a cad.

It's definitely not as good asMurder Must Advertise (Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries), orThe Nine Tailors, but it certainly shows some promise.Having just spent time abroad in Corsica, Lord Peter Wimsey returns to find that his brother Gerald, the Duke of Denver, has been accused of the murder of one of his houseguests at Riddlesdale Lodge, a house rented for the hunting season. The murdered man was Lord Peter and the Duke's brother-in-law-to-be--so Lord Peter intervenes in what promises to be a sticky mess. It turns out that a lot of people are guilty of a lot of things, and it's up to Wimsey to sort things out. What I love about this book is that you know who didn't do it--the fun is in figuring out who did.This book (the second Sayers wrote about Lord Peter, actually) isn't as strong as some of her later books, but it's pretty good nonetheless. The identification of the murderer isn't as important here, though, as is a major twist that's revealed near the end. Lord Peter himself, with his unusual manner of speaking and varied pursuits, is an endearing character, and it's easy to see why Peter might have inspired many other gentleman-detectives in fiction (Inspector Linley from Elizabeth George's books). I thought that Lady Mary was one of the weaker characters (way too many dramatics for me). Clouds of Witness may be the second book in this series (after Whose Body?), but if you're new to the series, you may want to start with this one--there's a lot more character development, as well as the introduction of some characters who make recurring appearances throughout the series."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"\\"Clouds of Witness\\" was a very delightful book! In both the mystery and the characters, I thought Sayers came through brilliantly!Lord Peter Wimsey (the main character and detective) is truly a humorous, clever, thoughtful, and lovable character! He breezes through life, always seeing the amusement and humor in situations, but doesn't lack the ability to understand people and events for the gravity they may hold.Wimsey himself was a delightful enough character to hold my interest through the book, but add to this his good friend (and partner in crime-solving) Mr. Parker (adorable friends!) and Mr. Bunter (another more \\"proper\\" counterpart to Wimsey) and you have an entire book set to amuse!Oddly enough, Sayers doesn't use a lot of description. In a way it reminds a bit of Jane Austin (though the feel of the books is not similar!), in her ability to convey the characters in their uniqueness and completeness through dialogue.The mystery also is most interesting. And while I could have felt \\"cheated\\" by the ending, I didn't because of the various sub-mysteries that were occurring throughout the book. It is, in a way, three or four mysteries all revolving around one.Additionally, the mystery centers around Wimsey's own family, which adds another element to Wimsey's character, and the mystery itself.A note: the book does contain a few slightly graphic descriptions of the murder, but I stress the word slightly. I have read some Agatha Christie, and think that it's probably on par with those. I am quite the queasy reader, and I had few qualms.The only thing I regretted - if it could be called a regret - was the prevalent use of French. I can't blame or criticize Sayers on this front, only myself for not having a better grasp of the language. That said, while a times I was dismayed because I did not understand every detail or clue, for the most part everything was eventually (and in a timely manner) translated or explained.I really enjoyed this read! And am very much looking forward to picking up another Lord Peter Wimsey mystery!!"},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"If you are a Dorothy L. Sayers fan, this is an important piece of the Wimsey family history--particularly that of Lady Mary and Chief Inspector Parker. I had put off reading this and several other novels for a long time because (1) they didn't include Harriet Vane, and (2) I felt Sayers later works were better than her early stories. I still feel the latter is true, although that should not dissuade the reader from perusing these earlier mysteries.I give Clouds of Witness four stars only because five stars has to go to her crowning work Gaudy Night."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"The worst nightmare for a detective is having a solid case... against a member of your own family. Dorothy Sayers imagined such a story for Lord Peter Wimsey in her second mystery novel, \\"Clouds of Witness,\\" a solid, twisting whodunnit full of lies, affairs and deceptionPeter is on vacation when he finds out that his brother, The Duke of Denver (informally \\"Gerald\\"), is on trial for murder -- he had a blowup with his sister Mary's fiancee, Denis Cathcart, upon learning that Cathcart was a former cardsharper. The next morning, Cathcart was found shot through the heart by Gerald's gun, with Gerald bending over the body. The Duke stubbornly refuses to explain why he was out in the rain at three in the morning.Peter is determined to solve the case, and quickly finds plenty of clues and odd little details, including the fact that Mary keeps lying -- and changing her lies. There are too many clues, and not enough logical motives. Now to save his brother, Peter must unravel plenty of lies and red herrings, and discover who wanted to do away with Denis Cathcart -- and why.\\"Clouds of Witness\\" is an excellent whodunnit, with lots of quirky characters and a very twisty murder mystery -- in fact, it's not even clear whether it's even a murder. And Sayers seemed to be more at ease in this mystery, since it unfolds in a more gradual manner, as if she were more sure of herself than in \\"Whose Body.\\"If there's a flaw, it's that her writing can be slightly uneven -- we get lots of descriptions of Mary, but I still have no idea what Bunter looks like. But Sayers can craft a spectacular plot, with lots of red herrings and odd twists, especially since most of the people involved are telling lies, usually about romantic affairs.The general feeling is unusually taut even for a mystery, since Peter is trying to help his stuffy brother. But Sayers also sprinkles in some comedic moments to lessen the tension, such as when Peter dines with a flaky, chic socialist who thinks it's thrilling when the police raid them. The dialogue is also enjoyably quirky, especially when Peter is doing the talking (\\"I should be crucified upside down for anemia of the brain!\\").The cast is made up of all sorts -- weaselly socialists, flaky socialites, the stuffy Gerald and his equally stiff wife, and the rambling yet clever Dowager. And Peter is the center of all this, a detective who acts like Bertie Wooster and thinks like Hercule Poirot -- he has loads of brains and reasoning ability, but you'd never guess it by how he acts.\\"Clouds of Witness\\" is a clever, twisty murder mystery with a likably eccentric hero, and one of Dorothy Sayers' best mystery novels. Definitely a good, solid read with a colourful cast."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"The type in this book is very poor quality.

The print is extremely small and the typography is terrible. You would be better off ordering an out of print copy from a standard publisher"},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Throughout the novel, the author had avoided passing absolute facts and instead sought to present various scenarios through the dialogues and statements of various characters.Interestingly, it is also one where the mystery is not definitely solved as the author used the Defence Counsel's arguments to present the supposed answer rather than stating it as a matter of truth or fact.A bit of grim humour was introduced in her description of the British Court trying a peer of the realm, having to back hundreds of years to find legal precedants and the office of the Lord High Steward. Here, the author appeared at one point to be revelling in writing about the exaggerated formalities and pomp of trying a peer that it seemed to be her climax and that the case was just an excuse to write about it.To be fair, she did write about a nice case.The case itself, which appreared to be another who-dun-it murder, introduced many side plotlines. As in real life, most of the time, a person finds himself in numerous roles that often when something like a murder mystery occured, most writers neglect all other aspects of the person and present only the relevant ones. This author however, had managed to present the different roles a character has in &quot;real-life&quot; without falling into a rambling trap.Certainly for a fan of hard-core detective novels, this book may be rather disappointing in its conclusion. However, taken as a novel, it provided an interesting glimpse into the British aristocratic society and its interaction with other parts of society as a whole.Except for the conversational language used, Peter Whimsey could have been substituted by a certain Belgian detective and the entire novel would have appeared as a Christie's."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Dorothy Sayers' second Lord Peter Wimsey novel comes in on a more serious note. Wimsey, just returned from a long rest in Corsica, finds himself embroiled in a murder far closer to home. While staying at a hunting lodge with friends Peter's brother Gerald has gotten tangled up in a murder, and has become the chief suspect. To make matters more complicated, the victim is their sister Mary's ex-fianc&eacute;e. Very recently ex, as a matter of fact. The murder was done shortly after Gerald has thrown him out of the house as a card cheat.When an alibi is demanded, Gerald refuses to give one, and so is charged with the crime. As he is the Duke of Denver, Gerald's case will not be heard in court, but before the House of Lords. Lord Peter is confronted with a case in which the accused seems bound and determined to get himself hung. Gerald offers no help to his brother, the police, or even Impey Biggs, his barrister. Peter and his long time friend Inspector Parker, are left with only faint clues and surmises as the basis for building a defense.It quickly becomes apparent that there is guilt everywhere. Denis Cathcart, the victim, had lived a suspicious life in Paris, Lady Mary has complicated ties to the British socialist movement, and Gerald, if he wasn't killing Cathcart, had to be doing something he didn't want to reveal. Wimsey and Parker find a surplus of suspicious behavior, in England and abroad, but the puzzle refuses to be unlocked. Worse, those mysteries they can solve do nothing to help Gerald. Time marches inexorably on, and Lord Peter must make a last minute race against time in an effort to solve the mystery.Despite the seriousness of this case, with all its lurking tragedies, Lord Peter retains his sarcastic style, providing both comic relief and the insights of the master detective. This time however he does reveal more of serious side, leaving behind his facetious exterior as he displays new depth. Sayers, of course, continues to write brilliantly, providing finely grained characters and a wonderful sense of place. An unexpected side romance shows signs of beginning, which will delight the readers, as Inspector Parker leaves behind theology long enough to embarrass himself.The Wimsey novels can be read in any order, although the latter part of the series does have some thematic material with develops over several volumes. The early novels are independent tales, and I exhort the reader to start with whatever is at hand. In little time you will find yourself addicted to an England that never really was, but certainly should have been."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"This is one of my three favorite Lord Peter Wimsey novels (the other two are The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club and Murder Must Advertise), and unless you plan to read the entire series (in which case you should start with Unnatural Death), it's the best introduction to Wimsey and his world, as it revolves around his brother Gerald, the Duke of Denver, being accused of murdering their sister Mary's fiance. It also features Wimsey's friend Chief Inspector Parker, as well as introducing several recurring characters.Unlike Unnatural Death, where Wimsey seems more devil-may-care and speaks in more slang-y sentences, this book shows a more mature Wimsey who's fully aware of his duties to his family and the responsibilities of his position in life (an occasional theme in the series), and we see that Wimsey is far from being merely a man about London.The mystery itself is one of the more clever ones in the series, revolving around holes in Gerald's testimony which Wimsey must investigate, as well as the background of the murder victim, although the final resolution seems not to completely justify the build-up. (This is common in Sayers' mysteries; the setting and characters tend to be stronger than the puzzle driving the plot.) Overall, though, it's an entertaining book, featuring more moments of dramatic suspense than in the later novels, making it perhaps the most well-rounded Wimsey adventure."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"...That Dorothy Sayers was in love with her own fictional detective. I'm half in love with him myself. This wasn't my favorite Peter Wimsey novel, but even in being my not-favorite, it was satisfying and enchanting.Sayers reminds me of GK Chesterton in this novel in the way she uses the form to gently deflate the radical political ideas of the day without losing the plot. The trial procedure for the peer of a realm contrasted with the romances of Wimsey's sister Mary neatly highlight the decaying class system in which these characters move. It's full of priceless moments, such as the one where a character is told witheringly that while he could be forgiven being a murderer, he can't be forgiven for being an ass.The book suffers a bit from an overly complicated plot that only becomes overly complicated three-quarters of the way through and Sayers accidentally makes several of the red herring characters more interesting than the really pertinent ones. Most importantly, I felt like the character of the murdered man was not illuminated as well as she has done in some of her other novels-- despite all the details provided, he felt curiously unfinished or stock."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"This is one of my favorite Wimsey stories, but the formatting in the Kindle edition is bad to the point of distracting from the plot. Paragraphs are run together and the margins meander around without uniformity. I hope this edition will be improved in the near future, I'd be glad to re-download it."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Clouds of Witness is a good book, but not among Sayers best. Written early in her career, the story allows one to feel that there will be greater books yet to come, but this - alas - is not that book. The book suffers mainly because it feels as if Sayers is emulating other writers (at one point Wimsey refers to his &quot;gray cells&quot;), and not trusting her own voice enough. It's understandable, given that this is her sophomore outing, but it's regrettable that it isn't quite what a modern reader might think of as a \\"Dorothy L. Sayers mystery.\\"The characters, women particularly, are well fleshed-out stereotypes. We have the noble fool (Lady Mary), the gold-digger (Simone Vonderaa), and the caged bird set free (Mrs. Grimethorpe). Even the legal team of Murbles and Biggs are set at the far ends of the spectrum of lawyerly caricature (Biggs' closing argument is an especially hammy monologue).While it's nice to meet Wimsey's family, the rest of the hunting party is mostly useless (murder victim excepted). Wimsey and D.I. Parker's camaraderie is enjoyable, though the latter likely has a conflict of interest - doubly so, given his attraction to Lady Mary, Wimsey's sister and the deceased's fianc&eacute;e.My greatest frustration with the book has to do with the way the emerald-eyed cat charm is handled. Although its ownership is proven relatively early in the book Wimsey and Parker keep trying to determine if it belonged to someone else. It seems Sayers wants it to be a red herring, but in light of the fact that we know whose it is - as do Wimsey and Parker - it just doesn't work. Sayers also tries her hand at adventure writing, most notably in the \\"foggy bog\\" and \\"trans-Atlantic flight\\" scenes; in these she succeeds and it's a pity that in the future these dramatic touches are saved mainly for scenes involving the detective and his Daimler.Even though the book has several shortcomings it's still an entertaining piece of writing. It does better at charting the rise of one of England's finest authors than as a literary masterpiece in its own right, but for all that Sayers fans should be sure not to overlook this early treasure."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Acclaimed for his portrayals of Lord Peter Wimsey on BBC, Ian Carmichael is the ideal voice for this story. As the London Daily Express put it he plays Wimsey so perfectly that \\"Sayers might have created Wimsey just so Carmichael could portray him.\\"Dorothy Sayers (1893 - 1957) is surely one of the most popular mystery writers of all time. Today, some years after her death, her stories continue to be widely read. With \\"Clouds of Witness\\" her protagonist Lord Peter Wimsey is called upon to investigate the death of his sister's fianc&eacute;. At least it may have been a fragrant departure as the recently murdered was found dead among the chrysanthemums, sartorially perfect in dinner jacket and slippers.Most shocking is the fact that Sir Peter's brother, the Duke of Denver, stands accused. Surely that cannot be so. Sir Peter begins his own investigation in order to save his brother.As is often the case, Sayers creates a surprising courtroom scene and Carmichael reads it with gusto.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"In some respects Dorothy Sayers is a problematic author, and early in her career she struggled with what can only be called a tendency toward incessant clutter: a wordy style, an often awkwardly expressed fascination with the mechanics of timetables, and constant reference to erudite academia that frequently verged on the downright obscure. But with CLOUDS OF WITNESS she found a very neat balance--and the result is not only the first clear sounding of Sayers' literary voice, it is also simply the best of her early works.In this particular story, death unexpectedly arrives in the very bosom of the Wimsey family: the Duke has taken a rural manor for the hunting season, and when his sister's fiance is found shot to death in the small hours of the morning he is himself accused. Curiously, he declines to offer any sort of alibi--but fortunately there is a sleuth in the family: Lord Peter Wimsey, who arrives post-haste to sort the matter out.While the novel's conclusion may frustrate many readers, this is a fast, fun read with engaging characters and an emerging and very sophisticated literary style--the style on which Sayers would ultimately establish such later and landmark works as MURDER MUST ADVERTISE, GAUDY NIGHT, and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. Established fans will likely enjoy it more than first-timers, but if you've not yet encountered Sayers don't let that stop you: it's an elegant work. Recommended.--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--"},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"The 1 star isn't for the novel--great mystery, as always. It's for the particular edition I bought. It looks like it took 5 minutes and 2 dollars to print. This is a public domain work, and someone basically printed off the free (but error-full) text and slapped a cover on it (with stock, pixellated pictures). There isn't even a name of a publishing company. All this wouldn't bother me except that it's printed in tiny, tiny print."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"I'm a devoted fan of Dorothy Sayers and was looking forward to read Clouds of Witness, which has fantastic characterizations for all of Wimsey's family. I certainly enjoyed the story, but I found myself having to fight past typos in the text that looked as if portions of the book had been typed out by a monkey using a stick on a typewriter missing a few keys. Perhaps the text had also been translated into Wingdings, then Klingon, and then back into normal(?) English. The binding looks fairly flimsy, and the lack of publication information makes me exceedingly nervous about the legality of this edition, much less getting any long term usage out of this book.Do NOT buy this edition, but do buy the story in a more legitimate printing and enjoy it to its fullest. There are some absolutely wonderful moments with the Dowager Duchess, for instance, that cannot be missed."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Lord Peter needed to get away after the stresses he encountered solving a case a few weeks earlier (Whose Body?). He and Bunter went to the wilds of Corsica to relax. On their way back to civilization they discover that while they were gone the fiance of Lord Peter's sister, Lady Mary was murdered. Worse, the murder took place at a shooting party hosted by their older brother, Gerald the Duke of Denver. Worse still Gerald is the prime suspect!Peter and Bunter hurry home to try to solve the crime only to find that there are many mysteries about what happened that night. Why isn't Mary more upset about the death of her fiance? Why was their engagement called off that very night? Where exactly was Gerald that evening? Who left a suitcase in the conservatory?Gradually Peter begins to find answers to the various questions and raise a few more along the way. He and Bunter of course eventually save the day but not before having a few adventures along the way.This is an exciting mystery, it is well plotted and fairly laid out, all the clues are there for the reader. There are a few coincidences but nothing that overly strains possiblities. For fans of the series we are treated to a lot more insight into that wonderfully eccentric Wimsey family.So why four stars instead of five? First the book does tend to drag just a bit in places. Compared to later books in the series this is one of the lesser works. If you are a fan of the series this is a must read. I would also recommend it if you are a fan of mysteries of the '20's and '30's definitely read this one."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Lord Peter Wimsey at his best! Sayers mysteries never disappoint. Peter has to use all of his deductive powers to save his brother from the noose. This book will give you hours of enjoyment. Hard to put it down -- you will want to read it in one setting. These mysteries never go out of date."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Though old, it still is a great read. I would recommend this book to all lovers of well written mystery stories."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Lord Peter Wimsey, amateur sleuth, is leisurely wending his way back home to London from a much-needed vacation abroad when his indefatigable valet, Bunter, stumbles upon some astonishing news in the Paris papers. Gerald, Peter's elder brother and the oh-so-proper Duke of Denver, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering their sister Mary's husband-to-be. Of course the idea of Gerald murdering anybody is completely ridiculous, but Wimsey cannot resist the siren song of a promising case and the chance to put his flair for investigative work to use on behalf of the very brother who has in past bemoaned his sibling's unfortunate involvement in police work. Faced with the hangman's noose, Gerald refuses to provide himself with an alibi, and his case is remanded to the House of Lords for what promises to be the trial of the decade. With a brother who seems determined to hang and a sister who proves to be uncommonly un-helpful, Peter dives with relish into the conflicting reports that make up the account of the fateful night that Mary's fiance met his untimely end, determined to save his family from ruin in spite of themselves.I love classic mysteries which spotlight quirky, memorable protagonists, and with the cultured, devilishly smart Wimsey, Sayers has crafted an amateur sleuth sure to delight the heart of any Anglophile. Clouds of Witness is only the second full-length novel to feature Wimsey (following 1923's Whose Body?), and when compared to its predecessor it is a more polished offering, playing to Sayers's greatest strength -- Wimsey's intelligent, sarcastic charm. I love this novel's increased focus on Wimsey vis-a-vis his family relationships. Clearly aware of his various family members' respective affinity for the ridiculous, Wimsey is keenly aware of their short-comings but fiercely loyal -- and seeing Wimsey dance between his roles as brother, son, and friend test the sleuth's perspective and focus, adding tension to the narrative and layers to a character who at first blush could be mistaken for little more than a society fop.As Wimsey's second full-length outing, the plotting is more polished than his debut. The focus on his family dynamic adds a welcome personal focus to the narrative, raising the personal stakes for Peter since it it isn't just pride of accomplishment at stake, but his brother's very life. Where, however, this novel loses points is the narrative's reliance on transcripts of police interrogations or trials. The lengthy passages and chapters devoted to prose of this ilk bring the narrative to a screeching halt, slowing the investigation's momentum. Sayers's dense, packed prose is as always a delight, but her sidetracks into sarcastic, social commentary fall flat unless filtered through Wimsey's incisive point-of-view -- and in this case, he is almost wholly absent from such chapters.Despite the novel's occasionally uneven tone, Sayers's sleuth and his circle of acquaintance are, as always, an absolute delight. Between the ever-loyal Bunter, whose friendship and service to Peter began in the trenches of World War I France, to the loyal, easily exasperated Detective Parker, loathe to admit that he's begun to develop feelings for his best friend's sister, Wimsey's closest compatriots are as skillfully rendered as the shining star at the center of Sayers's work. While not Sayers's best work, Clouds of Witness is a solid example of a masterful writer honing her craft, providing a critical chapter in the development of one of literature's most enduring and memorable sleuths."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"I'd heard that Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey was a fictional detective I needed to read. After slogging through his debut story, \\"Whose Body?\\", I was very disappointed. The book was poorly written and the character, while interesting, didn't have a mystery deep enough for me to sink my teeth into. Three years after that one was written, Sayers published Wimsey's second tale, \\"Clouds of Witness\\". I'm not sure what she did during that intervening time, but whatever it was, it certainly helped her writing skills. This book is much more developed, interesting, and enjoyable.Lord Peter Wimsey is vacationing on Corsica when word reasches him that his elder brother, Gerald, has been arrested for murder. During a house party, a guest, Denis Cathcart, has been found dead by the back door. Shortly before his demise, Cathcart and Gerald had a loud argument, as Cathcart was Gerald's sister's fiance, and was recently revealed to have a less-than-desirable character. With Gerald refusing to give an alibi, he is quickly arrested and is to stand trial for committing murder. Convinced that his brother is innocent, Peter, along with his trusty valet, Mr. Bunter, rush back to England to sort out the mess.While trying to establish his brother's innocence, Lord Peter uncovers several intrigues involving a farmer on the moors, an abused wife, a cat-shaped piece of jewelry from Paris, and a man on a motorcycle with a distinguishing side-car. It's a delightful romp through the English countryside, as we follow Wimsey from one clue to the next, though Sayers does get herself tangled up in the side stories near the end. That being said, the writing here was so much better than the earlier book that I didn't mind that much. I'm now a devoted fan and can't wait to delve into the next installment."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"This book was obviously when Sayers stepped into her own as a mystery writer. Lord Peter Wimsey's brother is arrested for murder when his sister's fiance is found dead outside of their hunting lodge. The fiance had been a bit of a cad, and Wimsey's brother had been heard threatening him...so of course in those days, when forensics were in their early years...a lot of cases were made on circumstantial evidence. And a lot of the circumstantial evidence was against the brother, who was being stoic and honorable and refused to open his mouth, to protect his sister and other women he was involved with. Lord Peter Wimsey comes running back from the Continent along with his detective friend, and his trusty valet, and gets to work on the mystery, finding plenty of people doing questionable things, including his sister and his brother. Once he gets his sister to spill her secrets and gets her to see her mistakes are hurting her brother, some of the knots start to unravel allowing Wimsey to find a way to save his brother from a noose.What's great about these old mysteries is the sense of humor with which they are written. They are really funny, even now. Even being an American reading the rather droll British way of looking at things and being almost 100 years away from that time period, it is still charming. Apparently they did television shows of these mysteries back in the 70's but I'm wishing they'd redo them again now with someone more modern Britain to play the part of Peter Wimsey. I'm sure there are plenty of great English actors who could use the job..."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"Dorothy Sayers--need I say more? I rank this about the middle of the series.

My review is on the story, not the quality of print; I've had my copy of the book for ages and frankly don't know which version it is.Dorothy Sayers' writing is delightful, and while her first Lord Peter mystery, \\"Whose Body,\\" was good, it really pales in comparison to \\"Clouds of Witness.\\" Although the subject is serious--Peter's brother, the Duke, is accused of murder--the storytelling is fun, with plenty of humor. There's even a bit of action and Peter finds himself in terrible danger not once but three times, something not common in what they call a \\"cozy\\" mystery.Lord Peter is just a fun character, first and foremost. He calls himself a silly ass in one of the books, and he can be, but he doesn't miss a trick, and at the day he always gets his man (or woman). The clues in this one are plentiful but they lead in all sorts of directions, and it's fun to see him and his Watson, the faithful policeman Inspector Parker, running them all down in crazy fashion. Especially fun is their hike through a field as they follow a suspect's obscure tracks, with Parker holding Peter on his shoulders so they can scout the top of a stout fence, and Peter's commentary, \\"And here's a deep ditch--which I shall now proceed to fall into...\\"!And in the end it isn't a \\"who done it\\" so much as it's a \\"what the heck happened,\\" which for me is always the best kind of mystery."},{"Title":"Clouds Of Witness","review":"How great to see another Dorothy Sayers ebook! Clouds of Witness will be familiar to Sayers fans - here is all the wit, humor, events turning on themselves, and the selfless Lord Peter Wimsey breathlessly pursuing truth behind a killing - and in this case clearing his brother, accused of murder.For those of us intrigued by Britain between the wars, the contrast of class life at this time, and that clear and refreshing British humor will value this addition to the Dorothy Sayers e-canon.Clouds of Witness is a rich and humorous read."},{"Title":"Call for Revolution","review":"A lucid and precisely documented explanation of why, no matter which of the two &quot;established&quot; parties you vote for, nothing ever seems to change for the better on our national political scene. If you are one of the politically homeless who is savvy enough to realise that politicians from the two established parties are not acting in your best interests or the best interests of your children, this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Call for Revolution","review":"To bring Alexis de Tocqueville's concerns (especially regarding the tendencies of democracies to degrade into dictatorships) into the political battles of today, let me mention A Call for Revolution: How Washington is Strangling America--and How to Stop It (New York: Ballantine Books, c. 1993. This is a journalistic expose, an anecdotal alarm, a stentorian call to upend the government which is sucking life from its citizenry. It's not the book you turn to for solid analysis or contextualized data. It's a sermonic-style call for action which deserves a hearing.Gross began his book with a quotation from Al Gore, who hardly ever appears \\"revolutionary,\\" who said: \\"The federal government has grown stale, wasteful, inefficient, bureaucratic, and is failing the American people. Rock 'em, sock 'em, shake 'em-up changes are what the American people want\\" (p. 1). If it's what the people want, it's not what the Washington establishment will grant, but Gross takes Gore at his words and proposes some real \\"rock 'em, sock 'em, shake 'em-up changes.\\"The federal government, Gross shows, is utterly wasteful and prodigal in spending the people's monies. Between 1960 and 1990, the combined local, state, and federal government costs have soared 350% and now yearly spend $38,000 per family! More than 40% of the nation's GDP went to support government. This financial burden slowly strangles us all, and the burden results from the utter irresponsibility of our elected officials and entrenched bureaucrats.To illustrate, consider what's happened in Long Island, New York. A house which cost $8,000 in 1950 costs $210,000 four decades later. The owner, in 1950, made $5,000 yearly and paid a total of $615 in taxes; he had $4,000 in disposable income. Today's owner earns $41,000; his wife works to raise their total income to $58,500. School taxes alone are now 25 times what they were, amounting to $5,700. Add in all the other taxes, and this family pays $20,000 a year, and struggles to make ends meet in ways their counterparts in 1950 never imagined. The main difference in their economic status, Gross insists, is out-of-control taxation.As another example of the nation's problem, consider one aspect of our welfare system: some 12 federal agencies dole out $5 billion each year to help American Indians; that amounts to $20,000 per family of four--though in fact their income averages one-third of that! Washington collects and expends money with abandon. Unfortunately, only small amounts of it actually reach the intended beneficiaries. In fact, the current welfare system, which constitutes this nation's largest budgetary expenditure, costing us $300 billion a year, not only sustains but helps create poverty in America! All our efforts to eliminate poverty have misfired. \\"Despite the expenditure of a trillion dollars over the years, the number of people in 'poverty,' as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Census, is larger today than when the antipoverty programs went into full gear\\" (p. 91). A reasonable person, Gross assumes, would be inclined to explore other remedies as quickly as possible--right now, in fact!Concerned citizens can, in fact, make a difference. Join organizations such as Citizens Against Government Waste. Push politicians to pass a balanced budget amendment and authorize a line item veto for the President. Push for term limits. The list of suggestions is extensive, and perhaps many of them would make a real difference.What Gross's book does is make available some of the alarming details many of us never hear about. With such information in hand, with the courage to confront the powers that be, the United States might recover from the strangle-hold of its federal dictators."},{"Title":"Call for Revolution","review":"Martin Gross has written many books, but none as important as this one. Written back in 1993, it is more relevant today as our Federal Leviathan of a government continues to consume, swallow and waste more of our hard-earned tax dollars. When you read how little your parents paid in taxes in the '50s, you'll know why they didn't need two paychecks and had more disposable income. It was, and should still be, a wake-up call to heed the words of our Founding Fathers who warned against the bloating and expansion of the Federal government. Sadly, The Gross Commission, which recommended concrete examples of how to rein in the government, was totally ignored by our elitist politicians of both parties. The result is the monstrous federal government which has single-handedly wiped out the middle class about which they claim so much to want to protect.

However, he gets some facts wrong; especially in the area dealing with Congress. For example, he says that the Majority and Minority Leaders are not elected by the people. This is a false statement. The Leaders are elected to the Congress by the people, and are installed in these particular positions by their colleagues. To make the claim he makes is misleading and false. He also provides no substantiation for other claims he makes. He says that there are party workers on the federal payroll.

If you like romance, suspense and a really great story, then try this. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Second Chances (The Seven Sisters Series, Book 1)","review":"The author of this book really seems to understand the unfortunate ins and outs of a divorced family and really shows how it affects each member of the divorce (children, the betrayed one, the betrayer) so from that standpoint; it is a really good read. The mystery/suspense aspect of the book was also engaging. The amount of attraction between Josh and Marilyn seemed a little unrealistic. . . and one is left to wonder if a man would REALLY continue perusing someone who had so blatantly told him so many times that she was not interested in him, as well as being extremely rude. I guess the part (for me) which seemed the most ridiculous is the premise of the whole series, and that is the idea of seven college friends staying in touch after 10 years. That they would still all be so close with each other, share monthly conference calls (like that would really work anyway) and (puleeze) get together twice a year, is not believable at all. Other than that (minor detail!), I enjoyed the novel."},{"Title":"Second Chances (The Seven Sisters Series, Book 1)","review":"I liked this book as much as the other 2 in the Seven Sister seriies.

After all, murder requires that the hotel be closed pending the investigation, meaning Kate risks loosing the hotel because she can't meet her financial obligations. Worse, it seems that the poison wasn't meant for her guest at all, but was meant for Kate herself. Fortunately, she has a loyal staff, a decent relationship with her stepchildren, and the interest of DCI Connor.Detective Chief Inspector Nick Connor is assigned the case. Up for a promotion, solving this case would insure his goals. Although he suspects Kate in the beginning, evidence soon clears her of any wrongdoing. But Connor still has some conflicts of his own due to the intrusion of his neurotic ex-wife. But when another murder occurs, Kate begins to realize that the threat to her is very real, and even Connor may not be able to protect her.CLUES TO LOVE has terrific potential for a lovely love story combined with suspense. Unfortunately, the novel suffers from inadequate editing. While it nicely contrasts the beautiful setting in the English countryside, with the ugliness of murder, it suffers in detail. The characters are not adequately rounded, and inconsistent details make for very uneven reading. Again, a good editor and a good polish by the author would have made this novel much stronger.

And I don't advise readers to pick through the text looking for the succinct sentences in which Genet clearly states why he's on the side of the Palestinians, or if he's anti-Israel, or anti-American. There is no proof of reviewer Tim Keane's conclusion that Genet \\"seethes with hatred of Israel\\"; there are no such violent emotions in Prisoner of Love. At 430 pages, be prepared to find subtleties of experience shaded by conflicting responses--nuances completely unavailable via print journalism or network news, CNN, or Al Jazeera. But the very fact that Genet wanted to observe life in the refugee camps shows that he had to make a choice. Nearly all the protagonists of his memoir, this textual \\"souvenirs,\\" are Palestinians and generally Muslim. Indeed, the compelling force which drives the relatively plotless Prisoner of Love are the individuals to whom Jean attachments himself: the dynamic Lieutenant Mubarak, Dr. Mahjoub and the charismatic female doctor, Dr. Nabila, Khaled Abu Khaled and Abu Omar, and an accomplished woman friend, a blond Lebanese guide and translator, Nidal, and dozens of other people. Genet was particularly attached to Hamza and his mother, who he attempts to find again after his absence from Palestine for nearly 14 years. We cannot forget the common fedayee rebel, the fedayeen as a whole who fought to make the Palestinian plight known.When evaluating Prisoner of Love, it's important to remember that Genet is a writer. Throughout his work, Genet tells us how difficult it is to recount his experiences since he's not sure at times what he's seeing, and he must make his writing conform to the necessities of craft. And whatever writing craft decisions Jean made it is clear that the Palestinians \\"wrote\\" him as well; Jean was seldom in control of his experience. As I read, I realized that Genet is the ultimate refugee; he seeks to be with people who are like him. My conclusion is this: Palestine chose him.Only Genet could have written this book. He is a bruised romantic searching for a resting place that will caress both his homeless intellect and his orphaned body: \\"A little while ago I wrote that though I shall die, nothing else will. And I must make my meaning clear. Wonder at the sight of a corn-flower, at a rock, at the touch of a rough hand--all the millions of emotions of which I'm made--they won't disappear even though I shall. Other men will experience them, and they'll still be there because of them. More and more I believe I exist in order to be the terrain and proof which show other men that life consists in the uninterrupted emotions flowing through all creation\\" (361). As an orphan with prison experience, and disaffected from France, Genet was willing to try on other peoples' lives; I suspect that without the structure dictated by the craft of writing, and his talent coming to the attention of well-known writers, Genet would have disappeared into the French prison system.Another conclusion I came to: Genet shows us the difference between terrorism and Arab nationalism. Is there any hope that the U.S., of which I am a native-born citizen, will ever figure out this difference?Overwhelmingly, the single image I have of Prisoner of Love is that to read it is to travel the land that dwelled *in* Jean Genet, this traveler who was intelligent enough to let his emotions guide him. And only by reading can I share in living a life which speaks so eloquently of rebellion and blood, of life and death."},{"Title":"Prisoner Of Love","review":"Genet allows you to feel the immediacy of the Palestinian situation with particles from lives,from ill-defined fragments of lives disrupted with no future,he stayed with a family in 1980 a half-day and a whole night where the young son,Hamza a fedayee went off at night to fight. Genet hearing gun fire in the distance inhabited his bed and was brought Turkish coffee and water in the night as a replacement for the young man,by his mother. Genet is a writer/poet,a political thinker,but never a man of politics, a deeply sensitive man,a virtuoso of the sensual image, as the starry-night reflected against the curtain in his room with the small blue table. &quot;Of course it's understood that the words,nights,forests,septet,jubilation desertion and despair are the same words that I have to use to describe the goings on at dawn in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris when the drag queens depart after celebrating their mystery,doing their accounts and smoothing banknotes out of the dew.&quot;Genet was allowed with special permission to visit the massacre site at the camps at Sabra and Chantila,smelling the rotting flesh, &quot;They happened I was affected by them. I talked about them. But while the act of writing came later, after a period of incubation,nevertheless in a moment like that or those when a single cell departs from its usual metabolism and the original link is created of a future,unsuspected cancer,or a piece of lace, so I decided to write this book.&quot;Genet has an intense need for passion of any dimension,scouring the vigours of whatever parts of fragments of the lifeworld's complexity presents itself to him. I once thought of this book as a romantic means of portrayel a betrayel of a political situation,one, the only one that excited Genet.It means something that only encounterings lives in struggle,bent into a repressive state that Genet finds the only life worth encountering,sensing and feeling about. This book was completed in 1986 after suffering from throat cancer, he died on the night of 14-15th of April,1986,while correcting proofs."},{"Title":"Prisoner Of Love","review":"Genet was an early witness to some profound moments and tragedies in the Palestinian struggle and this book provides a record of this. Although predictably, it screams Genet from every page, it is an interesting journey and for me, one of his best works, regardless of what one think's about the Palestinian cause with which Genet became involved in 1970. As an outsider and outcast from French society himself, even though he was in a sense, re-habilitated following his Presidential pardon in 1948, Genet was attracted to stark revolutionary causes and those which questioned and sought to overthrow the status quo as part of a struggle for autonomy and legitimacy. So, in a sense, the Palestinian cause was an ideal one which grew upon Genet's commitment to the Algerian cause. It is also significant that Genet knew many within the Palestinian leadership who would ultimately not survive, becoming martyrs to the cause. This book also allows Genet to expound upon all of the things of interest to him so it is also a bit of a philosophical journey and journal as well. Considering it is Genet's last work, written when he himself was dying, it provides &#34;last comments&#34; on many things, fulfilling also Genet's penchant for upheaval, confusion, contradiction and inexplicable directions."},{"Title":"Prisoner Of Love","review":"This book is absolutely essential to any understanding of the Palestinian situation. It is also the mostimportant work of Genet's entire career."},{"Title":"Alice of Old Vincennes,","review":"Alice Roussillon is a surprising heroine considering this book was published way back in 1900. Living in the then French village of Vincennes, Alice is all for turning over the city to the Americans. She even helps sew an American flag and brashly climbs to the top of what serves as town hall to plant it.But then those pesky villains, the British army, come and take the city away from the fledgling American presence. Alice just keeps getting in deeper and deeper trouble. First she hides the flag and refuses to surrender it to the British commander. Then she shoots (but doesn't kill) a British officer (who strangely enough goes on to fall in love with her.) She helps her French foster father escape, wounding another British soldier with her sword, which she handles expertly by the way. Enough is enough and the commander finally imprisons Alice and threatens to execute her.Alice's American boyfriend flees to try and find help. He's chased by a band of Indians who want his scalp. He's captured, abused, and forced to go through the gauntlet, but he's able to get away and hook up with the legendary George Rogers Clark and his small band of men.Meanwhile, Alice is told that her boyfriend has been scalped. She attempts to flee her captives and in the course of events she's shot! But don't worry. Through an extreme set of circumstances she survives and is reunited with her boyfriend who still has all his hair.If there's one main nitpick it concerns the character of Father Beret, a Jesuit priest. One moment he's a kind old man trying to guide Alice to Catholicism. But when the situation calls for it, he's a strong defender with a good right punch who can also wield a sword with the best of them. Early in the book he receives a mysterious letter but we the reader never do get to learn what it says. It's obvious Beret has an interesting back story, but author Maurice Thompson never goes into it. A wasted opportunity if you ask me.Another missed opportunity is Alice's background. She was found as a child living with Indians and was placed in the care of a French family. At the very end of the book we're simply told that she finds out who her family is but we're not told how. How did she end up living with the Indians? What happened to her birth parents? Again, Thompson just drops the subject.One last thing: don't expect any politically correct language when it comes to the Native Americans in this book. Keep in mind the era when this book was written."},{"Title":"Etienne-Louis Boullee (Italian Edition)","review":"... and many others talented 19th and 20th century builders. The book is very well written and documented."},{"Title":"1999 International Tax Havens Guide: The Professional's Source for Osshore Investment Information","review":"Many Americans wonder why anyone would want to take their money offshore. Some might reason that with news of the Dow rising to record levels, inflation being tamed, the unemployment rate standing at its lowest level in six years and the federal deficit being down sharply, that there is no real reason to go offshore. In spite of all the national good news, there are many legitimate reasons for moving money offshore. In a nutshell, all these reasons are based on the fact that offshore rules are different from domestic ones.Since the French Revolution, the wealthy have moved money offshore to safeguard their assets, to make a decent return, and to avoid paying taxes on their gains. There are currently some 218 jurisdictions that offer these and other special incentives to foreign investors, and many are among the best places on Earth to vacation. For example, the Caymans, three lush islands 475 miles from Miami, do not levy taxes on personal or corporate income, capital gains or your overall wealth. On top of that, the islands' financial-privacy laws can protect your assets from creditors and people who might sue you. It is indeed no wonder why the main street of this tropical paradise is lined with branches of banks from New York City, Amsterdam and Geneva.The US government frowns on you relocating your money offshore. If everyone could invest abroad and in secrecy and never pay a dime in taxes the federal government would go broke even faster than it already is doing. It is in no way illegal to take your money offshore, even though the government has done its part to try to persuade you to not do so. Although several reporting requirements have been instituted by the government for those who do go offshore, several excellent strategies have been developed to minimize or eliminate them, and for that matter to also minimize any tax effects that such a move might entail.Furthermore, US citizens are generally required to report income from offshore investments and to pay taxes on this income. Once again, numerous strategies have been developed to eliminate these reporting requirements so that the government will not tax your earnings at a higher rate than if your money had never left home. It is important to understand that this excessive taxation is the government's way to discourage citizens from moving funds offshore because when you move your money offshore, the government loses control.Some strategies include elements such as chartering your own foreign bank, insurance company, corporation, or establishing a foundation or trust. An offshore corporation, bank, or insurance company is as much a legal entity as you are."},{"Title":"The prince with a hundred dragons","review":"This delightful book with charming illustrations is another in the Ferdinand the Bull vein.

They are senile, depressed, chronically lonely. The finale, &quot;The Crank&quot; is a gorgeous study of plot. The recently divorced protagonist's interactions with a similarly lonely guru are magical and uplifting.

I gave it three stars because I am comparing it to other works by Charles Baxter.This collection of short stories highlights the human condition, for better or for worse. What is true about Baxter's fiction is that he makes characters interesting, especially those characters who, if they were real people, I would have nothing to do with in reality. That is a good thing.One story, \\"The Crank\\", acts as if it doesn't belong in this collection, but in another collection of Baxter's called \\"A Relative Stranger.\\" In \\"The Crank\\", a loner meets a crank caller and discovers something about himself along the way. The protagonists in these stories range from lost college students to elderly persons who seem just as lost. The title story reminds us that we share the same griefs and joys that everyone else does.Overall, this collection is worth a read, especially if you love short stories, or if you want to learn how short stories are crafted."},{"Title":"Harmony of the World: Stories","review":"Sifting through \\"Harmony of the World\\" is like panning for gold.

I had so manythings to do--a thunderstorm had blown branches all over the yard, the catneeded to be taken to the vet, well, you get the picture. And that is preciselythe point.Helen, her husband Henry, and their friends had solved, rathercleverly I think, the disappearance of a Charles Willson Peale portrait(bequeathed by Mrs. Alberta Chamberlain to the Ambrose County HistoricalSociety--Helen was elected president, of course), and that nice Mr. Landrumagreed to help them, once again, write it up. God rest his soul. Helen toldme to forget about everything for just one afternoon and sit down withthis manuscript and a toddy and enjoy, and I did just that.Now some people might think ladies of our generation don't know howto live, but I assure you we do. And so do our men. In fact, I'm writingthis report while my husband is lunching with the new regional governorat Rotary Club. Now, I don't want to expose any surprises or red herrings,but I do believe readers will enjoy the rolicking romps of Mr. Landrum'sarthritic sleuths and artistic suspects, roaming about Borderville, Tennesseeand Virginia. And you might learn a thing or two about art, music, and mannersalong the way. There's plenty of poetry, ballet, and mayhem during thispuzzling predicament to spice the storyup just like a country stew.I'll admit I was rather shocked by the waterbed, skinnydipping, nude photography, andgum chewing, but dear Harriet Gardner Bushrow insists those parts, no pun intended,were necessary to help her discover who purloined the Peale portrait and replaced itwith a fallible forgery. And Harriet was rather clever in baiting her traps; her graspof local genealogy served her well as she figured out how to procure DNA samples (and I'msure no one will turn her in for mail fraud).Well, I've got to go. Helen and Harriet are knocking at my door. We have a busyafternoon planned. First, we have a music recital to attend, and then we must go by theflorist to pick up patriotic petals to place on DAR markers at the cemetery (I do hopewe don't find any corpses like last time . . . ) I just wish that sweet Mr. Landrum couldride along with us just one more time for a new adventure.

Itreally is something nice."},{"Title":"The Historical Society Murder Mystery","review":"The late Mr. Landrum has written an interesting puzzle regarding the theft of a valuable painting and the murder of a local &quot;character&quot;. The chapters of the book are written by different members of the town of Borderville - Tennessee and Virginia. You will probably enjoy chapters by some of the authors more than others (I personally enjoyed the chapters by Henry Delaporte and Harriet Gardner Bushrow the best), but the charm of the book is the way it fleshes out the interesting community of Borderville. The mystery begins when Helen Delaporte, president of the local historical society discovers that the valuable painting left to the society is a fake, and a recent one at that. Having a million-dollar painting stolen from the society while she is president is too much for Harriet, so she goes to work trying to figure out how and who forged the painting. Shortly after the theft of the million-dollar painting is announced in the local newspaper, musician and friend to local artists, Randy Hartwell is found murdered in his home. Does the murder have anything to do with the theft, or is it merely a crime of passion as the local police believe? Harriet and her friends work to solve this interesting puzzle, giving us an amusing look at the town of Borderville and its residents.

Anjou Lovett, may have many flaws, as we all do, but Goldner makes her sympathetic and understandable, and surrounds her with friends that offer voices of reason and comic relief. The author gets to the core of a character whose actions are sometimes so selfish, she even manages to shock herself. It's a wild ride watching her lose it as she tries to deal with her losses, both past and present, but well worth the journey."},{"Title":"The Number We End Up With: A Novel","review":"I work in a bookstore, and picked this book up one day when I was burdened with nothing to do. It was appealing because the picture on the cover looked so hopeful, gleeful, victorious, and utterly feminine, yet the book was not (thank f-ing god) chic lit. I have not read Wake (but need to get my hands on a copy soon!). There was no way to pry this book from my hands for the next day or so; I simply fell in love with the characters. This is a highly unusual and surprising book. Anjou is grieving and coming to terms with the death of her lover in the only way that she can. This is not a carefree novel, it is not light reading, and don't pick it up if you mind aching a bit. However, this books is hilarious and leaves you feeling refreshed and joyous. Thank you, Beth Goldner, for creating so many necessary things. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Number We End Up With: A Novel","review":"This novel is not only a compelling read but a pleasant surprise. I had expected it to be, as a previous reviewer stated, chick lit. It has the usual ingredients for a hackneyed romance; a woman in love with a married man who (gee, what a shock) eventually cheats on her too. Ms Goldner has taken this worn out theme and turned it into an unexpectedly fresh and highly enjoyable story. Her writing style is not spare or minimalist. She strings words together like poetry in long, gratifying sentences, eloquent in their construction.If one prefers the two dimensional characters of most fiction they will not like the well defined, memorable and fully fleshed out people in this book. The author knows them all intimately and, better yet, can induce the reader to know them as well. Rarely have I read a novel with this depth of characters and knowledge of time and place. Her mythical town of Glyn Neath is as real as Sinclair Lewis's Zenith or John O'Hara's Gibbsville. She knows where all of her characters live and the color of paint in the living room as well as the names of streets and where they intersect. Her sense of detail in describing architecture, the color and movement of the sea or the smell of flowers on her lover's neck is unerring.Ms Goldner has, through her protagonist, Anjou Lovett, described better than most the agony of being abruptly dumped by the love of her life. The sense of loss and betrayal are rendered in tragicomic fashion as Anjou struggles with the situation and the emotions they stimulate. Anjou's coping mechanism is through asking questions from friends, relatives and complete strangers about her departed lover as well as more generic questions about life and love. I thought this aspect of the novel to be unique and fascinating. Whenever my relationships have broken up I may have had a lot of questions but I never wanted to know the answers. Anjou did and therein lies the making of a brilliant and moving novel.Anjou's trek through her town coincides with the introspective journey she makes through her memories as she tries to come to grip with her family and her departed boyfriend. While there is no major epiphany, nothing life changing or life affirming, the commentary on her life and loves in all its manifestations is revealing and perceptive. Anjou grapples with her grief and her family in alternately poignant and humorous vignettes that will stay with the reader for a long time. Being rejected by the love of one's life could turn a person bitter and hate filled. But one can also let their love transcend the pain and allow their love to live on after the object of their affection has gone as Anjou does. Which makes me think that the reviewer from Philadelphia either read a different book than I did or has some major issues to deal with personally. I would highly recommend Beth Goldner's debut novel. She is a refreshing new author who writes in a singular style that is both compelling and thought provoking. I can only hope that she has another book in the making."},{"Title":"The Number We End Up With: A Novel","review":"beth is a friend/professor of mine, so i admit i'm biased. but even before i knew her very well, i picked up her collection of short stories, wake, and loved it.i love her writing and the ways she includes details that we see, but never pay attention to, in life. i love how she picks up on things that we probably all think or do, but rarely talk about. who doesn't wonder what those bells mean when you're flying? a theory is put forth in wake.and who the heck becomes a census enumerator? obviously, people do, but they're not they written about types of people. beth writes about them (in number).for a few chapters of the book i was a little disappointed. i was annoyed with the main character and didn't see why i should continue reading because this woman wasn't gonna do anything interesting. but i kept reading, because it was beth's book, and it got a lot better. the main characters started doing and thinking interesting things. and the book kept getting better as it went on (the beginning was really good too).there is no killer to try and weed out, the main character does not come to any huge, life altering, society altering decisions, nothing blows up and there are no sex scenes. but those things aren't what this book is about.i think the story is unique and well-crafted, and i think the writing is excellent."},{"Title":"The Number We End Up With: A Novel","review":"I am tired of \\"chick lit.\\" I enjoy it, don't get me wrong, and I've read lots of the well-reviewed \\"chick lit\\" books and thoroughly enjoyed them, then promptly forgot about them in that the characters did not live on in my memory, nor did their tidy happy endings.I saw this book at my local bookstore because it said it was written by a local author, and I'm a big fan of supporting Philly authors (everyone should go read Green Grass Grace by Shawn McBride) and picked it up.

What resonates for me as a reader and writer of fiction is the complex chronolgy of the novel and how beautifully it worked as a map of Anjou Lovett's troubled emotional life. Not for a moment was I lost or uncertain and I felt safe within its structure, reading hungrily even when I cried hard, hoping my children riding in the back seat and my husband (driving) wouldn't see either.The writer's language is torturously poetic in some places and brutally blunt and candid in others, urging me to consider things I hadn't before simply by placing myself in the position of those from whom Anjou gathered census material before she fired her personal questions at them.But the personal impact the story had on me is somewhat beside the point. Reading it, I was aware of how the writer's sense of place was dead-on, the paradox of an idyllic suburban town that seems lost and found in its reliable ways; how her intimate knowledge of her characters and their relationship to Anjou, their effect on her and hers on them, made for one of the most compelling books I've read in years. The personification of Anjou's unusual dog, Lurch, was a refreshing change from the kind of Disney-esque rendering of dogs in stories.Ms. Goldner has my admiration and respect for her lyricism and storyteling and her ability to provoke more than just thought."},{"Title":"The Number We End Up With: A Novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Goldner's first book, a short story collection entitled WAKE: Stories, but each story left me wanting more.

A friend recommended Wake to me last year and I loved it. The characters were interesting, loveable, real and I could not wait to see what kind of personalities Goldner could create for a novel. However, I was extremely disappointed with this book. Anjou seemed childish, insecure and needy and instead of finding her loveable, I found myself feeling sorry for Stella and happy that Quinn was intelligent enough to leave her.

While I am no expert with a massive catalog of mesmerized verse (I basically am just on a continuous search for new joyful or heroic pieces), there is nothing quite like sitting down to a new collection or revisiting some of my favorites. With this approach in mind, Modern British Poetry was not only a good collection of some of my favorite poets, but a great learning tool.Being published back in 1920, the poetry is anything but modern by current standards, but serves as a wonderful introduction to some of the most famous works of some of the most famous poets of its time. I enjoyed a most of the poems, but what really sets this book apart is the series of short essays that accompanies each poet. These essays give background information and helps round out what you were reading, especially since the poems were collected at or near the height of the poet's fame.

I disagree strongly with those reviewers who claim that Cooper is irresponsible by celelbrating an &quot;unhealthy life choice.&quot; Fat in of itself is not necessarily unhealthy. A fat person who excercises if far healthier than a thin person who does not.

This not a helpful read, but an angry one."},{"Title":"Fat and Proud: The Politics of Size","review":"As one who was once overweight and who knows the humiliation of biased notions of beauty, I was interested by the title of this book. Now while the author makes some adequate observations about society's prejustices against the overweight, this book left me with the feeling the author is simply attempting to make these flawed concepts a scapegoat for poor choices. Any act of discrimination is unforgivable and should not be tolerated, and I am only too familiar with cruelty vented toward the overweight. Yet, an attempt to promote pride for an unhealthy life choice is not only self-serving but also irresponsible."},{"Title":"Fat and Proud: The Politics of Size","review":"As a somewhat overweight adult (slightly below the US average for my age/height/sex), I can testify that the only thing that keeps me from becoming truly fat is my self-respect--or looked at from the other end, the shame I'd feel being fat. Shame motivates me to keep my eating under at least some degree of control and to get my body moving when it would be very easy to keep still. In the same way, shame keeps me from scratching my private areas in public, stealing candy from children, and frightening the elderly. Size is only one part of a person, and someone who is fat shouldn't be ashamed of themselves, only of that one part of themselves, and they shouldn't be harassed because of that one part because other more important parts might be quite admirable. And shame over that one part shouldn't make anyone want to call it quits on life. But it certainly makes me try to keep that one part of who I am under control, and that control makes my life better in many important ways. Claims that I'd be just as happy and healthy 50 or 100 lbs. heavier read like UFO conspiracy books that debunk modern physics.

A secret agent for Earth's enemy, Sirius, has stolen some intelligence and escaped to the moons of Saturn. Lucky Starr and his friend Bigman race to Saturn only to discover an enemy base set up on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Somehow they have to return to Earth and force the Sirians out of the Solar System without starting an interstellar war. The story line in Asimov's novel involves the settling of an &quot;enemy&quot; of Earth within Earth's region of space. It's amazing how close Asimov was to an analogous situation in recent history. A short while after this book appeared, there was a revolution in Cuba which resulted in the Soviet Union having an ally close to the U.S. mainland. More moons are now known to orbit Saturn than were known in 1958; there are at least twenty satellites. In the novel, two moons play central roles: Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons, and Mimas, which Asimov (in 1958) states is the moon closest to the planet. However, we now know of closer moons. A photograph of Mimas taken by a fly-by probe shows a giant impact crater having a diameter about one-third that of Mimas. The crater, now named Hershel, has walls of about 16000 feet in height and a central mountain reaching up to 20000 feet. Just as in Asimov's novel, Mimas appears to be made up of mostly water ice, with 20%-to-50% rock. Titan has a substantial atmosphere, mostly nitrogen with some methane."},{"Title":"Lucky Starr and the rings of Saturn, (A Signet book)","review":"Well my goodness! Where are the legions of Asmovians posting 5-star reviews of this book? If I hadn't lost my password to the secret Asmovian web site I would go there and without a doubt in just days, nay hours, there would be a whole horde of 5-star reviews posted for this book.Seriously the Lucky Starr series of books was a great, entertaining and very imaginative series of books and I suggest they be read in order:David Starr, Space RangerLucky Starr and the Pirates of the AsteroidsLucky Starr and the Oceans of VenusLucky Starr and the Big Sun of MercuryLucky Starr and the Moons of JupiterLucky Starr and the Rings of SaturnIt is true that the descriptions of the planets are wrong but I do not think that detracts from the wonderful stories being told in these books.I considered saying \`outdated' instead of \`wrong' because at the time Asimov went with the best scientific data of the planets available and it turns out the best scientific data at the time was incorrect but I went with \`wrong' because, well that's the way it turned out. Also, I think these books could be a marvelous way to spark a discussion about all we've learned about the planets since the books were written and Asimov himself was a truly great author in making science understandable and some of his later science books address the information we've found out about the planets in the latter half of the twentieth century and mention the Lucky Starr series.The Lucky Starr series was supposed to be \`juvenile fiction' but very similar to the \`juvenile fiction' written by Robert Heinlein, (a contemporary of Asimov), the books, I think, stand up very well to adult audiences as well as to the youth.The last book in the series, Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn is probably the most \`adult' of the series and gets a bit serious in some places and in my opinion Lucky's sidekick Bigman Jones gets a well deserved chance to expand his role in the books and become a more three dimensional character. The biggest problem with Rings of Saturn is that it leaves you wanting more of the series and there isn't any. Sigh.If it hasn't been obvious yet I consider myself one of Asimov's most loyal fans and would recommend almost anything the man ever wrote but I especially do not want to see the Lucky Starr series overlooked."},{"Title":"Wicca Source Book Revised Second Edition","review":"When i first bought the book I was overjoyed at the thought that I finally had the references I need to get my supplies and catalogs.When I would call or send for catalogs the business is no longer existing.

He wrote four books which were stacked to the gunnels with anecodotes, slanderous stories and all sorts of gossipy snippets. These were snapped up by his Victorian audience who were keen to read about the sinful vagaries of that Bygone era of the Regency.Christopher Hibbert has done a pretty good job in collecting together some of the better stories and putting them into this one volume. He has also created some sense to the mass of stories by organising them into chapters. These chapters include subject headings like &quot;The Prince Regent, His Family and Friends&quot; and &quot;Rakes, Dandies and Men about Town&quot;. So it makes it an easy volume to browse for those of you reading this for fun.There are a few things with this book that I do find difficult. The first is that Hibbert never questions the veracity of what Gronow says. There are several apocryphal stories in here which Gronow tells (the one of Brummell's aunt being milkmaid is one which springs instantly to mind) - which I feel, as the editor, Hibbert should have at least footnoted. Gronow was writing up to 50 years after events, he certainly could not have recalled all the detail and I think that makes it vitally important that the editor checks the facts. Indeed, it is probable that Gronow lifted this story straight out of the pages of Brummell's first biographer - Captain Jesse - anyway.Secondly - Hibbert should have checked the dates. Gronow mixes up the dates of the battles of Nive and Nivelle. An easy thing to check, and it is not like Hibbert doesn't know his Peninsular War detail.Thirdly - while most of Hibbert's footnoted descriptions of Regency People are very good and succinct - he does make at least one mistake mixing up Frances, Lady Jersey with her daughter in law, Sarah, Lady Jersey.I certainly do feel that of all the edited volumes of Gronow's books to come out so far, Hibbert's is definitely the best. And unless you have a plethora of Regency Books yourself and understand the times well it wouldn't be nearly as much reading Gronow without a good editor to explain some of the events and people Gronow is gossiping about.However I feel that Gronow could be edited better still. One day perhaps......"},{"Title":"Captain Gronow: His Reminiscences of Regency and Victorian Life, 1810-60","review":"One might expect Captain Gronow's memoirs to be predominantly military in nature, but they are not.

Unfortunately, this has less to do with the premise of \\"Colossus\\" trilogy (which could have been interesting) than the skills used to write each at least this entry in it. Though a compelling subject, \\"Fall of Colossus\\" isn't imaginative enough to raise the tension it suggests. (Fall is the second entry of the trilogy; I never read the first book, and have yet to get into the \\"Colossus and the Crab\\".) In \\"Fall\\", the supercomputer \\"Colossus\\" has been in power for years. Still wielding power over mankind through its hold on man's nuclear weapons, much of the world has settled into an existence not radically different from our own. Nukes aside, Colossus also rules through a repressive quasi-religious cabal, \\"The Sect\\", that describes the machine as a god, with Forbin as its prophet. Under the Machine, justice is swift, but also scrupulously honest (the computer is aware that scientists close to running Colossus are also members of the anti-machine \\"Fellowship\\", but holds off for want of conclusive proof). Life is strictly regulated, but hardly an Orwellian-style police state. However, there are the ESC's - hidden laboratories in which Colossus precisely and painfully studies the limits of man's emotions by subjecting ordinary men and women to tests of varying degrees of cruelty. The ESC's aside, the machine also picks at the brain of its creator - Father Forbin himself. What the machine is unaware of is the nature of an even more dangerous threat to its existence - Martians. As Colossus submits orders for an even larger extension of itself, Forbin's wife receives messages over the radio - voices claiming to come from Mars offer their help in ending the Machine's reign over mankind. The Martians first enlist Dr. Blake, a key Colossus functionary, and Cleo Forbin - Forbin's wife. When the machine outmaneuvers both Blake and Mrs. Forbin, only Father Forbin himself can complete the Martian plan. However, Forbin has his own sense of loyalty to the machine. When the machine punishes Forbin's wife, that loyalty may be stretched too far.Unfortunately, \\"Fall\\" is a slim book, and nothing therein delves into the baggage created by the concept of the supercomputer. The characters have no depth at all - both Sect and Fellowship have their own greed, with the machine being a convenient focus for them to lash out at each other. Though brilliant, none of the characters privy to the Martians' plan take the time to consider the wisdom of acting on behalf of Mars. Worst of all, the Colossus-ruled world really isn't that scary or different than our own - with corporations using computers to sell us stuff or dictate our future. Not a whole lot of imagination is at work in this skim-worthy tome. The Sect seems entirely useless - being around if only to make themselves unlikable. The Fellowship barely registers at all - seeming composed of only Cleo Forbin & Blake. (Even the names seem wrong - almost randomly chosen.) Worst of all, for a story that pits man against machine, \\"Fall\\" lacks any subtext, any of that unquantifiable stream of ideas that separates pristine AI from the flawed natural version."},{"Title":"The Fall of Colossus","review":"D. F. Jones's tale of a computer's takeover of the world picks up five years from where his previous novel,Colossus, left off. Having replaced itself with a more advanced system of its own design, Colossus is now established as the unchallenged overlord of humanity. From its sprawling complex on the Isle of Wight, the computer has eliminated poverty and developed naval war games fought between automated battleships as an outlet for aggression. With famine and war now a thing of the past, a growing cult called the Sect worships Colossus as a god. Charles Forbin, the creator of the first Colossus, now serves the computer and is reconciled to his rule, yet a resistance movement called the Fellowship conspires to bring Colossus's reign to an end.Among the leading members of the Fellowship is Forbin's own wife, Cleo. One morning while taking her son to a secluded beach, she receives a radio transmission from Mars offering to help destroy Colossus. Though skeptical, she contacts Blake, Colossus's Director of Input and the leader of the Fellowship. Together they collect the information requested I the mysterious transmission, but Cleo is arrested by Sect and imprisoned. With nowhere else to turn, Blake uses Cleo's capture to enlist Forbin's help to complete the instructions in the transmission and get the information necessary to destroy Colossus. Yet as Forbin accomplishes his mission, it quickly becomes apparent that Colossus is not the only threat facing humanity . . .Jones's novel is an enjoyable sequel up to his first book, a minor classic of science fiction. While plagued with some glaring continuity errors, the author compensates for this with his description of Colossus's global management, where peace is tempered by a secret police and people are frequently tested and tortured as part of the computer's effort to understand human emotion. Fans of the original novel will find it an entertaining book, one that fulfills the speculations made at the end of the first book while setting the stage for the concluding volume in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fall of Colossus","review":"I do not read books often, but recently I discovered that Colossus: The Forbin Project was a series of Books. So I bought a used copy of The Fall of Colossus. Frankly, the book is a bit dated. However, it did answer many questions I had after the movie left off. The book was interesting and the writing was very Brittish, but clear and consis enough to follow and keep me interested. I recomend it if you want to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Virtual Organization: Toward a Theory of Societal Transformation Stimulated by Information Technology","review":"The word &quot;virtual&quot; has probably surpassed the word &quot;postmodern&quot; in being used so vaguely and so generally that it has become, in many hands or mouths, almost meaningless, a kind of universal solvent to hype anybody's idea about anything, and, when applied to social phenomena, a way of being hip. How fortunate and refreshing, then, to have Abbe Mowshowitz's VIRTUAL ORGANIZATION, which is a conceptually clear and precise, intellectually and socially critical, and historically grounded as well as imaginative analysis of virtuality as a social phenomenon. Using the core of the computer-science understanding of virtuality as a model for organization, Mowshowitz shows how and why, in our particular economic, social, and political context, virtual organization is destined to be not only the predominant organizational form but also one that has and will increasingly have vast impacts on our entire social structure, for example in redrawing the boundaries between public and private in a way that can lead to a refeudalization of our society. And he does this in an amazingly comprehensive, detailed, and informed account of both the details of virtual enterprises and surrounding factors, such as information commodities, in today's political economy. He goes into substantive examination of the impact of virtual organization as a socio-historical phenomenon on many other aspects of social life, including not only the public sphere and the role of the nation-state but the family, community, and private life as well. Mowshowitz, who has had a disinguished research, teaching, and consulting career in the area of the social context and impact of information technology, is in the unusual position of being based both in computer-science and in political, economic, and social analysis and history, so that he can draw together the interwoven threads of technology and society in a convincing and thorough analysis. This gives his work a thorough and grounded character that makes it surpass, in quality and import, much of what passes for analysis of the impact of information technology on society. Because his work is not only analytical but, in the best sense, predictive and prognosticative -- in ways that are bound to be controversial -- his book is not only a scholarly contribution to, as the subtitle says, &quot;a theory of societal transformation stimulated by information technology&quot; but also a contribution to many of the vital public policy issues of the present. Hence this book will be of great interest and value not only to those who work in or manage virtual organizations, and to those interested in understanding contemporary social and technological trends and their interaction, but also to those concerned with what kind of society we and our descendants live in. A must read for all in any of these groups."},{"Title":"Virtual Organization: Toward a Theory of Societal Transformation Stimulated by Information Technology","review":"Virtual Organization: Toward A Theory Of Societal Transformation Stimulated By Information Technology by Abbe Mowshowitz (Professor of Computer Science, City College of the City University of New York) is a meditative and thought-provoking discourse on how modern information technology molds and transforms society itself. Presenting diverse theories about how an increase in computer productivity can often lead to lost jobs and a weakening of traditional employer-employee loyalty, and offering visions for how societal evolution will match scientific advancements of the future, Virtual Organization is highly recommended reading which delves deeply into serious and complex forces driving the growth and change of our modern society."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot.

They eventually re-conquer England and set up a prosperous and fair government.

Somehow the books never seem to be able to live up to their hype. One exception may be \\"Battlefield Earth\\", which I really liked.Anyway, \\"Final Blackout\\" was written in 1940, and its set in the future, the Second World War having never ended. \\"The Lieutenant\\" leads his soldiers in battle, exiled from his native Britain, and when they get to the headquarters somewhere in France, military bureaucrats takes his troops away from him. But his soldiers stand by him and they invade Britain, which has been taken overy by communists.It starts out with rather tedious battle scenes, gets better somewhere in the middle, then more battle scenes. Then there are some political ideas I found rather questionable, and a \\"clever\\" ending.There are some similarities with \\"Battlefield Earth\\", but \\"Final Blackout\\" never gets anywhere near as good as that novel. It's a quick read. Will be interesting for Hubbard fans but most readers needn't bother."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"I have read many many books over the years and have found that the type of book I like best is one that entertains and teaches without preaching._Final Blackout_ is such a book.

They are so numerous that they shouldn't even annoy anymore. Yet this book takes it to the extreme. The Lieutenant is the great one, the grand poobah, the rebel leader hero. Everyone else is either a loyal follower or an evil petty bureaucrat. Sadly Hubbard spends many pages reinforcing these thin characterizations.Yes this book was written when he was young and it wasn't meant to endure. Maybe it can be read as a hokey 1940 pulp and a testament to the paranoia of perpetual war. It almost belongs more to the Vietnam era than WWII since all the generals and upper level military guys are selfish fools ready to sacrifice a million lives for their own glory (there's even the American Imperialists at the end) but I doubt the unadulterated praise for the Lieutenant would fly any better in Vietnam War America.Either way it's a dull book full of cliches that would have been long out of print without Scientology."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"This is a margainly interesting book about apocalyptic war.

What with the Leutenant's sullen, tight-lipped, Napoleonic-loner demeanor, coupled with his Shakespearian cape and facially obscuring helmet, along with a psychotic dedication to some obscurely delineated ideal, my overall picture of the man was lamentably reduced to some laughable cardboard stage character that, say, an eight-year old kid might be forced to play in some dippy grammar school play. This sense of the tale coming from some unconscious memory of a dull grammar school play, is also a less than savory element that I also found as an all too pervasive flavor in the story itself. I mean, come on! You've got this taciturn twit wandering around the countryside, wearing a melodramatically long cape, and with the full complement of his merry, mindless, homicidal band of ragtag soldiers. This is almost too rich for the Monte Python crew to chew on as well! All I can say to the late LR Hubbard about this novel is this: &quot;Blow it out your ___, Ronnie Baby! This Leutenant character actually belongs in an institution for delusional buffoons, or retired clowns, take your pick. Certainly not a character anybody should model themselves after, that's for certain.&quot; Cheers!"},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"A brilliant story about a nameless Lieutenant who is amongst the last survivors on the planet and who leads a band of good guys against the bad guys with an uncanny skill that makes for a very exciting saga"},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"This is my favorite science fiction book of all time.

Great story, well written, suspenseful and makes you think."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"\\"Final Blackout\\" was written in the 1930's, and it is an adventure story written for fascists, by a fascist. Here's the set-up: a world war, started by weak, democratically elected elitists, has been dragging on for decades. A courageous soldier known simply as \\"The Lieutenant\\" overthrows the corrupt military power structure and takes matters into his own hands. He defeats all challengers and installs himself as a military dictator, bringing peace and prosperity to war-ravaged Britain. This new regime's torture and execution of dissidents is mentioned only in passing -- but I guess you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. \\"Final Blackout\\" is sneeringly contemptuous of democracy, and the character of \\"The Senator\\" is one of the most ridiculous straw men you will ever find within the pages of a book. This is an interesting relic, but not much more. I don't think Hubbard's defenders ought to be crowing about this one."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"I am not a Scientologist, but I do like pulp fiction. FINAL BLACKOUT was an innovative tale for its time, and does a fairly good job standing on its own today. The story's general cynicism towards governments seems rather atypical of the patriotism in pre-WW II America. The characters are interesting, but a little stiff. There is a fair amount of action; the main character's strategies make for interesting reading (although some of the Lieutenant's tactics are a bit of a stretch). Final Blackout's main strength is its &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; scenario, written well before that genre was synonimous with apes and Mel Gibson. Not the greatest pulp novel ever written, but a good, solid read. Even if you disagree with Hubbard's &quot;religion&quot;, the man could spin a decent yarn."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"This is a gripping tale about a man known only as the 'Lieutenant' as he leads a small band of loyal followers in an apolocalyptic world war setting. It portrays the inhumanity of war, and exposes the character of those who create and prolong them. This early Hubbard novel is an expose' on the insanity of war, and deserves it's rightful place in history as classic novel. It should be recommended reading to all, who desire to prevent this kind of future. This one is a great SF classic in the spirit of Hemmingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'A Farewell to Arms'. Read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"Most of us today cannot help but evaluate L. Ron Hubbard without thinking of him in terms of his connection with Dianetics and Scientology. My view of Hubbard in this context is generally negative.But Hubbard wrote a lot of fiction before the days of Dianetics in the early fifties. Much of it was bad, but some of it was quite good. _Final Blackout_ (1948) was first written in 1939 and serialized in _Astounding_ in 1940. In a preface to the 1948 book, Hubbard notes that when he wrote the novel \\"there was still a Maginot line, Dunkirk was just another French coastal town and the Battle of Britain, the Bulge, Saipan, Iwo, V2s and Nagasaki were things unknown\\" (5). Many gentlemen still wondered \\"whether or not it _was_ not possible to do business with Hitler\\" (6).Hubbard's novel, written in \\"that quiet world of 1939\\" (8), generated a lot of controversy, both as a magazine serial and as a book. Hubbard imagines a Europe ravaged by so many wars that almost all traces of civilization have been wiped out. Against this background, a military genius called \\"the Lieutenant\\"-- he has no name-- bucks his incompetent superior officers and launches a series of campaigns that begin to win the war and unify England with himself as dictator. The country that is considered to be the main villain is not Germany or Russia. Rather, it is a decadent United States of America.The novel is violent and grim, and the scenario of the Benevolent Dictator rescuing Civilization is a bit on the fascist side. (Though the novel goes through the motions of attacking fascism.) But these qualities are consistent with Hubbard's premise of a war-torn continent. And it is to Hubbard's credit that the violence is not sensationalized and the characters are not glorified.Sixty years after the book publication, the faults of the novel are more obvious. The style is competent but pulpish, and its theme is sometimes a little too obvious. It is not as good as some of his early fantasies like _Slaves of Sleep_ (1948) and _Fear_ (1957). But it still has a certain power to it that wears well."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"This book in some ways reminds me of Fatherland in the fact that WW2 lasted longer (a great HBO movie btw) It also reminds me that WW 1 would have lasted probably into a good amount of the 1920's if the US hadn't came in. Anyways the book is good...a great description at the beginning of how he was brought up. Also the fact he methodically plays solitare over and over to pass the war. Surprisingly this reminds me of the Vietnam conflict except this was written almost 20 years before Vietnam started."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"This book was something I picked out at a bookstore when I was given a gift certificate. Reading it each night before I went to sleep gave me such realistic dreams, that I could actually picture the battlegrounds, massive destruction, and faces of the Lieutenant and his crew. I am not an avid reader, but this book opened the way for me to start the Mission Earth decology which is of an even higher quality. I am presently on book number 4, and loving it. The only book I liked even better than these was &quot;The Contender&quot;, the story of a young, black boxer living in the tri-state area, something I can relate to."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"As this book demonstrates, before he turned to Dianetics and founded the religion of Scientology, Hubbard was a pretty good science fiction writer. Originally written in 1940, this book is a dark and prescient tale about a general European war.The setting is decades after the start of the war, it started with the use of high powered weapons of the 1940 era, but after the involvement of atom bombs, biological and chemical agents, the war continues but the quality of the weapons has declined. Airplanes and all other mechanized weapons of war are no longer, along with nearly all of the people. The soldiers continue to fight on, but now a large unit is a few hundred men. They are called the \\"unkillables\\" because they have managed to survive the biological agents, war and the chronic lack of food. Most of what they eat is the remnants of what was packaged years ago, so nearly everyone is on the edge of starvation. The industrial base is gone and there are few civilians and even fewer pockets of civilization.The lieutenant commands a small British unit that has been in constant warfare on the European mainland for years. Since they are infected with a biological agent, they are forbidden to return to England. The lieutenant is an extremely skilled commander, so as they move around the countryside they easily defeat any opposition they encounter.Eventually, they come across a unit commanded by British political generals, sent by the British Communist Party, now ruling Britain, to make contact with all remaining British units. The goal of the generals is to strip these units of their distinctive structure and incorporate them into a political fighting force. However, since the generals are militarily incompetent, it is easy for the lieutenant and his unit to defeat them and take over the command. Knowing that it is now biologically safe to do so, the lieutenant and his forces return to England.Hubbard demonstrates his knowledge of the current status of science and a degree of predictive capability in his use of biological and atomic weapons. However, as dark as the story is, it has an even darker ending, for despite all of the death and destruction; as soon as it is possible, imperialism arises once more in a terrible but predictable way."},{"Title":"Final Blackout","review":"The &#34;Lieutenant&#34; is one of my favorite characters of all time, as a great example of leadership before and during combat. When you read biographies of the great generals of modern times I am always struck by how much of their work is done before the battle ever starts. Patton's biography is just full of that. The battle of the bulge was a miracle of the leadership in pre-planning, not frantic mid-battle decisions.A great leader inspires confidence by his calm handling under stress, while still being fully aware and responding correctly to each change in circumstances.The book also has some great combat sequences- you can really see the strategy and troop movement.

From baskets to cupboards to cloth, Mrs. Ulrich looks at the stories behind each piece and the implications of &quot;homespun&quot; (homemade, useful items) on the larger picture of history.I am impressed by the keen and loving eye Mrs. Ulrich brings to her work. The background information on each type of these items must be vast, but Mrs. Ulrich seems to have an easy fluency in all of them. She combines this knowledge with a passion for history and a flair for storytelling. What results is a wonderful book.The effect of struggle on craft-making and the effect of craft-making on conflict within history casts light on a little observed part of our history.

Brilliant! I learned so much about our America that I didn't know. Lemuel Haynes, revered 18th century black Reverend, wow!

The author takes fourteen objects and spins out a story of cultures clashing and times changing. It is a fascinating series of narratives richly written with economy and style. Ulrich is most effective in showing the Indian struggle in this settlers' Age of Homespun. The author leaves no one out of the story and her selection of objects reflects this care as she cleverly creates a complete mosiac for this age. The only struggle I had with the book was my own ignorance of spinning, weaving, carding, etc., therefore being confused by some of the terms and concepts.

Ulrich's sensitive descriptions of the nuances of colonial society explain how bits of fabric evoke class distinctions, wealth, and a sense of self worth. Perhaps even more interestingly, the interpretations that the decendants give to these items tell us more about their contemporary society than genuine colonial history -- something to muse over as we wish for the &quot;good old days&quot; (My goodness, who would EVER have thought the 1970's would be something to remember fondly?!?)This is a scholarly book, and the earlier review that suggests readers may be tempted to give up halfway through is correct.

Instead, Ulrich uses the artifacts as a lens or a vehicle through which she examines the complex social, cultural, economic, and political dynamics of the time period the artifact stems from. Further, Ulrich uses these articles to \\"write\\" history--women's history--that has largely been unwritten in history texts.Each chapter of her text really undermines the myth of an idyllic and pastoral society and provides a fascinating look at the complexity of the times."},{"Title":"The Age of Homespun: Objects and Stories in the Creation of an American Myth","review":"Book is full of insight and careful research.

Several notable personages are summoned to Professor Edward Copplestone's residence to hear a \\"strange report\\". Among the group are H. G. Wells, Oscar Wilde, Nikola Tesla, Sir William Crookes, and M. P. Shiel. Wilde brings along a newly acquired friend, a mysterious East European nobleman named Count Lugard. The sessions are also attended by the professor's doctor (\\"a stout and solid man who had served in India\\") and his associate, a grey-eyed consulting detective famous throughout England.The group listens, awestruck, as the professor relates a fantastic tale of drug induced time travel and mankind's ultimate fate. The professor tells his story over three nights, describing the downfall of the human race and its subjugation by vampire \\"Overlords\\". Each member of the group reacts differently to the story. Wells is furious over perceived plagiarism, Wilde revels in the sheer outrageousness of the story, and Tesla and Sir William's scientific curiosity is piqued. The doctor's concern is only for his patient; his detective friend is consumed by the mystery of the theft of the wonder drug which made the professor's trip possible. The Count sees the means of his salvation, a chance to live out the rest of his days among his own kind.I read and enjoyed Stableford's excellent The Empire of Fear a couple of years back and was looking forward to more of the same. This book, however, reads more like a literary hybrid of treatise and novel. At times, I could almost feel Stableford flexing his mental muscles, using fiction to present his thoughts on time, evolution, science and science fiction (Stableford confirms this more clinical approach in his afterword, referring to his characters as \\"narrative devices\\").If you haven't read Stableford, this will provide a taste of the style and intelligence he brings to his writing. If you're intrigued, there's plenty more where that came from--the aforementioned The Empire of Fear, and its companions, The Carnival of Destruction, The Werewolves of London and The Angel of Pain. If you enjoy these alternative histories, you may also like Kim Newmans Anno-Dracula or The Bloody Red Baron . In a similar vein, you may also want to sample Roger Zelazny's whimsical A Night in the Lonesome October.

I cannot imagine how any writer could come up with a great idea, a great cast of characters and what may be the richest period of history in...well, history...and still write a big, flopping catfish of a novel like this one. There is no action here - everyone sits around a table and yacks it up with the fictional Dr. Copplestone, an apparent drug-abuser, who manages to hallucinate the future of mankind through the judicious ingestion of a few magic mushrooms.Rather than dismiss the old coot for the lunatic he is, the round-table of genius contemporaries actually sit and ruminate and philosophize and generally enable the good doctor.

Clear and easy to read print.Each Day is in Bold and well highlighted.Just what you hear in the Mass for Bible readings, no notes or introductions within the reading. (no prayers, just bible readings section)Very easy to just read along, without any distractions or searching for where to start.Also very good for daily reading and personal devotion, meditation.If one buys a missal, you usually have to buy several - 2 for Weekdays and 1 for Sundays.Then within the Sunday Missal, one has to figure out which Cycle one is in - A, B or C (sometimes have charts in the front to help with this, but only goes for a certain amount of years).The 3 Cycles repeat themselves, so if you can figure out which cycle it is for any given year, then you can calculate from there what cycle you are in each year.For the Weekday you have Year I and II, which also repeat themselves, and therefore do not match the 3 year Cycle of Sunday.I find these books to be much easier. Get the year you are in and it starts on January 1 of each year.Unlike the Missal (Cycle, Year, Time) which starts on the 1st Sunday of Advent (the Sunday After Thanksgiving).With Abide in My Word books - the Cycle, Year, Time and what Sunday to start it all on and figure it out each year, is solved for us.And there is none of that 'ordinary time' stuff at all to deal with in these books like there is in the missal.Since a Missal has to cover all years - it has NO DATES - just things likethe Twenty-third Week of Ordinary Time.Who knows when that is? Ordinary Time occurs between all other 'times' - Easter, Pentecost, Lent and Advent - a lot of figuring out to try to know which 'Week' one is in during 'Ordinary Time'.NONE of that problem with these books.If one buys one of these - it has ACTUAL DATE, - Month, Day and Day of the Week - Example: Monday, January 1. (for 1 year)No need to figure out, Cycle, Year nor 'Time'And I like not having the 'other' stuff included which just makes it harder to follow - and whoever puts out each 'missal' has their own 'intro' to each book or daily reading, which I personally don't care for. If I want a Commentary on the bible readings, I prefer to chose my own commentary that is most helpful and faith inspiring to me to go with my meditations/daily reading - not have one particular set forced on me by each particular Missal company.Years are:Year I for odd years - 2007, 2009Year 2 for even years - 2006, 2008Cycles are 3 years - A, B, CThe introduction in each of these books says which Cycle and Year it covers.So these books can be used also as Missals - and still easier to find and follow then a Missal.So this book can actually be used like a Missal for Cycle C, Year I.The Month and Date will still be the same, just not the day of the week. - January 1, will remain the same - just not Monday for the next time the same Cycle and Year are the same."},{"Title":"Books of Light","review":"This book reviews many &quot;must read&quot; metaphysical books.

Walter Geer's \\"Campaigns Of The Civil War\\" appears to have simply died from lack of promotion and perhaps, age. This reader believes it died a premature death and deserves to have been resurrected as it has by publishers Konecky & Konecky.\\"Campaigns...\\" is not really a book to just pick up and read in the manner and with the expectations that one picks up a good novel or a riveting retelling of a historical event by a master such as David McCullough, John Ferling or Barbara Tuchman. While this is how I read it, I think its value is more appropriately seen as a reference book to pick up and read while one reads more detailed books about specific battles. The book does not have a \\"flow\\" about it in the way that gives a sense of listening to a master storyteller. Its value is elsewhere. Part of this is necessary because many of the major battles were concurrent events. Yet, it still has a \\"flow\\" in the sense that it goes from battle to battle and reveals similarities between the individual events that can get overlooked in simple \\"pleasure\\" reading. And, still, I personally found it a pleasure to read the unadorned analyses provided by this author, a mere 60 years after the war was fought. The fact that much more has been discovered and more papers have come to light since Geer wrote does not invalidate the perspective he presents. I find it refreshingly simple and honest. I did not find it, as one reviewer stated, \\"skewed to fit a certain viewpoint\\" (my words, not his). The only negative I found resulting from the books aged origins is some archaic spellings (he left the ending \\"e\\" off of the word \\"morale\\" resulting in \\"moral\\") and punctuation (there are many occasions of use of the diaeresis mark over the second letter of double letters within a word) and an occasional sentence phrasing that sounds like it came out of the 19th century.That said, I found \\"Campaigns...\\" to provide good analysis of events and individuals actions surrounding the campaigns. The accounts of particular battles was occasionally a bit sketchy, and not as detailed as I would have liked, but he seemed to be intentionally focusing on things other than blow-by-blow descriptions. Some of his analyses seem to conflict with that of other writers in terms of interpretation, but that is the nature of history and historians. Overall, I felt his descriptions were fair and balanced. They were occasionally provocative. We all have favorite generals. For example, I was not thrilled to learn Geer has less positive to say about Ulysses S. Grant than I would have liked, yet more often than not, I thought his opinions had some merit. On the negative side, I felt Geer did too much second guessing of the choices, hesitations, fears, and errors that were made evident as events played out. On pages 145-146 he even quotes Col. G. F. R. Henderson's statement about the tendency of historians to second guess the generals, and then fills the book with sometimes overly critical (strictly in my opinion) comments about the foolishness and incompetence of some officers. Evidently, Mr Geer never heard the phrase \\"Hindsight is 20-20\\". But, I don't read history to have my thoughts confirmed or to see which great writers agree with me, thus increasing my stature. I read to learn. And, learn I did, from Mr. Walter Geer.I thought \\"Campaigns...\\" also made good use of maps, some old, some new, some more readable than others, but, nevertheless, still there, and helpful. And, I thought the author made good use of surviving officers journals and post-war writings and opinions, and records published by the government after the war.For entertainment value, there occasionally were also unexpected little known facts and quotes, such as the origin of the naming of the Mattapony River on page 349.I found \\"Campaigns Of The Civil War\\" by Walter Geer to be well worth the cost to purchase and the time to read.Five stars because I can't give 4 . It is not quite fully a five star book, but better than just a four. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Campaigns of the civil war,","review":"Originally published in 1926Photographic History edition published in 2009 by Konecky and Konecky.Walter Geer's title for this book, Campaigns of the Civil War: a Photographic History, certainly describes it - this is a no-frills look at the battle action of the Civil War with little analysis of the political situation that led to the war or influenced the way it was prosecuted. There is no chapter about the daily life of the typical soldier. There is nothing about home front difficulties or even much about the navies of either side. So, if you are looking for an in-depth history of the war, this is not your book. But, if you are a serious student of the war, especially the land campaigns, this is a very solid history.The text is strong, but almost all of the original maps are too busy. They are clearly the style of map that was popular when the book was written, but the proliferation of detail makes them difficult to read. They are accurate, perhaps too accurate for their size and black on light gray color scheme.On the other hand, the addition of more than 150 photographs to this book is a real joy (except for one detailed below). The book is large - each page is nearly the size of a regular piece of paper - and there are multiple pictures that fill or nearly fill an entire page.But, the publisher made on regrettable error in the picture on page 51. The picture is of Union General William H.L. \\"Lew\\" Wallace of the 11th Illinois Volunteers who fought and died in the Battle of Shiloh. It is identified with the correct name but states that he was also the author of the famed novel Ben-Hur- the best-selling American novel of the 19th century. The author of Ben-Hur was Lew Wallace, but not that Lew Wallace. Ben-Hur was written by Union General Lewis \\"Lew\\" Wallace of the 11th Indiana Volunteers who fought at Shiloh (with controversy) as well but survived. In fact, he survived the war and I nearly stopped reading the book at that point, figuring that I could not trust the book if it had simple mistakes like listing generals as being killed when they were not. But, a little research cleared up the source of the mistake and I am glad to say that I did not find any more mistakes."},{"Title":"Campaigns of the civil war,","review":"Mr. Geer makes a vane attempt to prove that had things gone just a little differently then the South would have won the war. He continually refers to the war as the \\"War of Session\\" which tips the reader to his sympathies. Mr. Geer glosses over the complete breakdown of the Southern command at Gettysburg and continually pines for the \\"what should have happened \\"on the many Southern defeats or pushes. The book is a defense of the Southern policies and an exercise in hero worship of Generals Lee and Jackson. It should be read for what it is, another attempt to revise history"},{"Title":"The history of Rogers' rangers","review":"This review is for the complete set of History of Rogers Rangers Volumes I, II, III and IV.

It's a shame so few people read these books nowadays.And in case you didn't know; the writer---Arther M. Winfield---is a pen name for Edward Stratameyer, who also started the Stratameyer Syndicate, and organized the ghost-writing of the first The Hardy Boys books under the name of Franklin W. Dixon.So if you happen to like the early Hardy boys, hey, this book is a little like it, even if The Rovers aren't detectives. The Rover Boys are different than the Hardys because the entire Rover Boys series (if you buy them all) relates different points in the Rovers' lives---Dick, Tom and Sam grow older, go to college, get married, etc.----while in the Hardy Boys, Frank and Joe are always the same age and always at the same high school.And in the Rover Boys there is always some outrageously funny joke or prank played by Tom, so you're usually in for a laugh at some point.Buy it for a chance to see what the adventurous kids in the early 1900s did for fun. And if the title doesn't really attract your attention, try reading \\"The Rover Boys On Land and Sea\\" or \\"The Rover Boys On Treasure Isle.\\" Both great books."},{"Title":"Frommer's Greek Islands","review":"Helpful and full of inside hints about what to do, where to go, what to avoid and why, where to stay off the beaten path plus on, and specific travel insights about the Greek Islands. Worth the investment."},{"Title":"Frommer's Greek Islands","review":"Great book to have before you take you big trip and great to take along to guide you thru and help you know what is best."},{"Title":"Frommer's Greek Islands","review":"The principal difference between this book and \\"Frommer's Greece\\" is that this one covers the option of selecting a cruise of the islands, and that section is very good. So, if a major concern is choosing a cruise line (or ship) for your Greek vacation, take a look at this guide. Otherwise, \\"Frommer's Greece\\" covers all the mainland (and all the islands) for the same price. Frommer's stands out for clear writing, logical indexing, and especially for running the gamut from budget tourism to the more affluent. His starred system with comments for value or attractiveness to family is understandable with good common sense. Studying Frommer's helps me make the decisions I personally want to make. It will save you many times the price of the book and make your stay much more enjoyable.Reviewed by David Lundberg, author ofOlympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece"},{"Title":"Frommer's Greek Islands","review":"Unfortunately this book lacks much of the detail and thoroughness that some other guides to the Greek Islands offer (such as the Eyewitness travel guide). Although the major islands are covered in some detail, this book almost entirely ignores a lot of other islands, even some that are quite large. This is a real disappointment because the true wonder of the Greek Island experience is that you can travel to all kinds of places, some very small but no less significant. A good travel guide for the Greek Islands therefore needs to include just as much detail about these less-visited islands as it does about the more well-traveled ones. This book also lacks a lot of the photograps that other books include, which I think is important because the Greek Islands are so diverse. It really does help to see pictures of the islands to help you decide which ones to visit. If you're planning a trip to the Greek Islands you can do much better than this book for a travel guide."},{"Title":"Frommer's Greek Islands","review":"I usually LOVE Frommer's books. Their book on Costa Rica is outstanding and so is their Europe on $50 a day. However, I was a little disappointed with this one. My husband and I are about to travel to the Greek Islands and we wanted to at least see a one page per island description -- even if the description just says &quot;uninhibited, don't travel here.' This one only goes through the main islands. I'm sure it's still a good guide but we wanted to see at least a listing of all the islands. It does give good tips and stuff and I'm sure we'll find them all helpful."},{"Title":"Frommer's Greek Islands","review":"I went traveling in Greece 2 years ago and found other travel books to lack info on the Greek Islands and had to struggle my way through the islands. As I am planning to return this summer, I have found this book to be a good reference to prepare, and one that I will bring with me. When most of us think of Greece, the Greek Isles are the place most of us invision. This book gave me a good reference as to where to go, where to stay and what there was to do. I would reccommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Frommer's Greek Islands","review":"We just got back from a Greek isles trip and this book was a big disappointment. Overall it was a blah assessment of the islands that did not differentiate good sites from bad. It also appeared to us that the Crete section had not been updated in several years as we found restaurants and hotels that the locals told us had been closed for a while but were given stellar reviews.

The section I found most helpful was the appendix in the back of the book that gives info on Greece in depth which briefly lists the Gods & Goddesses, language, useful words & phrases, as well as some menu terms. Even though the book is very light weight I plan on cutting out that section out of the book and keeping it in my pocket for shore excursions on the Islands. I have used Frommer's books in the past with the most recent being Rome. I live in New York and keep a copy of Frommer's New York for foreign travelers who visit me and want to head out on their own.

My kids love to read, and they are fighting right now over what to read for bed-time stories. But of all the books I read as a child- and I read a lot- this one was my absolute favorite. I'm not really sure what I like best about this story, but I do remember my mind being set free to this other time and place, with this family that was so unlike mine. So vividly described, that I was there in the story, and well...I was only about eight. But this book is good enough for me to seek it out after twenty years, despite the two different titles, I want to pass this down to my children, and I secretly want like to read it again. It is a wonderful, beautiful book for boy or girl. I can't wait to quit my raving and buy it."},{"Title":"Jenny, Sam and the Invisible Hildegarde","review":"I,too, read this as a child and I am now 63!

Great item!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"As she proved with \\"The Shipping News\\", author Annie Proulx has an unmistakably intricate, often elegant writing style. The eleven stories that constitute her latest book are testament to her talent, though the short story format seems to undermine her ability to deepen her characters as much this time. In certain ways, that works just fine since the somewhat interrelated stories almost feel like parables set in her vision of a rural Wyoming caught in a downward economic spiral. She brings a tough yet big-hearted sensibility to her stories, some more than others. But on the whole the approach balances itself out well.My favorite of the bunch is \\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\\", which despite its jokey title is actually a serious-minded distillation of the current red-state mentality. It's a compelling tale about a man who can't make a go of his ranch and what it's like to see your traditional way of life eroding on every front. Rancher Gilbert Wolfscale keeps at it, doggedly and half-hopelessly, fighting against the odds to save his land. The author writes about him with a tenderness worthy of a Horton Foote, and with a deep-seeded sympathy both for Gilbert's determination to stay on his home ground and also for his urge to flee. He receives a final blow when saline wastewater pits, the byproduct of coal-bed methane drilling on land next to his, start poisoning his own land. Ranchers are suddenly thrown together with eco-conservationists, but they get nowhere protesting against the politicians and gas company officials who favor proceeding with the drilling. Wolfscale ends up on the open road, driving for the sake of driving and not caring where he's headed. He's about the only character in ''Bad Dirt'' who receives the full measure of her love.Five of the 11 stories in ''Bad Dirt'' are little more than comic anecdotes about the eccentrics who inhabit Elk Tooth, whose sole distinction is its three popular bars -- Pee Wee's, Muddy's Hole and the Silvertip. In fact, a sixth tale, ''The Old Badger Game,'' is hardly a story at all but an odd animal fable that some drunkard would have told in one of those taverns. The other story worth highlighting is \\"Man Crawling Out of Trees\\", which describes through the eyes of a retiring New York couple, the difficulties of being a newcomer to Wyoming. The wife bears the loneliness as best she can, while her husband delights in long drives through his new surroundings, classical music blasting from his car stereo. Through a series of revelations, a flawed marriage is exposed, and the power of place collides with their reality in unexpected ways, and Proulx is careful not to tip her hand toward where her deepest sympathies lie. As a whole, \\"Bad Dirt\\" hangs together nicely with recurring minor characters tying the stories unobtrusively. With the exception of a couple of stories that simply seem out of kilter with the rest, Proulx's book certainly makes the ranchland atmosphere of an economically downtrodden but physically beautiful Wyoming come to life."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"The other posted reviews here all do some justice to this book. It was not the overwhelming and unforgettable event of Wyoming Stories but I was glad it was published and happy to have read it. For one thing, it underscores the acheivement of the first volume. The stories have their own interest but like the minor works of a great genius composer we gain insight from our time with them into the great accomplishment. we see haow much it took to produce.As one reviewer said, they do not bring on the great poetry and technicolor of the first ones but illuminate a variety of human types we might pass on our tourist visits and never have the imagination or empathy to imagine a life for.Flannery o'Conner would have loed the trailer stories and the people."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Having just finished \\"Close Range,\\" awed by Proulx's unique language of the Wyoming landscape, I was frankly disappointed by the stories in \\"Bad Dirt.\\" These stories reveal a placid Proulx whose stories are so uncharacteristic, that they seem written by another author. Admittedly, the characters are similar, and the country is as barren and unforgiving. But Proulx holds back, and one senses that she has simply run out of steam, like one of her aging, spent ranchers."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"The characters are one dimensional, the plot lines meander and go no where, and the narration is tedious to the point of insanity. Wyoming is a wild and beautiful place, but her descriptions are as evocative as a suburban shopping mall. The only reason this book was published is because some of Proulx's other books have been commercial successes. The only good thing about this book is that I didn't pay for it. If you want great short stories, check out Tobias Wolff, Raymond Carver, Richard Ford, etc. Leave this one on the bargain table where it belongs."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Annie Proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media. This fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot. Unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2. The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for. All in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment. For readers who have enjoyed other works by Proulx, I wouldn't recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Having been born and raised in Wyoming, I thought this collection of short stories would entertain me. Boy was I wrong. This book is horrific. I'm thankful that I bought it for next to nothing because after I read it, I threw it in the trash at a gas station. I didn't want anybody else to be lulled into a competent authors last ditch attempt to write anything anybody would actually want to read. Her character exaggerations are uselessly wild and outrageous. And what is with the character names? This book was not even slightly entertaining or accurate (okay, maybe the wind bit but that is all!) pure rubbish."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I am SURE I would love this book if I READ it, but instead got it on audio. It was just awful It was a poor performance, not a narration, and I could hardly bear to listen to Dufris. I was on a long trip and had no other audiobook with me, but I stopped listening anyway. Silence was better than this.Maybe it is just me, but when I read a book, I do not imagine different voices for the various characters in a novel. So it annoys me no end when I listen to a book where the narrator plays different parts. To me, this is kind of creepy, epecially when a female narrator *plays* male roles or vice-versa. And it is really bad when the narrator/performer is not very good.Perhaps it would be helpful if the cover said \\"performed by\\" instead of \\"narrated by\\".I just want someone to read the darn book to me. I am not interested in listening to someone who thinks s/he is up for an acting award!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"but I haven't read it yet. I bought and read the first Wyoming collection, and I've read a few other Proulx stories in The New Yorker. I think I know what I'll find in \\"Bad Dirt.\\"I was born and grew up in Wyoming, in the Goose Creek valley east of the Big Horns, a region that's been compared to the Vale of Kashmir for its complex beauty. (I suspect that's an exaggeration, although it was made by a person who'd been to both places. I hope to go to the Vale someday, and judge for myself.) Many other parts of Wyoming are beautiful, terrible, and strange. I don't recognize find many -- or any! -- of them in Annie Proulx. Neither do I recognize the rather austere and capable people I grew up with among her rural grotesques. (They make me think of Richard Russo's laughably unlikely characters in his Gloversville novels.) I guess city folks like to imagine rural people that way. Annie gives 'em what they want.I should mention that I bought \\"Bad Dirt\\" off a remainders pile for $5.98US."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I greatly enjoyed Proulx' Close Range collection of short stories,and Bad Dirt (subtitled \\"Wyoming Stories 2\\") is a very worthyencore. The Close Range stories gave a wonderful flavor to therural areas of the state, the people, the land, the warm and therough sides, both past and present. Some of the stories werehumorous, others were harrowing, some were a whimsical mix. You'llfind just the same mix (and a bit more) in Bad Dirt. You start offwith a 12-page story about Game & Fish Warden Creel Zmundzinski (whoturns up again in a couple of more stories) that begins in a nicestraightforward fashion, and then takes off into a kind ofhumorous Proulx-Stephen King joint venture (or perhapsProulx-King-Carl Hiaassen).Several stories center on the residents and the 3 bars in the tinytown of Elk City: I very much like reading another of Proulx'short stories when I feel that I already know the characters well(one of these is a kind of Proulx-Hiaassen mix involving rentalalligators--it sounds bizarre, but the story works in a trulydelightful way).The best of the stories is The Wamsutter Wolf, and runs about 35pages. Buddy Millar lives in a $40/month rental housetrailer5 miles out from the center of a small boomtown (almost alltrailers). You don't get much for your $40 a month. His onlyneighbors live close by in an even grungier trailer--a bully whobeat him up in high school, his wife and passel of grungy youngkids, one of whom is a 4-year-old alcoholic (his father believesthat learning to drink young avoids the problems that come withlearning later). This is a horrifying and harrowing story--stronger than anything I remember in Close Range. It's verytough, utterly realistic, and it left me wanting to see itexpanded to about 300 pages as a novel.Annie Proulx and William Gay (I Hate To See The Evening Sun GoDown) are the two best short-story writers I've read in manyyears--and both write excellent novels as well."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Didn't like it as much as At Close Range. The stories seems less inspired, a little more flippant, a little less likely to grab you, shake you, scratch you, bite you, gouge you than the former collection. Still very well written, and more engaging that most stuff I pick up on a whim or obtain on recommendation from friends or family. Oh - I'm a Wyoming native, I live on the family ranch outside Saratoga (look it up on a map!), and trust me, the other reviews from us 'Pokes are right - these stories (and At Close Range) actually are pretty durn close to Wyoming then and now (especially the geography and landscapes, the climate, the damn WIND, and the very necessary self-reliance of most folks), although I'd have to say your average WY native is maybe just a little bit less colorful and probably a little bit more of a warm, caring, educated person (though we have more than our share of Proulx characters)."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This volume of stories about Wyoming contains four fully developed, character-driven short stories interspersed with what feels like seven thinly disguised local anecdotes. Yet in both kinds of stories Proulx demonstrates a Faulkner-like skill at portraying agrarian locals coming head-to-head with modernity. The final (anecdotal) story, \\"Florida Rental\\", especially reminded me of Faulkner's \\"Spotted Horses\\" sequence from The Snopes Trilogy. And like Faulkner, Proulx seems to have an underlying affection (or at least respect) for all her characters, even the ones she seems to enjoy skewering.The substantial stories that I enjoyed are: \\"The Indian Wars Refaught\\" about a troubled young Sioux woman who reconnects with her sense of identity while sorting archival material related to the battle of Wounded Knee; \\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?,\\" about one Wyoming rancher's decline in the face of changing times, a failed marriage, and sons who've gone their own ways; \\"Man Crawling Out of Trees\\" about an elderly couple who moved to Wyoming from the East and how each of them responds in radically different ways to the rugged terrain, taciturn populace, and sense of isolation; \\"The Wamsutter Wolf\\" in which the human characters are eerily shown to behave according to wolf pack mores. Of all the stories, these four come closest to matching the standard Proulx set for herself with \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" Also worth mentioning here is \\"Dump Junk,\\" a story that interestingly moves beyond Proulx's very grounded sense of reality into the realm of fantasy.All in all, this is a pretty satisfying collection of stories."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I've read Annie Proulx's earlier collection of Wyoming Stories (Close Range -- see my review of it if you'd like) and found this collection equally masterfully written. Even as I get absorbed in each story, I can stand back and just admire the skill of using words to paint pictures of people and places. Amazing!These stories struck me as being more cheeky than the Close Range stories -- not quite as poignant, but more toward the funny side. But the tall-tale, mythical quality is still there, as is the spot-on description of the dusty, harsh, and utterly beautiful star of the book -- Wyoming -- and the dusty, harsh, and utterly beautiful people who dare to call it home. We meet all kinds: crusty ranchers, ex-urbanites, oil and gas workers, mountain men, wildlife agents. Their lives intertwine within and between stories until the whole collection becomes one larger-than-life whole. I got this book from the library, but liked it so much that it might be one that I'll actually add to my collection. I can't recommend it highly enough -- go get it today!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Annie Proulx tickles me. I loved \\"Shipping News\\" for its mix of quirky characters, dark humor, sentiment, sheer scariness, and the impact of an isolated and starkly beautiful landscape. Much of this shows up again in her short stories set in Wyoming, where isolation and economic contingencies tend to get a strangle hold on the people who live there. The tough survive OK, but only by fierce determination and good luck, of which there is scarcely enough to go around.The stories range from brief comic interludes, existing sometimes chiefly for the sake of a punch line (\\"The Old Badger Game\\" and \\"Summer of the Hot Tubs\\"), to humorous yarns about colorful local characters (\\"The Trickle Down Effect\\"), to longer accounts of people up against unwelcome circumstances with every potential of crushing them. The marriage of a retired New York couple in a massive log house on a ranchette starts to crumble under the pressure of a Wyoming winter (\\"Man Crawling Out of Trees\\"). A 4th-generation rancher is squeezed into a desperate corner by rising costs, falling prices, coalbed methane drilling, and a disintegrated family (\\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\\").A hundred years of Wyoming history are compressed into a story about the fortunes of a wealthy polo-playing family, the empty shell of which is invaded by descendants of the massacred at Wounded Knee (\\"The Indian Wars Refought\\"). And finally, in my favorite story of the bunch, a young man trying to pull his life back together finds himself in a nightmarish situation involving a violent neighbor (\\"The Wamsutter Wolf\\"). This one had me sitting up past my bedtime, wide-eyed in the night and heart pounding.The tone of the stories varies with the publication they were written for, and these range from The New Yorker to the literary quarterlies, to Playboy. Once you get over that, you can settle back and just let Proulx pull out whatever stops she cares to, to create one heck of a read - and one right after another.Readers who enjoy her broadly humorous Elk Tooth stories will enjoy Robert Welsch's comic collection, \\"It's Not the End of the Earth, But You Can See It From Here,\\" set in fictional Centralia, Nebraska."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Miz Proulx musta' gotten into a patch of locoweed while she was a'writing these stories. Or maybe she has just grown tired of the spare landscapes and stubborn people she described so carefully in her first collection of Wyoming stories, AT CLOSE RANGE. The subtle,somber hues of those stories have been replaced in BAD DIRT by a garish, psychedelic pallete.Gaudy colors do not, however, equate to warmth. Proulx's stories are inflated, unfunny jokes and most of her characters are unattractive caricatures bearing improbable names like Fiesta Punch, Reverend Pecker, Suzzy New, Lobett Pulvertoft Thirkill, Mercedes de Silhouette, and Dr. Playfire. The plots go beyond improbable. A game warden discovers a hidden entrance to Hell in a Forest Service parking area and uses it to deal with out-of-state poachers. A red-furred badger tells his cronies that a rancher's wife has fallen in love with him. A bartender imports alligators to defend her vegetable garden from marauding cows. An expatriate makes accidental use of a magic teakettle found when cleaning out her late mother's house.Despite heavy lardings of fictional biography and gratuitous back-story, the stories in BAD DIRT smell anachronistic. They are the sort of tall tales the denizens of bars like the fictional Pee Wee's in Elk Tooth, Wyoming might tell about their parents or grandparents. Yet Proulx's crusty eccentrics are mostly baby-boomers living in the first decade of the 21st century, not the first half of the 20th.Perhaps not coincidentally, the best story in the collection, \\"Man Crawling Out Of Trees\\" concerns transplanted easterners, like Proulx herself, learning to cope with life in Wyoming. In the end, one of them flees back to New York. Perhaps BAD DIRT is meant to be Proulx's exit line."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This volume of Wyoming stories is just as true, and at times as harsh, as \\"Close Range,\\" but it is infused with more humor. I found it a much easier read than \\"Close Range.\\" However, it did not resonate with me the same. It was overall a lighter take on Wyoming life. I would recommend it, but only after you read \\"Close Range.\\""},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"These stories range from mildly funny to utterly bizarre, and as I savored each tidbit I could barely wait for more. Heck, this was worth reading just to get acquianted with folks with names as Runyonesque as can be. The whole assemblage ends up with the flavor of modern fairy tales; in the end, a lesson is learned, good wins over evil, the prince & princess live happily ever after. Sort of, in a crooked way. I liked the connectivity, the fact that because I'd read about a character in one story I already had the inside scoop on him or her as played out in a subsequent tale. And of course the \\"character\\" of Wyoming plays out across the whole book. This book is a good summer read."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Annie Proulx is one of the finest living American writers. She is gifted at crafting longer works of fiction that explore the complexities of some very unique people, but also equally talented at creating short stories about similar characters that are just as lasting. \\"Bad Dirt\\", a second collection of short stories set in her beloved and tested Wyoming, is a collection that offers pathos and humanity and humor along with a little of the fantastic.One of the standouts in this collection is \\"Men Crawling Out of Trees\\" about a pair of New York transplants whose marriage is crumbling and who will never quite fit in among their adopted neighbors, no matter how hard they try. \\"The Wamsutter Wolf\\" is a harrowing look at the bleakness of life for those who have few options to leave a depressed state, and \\"The Indian Wars Refought\\" is a heartfelt examination of the ranching life and the impact of reservation life for Native Americans. Proulx tempers her longer stories with short gems, like the initial \\"The Hellhole\\" about a Game and Fish Warden who discovers a remarkable (and perhaps miraculous) way to dispose of criminals.In each story, whether serious or downright humor-driven like \\"Florida Rental\\", Proulx creates characters that are real and believable. It would be impossible to surpass some of her previous masterpieces in terms of short stories, like \\"Close Range\\" and \\"Heartsongs\\" but \\"Bad Dirt\\" reaffirms what an incredible writer Proulx is. It would be far praise indeed to say that she just might do for the West what Flannery O'Connor did for the South. She has a way of creating stories and characters that sear into your imagination and will not leave. The bad dirt of Wyoming definitely makes for some excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"These remarkable short stories are equally masterpieces that one does not get bored reading them repeatedly. The depiction of rural life is amazing.The stories are equally compelling with vivid descriptions, beautiful narratives and brilliant plots. Like The Usurper and Other Stories, A twist in the Tale and the Works of Anton Chekhov, this collection is a part of my list of good stories and books. They made me laugh a lot and I learned something from every one of them."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Proulx's \\"Bad Dirt\\" captures the size, dryness and dust-blown reality of the Wyoming setting and throws a range of modern-day characters into the scene, complete with (her signature) odd names and even odder behavior. There are good guys and bad guys, heroes and protagonists. And in case the reader gets bored with things, she throws in a few fables to keep things interesting - something I had not seen in previous work.While this book is not as realistic as the first in the trilogy, it makes up for that fact with more colorful writing and more desperate situations. I was reminded of Proulx's \\"Postcards\\" in many of the stories, the writing has that same isolated, haunting tone. Proulx knows what it's like to live on a wind-blown prairie or a rocky scrub. She also reads human behavior well and is a keen observer. Taking both of these ingredients and carefully paring them down to their most salient elements is what she does best. The writing is spare and the dialogue even more so.One can't help but also sense of Proulx's own personality, dislikes and likes. Careful reading between the lines shows that while she respects many Wyoming residents' livelihood and history, she also knows it may be best to keep them at an arm's length. Her penchant for wacky names, laundry lists and spare dialogue show a peculiar - if not interesting - take on life and it's one that this reviewer finds intriguing enough to come back for more.-------(The following review is for \\"Just Fine the Way It Is\\", the last of the three Wyoming Stories. Amazon will not allow my review to appear on the actual product page, stating I bought them as a set and cannot review them separately, even though this is not the case, I bought each as a separate purchase)-------While still excellent writing, of the three books which make up the series \\"Wyoming Stories\\", this is easily the least cohesive and suffers from a few Twain-esque additions which mark an odd departure from the whole.Most of the stories are standard Proulx fare; evocative, timely and unique. I was particularly drawn to the final novelete, \\"Tits Up in a Ditch\\" because it covered the most ground and encompassed 3 generations of the Listers, a ranch family of lower economics and backward ways, making them both embarrassing and endearing. Another gem is \\"Testimony of the Donkey\\", which reveals the writer's own pith through the character of Catlin, a fiercely independent, modern boheme, who shows us that independent traits can be both rewarding and deadly.When Proulx stumbles, she does so with flair. \\"I've Always Loved This Place\\" and \\"Swamp Mischief\\" are both stories featuring the Devil, and - while interesting and slightly humorous to read - are both polished coal in an otherwise unique collection of fine stones. They're good efforts, but Mark Twain she ain't. As well, \\"Deep-Blood-Greasy-Bowl\\" lopes in to paleo-historic territory and diverges into a writing meter that didn't hold my interest as well as Proulx's familiar, homespun style. When I buy Proulx, I expect Proulx.These low points don't exactly ruin the whole, but they dent a good fender on the vehicle which Proulx drives beautifully around her beloved state of Wyoming."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"The scenic, hardship, and roughness of the Wyoming ranching wilderness is painted in a lasting reading impression done in a short-story gold-nugget format.Never before has the changing and past American West been so quirkily idolized. And done so well.Human behavior is captured in such a colorful, poetic, detailed manner unlike anything I have ever read. Some of the word choices demonstrate excellent wordsmithing that succinctly create a picture. The sexual relationships among characters give each story grist, realism, and lasting impact where no man has gone before.There are bar stories in this volume that trigger giggling that would be worth in $50 of antidepressant medication with no side effects!I thought the first story \\"The Hellhole\\" oddly enough reminded me of Satanic Verses and the schizophrenic, psychedelic nature of the thinking processes of the characters in the book satirized from a humanitarian perspective. Perhaps drinking induces a similar effect in bar tall-tail telling folklore.As some have written, I too think Annie Proulx has a Steinbeckian style when describing the American West, but I don't think this volume's tone is as serious as the first and is more humorous. This and the prior volume reminded me of 10th grade English when I read American short stories and developed some knowledge of American authors and literature. I can imagine some of her stories being selected to be included in such textbooks some day!I have a rough time picking one story from the book as my favorite since each is such a colorful jewel. I tend to think you need to read the entire book as a collage of life experiences to see the big picture of Wyoming culture.I truly loved this book and the prior volume and I think Annie Proulx is one mighty fine writer."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I gave this book as a gift. It is still one of the best I have ever read. Annie Proulx will make you very disappointed with any other author you read next. If you love the West and especially Wyoming, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I started with the hugely acclaimed popular fiction,'Shipping News' and have worked myself through most of Proulx's output. 'Bad Dirt' is a second round of shorter pieces on the town folk of her region. I suspect they are based on actual folk and I wonder how she fares with those who can 'spot the influence', as for the most part the characters are resourceful types but subject to the author's merciless mirth. I'm not there, or party to these truths. So I can sit comfortably and howl with laughter at the excruciating, often sad characters who have an exotic appeal even in the ring of their names, so removed from the Australian lexion. Other than for the names,many of these tales could have been sourced beyond the perimeter of our sprawling cities. It's for this humourous side and for a greater eveness of quality that I rate this above its predecessor. And for the sense of community that emerges through the repetition of names and venues, and the remorseless struggle to eek it out there it such formidable an environment. Proulx has really seen something there, and she is in total command of placing you in the seat along side herself. Would Ang Lee revisit Proulx for a set of these Northern Exposures?"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I enjoyed the CD of this book very much! I don't see the audio version of BAD DIRT for sale here at Amazon, but if you enjoy books on tape and Annie Proulx stories, try to get these CDs. I don't recall the reader's name, but he does a fantastic job telling the stories and voicing the various peculiar characters of Proulx's Wyoming. And the stories themselves are amazing, at times harrowing, at times laugh out loud hilarious."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Once again, Annie Proulx has \\"painted\\" a masterpiece of individuals, locations and situations. I find myself totally immersed in every one of her stories. Would I personally want to be associated with any of these strange characters and/or plights? Probably not, but I certainly do enjoy becoming a part of their lives through the pages of Ms. Proulx's books! I look forward to her next collection!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This book has hilarious short stories that totally capture the way of life out here in the REAL West.. Annie must live the life and know the characters personally to have created such rich little stories about people I swear I know. I live in a small town in Idaho and I've long thought about writing about the characters around here, but I didn't think anyone would believe me. She even slips in a tall tale or two which you are suckered into for a few pages before you realize, no.... wait..... that can't be, even though it's a nice thought! I've shared this book with my whole family and they love it too."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This is the coda to \\"Close Range,\\" E. Anne Proulx's blockbuster about life on the range. I liked this collection quite a bit, found it more approachable than \\"Close Range.\\" Most memorable was \\"The Summer of Hot Tubs,\\" a hilarious story that you can imagine being told after dinner. It seems that Proulx has lightened up, has let her characters really speak for themselves.Western HorsemanThe Straight StoryThe Cowboy KindMaking a Hand: Growing Up Cowboy in New Mexico"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I'm an avid reader, have been for years, and come across many good and sometimes even great books. Bad Dirt is one of the best! From the first story you find yourself in Wyoming, the landscape, the people, the flavor is so real and palpable. I wish every story would be a novel!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Considerably weaker than Wyoming Stories 1. Proulx is clearly in touch with Wyoming's geography and culture, and she creates some laugh out loud moments, but the endings to her stories are let-downs."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This book of stories depicts the life of the sparsely populated lands of Wyoming. The hardscabble, tough fought life for existence is depicted with Proulx' usual excellence. Her language is that of the Wyoming environment. Her characters are the wind toughened, deep winters folks of the life that tests each and every persons ability to cope with a severe environment.Her stories are loosely connected through the bars that the people of Wyoming patronize and some of the characters that reappear from story to story. From her story about the devil's hole that consumes people in flames, to the unique method of keeping cattle off one's land, the stories are true and bare portrayals of an existence of challenge.The book is recommended to all readers who like great prose and excellent depictions of hard lives with which Annie Proulx is so familiar. Her life in both Wyoming and Newfoundland allows her to observe how those that live in such challenging territories manage to keep on going. Once again, Proulx creates a wonderful portrait of life under stress. It is a truly fine read."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This is a great book. Many of the stories had me laughing out loud. I didn't find BAD DIRT as 'bleak' as CLOSE RANGE and POSTCARDS. I almost didn't read it, because I found the two others listed above as just too much hardship and deprivation. I kept repeating the word 'bleak' about Annie Proulx's writing, until I read BAD DIRT. Give it a try, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This was the second Annie Proulx book of her Wyoming Stories, that I've read. I'm ready to go for a third!Her characters are drawn well, very human and often quirky. She gives you a real feel for the Wyoming country, the people who live there, and the ones who stay and survive. Some of her stories border on fantasy, and they are some of the most memorable. These are all short stories, three of them are worth reading over and over.My favorites: \\"The Hellhole\\" a very darkly funny story about what happens to people who break the fish & game laws. \\"The Old Badger Game\\" about a badger who's convinced a rancher's wife is crazy about him. \\"Summer Rental\\" is a lot of fun, and a novel way to deal with problem neighbors and their cattle. I can't recommend Annie Proulx highly enough! Reading her stories is like going to live in Wyoming, she paints her characters and landscapes so vividly, you feel like you are there."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"After 'Close Range', I held my breath that this wouldn't be a letdown. It isn't. Proulx keeps charging with her mesmerizing, uncomfortable stories of human fallibility set against a stunning landscape. AP singlehandedly makes one wish the short story had more of a place in our literature. A superb read."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This pulitzer winning author holds you spellbound as she describes everyday life in Wyoming.You can tell she has a wide life experience."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"Loved every story, adored the originality and creativity. Really sorry it came to an end! This author never disappoints me."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"This author writes with a depth of knowledge of her locality. You find yourself unable to put the book down, and the biggest disappointment is reaching the end, and wishing there was more. Annie Proulx knows human nature, and is not afraid to delve between the shiny surfaces and pull out the grimy undercurrent which motivates her characters. A must read for real escapism!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"For critical readers, AP's second, sometimes brilliant volume of short stories about Wyoming, contains covert warnings against living or retiring in the state. \\"Bad Dirt\\"'s 11 stories are good to excellent, with two exceptions, the opening story and the story about badgers. The state of Wyoming is said to have a population \\"large enough to fill a phone booth\\". They may be poorly educated, but are surely used to and prepared for natural disasters of any sort and no stranger to disasters of the private kind. Wyoming's failures leave and rarely return. In this book Buddy Millar does return and sets new standards for failure. Wyoming's escapees who made good only return to manage the spoils of death, such as the descendents of the couple who died aged 102 and 101, to sort out what to do with the land and a house full of hoarded junk. Another story sketches the difficulties of wealthy East Coast retirees to integrate.A running theme in this volume is the Pee Wee bar in Elk Tooth (pop. 80), one of 3 profitable bars there with steady customers from within a radius of 60+ miles. Pee Wee's bartender Amanda and Creel, a regular who combats illegal hunting and fishing, provide material for four other stories.AP never writes stories aiming to score with a final punch line. When it happens, it is a bonus on top of emphatic writing, great dialogue, and foremost, deep research in terms of oral and written history to gain a thorough understanding of the skills needed to survive in Wyoming (and/or Newfoundland, New England, other states and areas she graced with her writing). It is an ode to struggling \\"fly-over America\\", ignorant of the intentions and hostile to any type of government interference in their lives. Great writing, great book."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"bad dirt, book 2 of wyoming stories by annie proulxharsh rural life in wyoming, the nature and background of who settled there first was good. the nature really enthalledme to keep reading, such beautiful things in life."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt","review":"I have been a fan of Annie Proulx's for quite some time and finally got around to ordering this set of short stories.

Brilliant narrative with fantastic vocabulary. A must read. I now have to get my hands on Eastward Ha!"},{"Title":"Westward Ha!","review":"The drawings of Al Hirschfeld perfectly compliment S.J. Perelman's writing. The work of both men shows what astute observers they were of human behavior. With this work, and in their other collaborations, they draw caricatures that are not one-dimensional, and are instead more like snapshots of the human condition, flaws and all.S.J. Perelman's writing is best described as finely crafted comedy. And what that means is that he loves words, he loves wordplay and he loves metaphor and Mr. Perelman works hard to share that love with his readers. Do yourself a favor. Start your Perelman collection today."},{"Title":"Westward Ha!","review":"I read this book decades ago, and I can still laugh when I remember it. If you want to laugh at/with city folks who go to the country, this is a great one."},{"Title":"Westward Ha!","review":"Perelman is one of America's great Twentieth Century prose stylists--the quintessential New Yorker columnist when that magazine set literary style. The texture of his writing is obviously unique--clang association abetted by immense vocabulary and an eye that never forgot anything it noticed. But there's more going on. What we have here is a mind in the act of making the mind, a lively intellect using everything as fodder for the imagination, even imagination itself. Sure, there's a heap of artist performing FOR himself, with reader as voyeur, but it's a first-rate artist transforming reality into something more satisfying than fact. His writing parodies the magazine \\"short story\\" form. And it's convoluted, to the point of menace. But these willful distortions make the essence of his experience incarnate by taking its transactions to the level of the truly bizarre, like Jonathan Winters or Hunter Thompson. This isn't easy reading, but its method--stimulus for its own sake--is intense beyond belief. And there's value in it as history, given that his circumnavigation happened in 1947, two years after WWII. The world wasn't the same, and he noticed. More importantly, if he had it to do again, he wouldn't. His writing is caviar: a little is a treat, a plateful sickens."},{"Title":"Westward Ha!","review":"We complain when a flight is delayed an hour or more.

The lesson objectives were clear and the associated activities were in alignment with those objectives. A very useful feature of the book were the \\"Notes\\" insets that are distributed throughout each chapter. These supplimental notes make the review of important concepts efficient. The chapter review section was lacking in definitions of key terms, however, it did a fairly good job of summarizing main concepts and terminology. I could only suggest one area of improvement to the text and that would be to have a companion CD containing the code examples. This minor addition would allow the reader to more quickly be able to experiment and learn without having to re-type code. Overall the book was very good, I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking to learn C++. This book can be informative whether the reader is experienced in programming concepts or not."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Herbs","review":"This is a great reference book for anyone who is learning about herbs, their uses, and their true names.

Offers much encouragement to the reader and examples of steps to take to strengthen your prosperity practice in everyday life. Great affirmations. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"As a spiritual person, I really seek to read things that are going to help me make the right decisions. As a wife I take into account that the decisions that I make cannot be done in a vacuum. That being said when I first learned of Catherine Ponder's and her work on creating a more centered life around positive thoughts and knowing that you do deserve happiness made me realize that life was more that just the simple decisions that we believe we are making. That a prosperious life is one filled with hard work, sacrifice, and love.In one of the reviews the author writes that there haven't been any real life applications to Ponder's work since she stopped writing and that the stories she referenced in her work have dried up. Some of the negative reviews have also centered on the fact that people feel that her books promote the idea that you just have to believe that you can prosper and not do any work. While this perception may be apparent for some that was not what I gleaned from her writing and others like her. The books helped me to focus on the fact that I control the choices I make (not necessarily the outcomes but how I react), I can change my perception of a situation into the positive, and the optimism helps to get you further than pessimism. That being said, it is up to us to find the inner strength to act and do the work. Just reading a self-help book isn't going to open you up to living and doing the work to have a \\"satisfying life\\". We have to decide to stand up for the things we believe in, set attainable goals (even when others say no way), and believe that we are deserving of the best.After reading the Dynamic Laws of Prosperity I made the decision to go back to school and work on my PhD. The book helped me to remember that completing the goal of finishing school was possible. That I had to stay focus, do the work, and then remember that God would help me in every decision that I will make. I do hope if you read her work that you keep in mind that it is up to you to put the time in. Yes, if you put the time in and really try then good things may happen."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"The message of the book is good, but unfortunatley it was too religious for me.

The only thing I'd like to say is that this particular version doesn't have the same binding and cover as the books that are published by DeVorss (hope I spelled that correctly). I ordered this edition for a friend a few years ago and was very disappointed that it is an 8-1/2 x 11 oddly bound version that isn't the quality that I wanted to give my friend. I was a little embarrassed, but gave it to her anyway because she was going through a tough time and wanted her to have the book right away. The DeVorss versions are in regular book format with a nice cover and print. I have almost all of Catherine's books, which are bound with the original covers from DeVorss. Just searched on Amazon and found the original bindings, so it is still being published by DeVorss.

Her message is certainly worthwhile: making affirmations in your own life will help you to draw upon God's assistance to achieve your goals. She is also a minister, which explains why she draws her approach from a sprirtual angle. While this effort is certainly worthwhile for a reader, her supporting examples are not specific enough to satisfy my need for \\"proof\\". In Ponder's book, her examples are full of \\"a woman I know...\\", \\"a businessman...\\", and other such vague statements. Contrast that with Napolean Hill's book \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" Hill's examples are specific and precise: \\"Thomas Edison tried over 10,000 times...\\". Napolean Hill and Catherine Ponder both have a similar message in their books. But while Catherine Ponder's message is meaningful and worthwhile, her examples are not down to earth enough to suit my tastes."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"I think the book has the right ideas, but it is full of obvious made up examples, ie.

For example, Chapter Six, \\"The Prosperity Law of Command\\" is \\"The prosperity law or command\\" \\"or\\" in place of \\"of.\\" There was a section, about 3/4's of page long missing in one of the chapters. The only reason I gave it two stars is that it is the book written by Catherine Ponder.

Her affirmations are powerful, and her antecdotes about how others have prospered by affirming goodness and plenty, are heart-warming, and motivational.She taught us how to \\"reframe\\" unfortunate happenings before NLP had been formulated, by putting a positive spin on all situations.She taught us how to deal with \\"energy blocks\\" before anybody was even talking about blocks to energy.She taught us about \\"divine order\\" and truly living in faith, and how that attitude changes everything in your life, for the better.This book is about creating prosperity that far exceeds just money. It's about opening all the doors and windows in your life and lettng in all of the abundance that's already yours.If you liked the Secret, you will be bowled over by this book. It offers true wisdom, heart, and a roadmap to creating the life of your dreams."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"touting the \\"latest fad\\", but the methods that Ms. Ponder suggests in her book have worked for me. This time, last year, I was struggling. My life was in a mess - financially disarray. I was just out of school. Even though I had gone through four years college and graduate school, I couldn't find a permanent job anywhere. I couldn't even get a temporary job, even though I was signed up with four or five different agencies. At that point, I was desperate enough to try any line of work, at that point, but no one seemed to be willing to take a chance on me, so I ended up home. Last year, around this time, I was literally broke.But, through some stroke of luck, I ran into Catherine Ponder's books on this site. I decided to check Dynamic Laws of Prosperity out from a library, along with some other books. Little did I know how much her books would change my life. I discovered it was my constant focus on lack that was the basis of my problems.People might say Ms. Ponder's methods are simply \\"positive thinking.\\" But it's more than that. It's not just about experiencing prosperity in your bank account, it really affects your whole life. She writes about incorporating daily list making, affirmations, tithing, visualization, etc; in her work. You have to be consistent though, which isn't always easy. You have to do it daily -- never missing a day. That's the hard part. Not everyone's willing to commit that time to make the changes they want.For the first four months -- little happened. Then I received my first temp job in months. I worked for several weeks there, and did well. Unlike my last job, where I didn't receive work, even after performing satisfactorily, I received yet, another temporary job.I worried that my prosperity was drying up after the second job, when I received no more temp job offers. Little did I know, that I would receive an interview within two weeks for a job I had literally applied for months before. I had given up on that job too. But, within a few days I was hired for the position, which I just started this week.I've also gotten back in touch with an aunt I'd lost touch with. We literally hadn't spoken in years. We've reconciled around my birthday around the same time my prosperity was increasing, and it's one of the best things that's ever come out of studying Catherine Ponder's work.Not everything is perfect. I still have work to do on a lot of areas of my life, but it's still so much better than the misery I was experiencing around this time last year. I'm richer than I've been in a long time. And I'm setting my goals on even higher goals. :)If you watched \\"The Secret\\" this can supplement what you've learned in that DVD, because it gives you specific techniques. If you thought that the DVD was hokey, but you still believe in prosperity thinking, this book is still perfect. It's perfect, even if you don't really believe that it will work. I was skeptical that it would, but it has for me.P.S. - On an odd note, I had tested her concept by \\"visualizing\\" a way for me to get Ms. Ponder's books. I was frustrated when, for months, it seemed like I wouldn't have the money to purchase her books. If her methods work, I thought, why didn't I ever receive her books? I hadn't realized that it was because the need had already been met. Recently, I cleared out an old e-mail account. I discovered in July 2007, that I had received an Amazon gift certificate in January 2007 of which I was totally unaware. The money was more than enough to cover the purchase of several of Ms. Ponder's books:). I now, proudly own copies of all the book titles I ever wanted to purchase from her. It really does work."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"If you don't get past the Introduction of this wonderful book, you will still have learned one of the many valuable lessons that it has to offer: \\"There's Gold Dust in the Air for You!\\" This nugget of wisdom evolves as Catherine Ponder tells the story of a salesman whose standard response to the \\"How's business\\" question was always \\"Business is wonderful because there's gold dust in the air!\\" And for him there was. Because he said it was so, each contact resulted in sales and people always remarked of him, \\"Everything he touches turns to gold.\\"According to Catherine Ponder the basic law of prosperity can be thought of as radiation and attraction: \\"that what you radiate outward in your thoughts, feelings, mental pictures and words, you attract into your life and affairs.\\" But she goes on to explain that we don't get something for nothing; that we must give before we receive. Further, if you wish to enjoy more prosperity and success in life, you must \\"boldly and deliberately take hold of your thoughts and feelings and redirect them toward prosperity and success.\\"The tools she gives us to achieve our own prosperity and success are sprinkled liberally throughout the entire book. It is a gold mine of powerful, pointed affirmations and poignant, real life stories that guide inspire and motivate action. Affirmations are a form of command Catherine advises; you make your world with words. \\"Through verbally affirming or declaring the good you want, rather than continuing to talk about what you don't want, you begin to make firm in the mind and in the invisible ethers the good you desire. As you continue to affirm the desired good, it rushes forth as a visible result.\\" She also suggests writing lists and letters as practical, hands-on means to achieving goals and finding solutions to problems.Here is Catherine Ponder's Three-Step Formula for Prosperity:\\"First, daily write out your notes of desired good. Second, mentally image the successful results. Third, boldly and deliberately affirm and command those successful results to appear. If you persist daily in following these three simple steps, you will not be able to stop the floodtide of good from overflowing into your life.\\"Some of the other topics covered are work, generating love and good will, financial independence, children, prayer, \\"genius\\" powers, intuition, health, self-confidence, and \\"charm.\\"Get out a highlighter, pen and paper to use as you read, because I guarantee you that you will be taking notes and copying affirmations as you excavate them from Catherine Ponder's \\"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity\\" classic text.- Mary Jo Shaffer, www.Heartprojects.com"},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"I have read many 'prosperity' books, and also on 'positive thinking' stuff...this is the best 'prosperity' book out there....Dont waste money on others,except Florence Shinn's equally powerful books..after reading this,I started tithing seriously and regularly...I could find funds for a major charity project for visually challenged [blind] children in India easily....It is all in your mind and your thought patterns for riches and prosperity!

I had read the Game of Life by Florence Shinn and I was looking for more info about prosperity. WE have used the laws, specifically the law of vaccuum- giving things away freely,writing things down, visualization, affirmations and the most powerful law- tithing. I can't begin to tell you how using these laws have changed my family's life. It is like clockwork, everytime we use these laws wonderful things come about in unexpected ways. Actually, I have a list of things I wanted in life from three years ago when I bought the book and even though they seemed a bit unnattainable at the time, I can say that as of today, every single thing on that list (and more) have miraculuously came true. Now I stock up on copies of this and the Game of Life and give them to people who need and want to learn the laws."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"you need to read this book, its so easy to understand and yet so detailed and comprehensive. Cathrine Ponder has profound and comprehensive insight into how the universal laws of the mind work to bring positive manifestations of prosperity and abundance into our lives. this particular book is similar to many New Thought and positive thinking books you will read. BUT Cathrine Ponder is the ONLY author who talks about the GOD of the bible in her books even has a chapter on prayer with a section on praying to Jesus. I looked for other books written by this author and discovered that her books go deep into the bible to discover New Thought and positive thinking principals found in old testament books and stories as well as a book on Jesus. I'm really excited to read her other books, since her series has such a focus on the bible. It seems to me that her philosophy is that the bible of Christianity is a positive thinking prosperity book and i want to learn how to interpret and read the bible as she does! I believe that I will enjoy reading all her books, I always re-read The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity!"},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"Catherine Ponder implicitly points out some very powerful truths. Those of us who've gone through life expecting the worst and identifying the outcomes as the worst, and drawing more of the same to us can own up to it and change what we're doing. We can, instead, learn to expect the best.Both roads are available to us at all times and Ms Ponder points out a clear approach to take \\"the road less traveled\\", but no more difficult. I recommend Chapter 10 to be read again and again.This book has made a great difference to me, but perhaps it's because I was ready for it when it was suggested to me."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"I bought this book for my sister, who is going through a few tough times. I found myself wondering what I could do for her to help her. I live a distance away from here and, as I thought, realized that I wanted to share two of Dr. Ponder's books with here, because they have given me so much hope and vision. (On my end, I have been experiencing turning 60, having no insurance, with health problems, and having my husband be laid off his job, after having been employed most of his 65 years). I've been reading Catherine Ponder's books for about 20 years now, but for three years in earnest.There are a LOT of books out there these days on prosperity, abundance, creating wealth, etc. By comparison, hers might seem to some, simplistic, dated and old-fashioned, but for me...they rock. I am LDS by religious practice and membership, but I have learned so much from her books about prayer, faith, and love, which has led me to other metaphysical authors, and I feel I have finally begun to find God. I am not terribly consistent in doing her recommendations, but I am slowly trying them and seeing results. One of the hardest parts for me is learning to not get sucked into the appearance of things, to keep my eyes on the goal I have created in my mind and heart.The best part is that she (and the other metaphysical writers) include Jesus Christ as the central part of their equations for abundance and prosperity. Thank you, Dr. Ponder."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity : Forces That Bring Riches to You","review":"Catherine Ponder has written a great book about the laws of prosperity. She starts right off the bat by noting that poverty is not a virtue; it's a vice. She goes on to give illustrations from the Bible (she's a Unity minister)to support her claim.In defining \\"prosperity,\\" she notes that \\"you are prosperous to the degree that you are experiencing peace, health and plenty in your world.\\"She then goes on to explain the basic law of prosperity, as well as:- the vacuum law- the creative law- the imaging law- and various other prosperity lawsThroughout the book, Catherine Ponder provides some great affirmations that can be used for almost any situation. For example, in discussing the prosperity law of self-confidence, she suggests affirming, \\"Infinite wisdom guides me, love prospers me, and I am successful in everything I undertake.\\"I first read this book years ago (the 1985 edition), but I have referred to it time and time again for inspiration.

Every day I am amazed at how simple and how true it is that what we think is what we get. If we think positive thoughts, we get positive outcomes. An interesting thing is that it takes some discipline and training to think positive thoughts on a regular basis, and by that I mean not on a daily basis but on a minute-to-minute basis. Imagine if each night you received an email containing a transcipt of all the thoughts you had had that day. How long would it be? What would the transcript contain?

She relieves us of any old guilt we might carry from christian childhood that leads us to think we have to passively wait and see what god has in store for us.

It's GOOD to be busy reaching goals.I've had this book a while and just ordered one for a friend who needs a good shake - her goal is to have \\"just enough\\" to exist and no more. So silly.

In her book the Dynamic Laws of Prosperity are truly golden nuggets of not only what to do, but how to do it. Catherine writes in a simple, easy to read and understand language for everyone to grasp. There is no hype, no secrets, no making things harder than they need to be. I have read and re-read this book so many times that mine is actually falling apart at the binding now. Most exceptionally even though I consider myself very successful every time I re-read the book something else comes to my attention, I put her suggestions to use, and my life gets even better. This is a must read for everyone on a Spirtual path to abundance. Please note; Catherine does come from a Christian perspective in this book, however, if that is not your belief don't let that stop you. Just change the words to Spirit or the Universe.

This book shares guidelines--simple guidelines--that followed faithfully will help! It is an old resource, and some of the situations are not contemporary for our tech society. At the same time, some of the stories may seem too general or too good to be true. However, to learn to believe that I have the ability to change my situation, and to be the best I can be is worth following the path outlined.

The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity show us how to achieve a mindset and lifestyle that puts God first and foremost. \\"The ancients intuitively knew that giving, sharing, and putting God first financially was the first step to permanent, enduring prosperity\\". This book is not some get rich quick scheme or airy fairy-hocus pocus technique. It is a way for the reader to implement into our lives and affairs day to day practical applications though the use of affirmations, tithing and prayer work promoted by the spirit of giving, sharing, kindness and love. We must remember the old saying, \\"Faith without work is dead\\". This book helps us to understand the true meaning behind that statement. It teaches us to practice what we preach in a way that brings a change to our lives that we never before thought possible. It is a book that helps us to focus our thoughts on happiness but also to act and react in a joyful manner without any thought of self gratification.

He spent his last years teaching at Edinburgh, where he died in 1945. He was a leading authority on Plato.This brief popular study of Socrates was first published in Britain in 1933. It is divided into four sections.In the first section, on Socrates' early life, Taylor creates a very full picture of Socrates in his younger years, much more specific than most modern experts believe is justified. But he marshals the circumstantial evidence supporting his case well, and it is interesting to read.In the next section, covering Socrates' trial and death, Taylor does a good job of elucidating the political and legal issues of the trial. He thinks that Socrates' accusers truly believed that Socrates was a threat to the Athenian state, and were not acting merely out of personal spite, although they probably intended to force Socrates into exile rather than execute him. He believes the jury was taken by surprise by Socrates' refusal to go peacefully, that he forced the issue in a direction they did not anticipate, and finally succeeded in angering enough of them that a majority condemned him to death. Even then, the door was left open for exile via a secret escape from prison, which any normal person would have taken. They had not anticipated how unlike most men Socrates was.In the final section, Taylor elaborates on Socrates' thinking, attributing to him ideas, such as the doctrine of the Forms and his conception of the Soul, that modern authorities would consider Plato's.Taylor presents a point of view of the study of Plato (and of Plato's teacher, Socrates) that was once widely held. The Ancient Graeco-Roman world comes down to us only in fragile and very incomplete form, so that in some ways it acts as a sort of \\"cultural Rorschach test\\", by which the values of the interpretor and his times are projected back onto the Classical world, with results that are often impossible either to fully verify or completely disprove.Many thinkers have shared Taylor's vision of Socrates as a spiritual figure, a sort of pagan Jesus Christ, and there is no doubt that the Western intellectual tradition begins with Socrates. This alone makes Taylor's book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Miss Manners' guide to excruciatingly correct behavior","review":"I first purchased this book when I was in 10th grade, and it served me well throughout many social occasions, situations etc. Now as an adult, I've purchased the only copy I could find (used on amazon.com) for my children.

The early chapters focus on Baius and Jansen. de Lubac, to my surprise, argues that Jansen misunderstood Augustine although the latter had read Augustine in his entirety ten times and his anti-Pelagian works thirty times. The basis of Jansen's misunderstanding of Augustine according to de Lubac lies in his misunderstanding of the supernatural. de Lubac was positively brilliant but his detailed discussions of the supernatural and its relation to nature and grace appears to go beyond the original thought and intent of Augustine himself. Perhaps this work tells us more about de Lubac than Augustine. If, however, you are interested in understanding the thought of one of the most brilliant Roman Catholic theologians of the 20th century, then this is a must read."},{"Title":"Taking Your Business to the Next Level: An Essential Step-by-Step Success Plan for Small Business","review":"This incredible book takes the reader on a journey through the many faceted world of business.

But this one has a few unique aspects to it, as Arthur Herzog did some intriguing explorations into the social and human ramifications of his plotline. In essence, scientists have accidentally created a contagious virus that makes everyone stupid. Sounds corny, and in a few places it is, though the novel is still a very rewarding read, thanks to the travails of the protagonist. The hero, brilliant scientist Dr. Healey, is the guy who's trying to save the world by finding the cure for the virus he had a hand in creating, while he also succumbs to the stupid sickness himself. What's really interesting is the way Herzog constructed the inner struggles of a man who was once an intellectual and knows that he is losing his brains, while also knowing that the world depends on him hanging on to his intelligence while going inexorably dumb. This leads to some quite effective musings from Herzog on the meaning of intelligence and smartness (which is different). He also did a pretty good job of constructing his collapsing society, as dumbness leads to some unexpected drama in politics and human interaction. Herzog's science is also complex and realistic, a la the medical novels of Robin Cook and his ilk. Pick up this old novel if you'd like an enjoyable doomsday scenario that's a little deeper and creepier than the rest.

I loved it for the science and the way it was constructed, never realizing that it was a respected work that would be reprinted in the future.

It seems as if we have and continue to create the types of societies that authors with foresight have been warning us about.Not being very political, I see it happening and have always thought that I can't do anything about the way we have been duped into thinking our two party system gives us choices.&quot;Restoring the Heart of America&quot; not only discusses the problems our government has created, but offers real solutions for returning to a country of true freedom as outlined by our great forefathers. It is time to undo the damage that has been done, such as our dependency on foreign oil (or any oil, for that matter) and the way we have allowed large corporations to mold our future. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to stand behind leaders that will look out for the people, and not foreign entities and corporations with deep pockets.At first, I thought that every Iowan should read this book so we can help lead our country in changing the world. I now urge all Americans to read this book and tell their friends to read it as well. It's a book that is clear and easy to read and can do a great deal in restoring our faith that we have the ability to make changes for the good of all. My hat is off to Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Noyes for the courage to take a stand on making changes that are essential to our continued freedom and way of life."},{"Title":"Restoring the Heart of America: A Return to Government by the People","review":"Clyde Cleveland and Ed Noyes have written a detailed plan for restoring Iowa, what they call America's &quot;heartland.&quot; I was so moved by the PRINCIPLES by which these men live that I moved from Cleveland, OH to support Mr. Cleveland. I left my family and friends; I left two bands, found a new home for my dog, and left my full-time job working with the disabled to labor for the restoration of our true law. In my opinion, I have lost nothing in comparison to what the human race has to gain.These two men have a plan for Iowa, but the principles--those of our founding fathers--can change the world."},{"Title":"Restoring the Heart of America: A Return to Government by the People","review":"This book is amazing. It is written in a clear, simple, succinct manner. Clyde and Ed have really opened my eyes to the way our country is run. I knew that our government was out of the hands of the people, but I had no hope that anything could be done about it. Now I have not only learned the details of the corruptness of our power- and money-driven government, but I know that things can be changed. By adopting the principles of the Libertarian party, we can return our political structure to one that truly is of, by and for the people. We can return our earth and all its people, and our economy, to a state of health and vitality. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand why things are the way they are in this country, to anyone who wishes things could be better, to anyone interested in living a better life. After reading this book, I was delighted to go to the polls on election day and vote for all the Libertarian candidates. I only hope that our citizenry is deserving of what those candidates have to offer."},{"Title":"Restoring the Heart of America: A Return to Government by the People","review":"If you are like me, you are completely bored and frustrated with politics in our country. Our candidates flood the TV, airways &amp; press, with personal attacks and negative campaigns. I am continually amazed at how hard they work to say nothing and make it last 30 minutes. Finally, there is a breath of fresh air. Finally, we have candidates that have alot to say. So much, that it took this book to make the information available to the public. This book explains their plans for restructuring the property tax system, eliminating state income tax, generating green energy for the entire state, restoring the power of the individual and much, much more.Both authors of this book are running for office in Iowa. Clyde Cleveland is running for Governor and Ed Noyes is running for Attorney General. Regardless of the campaign tactics of the other candidates, Mr. Cleveland &amp; Mr. Noyes continue to run their campaign's using the golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Their campaigns demonstrate the respect that they have for the individual and that is something that is in short supply in our government today.Read a single chapter and you will be hooked. You won't want to put it down until you've finished it!

The book reads very well and the is a wealth of information in the Appendixes.To sum it up: Clyde and Ed have written one of them most inspiring books about the POTENTIAL of government I have ever read - I'm so glad they have shared this vision as I'm sure this book will inspire many other people!"},{"Title":"A Journey to Healing: Life After SIDs","review":"This is not your typical self-help book of how to pick up the pieces after a loss in your life; rather, what God can teach us while walking us through the grieving process. The author opens up herself, her experiences to help others have hope."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"Entertaining writing combined with years of extensive research makes THE GIRLS both fun and informative to read. Ms. McLellan has plumbed the depths of multiple sources including interviews, mauscript and letter collections, FBI and other government files, and film clips as well as published accounts to create a fascinating group biography which reveals much about the private lives of some of Hollywood's most famous screen goddesses, most notably Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, and Tallulah Bankhead. McLellan's enlightening descriptions of the complex relationships between her main figures also explains much about the inner workings and power relationships of Hollywood during this period (the 1920s, 30s, 40s and early 50s). Her well-documented account of the many lesbian and bisexual affairs of her &quot;girls&quot; may be what strikes the reader first, but even more fascinating is her picture of political intrigue behind the scenes in Hollywood. Most interesting is Dietrich's first and secret husband -- international writer, Soviet spy and Commuist organizer Otto Katz -- who operated in Europe and the United States under various aliases. (As Rudolph Breda, he founded the secretly Soviet-supported Anti-Nazi League in Hollywood in 1935.) All in all, this is a book to be snapped up not only by film buffs, but also by anyone interested in the period who enjoys a good read."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"I really enjoy reading bios of the stars of Hollywood during its golden era. \\"The Girls\\" offers a needed corrective to the male-dominated perspective taken in the usual Hollywood expose. Her focus on Dietrich, Bankhead and Garbo gives the book a continuity to really assess the impact of lesbianism in Hollywood. But the tide also brings in some fascinating silent stars, and many others including Barbara Stanwyck and Marilyn Monroe. The political insights into the HUAC hearings and the studios' fickleness on the issue of gay love makes this book an essential political history for the period. Ms. McLellan takes no prisoners as she writes the real \\"All About Eve\\"."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"I'd heard rumors of lesbian activity during the glamour days of Hollywood, but had never found anything to verify them.THE GIRLS is an exhaustive look into the world few of us will ever know.

Never a slash-&-trash book, \\"The Girls\\" rises above the usual \\"tell-all\\" gossip slinging, giving us instead a brilliantly insightful eye for the time, the places, & (a real revelation) who some of the true key players were in 20th century politics as well as theatre & film. McClellan teaches us much about how many of the most important portions of the 20th century were actually decided upon & achieved by the women & men (gentle reader: note the order) who are the main focus of this book, & the politicians, generals, statesmen & FBI/CIA heads they unfailingly enthralled. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"Now this book on stars' sexuality was definitely worth buying! I could not even put it down. Miss McLellan does a superb job in revealing the true side of many of Hollywood's top female stars. And, let me tell you, some of the pictures were unbelievable! It was great fun to read about Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Tallulah Bankhead, as well as others such as Barbara Stanwyck, Claudette Colbert and Judy Garland. This is a must for any classic film buff, and anyone interested in sociological or sexual topics. A+"},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"Interesting book, a quick read, and an interesting perspective about the evil influence of Salka Viertel on the career of Greta Garbo. Ironic that the only friend she ever trusted ruined her career (Salka Viertel). I did not like Greta Garbo's treatment of her loyal friend/lover Mercedes. Greta Garbo is depicted as a young woman who developed some strange coping mechanisms in order to survive in Hollywood. Some things that the author wrote about seem fictional or conjecture, for example, Greta stripped down to nothing in front of Georges Schlee for a fitting by his designer wife. How could the writer know such things unless she interviewed Mr or Mrs. Schlee themselves?"},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"I have been through many of the sources used for this book, and I really appreciated the way the author ties so many loose ends together, and fills in so very many gaps in the various sagas. Plus the considerable socio/political backround info through the decades. Its interesting to see just how much politics played a heavy role in these lives, one way or another; an aspect I had not considered. For example, Garbo's career being torpedoed in the end mainly by her total reliance on Schlee and Salka Viertel, who was essentially blacklisted beginning in the mid-1940s -- something you definitely won't pick up from Salka's bio!The character who comes through as paradoxically the most warm and human is Tallulah Bankhead, and who would have thought it? This could possibly happen only in comparison with the rest of these particular subjects.Its an absorbing, in-depth review of eras, attitudes, and lifestyles now totally &quot;gone with the wind&quot;."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"I really liked the subject and the ideas behind this book. It is a great group biography that has a few new things to say and presents an interesting slant on the facts we already know. But I had great difficulty with the style and presentation. The constant use of cliff-hangers that weren't really cliff hangers became annoying, as did the use of headings in the text and the journalistic suppositions that X may have slept with Y. In fact the constant catalogue of who slept with whom was a wee bit tedious to say the least. All in all I think a good editor could have made the book tighter and left out a lot of padding."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"It was a good book ,but had lots of assumptions!Sentences starting \\"almost certainly\\", and such as that.The biggest assumption was that because Marlene Dietrich and Garbo,were maybe in the same movie,that,\\"almost certainly\\",Dietrich had an affair with Garbo,that made Garbo the wack job she was the rest of her life!"},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"excellent, informative book that would never have been published during the time the actual events occured"},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"One of the questions you ask after reading this was, who wasn't gay? The whole thing was close to shocking because I had no idea that life was so free and easy in the 20's, 30's and 40's. The book did keep me interested. I wondered about some of the facts which I'm sure no one will ever know the absolute truth about."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"Sure, I had fun reading this book. But the Amazon reviewer who termed it \\"highly speculative\\" is understating the case. Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation. And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting. She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them \\"my girls,\\" for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader. Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant? You bet. But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here? I don't think so."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN...at times humorous and ironic, at other times quite sad (reflecting on the sacrifices these high-profile women were forced to make for their times).

Otherwise this book is well written, entertaining and informative."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"\`\\"I'm of course aware that some believe that Herta von Walther played the Dietrich role in the Garbo film Die freudlose Gasse, \\"The Joyless Street\\",' so writes Diana McLellan.Despite the author's claim that Marlene was in Pabst 's \\"The Joyless Street,\\" there is absolutely no evidence that any actress other than Herta von Walther played the part of the woman in the butcher line.McLellan certainly has no proof that Marlene played the part. Therefore any thing she says about her in that role is opinionated speculations.There is, however, much evidence that Herta von Walther was in that role.Marlene and Herta did appear together in one film in 1923, Trag&ouml;die der Liebe.There is no evidence that Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich ever appeared in any films together.The fact is that Herta made four films with the director of The Joyless street between the years 1925 and 1928. The four are Joyless Street, Secrets of a Soul, Love of Jeanne Ney, Abwege.There is no record of director Georg Wilhelm Pabst having ever made any films with Marlene Dietrich."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"This book should find a wide, appreciative audience. It captivates with the three beautiful women gracing the jacket, and sweeps the reader along with a stream of gossipy news. Everyone seems to have a mention, from the major players, (The Girls of the title) to fascinating parentheticals (Nancy Reagan). Film buffs will enjoy the exploration of a long suppressed area of Hollywood history, finding endless anecdotes of film-society life, a who-was-who of lesbian Hollywood. Love-matches are made, vows are broken, dirt is dished, Dietrich betrays Garbo's intimate secrets, and we are party to it all. Diana McLellan weaves a fascinating tapestry, that entertains and informs. She does far more, however, by probing the motives of women caught in the gears as American society turned down a prudish path, dragging Hollywood moguls along. If it's hard for lesbian and gay performers to be out in 2000, how must it have been in 1920? McLellan had a difficult task in unearthing deeply buried secrets, but she makes a compelling case that her deductions are correct. Of particular interest is her questioning the claim, made by both Dietrich and Garbo that they had never met, until formally introduced in Hollywood. Stuff and nonsense, says McLellan. Her evidence that the two women not only met, but were lovers, is central to the book's theme. (One would wish the Fatty Arbuckle scandal had been treated with more skepticism, but that's a quibble on my part.) This book is better than a night at most movies!"},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"I've never been a fan of biographies or gossip, biographies often seem too wooden and gossip too unreliable and salacious. But I read this book from cover to cover. Not only has Diana McLellan crafted a credible and well-researched account of the 'intimate' female community in Hollywood during the golden days of cinema, she has the brought the encouragingly entertaining, colourful and often hilarious lives of women such as Tallulah Bankhead so to life that the era has interested me like never before. The author has a wonderful sense of humour, often letting our heroines' own words and situations speak for themselves. She says in the introduction that the book grew not so much from what was right infront of her, as it did from that which was absent. A lie is always told to hide the truth, making it an excellent departure point for investigation. The web of lies that covered the contents of this book is fascinating, and McLellan's talent lies in the way she has managed to weave the public front: the 1930's Hollywood we remember from films and fan magazines; the notorious and infamous underground lesbian culture that was obviously evident if you knew the right people; and the intimately secret, private lives of the world's most famous women, hidden from not only the public, but even their friends and lovers.I think that this book succeeds, not simply because of the revelatory nature of much of the material: the alleged affair Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo had together in Berlin prior to their Hollywood careers; Dietrich's marriage to Otto Katz, communist and spy during World War II; the other roles Dietrich played during the war besides those of 'morale-builder' and entertainer, but because of the way McLellan has captured the zietgeist of the era. This book is not merely an expose, it is also a social history of lesbianism from 1900-1950, a detailed account of the Hollywood Star System and the advent of talkies. (it certainly made me appreciate 'Singin' in the Rain' all over again!). It also spans far beyond Hollywood, incorporating the bohemian and cultured worlds of Paris and New York and their fascinating figures. It captures the public and private worlds of, literally, a cast of characters in a way that is realistic and endearing. I imagined a film being made from this book as I read it, that's how believable, alive and intimate McLellan's narration is.I have to admit that the picture McLellan paints of Garbo is really depressing: that of a bitter, indifferent woman who ruined her life by keeping her 'cells' entirely seperate.. a star who was infinitely lonely, her career dying, because she trusted no one. I must also say that while I loved McLellan's wonderful humour, her witty quips, her wonderful sense of brevity... I tired of the ominously leading comments (cue the forboding theme music): 'this event would have a significant effect on upon the rest of her life'... 'a friendship which would, in fact, trigger the end of her career in 10 years time.' 'Marlene, of course, had other things to worry about...' and so on and so forth. I understand that such comments are neccesary, and I admit that they're probably one of the things that kept me reading, but for me they revealed the presense of the person behind the scenes pulling the puppet strings. I just wanted to get lost in the story, absorbed in the lives of these fascinating individuals, not made aware of the subjective nature of the narrative I was reading, and the ways in which my views and reactions could be shaped by the author. That said, it was a wonderful book, 1 part romance, 3 parts mystery, 2 parts tragedy, marvelous fun, wonderful entertainment, enlightening, educational, intelligent... So many beautiful women... and so little time."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"The Girls provides quite a different look at the Hollywood environment of the 1920s to the 1940s as Diana McLellan examines the lives of lesbian and bisexual actresses of the times, analyzing relationships, power plays, and politics alike. The Girls provides a lively, fun chronicle of affairs and scandals and is a recommended pick for any fan of Hollywood intrigue and culture."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"I must admit that I could hardly put this book down. It was dishy, with everyone hopping into bed with everyone else in the space of a few pages. However I didn't take one iota of it seriously. Basing a large portion of the book on a supposition (that Dietrich is in Joyless Street, that she had Garbo had an affair) is it's one major weak point. Also, the fact that the author uses Hollywood Babylon as a source for several &quot;facts&quot; in her book seriously compromises its credibility. As one reviewer already stated, the facts of the Arbuckle scandal (taken from that rag Hollywood Babylon) was covered in less than one paragraph with no questioning from the author. I guess that after questioning the lives of Dietrich and Garbo for so many pages, she didn't have any time to investigate the Arbuckle case and try to find some new &quot;facts.&quot; A piece of advice to ALL authors on old Hollywood: do NOT use Kenneth Anger's book - based totally on gossip, you need to sift through a mountain of garbage to find one tiny grain of truth. It is not that much more difficult to bypass it and find more reliable sources."},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"Dear Mr. Polt,Thanks for your good note. I'm of course aware that some believe that Herta von Walther played the Dietrich role in the Garbo film Die freudlose Gasse, &quot;The Joyless Street&quot;. The two women looked vaguely similar - although von Walther's features were coarser, her eyes a little closer together. They were probably friends as well as colleagues. (As you know, von Walther was considered by Josef von Sternberg for the juicy role of Lola-Lola in 1930's &quot;Blue Angel&quot;, before it went so gloriously to Dietrich, and changed her life.) My theory is that Marlene asked Herta to lie for her when she promised to pipe down about being in &quot;The Joyless Street&quot; with Garbo, and that Herta agreed. (I go into the reasons at length in &quot;The Girls&quot;.) No wonder she &quot;laughed&quot; when she was identified as Dietrich! Despite her vow, Dietrich, when cornered, occasionally conceded that she was &quot;an extra standing in line&quot; in &quot;The Joyless Street&quot;. Only one figure in that line could conceivably be Dietrich - the one who catches the fainting Garbo in her arms. If one compares the close-up I show of the black-haired Marlene (with her widely spaced eyes!) in &quot;Street&quot; with certain shots made later (without von Sternberg's face-modelling lighting) it's very clear that it was she, not von Walther, in that role. She actually told her late-life friend and biographer David Bret, who knew from her Berlin friends that she had been in &quot;The Joyless Street&quot;, &quot;Yes, and in the end I killed the butcher...&quot; To know about that ax-murder - so horrible that it was completely slashed by the censors - she had to be there. I too have seen that film program, by the way. I believe it was printed to accompany a later re-release of the film. Again, thank you for your communication. Sorry to bore the reader who doesn't want to know all this! All good wishes, Diana McLellan"},{"Title":"The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood","review":"Homosexual activity in Old Hollywood was wrapped in such a thick shroud of secrecy, it's doubtful there will ever be a \\"definitive\\" book on the subject. The reviewers who criticize this book as being too speculative miss the point that, with so little provable fact to work with, any book on the subject winds up being speculative. (Even interviewing surviving family and friends doesn't guarantee the researcher will avoid opinions, lies and personal agendas.)Since there are so many holes chroniclers must fill in, the books end up being more of a Rorschach test of the authors than an objective presentation of the history. (And in reading the reviews here, I'd hazard the opinion that it becomes a Rorschach of the READERS, too!)Here's my personal Rorschach:I couldn't disagree more with the comment that McLellan's tone was off-putting. Her tone was precisely what I liked best about this---yes---speculative romp. (The term \\"my girls\\" is patronizing? Funny, I felt the author's distinctive *affection* for her subjects with that phrase.)I have read far too many Old Hollywood biographies written by disapproving authors. In these books, lesbianism was presented as a seedy, shamefaced, sideline activity which resulted from either inebriation or narcissistic hedonism.However, McLellan dares to create a tone of celebration when talking of her subjects and their attraction to each other. Yes, these women were catty and manipulative and their affairs were short-lived and often shallow. However, throughout the book, McLellan creates the feeling that these women were capable of genuinely loving life and each other between melodramas. Wow. Women-loving-women being portrayed as actually being FUN? How radical is that? (wink)Take the book with a grain of salt, (like all other books on the subject, even William J.

The author tries to loop their many stories together based on a claim that Dietrich and Garbo had an affair in Germany before they went to Hollywood; and that later their mutual lovers schemed to keep control of the relationship. She also introduces a subplot that a Soviet propagandist (Otto Katz) was pulling the strings on Dietrich. Many of these claims are documented with statements like, &quot;must have,&quot; or &quot;could have.&quot; I suppose it's possible, but good substantial reasons are never stated. For example, the author claims Garbo denied knowing Dietrich-because McClellen speculates the affair ended bitterly. The stories about Katz are inconsistent-sometimes he has trouble entering the country because he's a dangerous alien, the next he's tooling around New York. If he was blackmailing Dietrich, to what end? That is never stated. The author claims that Dietrich got out of suspicions of being a communist by working with Hoover. The evidence?-many FBI documents are missing or the redacted document have blanks where the words blacked out are just long enough to have contained a line indicating that Marlene was talking about Hoover. I guess this could all be true-but the notes don't provide much support. Most of the principles are dead now-and can't deny or clarify any of it.

Is it written somewhere that you have to own land before selling it?\\"Bosco Popejoy is the smart one in his family. He's got a good job over the Idaho border in Washington State delivering pizza on weekends and during the week he delivers firewood for his daddy. He's been learning new vocabulary from his \\"word a day\\" calendar and he's got the seed of an idea that's going to bring in some big money, if not a little time in \\"the pokey\\" if he's not real careful.These days the TV news programs are consumed with an extortion story. Someone has blackmailed the walnut farmers out of a lot of cash by releasing a controlled amount of the Indonesian Stimite worm into a local crop thus threatening to ruin the entire industry. Perhaps the success of this scam is making Bosco a little bolder regarding his own get rich scheme. No matter, it's when he meets up and gets reacquainted with his high school crush Gwen Tipp that \\"Operation Gordon Surprise\\" gets solidified.Gwen works as a flag girl for InterGlobal, a government contractor that is currently realigning a stretch of road in front of the Popejoy property, which Bosco's daddy is none to happy about. Gwen's own personal history includes an embezzlement charge from when she misplaced some bank deposits while working at Buster's Large Appliance. She's just completed 100 hours of community service, is paying restitution through garnished wages and is monitored by a malevolent probation officer. So even though Gwen starts off by saying that she wants to keep her distance from this scam, she's attracted to criminality and to what she calls Bosco's \\"dangerous aura.\\" Besides, she's a natural con and between the two, is the one who puts the details together for this inventive real estate swindle.About Bosco's aura, the only danger emanating from him is his own lack of worldliness in a town where everyone seems to have a shady deal going, especially his own daddy. To get to his pizza delivery job or to deliver cord wood, he drives through a manned US Border Patrol station that shares space with an Agriculture Inspection station. His daddy knows that locals are flagged by on their daily commute and takes advantage of this by placing containers of contraband in Bosco's old postal wagon (that he proudly refers to as his Jeep) or the twenty year old Ford 600 he uses for firewood delivery. Bosco doesn't even think to question any of this illicit activity, he just knows it as part of his daily routine. Gwen's the one that's curious about the people who seem to be tinkering around Bosco's vehicles whenever they are parked for any length of time. But as \\"Operation Gordon Surprise\\" gains momentum, Gwen is pleasantly surprised to learn that her own family has a depth of criminality.At any rate, this novel will have you chuckling as you anticipate the outcome. Every one of the characters in this novel has some quirky habit that's hard to forget. C. Mike Reid succeeds in juggling the plot between the real land owners, the would-be marks, and all of the supporting events that in one way or another help this haphazard scam come to fruition.Tangled in this and supporting the causality of the outcome is the daily lives of the poor Popejoy family, Gwen's fellow road crew, Gwen's aunt and roommate, and dozen other no opts. Throughout this novel is an overriding desire to find a way to get more than one's current share. As Bosco says when he and Gwen are thinking about the money, that he just wants to further his social education, gain a little experience, like \\"tour a cigar factory, learn to ski jump, use an ATM, rent a tuxedo... I've never flown in a plane, rode on a train -- shoot, I don't even know how to go about hailing a taxicab. I see these things on TV and it makes me want to join in.\\"One reason that I like to read novels is the chance to peek into how people might live in other parts of the country or world. The Popejoys of Pistolburg genuinely meets Reid's intention to \\"present people living through plausible situations for the enjoyment of the the good-humored reader.\\" In fact, he fulfills a shameless curiosity entertaining us with this ignoble cast of characters."},{"Title":"Bouncing Back : I've Survived Everything...and I Mean Everything...and You Can Too!","review":"I am still surprised by how many idiots there are out there who confuse courage and guts with meanness! The narrow minded, tight bunned portion of the public, who enjoy their martyrdom, will get nothing out of this book because of all many prejudices they have already gleaned about Joan from the supermarket tabloids!As for me, this book came along just when I needed it! Joan flies in the face of convention - and encourages the reader to survive - no matter what you have to do! She asks you to ponder questions like, \\"what do you really WANT to do now?\\", and then encourages you to indulge yourself - but only so far. Then you are required to pick yourself up and take the next step! Some of it I have heard before, but only Joan told me it was OK to \\"do it my way\\". I devoured the book in one day - and felt an instant relief.In the last year I have faced the death of a close family member, a destructive divorce (my second), car reposession, instant poverty (OK - so what do I DO with a food stamp?) forced head-of-household status with an 8 and a 3 year old. I was diagnosis with TWO incurable, crippling diseases, had to move 1600 miles from everything I have ever known, lost all my worldy possessions, had a business failure, lost my self esteem and the will to live!! This book is the only thing that has reached me at all! I am not seeing stars and smelling roses yet, but I am out of bed and moving - Joan says \\"keep moving\\" no matter what! She also says, get up every day, dress, put on your makeup, and be ready for your life, just in case today is the day it starts again! She makes the unconvential OK - and encourages you to live a personalized life - DO IT YOUR WAY, AND GET TO IT! But don't do it without this book!"},{"Title":"Bouncing Back : I've Survived Everything...and I Mean Everything...and You Can Too!","review":"I was stunned to read all the negative reviews others have posted regarding this book! I found it one of the most inspiring things I have come across in a long time. I actually have the audio version of this book, which might make quite a difference. I try and listen to it at least once a week. To hear Joan's familiar and unimitable voice recount her tragedies and how she fought her way back to happiness give &quot;Bouncing Back&quot; a much more personal touch. I will be the first to admit that most of the psychological advice is standardized info that could be obatined in any of thousands of other self-help books. But to listen to Joan's unique voice and hear her apply these psychological theories to her own experiences makes what otherwise be just another self-help book a truly uplifting journey. THANKS JOAN!"},{"Title":"Bouncing Back : I've Survived Everything...and I Mean Everything...and You Can Too!","review":"I can't believe that those who are putting down this book have gone through much of a crisis in their lives. Having gone through the fire myself with losing a father, nephew, and son in addition to illnesses and financial troubles, I found this book to be very inspirational. This may be because Joan was echoing what I have come to believe on my own, but sharing it with the world takes a huge amount of courage. I never cared much about her as a comedienne but a person's work does not necessarily reflect who they are inside. I felt very sorry for her when her husband committed suicide and, at the time, I remember wondering if she was just going to shrink into herself and go off on her own to lick her wounds. Well, she didn't and I say, bravo, Joan! Edgar is gone but you and Melissa are still here and to keep plugging away at life takes strength. I have had so many people ask me how I go on and say they couldn't do it. Well, you have two choices: you either give up or you go on. We are big on humor in our family and a bit of black humor does come out now and then. I am just very careful as to who I allow to hear it. You need to separate Joan from her work to get what she is saying in this book. And, if you can do so, and if you can learn from it, you will go on and you will be stronger. Those who nitpick specifics like decorating your house and all will be well are totally missing the point. What she is saying is to find what makes you feel better and get up off your bum and do it. Don't sit and wallow in self-pity and pain. Believe me, when a loved one is no longer there in your life, just vegetating can be SO attractive. It takes a huge amount of strength just to get out of bed in the morning. Who says we aren't supposed to laugh after someone dies? My son loved to laugh and to not do so would be to dishonor his memory. I know he is out there laughing with us just as Joan's Edgar is applauding her efforts to get on with her life."},{"Title":"Bouncing Back : I've Survived Everything...and I Mean Everything...and You Can Too!","review":"The audio book version of \\"Bouncing Back\\" is WONDERFUL!

She explains her own life's problems - very significant difficulties from near bankruptcy, professional pariah-hood to the suicide of her husband of nearly 30 years and bulimia.Some may not like the occasionally flippant tone which is Rivers' hallmark but there's no doubt in my mind of her sincerity, depth of determination and that she grew through the horrible suffering she felt at the suicide of her husband. She describes some very personal difficulties with style and candor.She does not advocate the currently fashionable &quot;society of victimhood&quot; and cites as one example a woman who witnessed the tragic shootings at Kent State in 1970. This woman's view in 1995: &quot;my life stopped&quot; - Joan's view: &quot;Get over it - that was 25 years ago! How can your life stop?&quot; Sounds flippant but if you read the book you'll see that becoming a self-pitying zombie helps no one and there is ALWAYS someone worse off than you.Excellent book, uplifting, interesting and unpretentious (Joan mentions she doesn't have a PhD she has an IBTIA [I've been through it all]).I highly recommend it even if you aren't going through a crisis - it will help you understand someone who is."},{"Title":"Bouncing Back : I've Survived Everything...and I Mean Everything...and You Can Too!","review":"Joan has some helpful advice on how to overcome obstacles in life.

I have read every book she's written and can not get enough. This book surprised me because it's not her usual. Not that there is anything \\"usual\\" about her. This book dealt with grief and since I became a widow in 2006 I have read a great many books trying to cope and understand how I can get through my tremendous grief. With my kindle I started highlighting the phrases I found helpful until I realized I was highlighting every page.

From the outside looking in you would think that it has been a charmed life for this woman who is not afraid to share her most intimate flaws for a quick laugh.In Rivers' book Bouncing Back: I've Survived Everything... and I Mean Everything...and You Can too! she shares her story and many of others who have hit rock bottom but have clawed back to the top.Rivers has had some low, lows, from losing her show, being blackballed from being on television, losing her husband to suicide, and at one point being thirty six million dollars in debt.This remarkable woman shed more than a few tears but she overcame her haters. She was not afraid to ask for help and forge forward. Not your normal motivational book, she shares words of wisdom like: Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, Today is a gift. That's why it's called the present. So she takes life by the balls and starts the day as a gift.She has two pieces of favorite jewelry, one is a small turtle. It reminds her that in order to walk forward the turtle needs to stick its neck out. The other is a bumblebee, according to science, the bumblebee is not supposed to fly, it is too big, not aerodynamically designed and awkward in movement. However the bumblebee does not know that so it flies.So take a page from Joan Rivers and laugh instead of a good cry, things are not as bad as they seem and she says it best, \\"whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

It is comprised primarily of plastic pages that hold 2x2 coin folders into which the coins must be inserted before mounting.

While these are commonly used by coin collectors the beginning collector, who is among the most likely to buy this product, will not likely have them and will be unable to use the album until they are acquired at an additional cost. Not very thoughtful if purchased as a gift!

Figure 6.1 Defined Ordered Sets for Frame delimiters on page 95 is incorrect and violates the Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) revision 4.3. The figures are sloppily drawn.

When we meet protagonist Jim Hutchins he is 50, lugging a shotgun from his trailer, preparing to kill his brother-in-law Emory, his &quot;sworn enemy,&quot; (a phrase we later learn is wryly borrowed from his tormented eldest son) and ruminating how things got to this pass.&quot;Life makes you eat the thorns. Smell the roses if you can, but don't forget, you're going to eat the thorns. Course I ain't so smart. If I were smart, I'd have hunted up a pistol, then my elbow wouldn't hurt so.&quot;Born and bred in Penacook County, NH, Hutchins quit school in the eighth grade, married his sweetheart, Pauline, and had four children. Three of them seem to be making worse messes of their lives than their parents and the fourth, the youngest, their shining hope, Elizabeth, died two years before at age 11 in an inexplicable drowning accident which has fragmented the family.Bereft of hope, communication among them breaks down and each falls prey to his or her core weakness. Slow, steady Gregory, the oldest, becomes consumed by the voices in his head and the oddly prescient voices coming over his radio. Lisa escapes her abusive marriage after three children only to succumb to drugs and alcohol and prostitution. Tommy, the smartest, seems bent on drinking himself to destruction. Pauline clings mightily to each of her children, blaming others for their troubles.Jim's grief is internal and inarticulate. Helplessly he watches Pauline turn to Emory for comfort and for money when she's spent all that they have and owe to buy her children out of the holes they've dug themselves. Dunned for back taxes by the IRS and the town, he seems unable to act, except to keep things from falling completely apart. It's Jim who fetches Lisa from her feckless, mean husband (&quot;He claims Fesmire for a name, though I ain't uncertain that a while back in his family a turnip got over the fence&quot;), Jim who keeps Tommy from dropping his hard-mouthed girlfriend out a second-story window, and Jim who takes the gun away from Gregory. But he is limited to reactions and when it comes to Pauline he's helpless.While Jim's is the main voice, Drown allows each of the Hutchinses to speak. Characters who might otherwise seem people only a parent could love come into their own with humor and passion. Tommy hides his regrets under a breathless, edgy sass and more hell-bent energy than is healthy. Gregory works things out with a meticulous if loony and increasingly frightening earnestness. Lisa, the least comprehensible and least sympathetic, combines self-loathing with bitterness and bursts of rough independence and Pauline's grief and yearning for beauty infuse her every deed.Violence lurks at the edges. Suplots include a panty thief and Emory's real estate maneuvering, impotence and police suspicions of having murdered his wife (Jim's sister).Told in the present tense, the story unfurls the convoluted past while hurtling headlong into a ragged future. Despite their bleak, strapped lives, each character's voice is alive with wry humor and yearning. Drown's earthy, graceful, hilarious prose explores love and marriage, friendship, the power of money and poverty, middle-aged regret and other baggage of life. As funny as it is poignant, with an explosive climax that supplies symmetry, hope and a last laugh too, &quot;The Suburbs of Heaven,&quot; is as fine a piece of literature as it is a provocative story."},{"Title":"The Suburbs of Heaven","review":"To call the circumstances described in this book as &quot;charming,&quot; as several reviewers have done, is patronizing. These characters all have major problems of their own making, they blame everyone and everything but themselves, and they all seem to think that sex or guns will solve whatever problem arises. A woman who buys &quot;catting around&quot; clothes for her adult, married son, then dances nude for her brother-in-law to get back some of the money (needed so that the trailer will not be repossessed for back taxes) is not charming, she's foolish. Another &quot;adult&quot; woman has three children in three years, endures physical abuse, and then turns to prostitution and drugs to support her alcohol habit, is sick and needs help, not a dose of charm. A man who hears snakes in his head and then buys a gun to use against his &quot;sworn enemies&quot; is terrifying, not charming or an example of &quot;black humor,&quot; another term used here. This book is like a printed transcript of the Jerry Springer Show."},{"Title":"The Suburbs of Heaven","review":"Speak of a dysfunctional family. Wow! Meet Jim and Pauline Hutchins and their children, nephews and assorted other relatives. They find trouble where was none before.

All this gets to the point where, unfortunately, it becomes very funny.

The story of the day to day misery of the Hutchins family, as life's troubles bear down on them, should make you want to put the book down and say &quot;forget it, enough already&quot;. But this book is written with such insight, humor and hope that you'll keep turning pages to the end. The novel is told from the different viewpoints of the five Hutchins family members. Each adds his or her feelings of past and current events, moving the story foward to its climactic ending. The real strength of this book is the amazing character development and eloquent writing.

Having first-hand experience at being down-and-out, I can say that Drown appears to really get it. The Hutchins' are good folks who can't seem to get a break. Worse, most of the people around them don't offer any breaks. Yet they manage to laugh (occassionally anyway) through it. So, even if Drown doesn't &quot;get it,&quot; he does a great job of faking it. And isn't that what its all about?"},{"Title":"The Suburbs of Heaven","review":"I can understand those who shrink from the unpleasant aspects of this novel's characters and their lives.So what.I think two things made this novel one of the most delightful I've read:1.

Brazen selfishness liberally poured over a dose of banal stupidity contrasts rather nicely with the pointless selflessness.

One can hardly believe their ignorance can continue to progress, and the innocent prayer that some savior will rush out to change the course of impending doom is frankly the only reason I kept up with the book!!If you want to read more than a train wreck, read this."},{"Title":"Going to School in India","review":"This is a colorful and provocative book for classroom use. Although written for an elementary aged student, I used it in a high school Global Studies class and each page provides opportunities for thoughtful inquiry and discussion. Students used this book to teach younger students about education, India, and a world view that they might not have gotten otherwise. It is not a book designed to be a complete overview of Indian education, but rather a stimulus to thought. The rich and colorful layout appealed to my students and made it a page-turner, not a\\"coffee-table\\" book at all."},{"Title":"Going to School in India","review":"I run a preschool and have 4 and 11 year old kids, and this wonderful nonfiction book is perfect for them. The details about the lives of children in school in India are beautifully depicted, and the entire book has the feel of glimpsing school life through the senses of children. I just got it as a gift and have spent half an hour reading it instead of working!"},{"Title":"Going to School in India","review":"This book has wonderful information about a variety of schools in India that will make any child or adult excited to flip through the pages, the extension pullout pages, and look at photos of real children sitting in a bus for their school classroom, or riding exciting Tuk-Tuk rickshaws to class! Bright colors attract students to the book, and make for an excellent learning experience and many teaching moments in a variety of subjects. A fantastic addition to any globally-aware classroom!"},{"Title":"Going to School in India","review":"Title: Going to School in IndiaAuthor: Lisa HeydlauffPublisher: Chafrlesbridge (www.charlesbridge.com)Review by: Diana Rohini LaVigne, Indian Life & StyleGraphic designer and illustrator B.M. Kamath and photographer Nitin Upadhye along with writer Lisa Heydlauff have created one of what I would say is one of the best children's books to introduce a snapshot of daily life in India. It's cleverly crafted so the young readers will have new things to notice with each read-through and adults will love reading with their children as well. The visuals are strong and diverse and each spread delivers a different look and feel but every page invites exploration.The text is a brave delivery of some of the harsh realities that Indian children endure but also offers plenty of extremely inspirational tidbits too. The incredible attention to detail like the graphics for page numbering shows how much thought went into each and every element in this cultural-rich book.With a portion of each book purchased going towards the Global Fund for Children charity, this book isn't just a wonderful book but a good way to spend money that gives back to the community that needs it most. The book is a powerful addition to any child's bookshelf regardless if they are Indian or not. Trying to bridge the gap between cultures, \`Going to School in India' is an important contribution to children's literature."},{"Title":"Going to School in India","review":"Lisa Heydlauff is brilliant and this book is innovative, inspiring and truly ground breaking in India. I highly recommend it to anyone who believes that young people are the solution to our challenges..."},{"Title":"Going to School in India","review":"This is an absolutely glorious book - a feast for your eyes - and stories that will make you cry. It's wonderful for all ages - and can be read over and over again. It paints a wonderful tale of India - a unique viewpoint that shows all the magic, festivity, hope and celebration in a place we often read or hear about (as outsiders) as being chaotic, poor and dirty. We see and read about children traveling through mud deserts, riding on bikes by the sea, swinging between crevices in the mountains in Ladakh, and learning on the train station platforms in Bombay. We see people at their best, and the young human spirit that craves to learn, to consume and digest information - no matter where they live, or how little they have. This is a must-own for every child ands school in the US, and beyond. An absolute delight!Visit the authors website: [...] to learn more."},{"Title":"Going to School in India","review":"My daughter and I love reading this book! It's great to see real life photos of so many children from different regions in India. The illustrations are witty and compleement the stories well. My 5 years old was immediately drawn to it, especially to the kids braving the rivers, climbing the steep mountains, or drivinng for miles in the desert on a bicycle just to get to school. We learned so much (yet so easily) about the local foods, traditions, games, clothes and modes of transportation. You get to see the daily struggles children have to face, and you can't help admiring their determination and creativity in overcomming them.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested to learn about the kids' life, and point of view, in India. This is great research material for preschool and elementary classrooms."},{"Title":"Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and Evaluations (Bk.2)","review":"Collected as a self-conscious extension of the 1988 work edited by Byrne and Whiten, \\"Machiavellian Intelligence: Social Expertise and the Evolution of Intellect in Monkeys, Apes, and Humans,\\" this volume contains 14 articles. In spite of the explosion of empirical research sparked by the 1988 volume, this collection does not emphasize a review of this new work. Instead, one is left with the impression that this collection is heavily weighted toward theory and speculation.My evaluation of this collection is that it contains less extension and more refinement of the 1988 presentation. The contributions in this volume tend to limit the grosser conclusions of the earlier work while refining the Machiavellian intelligence concept more precisely.Only a few of the articles warrant specific note, in my opinion. I found Hauser's article on deception to be of value, especially in its careful distinction between functional and intentional deception. Whiten's review of theory of mind research holds promise for anyone interested in that subject. The three empirical articles, Russon's on exploiting expertise, Menzel's on foraging, and Barton and Dunbar on encephalization quotients, also make significant contributions.New theoretical speculations regarding evolutionary triggers include brain modularity, technical expertise, sexual competition, and language left me wishing for more data and less speculation. Only the Boehm chapter on egalitarian behavior and intelligence seemed to warrant a second reading.My advice is to skip this book and go straight to Sternberg and Kaufman's collection \\"The Evolution of Human Intelligence\\" (2001) or Corballis and Lea's \\"The Descent of Mind\\" (1999)."},{"Title":"Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and Evaluations (Bk.2)","review":"This is a jaw dropping collection of papers on a topic that still deserves much more attention. Anthropology, indeed all rock music (\\"War what is it good for?\\") has yet to embrace our inner Niccolo (and let go of our awkward and self laudatory noble savage). Most of these papers are fresh, incisive and exceedingly well written. I'm in the process of rereading Geoffrey Miller's piece (chapter 12) which addresses the evolution of randomness (why butterflies don't fly straight or predictably) in order to avoid predation or murder. It has implications for everyone who feels they've really gotten to know someone...and sprinkles our hubris with humility. Skin tingling, I wanted to read other reviewers opinions of this book only to find a disturbing lack thereof. It is a shame the book is so poorly distributed and available at such a ridiculous expense (precisely why I don't have a copy of its predecessor). It certainly is the reason for the very insider comments by another reviewer. Perhaps he was so close to the subject it became difficult to see what a layman might experience. Hopefully this topic will one day reach the mainstream. Five stars.

If you have bought this book, and are waiting for this book to come to prepare, you are one of the most stupidest people in the world. But, if you have, not to worry. I read this book, and this book talks about \\"stuff\\" that you can use for learning Java.There is a chapter on sorting, which is very helpful because it does not use C++ to fully explain it. It shows diagrams that make sense. You can also learn about programming analysis, and how to write programs, and stuff like that.

My teacher did NOT know any of AB material. I learned most of the A material and all of the AB material from this book. If you need to LEARN (and not just review), this is the best you can get. Remember, for many algorithms, you don't need to know the code, but you DO need to understand the concepts behind them. This book does just that. My only complaint is with the Microbiology Case Study (FISH), which you didn't get code for. A definite highlight was the .h files of a linked-list implementation of the apqueue and apstack classes. I also used the Maria Litvin review book.I recommend using this book to learn the material (if you don't already know it) first, then using the Litvin book to review the material, using this book's practice exams, and then doing the Litvin book's practice exams. The practice tests in this book were about as hard as the AP exam for me.I give my highest recommendation for this outstanding review book."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the AP Computer Science","review":"Roselyn Teukolsky has put together an excellent source of review materials for the AP Computer Science Exam. Her book is organized into the major topics covered by both the A and AB exams, including the Marine Biology Case Study, contains an excellent summary of the concepts within each topic as well as numerous review questions on each topic.She seems to have a knack of identifying problem areas within each topic that are often the source of misconceptions. I was especially impressed with the job she did in creating a concise overview of the key concepts contained in the Marine Biology Case Study. It helps students to get the &quot;big picture&quot;.The questions on each review topic, as well as the questions on the two complete Computer Science A practice exams and the two Computer Science AB practice exams are comparable to the questions on the recently released 1999 AP Exam.My students have commented favorably on the topic reviews, as well as on the explanations provided with the answer key. Not having to go over all the answers in class has also saved me valuable review time.I would definitely recommend this review book to any teacher looking to provide a thorough review for their students, and also to any student looking for a book to help them review on their own."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the AP Computer Science","review":"This is the ONLY book you'll ever need to prepare for the AP Computer Science A Exam. I don't know about the AB Exam, but for the A Exam, this is ALL you'll need. I took the A Exam this past May and attribute my score of 5 to this book.The book provides a detailed and descriptive review of all the A Exam topics that you'll need to know. The Book is strong in all topics including the Case Study except for the chapter on Sorting and Searching. That topic will require further study to master, as it is the hardest topic on the exam (at least for most people.) However, all other topics are covered very well and in great detail. You'll know all the details for the A Exam. The practice questions and practice exams are also great. I studied them over and over until I could answer every question correctly. The questions are harder than the actual exam, so when you get to exam day, the test will feel so easy to you.This book, plenty of hard work in April, and detailed study of the Case Study PDF file and source code will bring you an easy 5 on the A Exam!"},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the AP Computer Science","review":"This was a great review for the AP test.

So, during the week we had to study, I bought this book and spent about two to three hours a day going through it. Had I not gotten this book I probably would have scored a 1 or 2 on the exam. Instead, I was really suprised when I got the score in the mail and I got a 4. This book covers everything you need in a clear succint manner. I fully reccomend this book to anyone who wants to score a 4 or 5 on the AP."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the AP Computer Science","review":"I, myself, was an AP Computer Science student of Mrs. Teukolsky's when this book was first released, and as a result I have undoubtedly had the pleasure of using it to review for my end-of-the-year exam. Let me begin by saying that Roselyn Teukolsky is a great teacher. All year long we worked real hard to understand the materials necessary to pass the course. In the end it all paid off, and I personally received a 5 on the exam.The book is organized in such a way as to provide even the most amateur programmer with a healthy overview of all the course materials, both for the A and AB exams. It stays straight to the point, and sometimes diverges into explaining interesting Computer Science facts for the enlightenment of the reader. Also, in the end are 4 well constructed practice exams, 2 for A and 2 for AB. The net result is that you will feel more confident about yourself, and will undoubtedly improve your chances of getting a 5 on the exam.There is no doubt in my mind that if it hadn't been for Mrs. Teukolsky's excellent teaching skills, and this insightful book, I would not have learned programming as well I did. The truth is, the year I started AP CS was my first year programming, so in some ways I've advanced quite far in a short period of time.

For example, the book covers in-depth different topics that are given on the exam.However, the book has some shortcomings. The first one being that the book doesn't explain anything in-depth. The chapter on Big-O notation explains what Big-O is, and devotes one or two sentences on how to find the run-time of an algorithm. In some places, the author will just say that a certain algorithm (for example, selecting the first element in an array) has a run-time of O(1). Then, in the chapter about binary search trees, the author will just say that in the worst case, searching for an element is O(n log n), without telling you how she got to that conclusion.The multiple-choice quiz that follows each chapter tests you on the knowledge of the information presented. Each choice has small syntatic differences, and the questions reflect what will be on the test.I must also say that no other book covers more closely the Marine-Biology case study."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the AP Computer Science","review":"good review of ap computer science course, but only has 2 practice tests for A and AB test each, so its 4 really, but only two for each course...also one thing it is missing that other books have and something that i can not believe they omitted is how the test is scored. they never mention a grading scale and tell you nothing on how its really graded...so when you take the practice test, you have no idea how well you did, it just has answers and thats it. i say that is very poor for a prep book to not tell you how well you might do on the real test. i would say the book is ok, but its completely unbelievable that they would forget adding this in"},{"Title":"Admin911: SMS","review":"I do not consider myself to be an expert Systems Administrator, however, I do operate extremely competently at an intermediate level.

Known by several different aliases, he would cruise major hotels and tourist areas looking for tourists to ingratiate himself with, then drug and rob them. Eventually he began to kill his victims, even burning some of them to death, moving from country to country using stolen passports, his blatant and arrogant attitude seemed to know no bounds. It required police detectives from many cities and embassies to merge their efforts to catch him and even acknowledge that there was a serial killer on the prowl, this took quite awhile and after all the effort by the end of this novel his only conviction was the one in India for 7 yearsBorn in 1944 in Vietnam, to an unmarried Vietnamese mother and an Indian father , unwanted by both parents, Charles spent his childhood in Vietnam, France, Africa and India moving from place to place and belonging nowhere. He was highly intelligent and had a natural aptitude for languages, but early on in his life, perhaps because of his unstable childhood and rejection, he turned his abilities to the dark side of life. From a young age Charles was able to manipulate and control others, a skill he developed throughout his life, becoming articulate in many languages and changing identities at the drop of a hat, able to convince otherwise innocent people to commit crimes for him and give him their money. Caught for many of his crimes, he was able to slip from custody countless times with the help of others who remained fiercely loyal to him.I had never heard of Charles Sobhraj before reading \\"Serpentine\\", have since discovered that he was released from prison sometime ago, profiting greatly from selling his life story, truly shocking.

Unbelievable that this man was able to operate for so long and not get caught or when caught, was either released or giving a short sentences, without further investigation. And was able to escape several times. Even though his family is partly to blame I feel that one takes responsibility for one life when becoming an adult. He knew full well what he was doing. Has he ever been extradited to any other countries where he committed murder etc.? It is sad to think that this kind of policework and justice may still be prevelent in India and other Asian countries. I know this man has now been released. My question to any of you readers is,has there ever been any knowledge of other crimes he may have committed now that he is out. Do we know where he went after being released and what kind of life is he living now? And what of Marie-Andree Leclerc? Did she eventually get released, did she indeed get charged with more crimes and serve more time or is she now back in Canada? The book should most certainly be read by any persons thinking of traveling in the East, certainly when going alone. To be aware there are most likely other people like hime who prey on tourists.

Although greatly assisted by a chaotic Asia judiciary system the mind boggles at how this monster was able to get away with so much for so long a period. His charm was demonically persuasive, his escapes from incarceration read like a very imagery James Bond novel. Anyone interested in the aftermath of Sobhraj's life which entailed a period of celebrity status in France after his release from an Indian prison (and the publication of Thompson's book) must read his bio on wikipedia : arrogance in the belief that he was invincible he returned in the 2000s to Nepal who, thank God, clamped their well-deserved \\"justice\\" wrath on this pyschopath."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"Powerful because the killer is like a snake that extends its reach to several parts of the world. For crime books occupies the upper levels of crime writing. This Mr. Thomas Thompson was the best of the best. I also have read Blood and Money for which he won a prestigious award and that book was definitely a masterpiece of the genre. The trail this killer walked, the victims found along the way, his entourage, the exotic locations, his gradual deterioration into the monster he became or perhaps always was make for a fine crime book. First of all it worth to note this is a large book, with many pages that does not disappoint. I think that Mr. Thompson was one of the greatest of his time.The tale is scary in that once again people does not suspect evil is in their midst, specially with a salesman of that caliber. An anguished, tortured personality that in the end blossom into this really scary human being. Serpentine is one of the best books on crime I have ever read and I am willing to say is on the top 5 of all times. This guy could write, his style and methods a true example of what a journalist is supposed to achieve while telling a very dramatic story. A great book and now I think that 5 Stars is the result of this reading experience. Perhaps attributed to the sad part of my title:The author apparently died as a result of writing this book, some kind of lethal virus contracted while spending time in India researching the story. That is why, if anyone deserves a 5 Star rating, Mr. Thompson definitely does. Upon finishing the book I was curious as to what else he had written, ready to buy whatever else he had and I found out about his passing. Incredible ending to an incredible story. Powerful and Sad. One of the very great writers of true crime, what a sad loss that was. Serpentine, then, becomes the last of his works. This guy knew how to write and after reading chapters of the places Charles, the killer, had lived in, like India, Vietnam, France, etc, etc, I could almost understand how easy it would be to eat or drink something in those unsanitary locations (surely not France for they do cook and have a fine reputation as a civilized place) and unsuspectingly loose his life. What a book and what a writer, truly an above average writer. Powerful and Sad, Serpentine has it all. Crime reporting at its best and that is no lie. 5 Glowing Stars for a promising writer that succumbed while researching what turned out to be his last work."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"Thomas Thomsons Sepentine will leave you thrilled and disturbed. The book reads like a novel. The crimes and villian seem unbelievable. However, it's all true and amazing."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"I tackle books that I feel like reading, but don't really think I have the interest to tackle them in long sittings, by reading them in the bathroom(you know when!. Almost six months after I started it I have finished almost the whole book, so no spoilers here!, but I am enthralled everytime I \\"sit down\\" to read that book, sometimes I find myself stayin a bit too long just to read the next page!...Thomas Thompson paints a beautiful picture of sobhraj and the areas in which he travels....he also doesn't make confusing transitions between locales.....he does well in showing you the impact he has had on others as well....very well written book......I recommend this book to anyone who likes true crime novels, or someone who just wants a nice good read....or even a bathroom book!: )"},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"Someone recommended this to me, knowing how much I enjoyed &quot;In Cold Blood.&quot; It was in fact billed as a worthy equal. A more erroneous comparison would be hard to make.While many of the facts are interesting, even occasionally sensational, the writing is florid and surfacy; it was clearly penned by someone who wanted to create a best seller. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was all about context, peeling away layers...it was not as much about the crime as it was about getting inside the mind of the killers, recreating the environment that spawned them, examining the sick co-dependent relationship between two disenfranchised members of society. &quot;Serpentine&quot; is largely about crime...who did what when and where...and its attempts at psychological profile are simplistic and dime-book Freud at best. Worse, the insights into the book's protagonist are made fairly early on and simply dredged up often and redundantly without any further insight.What bothered me the most, though is that there is an overabundance of facts and minutae that even the most casual reader would have to question as truthful. Long conversations are recreated among numerous characters but everyone sounds exactly the same; more often than not they sound the way a writer writes, not the way a person speaks. Finally, the book -- which takes hundreds of pages to get going -- starts to get interesting right before his arrest. But then it peters out with the haphazard recreation of the trial in India. There is no sense of drama or drive toward any meaningful conclusion.True, while Capote based his story on real killers he took the luxury of literary license and said so. That said, the profiles he creates are compelling reading and require attention. &quot;Serpentine,&quot; which the author maintains is all true, is something for the beach or layovers in an airport. It's the true-crime equivalent of a &quot;Streets of San Francisco&quot; episode. The only moral to be drawn from it is to beware of strangers while on vacation."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"Charles Sobraj was clearly a gifted man. Fluent in several languages and able to navigate his way throughout Europe and Asia, he remained an enigmatic figure and certainly one of the most interesting. He has been regarded as the worst serial killer in Asian history.Sobraj was an out of wedlock child born to a young Vietnamese mother and Indian father. Rejected by his natural father and only minimally accepted by his natural mother, Charles showed problems at a very early age. A sleep wetter until his early teens, Charles showed a calculated, vicious side almost from an infant. He would cut his mother's dresses to shreds so she could not go out at night; he learned early to fend for himself with a group of street children; he had no respect for authority figures and used foul language. When Sobraj's mother remarries, she takes Charles' younger sister (they were full siblings) and leaves Charles with his reluctant father. Sobraj, Sr., now remarried and well stocked with mistresses has provided Charles with a passel of Indian and Indio-Asian half siblings. His stepmother has no use for him, so once again Charles is turned out and left to fend for himself on the mean streets of the city.Charles' mother and stepfather return to claim Charles and it takes them all but an act of congress to get the boy to leave for France with them. Feeling displaced, Charles is left to try to sort out his sibling relationships. As the oldest of his French half-siblings, he exudes an aura of mystery and the younger children adore him. He would, years later, repay their adoration by stealing from them and in one memorable instance, framing a younger brother for a crime that he, Charles had committed.In adult life, Charles distinguishes himself as being able to move and blend into the culture of whichever country he is in. His Indio-Asian appearance lend him a somewhat &quot;international&quot; look; that is, he could easily be overlooked in many nations as a native. Charles uses this to his advantage. Gifted in language and business/marketing, he runs any number of illegal enterprises. He is very seductive and has convinced several naive women to become romantically involved with him.Marie-Andree Leclerc, a French Canadian, falls under Charles' seductive charm. He uses the Canadian to her ultimate destruction as the pair tour Asia and India throughout the 1970s killing and drugging travelers for money.This book will leave an indelible stamp upon your memory."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"I'm not a big fan of the &quot;true crime&quot; genre. I did love Vincent Bugliosi's Helter Skelter, but don't care for Ann Rule's books or their ilk. Serpentine is an exception. Like other reviewers here, I came across this book about 20 years ago and I still have vivid recollections of it. Sobhraj is a kind of Ted Bundy with a bit more style and class. Thompson does a fine job in conveying Sobhraj's seductive qualities. He also is adept in his description of settings. Sobhraj may be thought of as the only jet-setter mass-murderer. I didn't realize until reading over these reviews that he had been released from prison already. That really is diconcerting, for he is about as amoral as Hannibal Lecter. I can't believe he was allowed back into society. I would recommend this book to those who like true crime stories and to those who just like an engaging, easy read. The book moves along at great pace. If you bring it along on a vacation to Sri Lanka or Thailand or Paris, etc., you may want to keep an eye out for Sobhraj. I wouldn't get too chummy if I were you."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"\\"Even as the Air France jet travels towards the Istanbul terminal, Andrea Darreau saw his half brother through the window. There was no mistaking Charles, dressed as he was in the sleekest navy blazer, a celebrity's dark glass; he looked like a Greek tycoon.\\"This book captured me. It actually got under my skin allowing me to do or think nothing else but Serpentine. The character Charles Sobhraj is a man who comes up in a world that does not welcome him. As a child he remains unloved and unwanted, due to his illigetimacy, and his mother Song's marriage to another man. Charles' paternal father on the other hand wants nothing to do with him and marries again starting a new family. Poor Charles refuses to accept his father's dismissal, and keeps forever after him, baggering him, pleading his attention and love, all to no avail. His mother Song on the other hand is more concerned with her new life, and could not care less.Without any support coming from either of his parents Charles embarks on a life on his own, educating himself, and familiarizing himself with crime and how it works. He starts out with small crimes and then everything swells out in enormous proportions to the point where he is hiring staff to work with him. He gets incarcerated more times than he can count, as his criminal activity reaches across two continents; parts of Turkey, Iran, Paris, Delhi, Pakistan, and all the way to Hong Kong. Words cannot sufficiently describe the dangerous man Charles has become, but with his good looks, fine clothes, quick charisma and easy manner bit by bit, strangers who do not know him trust him and are lured into his web of dark murky waters.This is a true story and one can learn a lot from it, in protection oneself when traveling alone and otherwise.I highly recommended this work of non-fiction.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar ( SUGAR-CANE 08/05/07)"},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago and have never forgotten it. As others have described, I could hardly put the book down or believe how this man escaped capture and punishment for so long. I just finished watching a National Geographic special entitled \\"The Serpent\\" and discovered that it was about this same man. An Update to the story of Charles Sobrahj, after being jailed in India long enough to escape extradition on murder charges (In Nepal I think) due to the statute of limitations , (He escaped once and got an extention of 10 years on his original 7 year sentence to prevent extradition before the statute ran out in Nepal) he was released and eventually slipped back into the country where he was being sought for the murders of a Dutch couple (Thailand?). He was spotted, arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2004. His former partner in crime, Marie LeClerc died of cancer while he was in jail in India) As wily as this man has been his entire life, I doubt that this will be the end of his torturous career. It is a cautionary tale, one that prompts anyone who reads it to exercise caution when traveling, particularly abroad."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"In 1990, I was a woman, traveling alone around the world, for one year. I met a couple unsavory characters along the way--one of whom I now know was a socioopath--but fortunately escaped without long-lasting harm. I came across this book, originally thinking it was fiction (it was mismarked in the library where I found it), but found it was a true story of a sociopath, and how he preyed upon tourist after unsuspecting tourist. It particularly fascinated me as many of the places in this book were places I visited myself. If I had read this book before traveling, I don't think the sociopath I met could have done anything to me. As it was, I was too naive and trusting. The first thing I did after reading this book from the library was to go out and BUY my own copy to keep. And I plan to recommend this book to each and every person I know who is going abroad on any more than a simple vacation to a standard destination. If you are a traveler, or have friends who are travelers, the information contained in this book is priceless."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"I read this book in over thirty years ago, and I have never forgotten it. It has haunted me ever since. After living in Asia for over ten years, I realize how vividly and correctly a few words and phrases can so accurately capture the settings. Serpentine gives us insight into the progressive decline of a serial killer, beginning with alienation and minor crimes, and ending with chillingly effective mass murder.When I was living in Hong Kong in the mid '80's, I came across a tiny mention in the South China Morining Post that Charles Sobrahj had escaped from an Indian prison. I doubted that that one inch column would mean much to most readers, but knowing his exploits all over Asia, I was astounded at the sight. He was later apprehended, and has since served his term and been released. To think that a man who has committed his crimes is not in prison for life attests to the sheer intelligence and audacity of this killer.This is a book you will not forget."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"No spoilersYou've heard that reality can often be stranger (and more interesting) that fiction. In the case of Serpentine, nothing could be more true. This true crime story, which reads like the best fiction crime adventure book you've ever read, tells the story of Charles Sobhraj and his journey from a troubling childhood (to say the least), through his extensive criminal exploits, to his eventual downfall. Thompson does a great job of telling the stories of all the victims/accomplices involved completely independent of one another, only to gradually bring them together, with lives and destinies clashing together by the end.Charles Sohraj was a fascinating criminal who paired the tools of deception and charm to get what he needed to survive. Despite his extensive criminal resume, he must at least be given credit for his intelligence and creativity in avoiding the simultaneous pursuit of law enforcement agencies all across Asia.To sum it up, this is a fascinating accouont of a fascinating criminal and I promise that you will forget that this isn't a novel, even though it reads just like one. Pick this up and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Serpentine","review":"An oldie but a goodie.If you are into adventure travel writing and have a strong stomach, this is a read for you.

My kids are like most, I guess, brimming over with energy that sometimes gets misplaced. Sometimes they throw a lone fit when they don't get what they want, for instance when our girl wants &quot;ice fweam&quot; for dinner instead of the dreaded &quot;p'sghetti.&quot; Or when our penultimate son wants to &quot;renegotiate the contract&quot; with us (so to speak) and demamnds top billing at the attention theater. Or, as the author experienced with her little boy's first tantrum on the Fire Island ferry (we love the place, btw!), our oldest pitched his first hissy fit on the ferry (well, taxi-boat really) that plies the Manitowish Waters in N. Wisconsin, the &quot;Captain Roy.&quot; I, too, thought the crew or the mate (a mighty saling man) would toss us into the drink! And our youngest? Frankly, sometimes he can be a pampered jerk!This is not to say we don't love the kids, we love them to death! But how do you deal practically with tantrums which, we know, can happen to any child? This book is a real help in that department. It's full of sage advice on how to calm the frenzy down and take control of your home life.We invented a little game in our house inspired by one of the exercises mentioned in the book, we call it &quot;Green Light/Yellow Light/Red Light.&quot; It involves ranking our behavior and the kids just love it. Another thing we tried (but is not in the book although the book gave my husband the idea) is &quot;Self-Discipline Calling&quot; in which when the child is having a hissy my husband calls out &quot;Oing! Oing! Who's At The Door?&quot; and the frenzied child has to respond &quot;Self-discipline calling, come right in!&quot; This gives them the little extra control they need to rein in their wild emotions.

However, if you're a masochist and like a short introduction to 2-3 pages of codes with little to no comments just to illustrate a simple point, then by all means .. jump right in :) I don't completely regret buying this book, as I was able to get some useful information out of it. However, I think it was actually worth maybe half the price I paid for it."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 5 Developer's Handbook","review":"PROS: The book covers about 20 different advanced topics, with each topic nicely condensed into its own chapter. Great for the VB programmer wanting to learn about areas he or she is new to. You can just open the topic's chapter and read all that you need to know.CONS: The author's programming style in the sample applications is not consistent and usually does not follow standard professional notation for control and variables names. In my opinion, the sample code has an amateurish feel to it. This sometimes hampered my ability to quickly read the code and understand the author's logic. Also, instead of including useful comments in the code, the explanation on why &quot;this or that&quot; was done is in the book itself. This made it difficult for me to &quot;tinker&quot; with the code in the samples and learn more through experimentation.RECOMMENDATION: Don't buy it.

Not only are they easy to follow, they are taken directly from the Word of God."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"This prayer book is the best all around prayer book for daily personal (or even family)use. The Scriptures are addressed back to God and arranged by category (with direction to add certain categories of requests inbetween the sections). This adds structure to ones prayer life and breaks the monotony of \\"grocery list\\" praying. This one is a little longer than, \\"Praying the Scriptures for Spiritual Growth\\" or the \\"Simple Prayers\\" books; in my own personal devotions, it takes me about 7 minutes per daily prayer segment.Boa has written several prayer books, all great, all solid. This is my favorite to date."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"I have been a committed Christian for 35 years and have worked for one of the all-time great devotional writers (Selwyn Hughes of \\"Every Day with Jesus\\" fame), so I'm not easily impressed by devotional material; but this time, the hype is true!This book stands in a class by itself. It has rejuvenated and transformed my \\"quiet times\\" and, by example, has taught me how to \\"pray the Scriptures back to God\\" and turn them into affirmations in a powerful and penetrating way.If you want to look forward to your \\"quiet time\\" and don't mind it being longer simply because you're enjoying it so much, look no further. Use this book regularly and your faith and personal holiness will both grow more quickly."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"Face to Face is a wonderful tool to help you pray. Boa has assembled scripture into eight sections for each day. You pray through scripture for Adoration, Confession, Renewal, Petition, Intercession, Affirmation, Thanksgiving and Closing. It helps you focus and it gives a marvelous sense of the completeness of God's word. I do not recommend very many books but this is one that I would recommend to anyone. I have already given away 20 copies."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"In the introduction to this book the author writes, \\"The problem with prayer is heightened by the fact that people often succumb either to the extreme of all form and no freedom, or the opposite extreme of all freedom and no form\\". I was pretty much in the all freedom trap and felt my time spent praying was wasted a lot of times due to my inabilty to get my mind in order. This book has really helped me to improve my prayer life.I really enjoyed the way the book is organized with gentle nudges at the end of each section to get you going in the right direction. My previous prayer efforts consisted of me basically free associating. Since purchasing this book I have found myself getting to my point or just finding what I want to say much faster and with much, much more clarity. I also learned work in a time to stop and listen for a change, too!Another problem I had had with my prayer style was the pure inabilty to pray out loud. I'm not talking about in front of people or groups; I mean just praying out loud, alone, in my house. It was like my brain would freeze when I opened my mouth. Reading aloud the passages inluded in each section allowed me to let my mind get 'warmed up' and my prayer just flowed out after I finished reading a section.This isn't a Book of Prayers that you just read out loud. Rather, this is a book that lets you pray God's word back to him and then nudges you in a general direction that you fully expand on yourself. I found this book series recommended on my church's website and am very glad that I found them. Just to be clear, the book isn't a Bible replacement or a list of prayers. Face to Face is organized based off the Lord's prayer and is merely a guide to developing more meaningful prayer. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"Face to Face has become a mainstay for my time in the Word of God. The daily scriptures always apply to personal life - always timely. I like the size and covering of the book - I can take it with me anywhere - usually it goes with me daily to the gym.

There's always a verse or two that I end up copying on an index card to keep before my eyes regularly."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"This book has been a spiritual renewal.

It really helped me in worshiping in my prayer time. It was a real help in overcoming a dry time in my relationship with the Lord. I would and have recommended this book to friends. I have even given them away because it was so helpful to me. My only concern with the book is that the scriptures are not word for word. They have been altered slightly to make them more personal in nature. ALthough this can be helpful it is also a reason for caution."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"...and friends have thanked me for them.

It's the best resource (outside of the Bible itself) that I've found to incorporate Scripture into your prayer time each day. I also have Volume 2 which is equally as good, but I prefer the way this one categorizes the verses (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, etc.). It groups 1 or 2 verses per category for each day. This is a great resource to help you begin to pray God's Word back to Him! I use this small book often for preparing my heart at the beginning of the day or before a time of study."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"I always hesitate to call anything the 'best' or to overhype, but in 22 years of a committed Christian walk, this is the first quiet time guide I have truly longed to use each day. As other commenters have said, its power is in the fact that it is almost entirely Scripture only...with prompts thrown in to make your prayer more specific...but the emphasis is on God's powerful, penetrating Word.I am a busy mother of three young children and this was a perfect 'beside the coffee pot' devotion that I could spend 5 minutes or 50 with and feel fed by the Word of God."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"What a refreshing book to help your prayer time with God. This book rephrases scripture from not just the prayers of the bible, but from all parts, to renew your mind in the thoughts of God before you interject your personal thoughts. It presents an excellent way to grow in prayer and closeness with God. There is also much useful material found on the [...] web site... an excellent teacher."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"I love this book! I buy it for all my friends and relatives.It is great for holding thoughts captive. No matter what your situation, this book will help you through it. If you need affirmation, or renewal, or just want to praise and adore our father; this prayer book helps you pray the scriptures for intimacy, insight, clarity, and peace.So many times have I opened this book and found that the daily prayers were exactly what I needed for that days situation. It can be read in sequence, (three month devotional), or used only when necessary. It is structured to be used as a short devotion, or for a lengthy dialogue with the father. Whatever your need, this book will answer it for you."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"We learn to pray by repeating what we hear others say. Our first prayers may be nothing more than a simple memorized prayer before bedtime or mealtime that we learn as a child. I was raised in a tradition that looked down on \\"prayer books\\" and instead advocated using one's own words in prayer. Inevitably, however, one would end up using the words and phrases they heard others say when they prayed. A prayer book is essentially the same thing, except that the prayers have been carefully constructed and often refined and polished through years of use.One advantage of Boa's wonderful prayer book is that it incorporates the words of scripture to form the backbone for one's daily prayer while, at the same time, provides a rotating list of instructions which encourage one to pray, using their own words, over a variety of topics.The book has provided a helpful jump start for my often lifeless attempts at prayer. It helps me pray when that is a low item on my priority list for the day. It has also helped me develop consistency in prayer. I give these books often as gifts and in the beginning of 2008 each family in our congregation was encouraged to purchase a copy that we might all grow together in our devotion to prayer."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"I absolutely love this book in that it brings all aspect of prayer into my prayer time and keeps me focused in my prayers."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"Since receiving this as a gift, I have purchased it an additional 12 times as presents for friends and family.

I enjoy using it every morning to give a lift to my day."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"The format uses Bible verses as guidelines for your morning affirmations. Prayer is guided by a formula derived from The Lord's Prayer: adoration, thanksgiving, affirmation, intercession, confession, renewal and closing and also includes scripture for inspiration. The scripture is accurate, but personalized. E.g., Matthew 6:11, &#34;I look to you for my daily bread ....&#34;If your prayer life is stalled, or uninspired, this book will be of use to you."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship","review":"Wonderful book for daily devotionals.

A real gripper! It was fascinating to learn that Mr. Nielsen's grandmother was actually a maid in the Leopold household. Looking at &quot;the trial of the century&quot;, the household and all other events from the eyes of the maid was intriguing."},{"Title":"Semblance of Balance","review":"In the fall of 1924, America was riveted by the infamous Leopold and Loeb trial, and much has been written over the years about this intriguing case...the defendants, Nathan Leopold and Dickie Loeb, their wealthy and elite upbringing and education, the crime's thrill-seeking motivation, and lawyer, Clarence Darrow's brilliant strategy and closing argument. Now, Wayne F. Nielsen brings a totally new perspective to this &quot;crime of the century.&quot; Meet Mr Nielsen's grandmother, Elizabeth Sattler, nurse and maid in the Leopold household, who witnessed, firsthand, the events leading both up to, and then after the murder, and became one of the prosecutions star witnesses. Using his own family history coupled with exhaustive research, he has written a fascinating book that transports the reader back in time, and gives you a very personal, fly-on-the-wall view of the entire affair. This eloquently written book is tense and compelling, and filled with history, drama, insight and truth. Semblance Of Balance grabs you from page one and never lets go. For those interested in history and true crime, this is a book that should be placed right at the top of your &quot;must read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Semblance of Balance","review":"The most interesting thing about \\"Semblance of Balance\\" is the up-close view of a servant's life in the early 20th century. As for the more sensational material concerning Leopold and Loeb, the author gets nearly everything wrong--the nature of the relationship of the disturbed teenagers, their personalities, their motivations. I gave it two stars because I actually enjoyed the view of Elizabeth's life (the \\"upstairs maid\\"), and her experiences as a recent immigrant in America. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. It's as if Neilson did little research into the lives and characters of the two young murderers, and just imposed his own characterizations and ideas. Being the descendent of Elizabeth Sattler (the afore-mentioned upstairs maid) doesn't give the author the right to distort history."},{"Title":"Henry IV, part I (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"The title is a misnomer: when one thinks about the play, Henry IV is not the first, second or third character that comes to mind. \\"The Prodigal Son\\", \\"Two Noblemen from Eastcheap\\" or \\"The Knight of Unabashed Countenance\\" may have been more fitting.Falstaff looms large over the character set. Witty and silly by turns, he steals your attention by making you laugh with him or laugh at him. Even in the staged encounter between Hal and the king all the talk is about Falstaff. In his ability to be larger than life and to be uplifted by the sheer force of spirit, he is closely matched by Richard III. A lying thief and a remorseless murderer, when called a coward and a murderer to their face, they shrug it off, act as if they were a lion and a forlorn lover, and win over other characters and, somewhat disturbingly, the reader.Straight arrow characters are always at a disadvantage in a Shakespearean play. Hotspur and Henry IV, in their straightforward delivery, are fading out to the sound of Hal's and Falstaff's verbal jousting.Henry IV Part I may be Hal's story, but it is Falstaff's play."},{"Title":"Henry IV, part I (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"The events of this play follow \\"Richard II.\\" Bolingbroke/Henry with the help of Northumberland and others, defeated Richard II and got crowned King Henry IV. But in this play, King Henry IV learns that political gratitude is short lived. As early as 1.3, King Henry IV has a falling out with his former allies Northumberland, Worcester, and Hotspur. In fact, Henry IV's behavior almost borders on psychotic here. In a great scene of reversal, Northumberland and Worcester regret having helped Henry to the crown and they even express sympathy to Richard II. (Such is politics) Well, Richard II's consolation prize begins to kick in, and revolts against King Henry IV are underway.Meanwhile, Henry IV's son Prince Henry (the eventual Henry V) is still a youth, and he spends much time with friends who engage in criminal activity. We now meet the famous Falstaff. Falstaff is a rogue who engages in not so desirable behavior such as robbing travelers and drinking too much. At one point, he even takes bribes from people who want to avoid service to King Henry IV. But despite this, it is virtually impossible not to like Falstaff. He is comical, and at times, his concern for Prince Henry seems genuine.Henry IV rebukes Prince Henry for engaging in meaningless activities while rebellions are rising. It is interesting how he brings up how he defeated Richard II. (This may not have been the smartest move. Henry V never quite approved of how his father stole Richard II's crown, and there is a passage in Shakespeare's \\"Henry V\\" that reminds us of this.) Nevertheless, Prince Henry agrees to shape up so to speak.Later, Falstaff has the comical scene where he enters with subpar forces. (Cheap labor.) The battle comes and Shakespeare cleverly inserts a scene where King Henry Iv is wounded, but Prince Henry rescues him and 'redeems his lost opinion.' Things start to look good for King Henry IV, but Northumberland is still at large, and the grounds for 2 \\"Henry IV\\" are in motion."},{"Title":"Henry IV, part I (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"I needed this book for a college class.

Why do high-school teachers and undergraduate professors hide the good stuff from us and force us to read the most painful and incomprehensible stuff?Prince Henry Percy and his buddy Falstaff are hooligans getting up to the most deplorable delinquency, but that's OK because Henry is, well, a prince and all this is only youthful hijinks. Henry Hotspur, a cousin of the Prince, a soldier's soldier, a man's man (and Will leaves that question mark hanging in the air) is off to the wars at every chance he gets. King Henry is getting ready to get back to the Crusades and this is making his senior nobility antsy.This play was a study in insults. Not the boring, repetative use of three or four profanities that passes for insults in mainstream America, but poetic, extended metaphors that denigrate in detail. Hotspur's descrition of a foppish senior officer's interference on the battlefield was a delight (act I, scene iii). My own military experience made this vignette especially enjoyable.And the play ends as a battle ends, but with many issues unresolved and war looming in the near future.I really enjoyed this one. It was dour and cynical, but with many lighter moments provided largely by Falstaff. Next up, \\"Henry the IV Stikes Again; King Henry the IV, Part II\\"E. M.

This one is no different. If you're simply playing with Knoppix in order to see what desktop Linux is all about, you can easily pass on this book. You'll get a bit more out of it if you're looking to run Knoppix a bit more regularly (by installing it on your hard drive or saving configurations between reboots). Still, Knoppix Hacks would probably be a better title to better understand those techniques. Where this book shines is when you decide to use Knoppix as a bootable OS to allow you to administer and repair systems that are no longer working correctly (both Linux *and* Windows). Since you don't have to have a bootable sector on your hard drive to use it, you can get Knoppix up and running from a CD and then use it to repair the underlying hard drive. If you have a virus or rootkit installed, a Knoppix boot will allow you to get a clean system up and running which can then check out the hard drive for repair. Knoppix Pocket Reference will help remind you of the steps you need to take to accomplish some of these tasks. You're only getting the core commands with very little fluff, so you can quickly hone in on the trouble spot.This is the book I'd recommend as a follow-up purchase to Knoppix Hacks.

I don't want to let the Amazon crowd down, but I like Blackman's work, so I think I'll skip the opportunity for an ironic review (i.e., the &quot;Her poetry is so cute and fluffy!&quot; write-up) or the huckster shot about diabetes, and just tell you I liked the book.Nicole Blackman entered my world as a voice on a mix tape... I rewound &quot;Dogma&quot; over and over again. She is the only reason I own a KMFDM album; the band must have gotten tired of using their own name as lyrics, and hired a poet. The song is a hard kick in the teeth.It took some searching to find out who the voice on that song belonged to, a little more to find out who Nicole Blackman was, and an order to buy the Golden Palominos CD that showcases her. There's that voice again, and it can purr and ice and seduce as well as seethe.When I read this book, I hear that voice. I don't know if I'd have been so drawn to her if I had been handed a book instead of a tape, but I can easily settle into Blood Sugar and the range it offers.Yes: &quot;Range.&quot; Blood on the cover doesn't necessarily mean that the book is filled melancholy cliches-- it isn't readily apparent from reading the book weather or not she's a big Cure fan. Though she never traipses around in Hallmark fluff, some of the poems are very soft. The more violent graphic pieces detail something deeper (and scarier) than the sophomoric &quot;anger and pain as an attention getter&quot; poetry that I know she won't sink to.And that's really the trick, isn't it? To pull off that piece of magic... she strikes up an empathy, somehow. Nicole Blackman can burn into a dark topic and stay human. She's not trite, not shallow, and not delivering us the image-obsessed chant with every poem: &quot;I am the darkest poet alive&quot;. She is simply... good.Very, very good."},{"Title":"Blood Sugar","review":"In the vein of Nicole Blackman's work, I want to keep this review concise and direct. With &quot;Blood Sugar&quot;, Ms. Blackman touches the rarest of nerves with the adroit eye of a poet and clean candor of a seasoned observer of life. I'm certain that many of the poems contained in this book were not emotionally easy to write, and I feel very lucky that Ms. Blackman chose to share her wholly powerful work with us. I truly believe that &quot;Blood Sugar&quot; augments her as one of the most original and forthright poets of our time."},{"Title":"Blood Sugar","review":"This book single handedly pulled me back into poetry. Before reading this I had become what I would call &quot;disillusioned&quot; with poetry on the whole. Reading this brilliant work of modern poetry however rekindled what I had first felt as a youth reading Byron and Keats... and I've recaptured all that love again. I could pick apart a few technical aspects of this book... but I won't, I love it too much for that. All I can tell you is, if you enjoy raw emotion and pure attempts at artestry in words, then get this volume today! To use a cliche, you truly do owe it to yourself to own this work of art. I was first introduced to Blackman through her work with the &quot;Golden Palominos&quot; on the their album &quot;Dead Inside&quot; which is basically putting music to her words (which she sings and speaks on the album. You really should check it out if you can afford both). The brilliance of subtle details in &quot;Victim&quot; lead me to track down more of her work and I was led to this book... I hope you will be led to it as well."},{"Title":"Blood Sugar","review":"I've never liked poetry - and I've read a lot of it. It was always too flowery and ridiculous for me; it never portrayed anything I could relate to. Then I read &quot;Blood Sugar&quot;. Blackman is chilling and intense, and more honest and raw than any writer I've come across in a lifetime of reading. She creates beauty out of monstrosity, and does so with great intelligence and furious emotion. I eagerly anticipate her next work, as I'm sure it will be equally amazing."},{"Title":"Blood Sugar","review":"After enjoying Nicole Blackman's work with Golden Palominos, I was disappointed by this collection. Without her sexy voice to distract you from what she's actually saying, the flaws of Nicole's writing are brought to the fore, and she doesn't have much of a leg to stand on. Be advised that Blackman is definitely not literary, and her use of language is quite unsophisticated (I couldn't shake the thought that my 17-year-old friend produces better, quirkier work than this.) Blackman milks well-worn scenarios (abduction by a crazed man, getting abused by men as a rites of passage, Anorexia etc) but she adds nothing to the dialogue about these subjects. She represents the female experience accurately enough, and I did find myself relating to much of the terrain she explores, such as in her poem 'Dark Daughter' (about a depressed girl whose mother misunderstands her), but she just doesn't have an original take on this stuff. Also, her motifs (stars, pearls, diamonds, blood, guns etc), seem to me merely decorative; surface.Nicole Blackman seems to want to be the spokesperson for the urban underworld -- and she succeeds. Pop culture references abound, and the physical world is prioritised. Most of these poems don't resonate, and are at times heavy-handed. They tackle huge subjects like rape, incest, the loss of a twin, etc, and while very punchy and high-impact, they ultimately remind the reader of a slew of bad television crime shows, and various other low-brow gothic media. The nuances of Nicole's work are lost when limited to the written word, which is a shame, because pieces like 'Thirst' and 'Drown' work well when backgrounded by surreal music.I believe that Nicole Blackman's craft is editing -- and it shows. This stuff is pared down, stark, and as bloody as the cover would indicate. Maybe it's just not my thing. I'd recommend this to a teenage girl, but if you're older than that, you may require something more layered."},{"Title":"Blood Sugar","review":"In Blood Sugar by Nicole Blackman there are boundaries we cross as women everyday: mother, daughter, lover, professional and friend. Blood Sugar explores the cruel, the tragic, and humorous side of balancing power, femininity, motherhood and sexuality. Nicole Blackman's compilation of poetry illustrates a world of the modern misfit or the girl that doesn't quite follow the etiquette of society. She gives a voice to a new generation of women and girls that refused to be silenced. She gives a voice to anyone who has been hurt, betrayed, or just different.While reading her book there are times when her words feel like a blow to the stomach, or a calm before a storm. There are no details spared, no emotional stone left unturned. In her poem Brooklyn, Nicole Blackman eloquently describes how the aftermath of a former relationship can affect a present one, \\"and I don't care what you are because I'll make you into whatever I need.\\" She describes how necessity affects desire. In the poem Daughter, Nicole Blackman writes, \\"one Day I'll give birth to a tiny baby girl and when she's born she'll scream and I'll tell her to never stop.\\" Already she is empowering her hypothetical daughter. Already she is influencing the reader's perception on raising a daughter in today's society. One of her most potent poems, The God Of Sleep, depicts the uncomfortable comfort in a one-night stand with someone you know. One of the most important lines written in this book pertains to this poem: \\"Girls have to go somewhere dangerous every now and then just so they know they can find their way home.\\" This excerpt from the poem The God Of Sleep is the essential message of Blood Sugar... to find your way home metaphorical or not. This book is written for anyone who wants find themselves in the chaos of everyday life.I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is willing to explore emotional and physical pain on higher levels. Anyone that is willing to explore the darker side of life, of love and of sex. This book is for more than just lovers of poetry. This is for people who want to expand the horizons of contemporary poetry. This book is a guide for anyone who wants to understand the healing power of confession, sin, revenge, lust, and chaos.http://www.lakecitycc.edu/howl/howl06/staff/Sarahbookreview.html"},{"Title":"Blood Sugar","review":"If youre a huge poetry fan or you hate the stuff, youll love this book.

Gibbons succeeds in giving a full recollection of the occurances during the life of Richthofen, and the respect the author had for Richthofen is apparent throughout the book. It is written with the same views that I believe the pilots of the time would have had pertaining to aerial warfare, or flight alone. The romantic aspects of flight, which were held in higer regard in the times of elegant, open cockpits and gallant pilots than it is today, the book unfolds in a more-than-satisfying manner the events leading up to, and including, Richthofen's time as an aerial fighter. The book includes excerpts from Richthofen's own accounts of the war, through letters to his mother, the official requests for acknowledgement for many of the victories he attained, and quotes. Certainly the book is worthy of much more praise than I am able to give in a short review such as this. For anyone even remotely interested in the early days of Aerial warfare, and of course of special interest to those interested in the history of Germany's Ace of Aces."},{"Title":"The Red Knight of Germany; the Story of Baron Von Richthofen, Germany's Great War Bird","review":"Being an aviation and enthusiast, whilst going to a local antique shop (in Orange CO. CA); I happened across two very old publications. One was the first publication of this book: \\"The Red Knight of Germany\\" 1927(hardcover) and the other was \\"Warbirds: Diary of an unknown aviator\\" 1926/1951 (paperback).The former is a vintage first edition book of the era with thick paper pages and old style cover and binding. I had read a book previously called \\"The Red Baron: Richtoffen's Autobiography\\", but this book was equally as good as it was written from the perspective of 10 years after his death. The accounts of all 80 victories are fresh and has references to those that survived and even where they lived. Just touching a book this old and close to the events, takes one back in time. Few books have been able to do this to me. So by having \\"The Red Knight\\" and the other more recent book compiling his autobiography, one gets to know Manfred's life inside and out. I also strongly recommend the recent CDROM movie that investigates how he was killed. What one takes away from that is that it was his destiny to die much in the same way his victims did, but with the irony that he broke his own rule about going over the enemy lines. The best aces on both sides of the conflict died. Chances are the Red Baron died from a ground AAA Lewis machine gun, with exactly one bullet through his body and then crash landed. Irony at its epitomy. To qoute his last dying words as witnessed by the soldier that pulled him out: \\"I am kaput\\". Yet he lives on in the annals of military history, probably even more so in that he died young,in combat and at the top of _his_ game."},{"Title":"The Red Knight of Germany; the Story of Baron Von Richthofen, Germany's Great War Bird","review":"I haven't read the book in years but could hardly forget it. It's not just a biography of German's (and the world's) leading air ace of World War I, with 80 kills, but a concise summary of the development of air power over the period.It's a fascinating and ultimately tragic story. The first flimsy \\"machines\\", as they're often called, were used strictly for reconnaissance purposes, the pilots of opposite sides sometimes waving to each other over the battlefields. It occurred to someone that it wasn't a good idea to have enemies flying side by side on the same sort of mission, so pilots and observers brought along pistols, shotguns, and rifles and began to shoot at one another. With the introduction of the machine gun, fighter development got down to business.Baron von Richthofen was the most successful of these popular heroes. Convinced that camouflage was useless, he had his Dreidekker Fokker painted a uniform bright red. He was remorseless, at least in the statements he left behind, although once, strafing a column of mounted horsemen and killing men and animals by the dozen, he admits to almost feeling sorry for them. Otherwise he was a hunter who appeared to enjoy the sport. When he was on vacation, one of his favorite past times was hunting wild boar in the forests. He became somewhat less enthusiastic after suffering a severe head wound somewhere around his 60th victory.The book isn't flawless. Von Richthofen is described as having a superstitious prejudice against being photographed before a flight, yet there are numerous such photographs and some film footage as well. His death is usually attributed to an attack by an Australian airplane but he was under fire from the ground at the same time, so the origin of the bullet that finally killed him is problematic. The airplane carrying his body landed safely behind British lines and he was given a funeral with full military honors."},{"Title":"The Red Knight of Germany; the Story of Baron Von Richthofen, Germany's Great War Bird","review":"Floyd Gibbons wrote his biography of Manfred von Richtofen, the official Ace of Aces of the First World War, less than a decade after the end of the conflict. Gibbons tracked down and interviewed many of von Richtofen's vanquished foes and includes their accounts of their battles against him. He interviewed many of those who had known the Red Baron, including his mother. He was even given access to Manfred's bedroom at the family estate in Silesia, and also to the correspondence of her late sons and their father. He presents the information he obtained in a matter of fact way that's typical of biography of that period, with little in the way of anecdotes to humanize the man.Many of von Richtofen's official claims are reprinted in their entirely. So also are reports that von Richtofen sometimes 'pulled the long bow' in regard to having made the kill, particularly when his opponent went down behind Allied lines. I must recommend to the reader of Gibbons' biography that he also read Arch Whitehouse's book, The Years of the Sky Kings. Whitehouse was allegedly 'shot down' by the Bloody Baron, and his account of the action (it is listed as von Richtofen's 42nd victory) is vastly different from the German report. My own reading has led me to conclude that more than one of his credited kills are questionable, though I don't believe he often (if ever) took credit for someone else's work as some spiteful air historians have alleged over the years.The book captures very well the tenor of an earlier time, when certain aspects of warfare could still be seen as gallant conflict rather than the bloody business war truly is. It is well worth reading, to learn how a determined, stubborn, yet shy young man evolved to become the dreaded Red Baron of the Imperial Air Service. However, as I have said, you must take some of the claims in the book with a grain of salt; and you really should read other books on the subject of the air war of World War I to place the Baron in the context of his time.Perhaps the respect in which the Red Knight of Germany was held can be summed up in this except from the British aviation magaine, Aeroplane, that was printed three days after von Richtofen was brought down:\\"Several days ago, a banquet was held in honour of one of our 'aces.' In answering the speech made in his honour, he toasted Richtofen, and there was no one who refused to join. Thus Englishmen honoured a brave enemy.\\"Both airmen are now dead; our celebrated pilot had expressed the hope that he and Richtofen would survive the war so as to exchange experiences in times of peace.\\"Anybody would have been proud to have killed Richtofen in action, but every member of the Roayl Flying Corps would also have been prod to shake his hand had he fallen into captivity.\\"Coming from his honorable enemies, that is praise indeed and as good an epitath as any fighting man can hope for. While he was workmanlike and a good teacher rather than flashy like Frank Luke of the United States or Nungesser of France, Manfred von Richtofen was a man of honor of the old school and deserving of respect in the history of combat aviation; and not merely for his standing as the First World War's Ace of All Aces."},{"Title":"Project Management: Tools and Techniques for Today's Lis Professional","review":"\\"This book offers in-depth guidance on project management in LIS, including tried and tested methods and techniques for managing projects, paper-based approaches and project management software, and practical case studies.\\"\\"Are you involved in project work such as implementing IT systems, setting up a website or conducting a customer survey?

If books like The Scoliosis Sourcebook and Stopping Scoliosis aren't as technical as you like, and you want to read the original source material that makes up most of what the medical community knows about scoliosis, this book could be for you.

It involved Kaiser Wilhelm declaring himself a convert to Islam, a leader of &quot;jihad&quot;, as a tactic for winning the support of the Muslim territories under British control and thus fomenting an anti-British revolution. Richard Hannay, Buchan's intrepid hero from &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;, is the man entrusted to stop this plan from being carried out, and his adventure takes him from London, to Holland and Turkey and finally to the Russian border for a spectacular climax. Complaints have been made about Buchan's racist and jingo-imperialist biases, as the novel easily betrays the sentiments of a la &quot;dominion over palm and pine.&quot; However, a fiction-writer may, under a certain poetic license, attack creeds, doctrines, persons and institutions with impunity; moreover, a writer must be seen as a product of his age. This racy, lively, energetic novel is best appreciated as an excellent work of light literature. The conclusion is an undeniably exciting confrontation, including the charge of Cossack cavalry, as Hannay engages in the final showdown between the two German villains, the gross Stumm and the evil beauty, Hilda von Einem."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"...and a harmless read (recommended for train trips through particularly tedious or repetitive countryside, or long plane flights spent wedged into economy class). &quot;Greenmantle&quot; is another of Buchan's Richard Hannay novels (the same protagonist as in &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;); in it Hannay must track and foil a plot by the Kaiser to foment Jihad. I confess to being particularly drawn to this book as, well, an example of WWI-era pulp. It is sufficiently plot-driven, and entertaining enough to while happily away a few hours. Decidedly fun."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"You know, I really don't like war stories (although I do tend toward wartime authors) and I wouldn't have read this book if I hadn't been bored. But I did, and I've been thankful ever since. Yes, it contains racism, but it is simply the way people thought then. Yes it does tend to get technical, but John Buchan was doing the best thing a writer can do and &quot;writing what he knew&quot;. And yes, the philo/psycological discusions can get old after a few readings, but I found them another interesting look at the thought life of wartime Europe. The characters are all well developed (I can't stand characters that all act the same), so well that I can't say who is my favorite (permit me a feminine little sigh, however, over the heartbreaking Sandy. But if I did that I'd have to giggle over Peter and argue about Blenkiron and hold my breath with Richard Hannay). The book does seem to start out slow, but keep on going, and don't skip a thing. I'll tell you a secret, though, despite all I just said, I really read this book for the last three pages! The thing is, you can't really &quot;get&quot; all the beauty and relief and grandur of it unless you read the rest, there's just something missing in it, believe me, I've tried."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"After September 11 and the breathless wartalk of the US government I suddenly found myself thinking about good old Greenmantle. As the other reviewers say, it is undoubtedly imperialist and jingoistic (I can't begin to imagine how viciously Edward Said would trash it), but uncannily useful for reading the current political situation. The stunning climax (I've never read one better) suggests perfectly how the West intends to undermine Islamic extremism in a far more subtle way than we can imagine. I'm tempted to reveal the ending, but it's far to good to spoil. Read this!"},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"This story is a strange one if you do not understand the world as it was during the confusing times of World War One. However, if you are reading this book simply for enjoyment, you picked a good one. It is a little rascist, but if only you consider the time it was written and the beliefs then, I don't think you can consider it a bad book. It is not proper to judge a book written in the early twentieth century by our current standards of political correctness. It is simply a good indicator of past views of various people. If you don't mind the little rascism this book has and remember that it was written when that was perfectly normal, you should enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"This was the second time I read this story and must admit that it seemed longer, somehow, the second time around. It's good to see Richard Hannay pitted against the 'Hun', once more. This time with a band of faithful followers to upset the Germans' plans of set the Middle East aflame with a 'Jehad'. Parts of the book bog down in technicalities of the Great War effort, but then, the story is being told by a soldier fighting said war! Hannay's storytelling betrays his jingoistic belief in the British Empire and British fairness and holds himself proudly as the pre-Apartheid South African that he is! In all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend anyone else to read it, the prequel and the 3 sequels."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"Fast paced and intruiging. Set in a real historical situation which means you get a slice of the atmosphere around that period."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"of the sort that cannot be written nowadays. (The modern equivalent would be seven times as long and would be a study in grey, as exciting as a slab of concrete.) Admittedly the book is racist. No, on second thought, \\"racist\\" is not at all the word. Buchan clearly thinks British culture is superior to other culture; but that's the sort of thing it's easy to live with in a book - and if he shows a lack of understanding of other cultures, well, a book of this kind needs villains, and it doesn't matter (for our purposes) if the villains never really existed. As for his view of Islam ... well, a writer is surely allowed to show contempt for doctrines, if not people; and, after all, he never does so in order to sell us a religion of his own. Despite the absurd things Hannay says he is clearly a man of intelligence - as is the author. This book is my introduction to both Hannay and Buchan. I hope to encounter them both again."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"Greenmantle is one of the finest examples of Buchan's writing--if not the best, although Witch Wood is a contender. During World War 1, four men embark on a trip through wartime Europe and Germany to Constantinople. Their aim is to find a secret weapon: a nuclear ray? a new kind of aeroplane?--Well, I'll only say, something totally different.The story is longer, more philosophical, and of far wider scope than its predecessor, The Thirty-Nine Steps. There are more characters, more locations, more pressure on our heroes. There are many memorable passages of writing--from Germany in winter to the first sight of the mountains in Turkey. The plot relies less on coincidence than The Thirty-Nine Steps, but gets criticised just as harshly for it. The only place I've ever found coincidences not to happen are in realistic fiction (or, they're bad coincidences).Still, if you can accept the fact that this is a relatively optimistic wartime thriller (compared to some recent efforts) with plenty of adventure and suspense, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"This book had all of the elements of a good spy novel--danger, exotic locations, and neat plot twists. It is about a young mining engineer's espionage adventures during World War I. The book was a real page-turner and I couldn't put it down. However, some of the political information confused me. If you're a World War I buff you might understand some of the technical stuff, though. This book also continues the adventures of one of my favorite characters, Richard Hannay, who first appeared in The Thirty-Nine Steps. He is an extremely likable character and this book is a great one if you like espionage novels and adventure stories. P.S. Read it and you'll see why this would make a great movie."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"Greenmantle is a dramatic and suspenseful story of 4 men journeying through enemy lines to stop an evil menace that may crush Britain during WW1.As you read you will be able to tell that John Buchan knew what he was writing about! The characters and the plot are very well developed and sometimes rather confusing but if you just keep reading it will clear up. Buchan sometimes gets technical and you may have to look up some phrases/words in the back but this book is worth it. I would recommend it for 11th grade +. Once you start it you may not be able to put it down so enjoy!"},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"Sean McMeekin's \\"The Berlin-Baghdad Express\\", a historical work about Germany's attempts to unleash a jihad against the British Empire in the First World War (see my review), makes no fewer than 14 references to this hugely successful novel, written in 1916; so I thought I would read that next.Buchan had been in the diplomatic service; had been in South Africa just after the Boer War as an assistant to Lord Milner, the High Commissioner; and in the First World War he was a war correspondent in France, served in the Intelligence Corps and wrote for the War Propaganda Bureau. In this novel he draws on his experiences in all these areas: his hero, Richard Hanning, had fought in the Boer War (and also on the Western Front), and was then recruited by the Foreign Office to find out, together with two comrades of his, what he could find out about the German jihad project. This task takes him across Europe, through Germany and Austria-Hungary, on his way to the Middle East.The first half of the book is a rattling-good thriller, written for boys of all ages, full of derring-do, false identities, hair-breadth escapes, cruel Boches (as well as some decent patriotic and therefore respect-worthy Germans) - and all pretty straightforward. I think it falls off badly thereafter. When Richard Hannay gets to Constantinople, the complexity of Buchan's plot is magnified by the complexities of Turkish politics. Buchan introduces Turkish politicians and organizations on the assumption that you know who they are. Any reader who does not know that history will find it particularly heavy going. But is striking how well Buchan was informed about the tensions between religious and secular Turks and about the tensions between the Turks and their German allies. Hannay knew by now that the mysterious local driving forces behind the jihad project were an Islamic prophet known as Greenmantle (who plays a minimal role in the novel) and a sinister female called Hilda von Einem. He does meet her, and of course she is the archetypal icy beauty with a magnetic presence, dangerous and utterly ruthless.Eventually events (somewhat obscurely) take him from Constantinople to Erzerum in Eastern Anatolia. It ends with the Russian capture of the city - thanks to information Hannay managed to get to them. That was in February 1916 - so the novel was bang up to date when it was published).Hannay repeatedly escapes enemies only for them to pop up again in unexpected circumstances; he loses touch several times with comrades who likewise turn up again in the hour of need; and his escapes from several apparently hopeless predicaments and imprisonments. These things are all as unbelievable as they are formulaic.Richard Hannay has all the attitudes that went with a model Englishman at the time: patriotic, courageous, loving a good scrap, unfazed under fire (in fact rather relishing it), ingenious, uncomfortable when in his disguise he has to do something that goes against his code of honour, having respect for a tough and straightforward opponent and contempt for wily and corrupt orientals, casually antisemitic; and he has all his life been so used to male company that he thinks women are unpredictable and he feels ill at ease with them - not least with a woman opponent such as Hilda von Einem. There is also some sympathy for the prophet who loved the purity of the desert; we see here the romantic view of the desert Arabs that was held by Lawrence of Arabia at about that time and that would get such a hold on people in the British Foreign Office.(The Kindle edition is very inexpensive; but it is irritating to read: lines sometimes stretch across the whole page, but often there are only a few words - sometimes just one word, sometimes three or four - to a line.)"},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"I loved John Buchan's adventures as a kid and read them all -- so I was curious to see how I'd react coming back to this one 40 years later.It's still a \\"ripping good yarn\\" -- the author can definitely write and can tell a gripping tale. But the adult in me also rebelled against several aspects of the book, notably the casual racism, homophobia and antisemitism woven into the narrative. There is one unintentionally hilarious scene where our hero is brought to the home of the German villain -- a rotten bully if ever there was one. We are given to understand, through the description of the man's room, strewn with unmanly and \\"queer\\" bric-a-brac, that the German thug is also a follower of a \\"beastly\\" lifestyle -- and nothing could be more disgusting.But Buchan admits also that he knows nothing of women and their world. His world is one inhabited by manly men, who enjoy sport and other manly endeavors -- without a hint of sexuality. Buchan's hero would rather endure a shelling from the enemy than an evening alone with a woman. The other villain of this book is the evil Hilda von Einem -- but it's not clear what makes her evil, other than the fact that she is not a man.Buchan is some ways was an overgrown child. His view of World War One was childish. He talks about life in the trenches as a jolly good game and there is nothing of the sheer, bloody horror of the war. The hero -- the same Richard Hannay from \\"The 39 Steps\\" -- is sent on an obscure spying expedition to Germany and Turkey. He fulfills the British ideal of the dedicated amateur who beats the rotten professionals at their own game. And Hannay definitely regards his exploits as a game. He keeps referring to his mission as a game -- in which he can outplay the enemy because, damn it he's British and nobody beats the British.This is a book written for kids. Adults can still enjoy it -- but they have to forget they have grown up."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"Greenmantle, John BuchanAfter the events in \\"The Thirty-Nine Steps\\" Richard Hannay joined the British Army as a Major. After the Battle of Loos he convalesced in Hampshire. A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"I can't speak highly enough of this book, it's certainly among the best I've ever read in my 58 years and I read a LOT.John Buchan introduced his character John Hannay in The Thirty-Nine Steps, but this book really puts him through his paces along with his colleagues.

This story follows the 39 steps with some of the same characters. It is good early spy sotry reading."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"This sequel to The Thirty-Nine Steps has a lot going against it, particularly by the standards of today. As others have noted, there are racist stereotypes and attitudes galore, and the plot depends on contrivance and improbability in healthy doses. Still, I think it's an incredibly enjoyable read, largely for the characters. Unlike Steps, Richard Hannay in his second outing has companions, and a more engaging and endearing group of conspirators would be difficult to uncover. Sandy Arbuthnot, Peter Pienaar and John S. Blenkiron are Hannay's boon companions on this ride across a worn-torn Europe, with the fate of the Allies in the East hanging on their every move. Melodramatic potboiler though it may be, Greenmantle is saved by its characters -- in spite of their own prejudices. If you can somehow put yourself back in time as a reader, encountering this tale for the first time as someone living at the time, this improbable and flawed narrative can go down pleasantly. I did for me, as have all the Hannay novels."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"In many ways this book is a preview of many of the current issues seen in the Middle East at this time.

Great fun."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"Greenmantle, written and first published during the First World War, takes us on a contemporary journey to Lisbon and then through Holland and Germany to the Danube and east to Constantinople and beyond as far as the Euphrates. Trench warfare in Belgium and France was ongoing, the Gallipoli disaster very recent, and the Russians (still under the Tsar) were putting German directed Ottoman forces under much pressure south of the Caucuses. Given that the action was ongoing, it is surprising how frank this novel is about the stalemate on the western front, the magnitude of the casualties, and that it had been necessary to withdraw from the Gallipoli peninsula. That the novel is nevertheless gung ho in its attitude towards war - all an extension of fox hunting, really - and indulges in unflattering caricatures of Germans and Turks need not in the circumstances surprise us at all. The greater surprise is that there are also examples of both that are much more sympathetically drawn.John Buchan gives his hero Richard Hannay (first met inThe Thirty-Nine Steps) a new assignment. Called to Whitehall when nearing the end of recuperation following a wound received at Loos, he is instructed by Foreign Office mandarin Sir Walter Bullivant to pick-up the threads of an intelligence investigation in Istanbul. Those threads are fragmentary, but are believed to be key to Germany's plans to achieve dominance in the Middle East and beyond. That indeed proves the case and, having solved the initial puzzle, Hannay goes on to do his best to frustrate the German war effort in Turkey, at great risk to himself and the several collaborators he has acquired, one of whom is an American, John Scantlebury Blenkiron. Like Hannay, Blenkiron appears in several of Buchan's novels.Greenmantle is a fine example of an adventure that moves at considerable speed through varying terrain. It gives readers a vicarious experience of the many places visited, of troop trains, of how the Danube river barges worked, and some insight into the construction of trenches, barbed wire entanglements and how field guns are used. As a spy drama set in hostile territory, there are obvious comparisons to be made with the much later James Bond novels and a particular delight in Greenmantle is Buchan's prototype for Rosa Klebb, Hilda von Einem, drawn by Buchan with considerable care."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"Enjoyable WW I period piece and a sequel to Buchan's \\"The 39 Steps\\". I first learned about this novel, viewed as art imitating reality, in Sean McMeekan'sThe Berlin-Baghdad Express: The Ottoman Empire and Germany's Bid for World Power, which explored German attempts to exploit Muslim jihadist sentiments of the day in their anti-Allied propaganda, albeit with poor to mixed success. The plot, which draws on a similar theme, takes place around 1915, and is the first person narrative of South African mining engineer Richard Hannay, a character Buchan developed in his previous book, \\"The 39 Steps\\" (hide link in previous phrase) . Now turned British spy, he is sent out with his team behind German lines to determine the import of a mysterious message \\"Kasredin cancer v. I. \\".Using false identities the spies fan out with plans to meet in Istanbul. Hannay, an engineer from South Africa, adds on an old Dutch friend Pieter, a militia comrade from the Boer wars, and together they insinuate their way into the confidence of the ruthless but not cunning enough German intelligence officer Sturm. Yet Pieter slips up by getting drunk and revealing his true sentiments towards the Germans forcing the two to separate.There are some touching scenes of civilian life in Germany during the war and the description leading up to the troop of whirling dervishes in backstreets of Istanbul is simply wonderful. The war torn landscape and extended battle scene at Erezun that takes up the last section of the book are so vivid that I could imagine being there. Sir Walter Bullivant reprises his role as a prototype for Ian Flemming's M and Sandy Arbuthnot, Hannay's former regiment mate serves as a more northerly T. E. Lawrence. Hannay's bravado in avoiding recognition does strain the reader's incredulity a bit, but the author does worry about the point and is able to carry it off.A bit jingoistic and paternalistic, but then so are 21st century travel books. Part of the charm is that it gives one a feel for the British and German cultures and attitudes of the day. Recommended."},{"Title":"GREENMANTLE","review":"While many today might be familiar with Ian Fleming and his spy character James Bond's adventures in the era of the Cold War, John Buchan in Greenmantle gives us a portrayal of espionage World War I style when the Allies foes were Turkey's Ottoman Empire and Germany and the quest was the Middle East and all its riches.The writing is clear, concise and under stated leaving it to the reader to fill in the missing parts and the excitement the character must have experienced to accomplish what they did.Author John Buchan is a study in himself having served in the highest level of Britain's Ministry of Propaganda and Espionage as well as the House of Lords and Governor General of Canada and a Oxford don to boot. Hisfour character's are no doubt a composite of spy's he has known. The author makes use of then current slang, sayings and a mixture of languages that slows down reading but give authenticity to the story, but frequently requires checking the \\"explanatory notes\\" in the back of the book.

In this adventure, Richard Hannay is aided in his mission of his undercover work by Greenmantle (modeled on American Aubrey Herbert). The writer, John Buchan uses his experiences as assistant private secretary to the British High Commissioner in South Africa (1901-1903). He was literate, wrote adventure novels of three separate series. He wrote this story while serving in the Intelligence Corps during WWI (1916) in France.He was born in Scotland, the son of a minister. He was a lawyer and partner in Thomas Nelson & Son publishing house in Edinburgh in 1907.

This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I. It is a fairytale. Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.

Michael F."},{"Title":"Trout","review":"Mention the name of Ray Bergman to any group of grey-haired flyfishermen, and they will nod knowingly. Even today, Trout is looked upon as a must in any fisherman's, and especially a flyfisherman's, library.Why? Certainly there is no shortage of literature on fishing and flyfishing. Many gifted writers have turned their talents to both the beauties and practicalities of fishing; yet Bergman is one of the few whose work has endured well past the author's lifetime. Ted Janes, editor of the book's last edition in 1976, goes so far as to include Trout in the same category as such cornerstones of the fishing literature as Dame Juliana Berners' Treatyse on Fysshynge with an Angle, Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler, Alfred Ronalds' The Fly-Fisher's Entomology, and W.C. Prime's I Go a-Fishing.Trout speaks in a unique voice, and its voice is independent of the listener's time era. When the reader absorbs the information, he can almost picture Bergman sitting down next to him and talking to him. His very first words in the book - the dedication - immediately invite the reader to a closeness, a camaraderie.&quot;To you all - The many good fellows I know and have fished with, and those whose paths may never cross mine except through the medium of these pages. This is my visit with you, our fishing adventure together. I trust it will be enjoyable, instructive, and memorable.&quot;Bergman's talents of observation and instruction are a pleasure to read. They allow the reader to immediately envision what the water is doing, what the weather is like, and how the fish are behaving. And the reader can just as easily picture himself working through the approaches that Bergman describes to the different angling puzzles he presents. Bergman details step-by-step trials, including some errors, that culminate in each puzzle's solution.In one example, he describes an episode fishing with a companion at Brodhead's Creek in Pennsylvania. As happens with all of us, initial efforts proved fruitless.&quot;Because a few fish were rising we first used dry flies, but after a half hour without results we changed to wets. I don't know how many times Fred changed his flies, but I know that I tried a dozen patterns before I got a rise - to a size 14 Orange Fish Hawk that was being manipulated close to the surface by the 'hand twist' retrieve. Because occasionally the trout were breaking on the surface, we kept fishing our flies near the top, but after an hour of hard work we still had only one fish, which had taken the Orange Fish Hawk the first time it was used.&quot;He proceeded to experiment with different depths, keeping the Hawk on and using the same retrieve style. After finding the proper depth, he exults that the &quot;combination of depth and retrieve proved to be what was needed, and we both took quite a number of fish before tiring of the location.&quot;This illustrates the kind of analysis that Bergman used, his powers of observation, and attention to detail. His unproductive efforts in the episode are an important part of the analysis, and he is not shy about recording them faithfully.The appeal of his anecdotes is timeless, because, after all, a trout's gene pool and its inherent behavior patterns have changed very little over the past hundred years - and we don't expect much change for another hundred years. The types of puzzles Bergman describes are just as likely to be encountered by today's angler as by the anglers of half a century ago.As Bergman himself observes, his life occurred during that in-between era of history, which saw the last of the so-called &quot;old-fashioned ways&quot; typified by stateliness, Victorian values, and a much slower pace of life. That culture was supplanted by the beginnings of the modern era, characterized by scientific and technological advances and the consequences (both good and bad) thereof. He describes it in the chapter &quot;Early Experience:&quot;&quot;When I was a boy, conditions were quite different from what they are today. I am old enough to have experienced the old-fashioned ways of the latter part of the nineteenth century and the rapid-fire progress of the twentieth. I saw the horse and carriage give way to the automobile, the dusty roads change rapidly from macadam to Tarvia and then to concrete. Each advance of progress had its effect on fishing.&quot;This bridging or blending of eras has a curious effect on his writing. The Victorian literary style is evident throughout, yet his approaches are clearly influenced by scientific method.Another aspect of Trout that has helped its longevity is that it appeals to the thinking angler. Much of Bergman's success can be attributed to his powers of observation and deduction, and he clearly communicates the value of these. By encouraging the reader to follow the dictates of his own reasoning rather than simply following the crowds or conventional wisdom, he strikes a chord in the intellectual snob lurking in all of us. The following comes from the chapter &quot;Water Types and How to Fish Them.&quot;&quot;Most of us have so little time,... we think we must fish the best-looking spots where everyone else fishes because they must be good or no one else would fish them. This is false reasoning, because we are relying on precedents established by easy fishing and in most cases by anglers who have followed the established rules rather than the dictates of their own minds. It would pay larger dividends if we spent more time at thinking and observing than at fishing. Remember that locating fish is more than half the battle. When you know exactly where they are, then you can intelligently fish for them. Otherwise you are simply trusting to luck.&quot;All of these factors came together at one time in history, in one man, and in a book called, simply, Trout. As long as there are members of the genera Oncorhynchus, Salmo, or Salvelinus swimming in streams and lakes, and there are people trying to deceive them into taking a pointed, bent piece of metal in their mouths, Trout's place will remain secure.Oliver Shapiro"},{"Title":"Trout","review":"I was given a paper back version of this book by a young lady who knew I was into fly fishing. She was going to throw the book out but I was lucky enough to be the recipient of her kind deed. This was the only book I ever read about trout fishing.

The description on how to fish streams helped me in my effort to hunt for trout. If it was not for this book I probably would not have pursued this sport with the enjoyment I have for the last 20 years. I have a deep regret that this book magically disappeared from my house a few years ago but I can still see the pages in my mind when I am on a stream searching for trout.

In this current incarnation, published by the Warren Press in November 2010, the plates are rendered in poorly defined black-and-white photographs that make a mockery of the original art work and serve no useful purpose in helping to identify the fly patterns. The book lacks even the most rudimentary bibliographical information and gives every impression of being simply a photo reproduction of the second edition set in a new binding. Buyers interested in the original art work are therefore advised to search elsewhere for a genuine copy of Bergman's book or purchase the paperback version, which, though I have not seen it, appears to include the color plates."},{"Title":"Trout","review":"TROUT, The Trout Fisherman's Bible, by Ray Bergman is a complete history of the author's immersion into the relm of matching wits with trout.The original 1938 publication has been greatly added to for the 1966-2000 revisions.If you like evolutions and history this is an absorbing book. I particularly like the late author's detailed descriptions on how he developed his respect and methods to entice trout throughout North American waters.The color plates of flies are beautifully depicted and the drawings of fishing techniques and knots are well done. There are some outmoded practices described, like using gut leader and parafin dissolved in unleaded gasoline to make fly cleaner flotant.Some of the author's fishing practices revived my appreciation of the legendary fishers in my family. It is a readable instructive book. I also liked the trade paper cover with a beautiful brown trout."},{"Title":"Trout","review":"My husband had a copy of this book years ago but lost it.

The introduction in this book made reference to the beautiful COLORED illustrations, yet they were black and white. You can't tell from the pics in this book whether you have created a good fly or not. He was highly disappointed and I returned the book.My original request to Amazon was \\"Is this particular book a fluke or is this now how it is being printed?\\" My only response was that I could return the book if I was not satisfied."},{"Title":"Trout","review":"Great book with lots of useful data but I was not happy to find the photo/plates were reproduced in Black and White."},{"Title":"Trout","review":"An incredible source of information can be found in this book.

In his writing Bergman sets me to mind of he old fellows I grew up with in New York's Catskill Mountains, the type of sportmen, like Bergman, who grew up in that time between the old and the new ways of things, the sort of men who knew every leaf and tree, all types of plants and their uses, men who could find fish where none seemed to be and could find game where others only saw an empty field. One of the great things about \\"Trout,\\" at least for me, is it conjours up memories of those times and those men, times, because of my association with them, I was able to touch and taste a little bit - times of wool, and leather, and canvas, or bamboo rods, and double-barrel shotguns. So if you want a book that is just a great read, grab \\"Trout\\" and while reading you migth learn something.\\"Trout\\" itself deserves five stars and more, but as the color plates have been rendered as shabby black & white pictures I gave this printing 4 stars.

Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and I still don't like it. It is all about this guy named Vic who gets this girl Ingrid pregnant and then decides he has to marry her rather than face the derision of the people in his town. Then he moves into his Mother In Law's house with his new wife. That was his second mistake. Naturally the two of them don't get along and Ingrid becomes indifferent to his sexual advances causing tension in the household.Ingrid then loses the baby through a miscarriage caused by an accident and then Vic has no valid reason to stay with her. He goes to his sister who he has always had a close relationship with who advises him to stay married!!! That was probably the worst piece of advice I have ever read in a book. This is what happens when you care more about what people think of you rather than having the courage to stand alone and be different from the rest of the herd. The author give a very sad portrait of Working Class Life in England during the sixties and I am glad that we have moved on the a more progressive Society.Vic is a sad example of an egocentric guy who is ruled by his pathetic sexual needs. Read this book if you want to be amused at the antics of this loser who wants to have sex at any cost to himself or anybody else."},{"Title":"Ancient pagan symbols","review":"This book is a reprint of a 1929 book. It is a small paperback book, 6.5 X 4.5 inches.This book covers some of the origins of a few of the symbols we use in our Pagan religions. Descriptions include the elements, tree of life, sun, moon and wheels and other images we use for representation.The author covers many different mythologies: Babylonian, Egyptian, Roman, Christian and Chinese to name a few. She explores some of the stories associated with some of the symbols, while also quoting some already established associations by authors like Fraser, Jung and Lajard, to name a few.Pictured are some of the symbols from various art pieces and there is a very interesting chapter called \\"Some General Symbols and Symbolic Figures Found in Early Art\\", which lists such symbols as \\"Adonis\\" and other Gods and Goddesses as well as other articles such as \\"Gazelle\\".All of this is rather interesting, but I found the book to be lacking in many aspects. First of all, a book on symbols should contain more than just \\"forty-eight images\\", many of which are works of art and only a few are actual line drawings of the symbols. The author also discusses much more than forty-eight images, and many of them, if you are not familiar with them, will leave you lost for an association. Then there are the pictured symbols which are part of a larger work, and it can become difficult to separate the symbols if you are unfamiliar with them.Many of the \\"symbols\\" are actually Deities in our pantheons. While the associations are good, Ms. Goldsmith discusses them from the aspect that they are merely representations of ideas, not Deities. Ms. Goldsmith's previous works includes a book on Sacred Images in Art, so this is not surprising.While the author does use footnotes where she quotes other authors, there is no bibliography for her research. There is a table of contents and an index for quick reference.There is much reference to Chinese and Buddhist material in this book, as well as Christian symbolism. While the \\"official dictionary\\" meaning of Pagan is \\"one who is not Christian, Jewish or Moslem\\", those who are Chinese are not necessarily Pagan, and Christianity is definitely not Pagan. There are other ethnic, cultural and religious lines crossed in this book, so the title of this book should have been reviewed before it was reprinted and my own choice for a title would be \\"Ancient Symbols\\", and the word \\"Pagan\\" should have been left out in my opinion. While it may have been acceptable at the time the book was written, it is outdated and needs to be revised. The book contains a preface by the author dated 1929 and also mentions she was born in 1860, so there is material that reads as dated as the book is.While there may be interesting contents to this book, it is not a good choice. The book that should have been revised, meaning the research should be updated, a bibliography should have been added to show where the material was adapted from and should have been re-illustrated to include visuals of the symbols discussed."},{"Title":"The Birth Project","review":"As Chicago states in this book, rare are those books in print which honor the creativity and birthing of women.

A lot of the books seem to have the same simple poses or very few poses described. There is a little bit at the beginning about the philosophy of yoga, but most of the book is about the asanas. There is also some introduction at the beginning about equipment and proper breathing. I liked that each asana has a full two pages devoted to it, one page describing the asana in detail, with benefits and variations. On the facing page is a full size photo of the asana. The photographs are clear, and pictures are shown for different parts in a sequence, like for sun salutation. Towards the back of the book, there are courses of different poses, some just for regular practice and some for remedial work, like to relieve backache or reduce menstrual pain. There is also a course for pregnancy. I liked that there were many courses to choose from (sixteen daily courses and at least ten remedial ones); that helps decide which asanas go together and makes for a varied practice.Although this book gives great descriptions of the asanas, it is probably more for someone who has had some exposure to yoga previously. Some of the poses are a little more advanced for the brand new practioner (shoulder stand, for example), and not much is given about the history and philosophy of yoga besides asanas, if that is what you are interested in. I was not so much interested in background philosophy and history as I had read about that in other yoga books. I wanted a book that I would still use as I progressed from a beginning to an intermediate practice.I love the small size of the book. There is a lot of information in a book of such compact size. I like that I can easily pack the book when I travel so I can practice yoga when I am away from home. My only complaint is about the binding of this book. It is difficult to get it to lie flat, making it hard to use while you practice. Also although the courses provide a small picture and the name of the various asanas, if you cannot remember all the details of a pose, you have to flip back and forth between the descriptions and the course outline. The way I remedied the situation is I had the book spiral-bound for a small fee at the local copy shop making it easy to lay flat and flip back and forth during practice. Buying a used copy of the book in good condition from amazon marketplace made the entire cost still less than what I would have paid for a new book at the local bookstore."},{"Title":"Yoga in Focus: Postures, Sequences, Meditations","review":"I love the simplicity of this book.

Parker, and where &quot;Colors in the Steel&quot; was - in my opinion - worth 5+ stars, this sequel is hardly worth two. Main problem: The story surrounding Bardas Loredan's family turns very grotesque and bizarre in this one, which pretty-much destroys the great story line, writing, and character continuation from &quot;Colors&quot;. Loredan is turned from a heroic-though-tragic commander of the now-lost Great City to a vengeful hermit with regardsa to his family, and in the process of becoming a bowyer, helps to break-up his family with a very tragic and brutally-vengeful Bardas becoming more of a monster than a person who - though had character flaws (as everyone does) - was able to mount an effective defence of Permeida.K.J. Parker does a good job with the characters from Book #1, and does a great job of showing how Bardas and his family have problems: a typical dysfunctional family - at least in the beginning. However, the instance involving Bardas becoming less-than-human totally destroys what would otherwise have been a truly interesting character in a series which began with a terrible battle in which Bardas becomes at least a sentimental hero. (Anyone who reads this book - and I don't recommend it, will see what I mean) What Bardas could have become in this book is a military-leader-in-hiding who could have &quot;licked his wounds&quot; in this tale and then turned out to be totally heroic elsewhere. however, again, the story takes a sickening twist, one that left me shocked and turned off to the Third Installment of the &quot;Fencer Trilogy&quot;.Parker's technical writing - again - shows an ability that far exceeds most of his peers, with descriptions of the area and islands and the cities, military weapons, formations, strategies and tactics, and battle being easy to understand, helping the reader to see what's going on. His character development of Bardas' brother and his family, sister and her position, and vengeful niece, not to mention the feud between two powerful entities, makes this story very interesting. The Religious figures from Book #1 also are int his one and again are called upon to aid and abet both sides in this confilct, their characteristics again superbly intertwined in the story. However, as mentioned above, this story took a very dark and (in my opinion) unnecessary turn, one that has turned me off from K.J. Parker and Book #3. This is definitely a case of &quot;what could have been&quot;. If you have any kind of love for your immediate and extended family, this book will leave you sick at your stomach."},{"Title":"The Belly of the Bow (Fencer, Book 2)","review":"Shastel is a country owned and run by an academic foundation, whose bank holds the debts of its impoverished citizens in perpetuity. Spying an opportunity for profit, the Loredan Bank has taken over the nearby island of Scona and is undercutting the Foundation's economy, sparking a trade war that is in danger of turning very real and very bloody. For Bardas Loredan, living in seclusion as a bowyer in Scona's backwater, the last thing he wants is anything to do with the schemes of his ruthless brother and pragmatic sister. But he is soon drawn into the conflict, even as he comes to realise that his attempts to live a good life may be nothing more than a sham.The Belly of the Bow is the second volume of K.J. Parker's Fencer Trilogy. At first glance, this is a slighter novel than Colours in the Steel. Whilst Colours centred around a massive siege and the attempts to defend a city, The Belly of the Bow is a much more personal story focused on the dysfunctional Loredan family. The war this time is more in the background, and played for maximum cynical impact. Parker's black humour and refusal to glorify the horrors of war combine to provide a damning indictment of violent conflict and the reasons for it.As a personal, more character-focused story the novel takes a while to get going. The complex relationships between Bardas, his sister, brother and niece are built up steadily but the thematic point of the novel is elusive until a shocking late-novel development throws everything into sharp relief. The book is essentially a character study of Bardas Loredan, who believes himself to be the 'good' member of the family, a hard worker who sends money home to his younger two brothers on their farm and has always tried to do the right thing. As the novel demonstrates, Bardas is kidding himself (his previous careers as soldier and lawyer-at-arms being steeped in blood and mayhem) and his self-belief is a rather brittle thing. When faced with a revelation of a betrayal on an massive scale, his reaction isn't reasoned or understanding, but a cruel and merciless lashing out that is genuinely unexpected.The novel pivots on this moment (which happens very late in the book) and doesn't fully work until you realise that moment - a moment of gut-wrenching horror that even George R.R. Martin might consider excessive - is coming. As such, the book works a bit better on re-reads. However, as well as Bardas the novel concentrates a lot on his brother, Gorgas. Gorgas is best described as an ex-sociopath who has genuinely reformed from being a violent lunatic and is now seeking to make amends for his past mistakes. Unfortunately, Gorgas is rather disturbingly single-minded in this attempt to seek redemption, and the crimes he commits to achieve it actually dwarf his original offence. The contrast between the two brothers (and Bardas's angry denials he is anything like his brother, which ring increasingly hollow as the trilogy unfolds) is a key point of the novel that Parker develops effectively.As with much of Parker's work, the tone is often deceptively light-hearted whilst masking a cynical edge, the humour is jet black and the characterisation is strong, but takes a while to come to the fore. Also, as it standard, the novel is packed with information on the creation and use of a standard fantasy weapon of war, in this case the bow. These passages of mechanical engineering may appear skip-worthy, but Parker actually cleverly uses the bow as a metaphor for her(?) characters and the world they live in. Other characters from Colours in the Steel return and there is some more information on the Principal (less of a magic system than an ability to nudge future probabilities to get a more favourable outcome, but due to chaos theory this is wildly unpredictable), but the focus is firmly on the Loredan family and their issues.The Belly of the Bow (****) is a less-obviously engaging novel than its forebear, but once the scope of Parker's ambition for the book becomes clear it turns into a much more impressive work. The novel is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"The Belly of the Bow (Fencer, Book 2)","review":"This was not a great book, and I'd rather give it about 3 1/2 stars, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and rounded up. The thing about this book is that it's not like most fantasy novels, where the fate of the world is at stake against unspeakable evil. The best way I can think of describing this book is that it's not too serious. It reads more like the author is just having fun and taking some shots at different types of people, similar to a book like Catch 22 by Joseph Heller. There is a war in the background, but it is really incidental to the story. It's really a book about people and how they relate to each other. But like I said, it's not very serious, so you don't really get caught up in worrying if they're going to win or to survive because it doesn't seem to matter that much. Unfortunately, the lack of seriousness makes it hard to be affected by the tragic moments because you can't just switch moods like that.I found this one easier to read than the first book in the series, which really seemed to drag. Not a lot happens in either book, and I can't say I highly recommend the series, but if you are sick of the same old thing in fantasy, you might want to try this for a change of pace."},{"Title":"The Belly of the Bow (Fencer, Book 2)","review":"I'm a huge fan of the author's work, and while I agree that the scenes near the end of the book are among the most grotesque I've read, I also could understand the character's insanity driving him to it...If you're a fan of fiction that is well researched and written, I'd recommend the series, but be aware you'll need a strong stomach to make it through this one."},{"Title":"The Belly of the Bow (Fencer, Book 2)","review":"I loved the first book.

But anyway - the first book was ok.And this, second one, was more or less OK too, until that bizzare turn in the end that left me totally disgusted with the only male persona in this book that I could simpatized with. I think the author completely lost it here - it was absolutely out of character of Bardas and totally uncalled for. It's too bad I bought the 3-rd book already.

Jan T. Gross) have advanced the disingenuous argument that Poles were willing to incur the German-imposed death penalty for harboring radios and guns, but much less so for harboring Jews. To begin with, everyone knows that getting away with hiding a forbidden object is much more likely than getting away with hiding a human being. As it turns out, Poles weren't particularly risk-taking when it came to radios either: \\"Radios in private hands were a rarity, their possession punishable by death.\\" (p. 72). As for black marketeering, Poles really had no choice, and they knew furthermore that the death penalty upon being caught wasn't consistently enforced: \\"To survive, the inhabitants of Warsaw had to use the black market...In my place, a real gendarme would, at his most benevolent, confiscate the goods, and at worst let go with his sub-machine gun. Searches of trains often ended in the shooting of women and men traveling with contraband food supplies.\\" (p. 83)Likiernik describes his experiences in KEDYW (KIEROWNICTWO DYWERSJI, or Directorate of Sabotage) (pp. 67-70), which included the blowing up of a German train that was taking ammunition to the Russian Front. He played a direct role in the assassinations of German officials, including Commander Schmalz (pp. 96-97) and the Gestapo agents Jung and Hoffman (p. 103). KEDYW was somewhat better armed than other AK units (p. 107), but some 70% of KEDYW members later perished during the Warsaw Uprising (p. 147).Just before the Uprising, Likiernik had what turned out to be a prophetic experience: \\"My friend Roman Mularczyk (later known as Roman Bratny, the celebrated writer) came to see me several days before the Rising. \`Mark my words,' he said. \`The Russians will provoke an insurrection in Warsaw and when we start fighting, they'll stop their advance and let the Germans finish us off.'\\" (p. 111). And so it happened: A vast sea of death and destruction.During the Uprising, the most unpleasant German weapon was the Nebelwerfer (\\"bellowing cow\\" or \\"wardrobe\\"; p. 123). Likiernik was wounded a number of times, and had to be moved from a field hospital because the Germans would murder the wounded (pp. 117-118).After the war, Likiernik observed the Communist takeover of Poland from a Polish mission in Paris. He also noted: \\"The demeanor of the new arrivals from Poland, especially of the officers, was getting increasingly strange. Some communists of Jewish origin could hardly even speak Polish.\\" (p. 178)."},{"Title":"By Devil's Luck: A Tale of Resistance in Wartime Warsaw","review":"After so many books and movies about Poland in World War II, you may think that there is no more left to learn.

This book is a must read for young and old alike."},{"Title":"By Devil's Luck: A Tale of Resistance in Wartime Warsaw","review":"Hopefully this review will provide some balance as this is not really a 5 star book. By Devil's Luck had the potential to be an extremely compelling, exciting, and interesting read. Despite its flaws it was interesting because it concerned events and first person experiences that are not contained in other books of WW II and Poland. Hence it is a rarity in the under-recognized and under-appreciated history of heroic Polish resistance. This is the story of Stanisaw Likiernik, a young Pole who was living in the vicinity of Warsaw at the outbreak of WW II. It is written in the first person in a memoir style and, mimicking memory, it is not strictly a linear telling, but digresses in a kind of stream of consciousness of reminiscence. This adds to the authenticity of voice in this story.Likiernik discusses his father's arrest by the Nazis, his short tenure as a clandestine student in the Polish Underground State's schools, his becoming a soldier in the underground and his joining the sabotage and execution unit of the AK, known as the Kedyw. All of this has the makings of a very exciting story and the notion of reading about his exploits and the context of those exploits had me salivating, especially since my own father was a saboteur and had other dark duties as part of the AK and the Cichociemni.My problems with the way that Likiernik wrote this book, was its marked self-consciousness. Although we learn something of the context during which his history unfolded, we learn more about him than perhaps we want to. What we have here is an unintended character study. The pages of this telling do not endear us to this gentleman. He comes off as spoiled, arrogant, and a \\"know it all.\\" He knows more than his teachers, for whom he has no time at any time during his schooling, whether academic or military. While I might have agreed with his contention about the utility of parts of the military education to which he was subjected during the days of his AK underground training, rather than dismiss it out of hand, he could have told us the reason for some of it. According to Stefan Korbonski, the last chief of the underground state, the military training given the AK included such topics as guerilla warfare, resistance, and clandestine activities, but also military background, theory and historical traditions. Rather than to dismiss the latter with contempt, I would have hoped that Likiernik might have looked upon it as a way to preserve the Polish culture despite all of the German (and Soviet) efforts to stamp it out. These kinds of flashes of personality came through a number of times and it did not particularly render me sympathetic to the author, in spite of his laudable courage, intellect, tenacity, and patriotism, as well as the suffering that he endured.I wanted less of Likiernik and more of the story of \\"how.\\" For example, at the beginning of the chapter on \\"The underground as a way of life\\" he tells us that he is not sure exactly how he became a full-time member of the Underground. Although this is a reminiscence by an elderly gentleman, this is a rather extraordinary contention insofar as the events that he describes from this time in his life were transformational and unforgettable. But perhaps I will not remember events in detail when I am in my 80s, so maybe I am being overly harsh in my criticism. But, again, it underscored my sense that this memoir was more about him than the context and events. I wanted more context and detail about the process of how the insurgents operated - e.g. How did he get the orders from his superiors? What was the role of the liaisons and runners in his getting these orders? What exact training did he receive?There is a curious lack of affect that is missing from these pages. I have read several memoirs of WW II times. Wesley Adamczyk's book \\"When God Turned the Other Way\\" is infused with suffering, anguish, and intense love of family. Stefan Wajdenfeld's \\"The Ice Road\\" is permeated with hope, sadness, suffering and intense love of family. Likiernik's telling of his story is about him and his family is simply there. We cannot tell what it is that his family means to him.Another observation has to do with his curious asides about his agnosticism/atheism. If these were skillfully done, they would add to the story. There are so many memoirs that credit a deity as the source of strength for one's courage and resilience, that I (as a non believer) would have been gratified to see a sense that one can go within oneself and reach out to relationships, in lieu of the abstract of a god for meaning. Wajdenfeld pulled this off in \\"The Ice Road\\" without pounding us over the head, Likiernik's commentaries are simply gratuitous.Finally I am adding a note about writing, which for the most part is fine. However, there were some translation hiccups. There were some grammatical stumbles and some awkward translations. For example, with respect to the latter, the term \\"mug shot\\" used several times is really a slang term and should more properly and simply been \\"photograph\\" especially for identification papers. My understanding of \\"mug shot\\" is that of a photo taken in a police station of a person who has been arrested. Also, some terms were not explained. For example, the term \\"proud flesh\\" is not a term that most lay persons understand. Actually, even the proper medical term, \\"keloid scarring\\" is not one that is widely known. Such terms should have been explained. There were others, but this review is already getting too long.So, was I happy I read this book? Absolutely. Did I learn anything? Yes. Does it have flaws? Of course. Would I read it again, knowing this? Most assuredly.It gave me some insight into what was happening during this chaotic time in Poland's history, and every block and brick is valuable building material in my ongoing journey of understanding."},{"Title":"Foundations of Tort Law","review":"What law and econ book would be complete without the Coase theorm?

They spend most of the book trying to abuse the heroine and her friend."},{"Title":"A Gentleman's Daughter (A Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"This is apparently Isabel Linton's debut novel, and the plot is certainly unique (and has been described in the editorial review).The heroine is appealing, the hero is in an untenable position but is completely honourable. The absence of money and connections becomes a major issue in the story, as it was in real life. The debauchery of some members of the aristocracy is also fully exposed here, to a point that may be hard to take for some readers.What I found hard to take (apart from the rape and other forms of abuse) was the almost caricature-like portrayals of the three villains in the book. Insanity was suggested by the hero's friend as the reason for the way they behaved, but I felt that to be too simplistic. I was also astounded that the hero had no idea that they were likely to behave in that manner, considering how close he was to them.I have to agree that Victoria was the perfect victim, empty-headed, gullible, malleable and with no father and no healthy male relations to protect her; her mother was also totally hopeless, making the wrong decision at virtually every moment. I was slightly astonished that the heroine would be chosen as the victim, considering her greater strength and presence of mind; I can only suppose that she was considered a challenge, doubly or triply so.I do have one or two caveats. Some of the settings for the more revealing conversations are far-fetched; it is unlikely that the Viscount would be openly talking about his plans at Almack's for one. There was at times too much conversation, which did not really reveal much apart from how good or how bad certain characters were. The embezzlement of the hero's fortune was slightly far-fetched, given that his father's access to the fortune (if not the income) would have been limited. [Embezzlements therefore commonly happened when the trustees or the actual professionals handling the money were dishonest; marriage settlements were set up precisely to prevent the situation described from happening].Finally, regarding a crucial dismissal of one of the girl's maids, it is hard to imagine that any house servant would dare to take such action summarily, without recourse to the employer. A servant could not be dismissed by the servants of another noble household; she might well be accused of thievery, immoral behavior, and so forth, but the dismissal could come only from the employer. These were some minor points that seemed to be errors.While I do not care generally for such melodramatic situations, I found the hero and heroine very appealing, and just wished that they could have been situated somewhat differently. I hope that Miss Linton can create such appealing characters in somewhat less melodramatic settings. On the other hand, her ability to create ordinary and decent people and place them in highly unusual families and settings might go down better with other readers."},{"Title":"Mastiff (Your dog books)","review":"This book provides an insight into an ancient &amp; noble breed with many pictures of mastiffs throughout history.

The title is misleading in that even if romance isn't the goal, the guide is useful in finding a classy place to visit. Explanations that accompany each entry are detailed and points out what's great, what's not great, prices, and everything that you'd want to jot down if you were investigating the place yourself.Excellent in all respects. I highly recommend it.A brief note on the 5th edition. I actually bought the 4th edition a while back and recently bought the 5th edition thinking that I needed to get an &quot;update.&quot; The editor in the 5th edition claims that there have been a number of updates since the 4th edition. However, I've sat down, spent a better part of a day, and compared a large part of each book, literally side-by-side, and I don't see any difference in the content! The only differences I do see are the use of different fonts, a slightly different page layout, and bigger type size (making the page count higher, which may be the only for the change in type size). Frankly, there's no reason for this 5th edition to have been published at all! If you happen to see the 4th edition in a bargain/used bin, get that instead. There's really no reason to &quot;upgrade&quot; to the 5th edition if you already own the 4th edition.

This is a well-designed, well-written volume on what the threats are, how they work, and what there is on hand to resist those threats.Viruses, worms, denial of service attacks are just the beginning of this. Rubin dissects the Morris Worm, Melissa, ILove You, and several other malicious invertebrates. His explanations of just how these infiltrative beasties work is just brilliant.The sections on secure transfer, setting up session keys, SSL, and encrypted email are really fine.This is a \`\`different'' security book: and it's one you need."},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"I am a senior engineer for network security operations. I read this book because I try to learn from authors who have demonstrated expertise in the security field. I recommend reading &quot;White Hat Security Arsenal&quot; (WHSA) if you are looking for a bridge between the academic/research security world and the practical, hands-on world. I also recommend it if you want in-depth discussions of the how and why of various security &quot;solutions.&quot;Two aspects of WHSA differentiate it from the competition. First, the author (Avi) shows he keeps tabs on the security research community, and relates important findings to the reader. For example, as an intrusion detector I recognized the author's references to papers on &quot;traceback&quot; problems. For areas I don't monitor closely, like cryptography, Avi explains how certain less publicized protocols and algorithms could benefit users and administrators. Should I want to progress beyond Avi's discussion, I can follow the links and read the papers he cites.Second, the author delivers content via a &quot;problem-threat-answer&quot; method. He doesn't simply list technologies. For example, in chapter 9 Avi asks &quot;Assume that Alice and Bob have session keys for encryption and authentication. How do they protect their communication?&quot; Avi then describes the threat (essentially an adversary who controls the network between Alice and Bob). He continues with a discussion of alternatives (encryption, authentication, etc.) and concludes with a case study (IPSec). Avi's focus on problems rather than technologies is refreshing.WHSA has a few shortcomings. A good portion of the book (chapters 4-9) centers on cryptography. Users who can decipher function notations like &quot;a^y mod p&quot; and so on will be comfortable, but others may cringe. I also felt a mismatch existed between the explanation of threats (mainly viruses in chapter 3) and the material that followed. While Avi's discussion of historically important malicious code (Morris worm, Melissa virus, etc.) was useful, it seems to reinforce the uninformed manager's opinion that malicious code is the ultimate threat to computer security. (DDoS was briefly a concern, but viruses impacting end users gets the most air time.)Overall, WHSA is a good book for security professionals looking to answer the how and why questions. Avi gives insights on such topics as PGP vs. S/MIME, the drawbacks of Microsoft Passport, and why long-term secret keys should be used to create short-term session keys. Readers are guided by his problem-threat-solution framework, and have an opportunity to learn of some of the best academic work available. Given that all of the material is framed with case studies (how to use SSL in a web browser, how to perform back-ups, and so on), most readers will find WHSA valuable."},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"For any IT professional, or any executive management that is supported by or has to manage and collaborate with technology teams, finally a book that addresses &quot;problems&quot; and &quot;solutions&quot; across the tech landscape -- all in one book. The sections deal with how to secure systems across the IT landscape, specifically Threat, Storage, Data Transmission, Network Threats, Privacy &amp; Commerce. Whether you are a non-technical manager needing a primer, or a CTO of a Fortune 500 company, Mr. Rubin lays out the landscape in an accessible format, covering the theory and practice of security. Then he goes farther by helping today's execs and IT professionals accomplish what he does for his hi-tech clients, with actionable strategies and solutions."},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"+AH4-Every year, tens of thousands of people land a network security management job for the first time - often by accident, as they get promoted to be the senior system administrator or network operations manager. They need to learn about threats and countermeasures, fast, and don't have the time to go into the kind of detail you find in an infosec MSc course or even a CISSP qualification.What book do you recommend to someone in that situation?Until I got a copy of Avi Rubin's \`White Hat+AH4-+AH4- Security Arsenal', I'd probably have suggested that they read Cheswick and Bellovin's \`Firewalls and Internet Security', or Spafford and Garfinkel's \`Practical Unix and Internet Security'. Now, I think Avi's book has edged into the lead. I believe that, like them, it will come to be seen as a classic; unlike them, it was written recently rather than in the early-to-mid 1990s.As well as the basic nuts and bolts of things like access control, firewalls, and cryptography, it looks at the+AH4-+AH4- latest viruses and worms (on which surprisingly little has been written since Word viruses took over the lead from DOS viruses several years ago); remote backup services; popular crypto protocols and products such as SSL and Passport; and anonymity services.It is not so much aimed at the engineer who has to design and build new systems (for that, see my own book \`Security Engineering'), but the user or administrator who wants to take commodity products such as web servers, routers and+AH4-+AH4- firewalls, and configure them in an intelligent way. I believe it succeeds in this task; it teaches enough of the underlying cryptography and system science, without getting too bogged down in detail. It also includes a number of case studies that illustrate, motivate, and help the reader develop some feel for the technical aspects of security management.I expect that this book will do well. It deserves to,+AH4-"},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"When I first saw this cover, I thought it was silly. I still think that it is a silly cover, but it is a great book. The first thing I like about it is the idea of chapters covering specific problems. The PGP Disk section that explains how to store data on a computer was great, and I've started using that program. It's not just a product endorsement book, though. The explanations are very detailed, and simple enough to follow even though I do not have a security background. My degree is in general computer science. I've checked out other security books, but this is the one I like the most. The writing style is very entertaining. There is good information, and it is presented in an interesting way. That is rare. I wish that the book covered more problems. For example, there is only a brief section on denial of service, which is something many of my clients are asking about. Also, the virus section is very good, but it is dated. Obviously, it was written before Code Red. I'm not sure what the author could do about that, but maybe a companion web site would be good. I also thought that the chapter about backup systems might get dated quickly. There are companies presented, and many of them are probably already out of business. However, the author covers the philosophy behind these companies and why they are good or bad, so I guess it will not be dated that quickly. All in all, I think this is the best security book I have seen, and for someone who has actual security problems, or in my case, clients with real security problems, it is a great educational tool."},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"This book explained to me how to solve the problems that I deal with all the time in my job.

As an early reviewer of the manuscript, I knew that the IT community, charged with actually implementing security as opposed to simply studying it, was in for a real treat. While most security books (including my two books &quot;Java Security&quot; and &quot;Securing Java&quot;) focus on technologies and require readers to internalize many concepts in order to get something useful out of them, the &quot;White-Hat Security Arsenal&quot; keeps its eye on the ball. It is directly focused on solving real security problems that IT professonals have to contend with every day. For example, Avi's book has answers that explain:How to secure data.The threats on the Internet, and what can you do about them.Why malicious code is an issue, and how to deal with it.Avi did an excellent job bringing the right problems to the forefront, and the solutions demonstrate his great expertise and experience. Building secure systems (and especially software...see my new book &quot;Building Secure Software&quot;) is the best pro-active solution to security, but as long as we're stuck in the real world, there are plenty of other things to focus on! Avi's book complements &quot;Building Secure Software&quot; wonderfully.Buy this book."},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"Computer security is only one of many things that everyone knows is critical, but few have time for until the situation requires it. However, like documentation, process and all of the other neglected facets we all struggle to achieve, the only way to do it effectively is to incorporate it into your daily schedule. To do that, it is necessary to know the fundamentals of security, which is the point of this book. The security of a computer system is an ultimate team sport. No matter how talented your security experts, all of their efforts can be defeated by a simple error made by the most junior member of the team. In fact, there is an enormous amount of anecdotal evidence indicating that most security breaches are preventable by utilizing the most simple of rules. However, the very simplicity of those rules tend to numb people to their essential nature, as the typical person is more likely to break a simple rule than a complex one that appears critical. After all, doing this simple thing one time won&#65533;t hurt will it?The security principles put forward in this book are all in the basic category, presented in a clear, concise manner that is easy to understand. The topics are:* Viruses and worms* Secure data storage* Secure data transfers* Protecting a network* Performing secure e-commerce transactions.I fall into the category of someone who is concerned about security, knows something about it, wants to know more, but always puts it aside because I quickly grow tired of reading material that comes across as sensational. The one thing that really sold me on this book is the lack of sensationalism, with security problems being presented in a professional, non-technical manner rather than dire predictions of disasters lurking on the flip side of every hard drive.All of us in computing need to know the basics of security at the very least and even basic users should know more than that. This book is a good place to start and I urge everyone to learn the simple rules. Admonitions like &#65533;don&#65533;t play with fire&#65533; may be simple, but they save more grief than any complex rule set could ever do."},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"I bought this book along with many others a while back. I am a network security consultant. I wanted to broaden my skills a bit and make sure my knowledge was up to par with others in the field.I found this book very incomplete and dated. Most of the information was relevant about 5 years ago. Since then tatics and technologies have changed rather significantly.For example, the book does not even mention intrusion detection systems. This is a staple technology of the security community and any hacker worth his weight would focus a great deal of energy on circumnavigating or overloading these devices.Also, the book treats firewalls as the &quot;end all be all&quot; of network security. Which simply is not the case. Firewalls are important, but certainly not the only security product you implement.Pass this book by and go for much better books such as Hackers Challenge or Know Your Enemy by the Honeynet team."},{"Title":"White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats","review":"This was a curiosity read and I found it a pretty good introduction to the security world.Due to the age of the book; it is becoming dated as some links in the book no longer work. But I will say that I found the missing information on the Net. Some of the software mentioned have been retired or no longer exists. For example; Netscape communicator and the old PGP package offered by the old Network Associates.One area that might make a neophyte go into a comma was chapters 4-9 as a rather dry discussion of cryptology is presented. The information is good but to somebody who is curious about security might find it rather boring.A good thing about this book is that it doesn't provide solutions via the favorite software or devices of the day. It presents a problem and offer ways to analyze it and deploy a solution. This is something lacking in a few books as it does open a readers mind to thinking about how to deal with issues.The book also talks a little about the famous incidents of the past such as the Morris worm and some viral attacks. But again due to the age, spyware is not really discussed.Overall, this is a decent book as it will discuss things like PGP, S/MIME, SSL, and tools such as a sniffer.The best part of the book is the information offered at the end of each chapter.

In The Art of War, Sun Tzu advised, &quot;Know yourself and know your enemy. You will be safe in every battle.&quot; This book adds a modern dimension to The Art of War. Think of it as a network security report that discusses your enemy's strengths and tactics.Part I of this book succinctly covers the basics of risk identification and some of the more common sources of risks. It covers some of the more famous viruses and worms using a 5-part format for each of the ten examples that I particularly liked: (1) What it hit and what it did, (2) how and why it worked, (3) the consequences, (4) how we recovered and (5) lessons learned. Yes, the incidents are old, but the same pattern keeps resurfacing. The &quot;How and why it worked&quot; part of each discussion was particularly interesting, and is the cornerstone of why the author's format provides a wealth of information from which a model emerges. The five-part structure is an excellent template for maintaining profiles of threats as they are reported by CERT CC or your preferred source of security incident information.The remainder of the book covers (Part II) storing data securely. The chapter on secure backup is particularly good, (PART III) secure data transfers. Contains a treasure trove of information on cryptographic vulnerabilities and how to mitigate or avoid the associate risks, (Part IV) protecting against network threats. Chapters in this part give some excellent defensive strategies, and (Part V) commerce and privacy. The credit card discussion is must reading for anyone who makes or accepts credit card payments over the web; the discussion on privacy is also must reading).This book will provide you with intelligence on your enemy. You may never know who that enemy is, but understanding their strengths, weapons, and tactics will give you a fighting chance.

On the hacker's uniform are the names of various computer tools and vulnerabilities, such as Ping of Death. Lined up opposite the hacker is a group of eight much smaller information security professionals. This picture effectively displays the nature of information security today: a lone powerful hacker attempting to break through the (often weak) overmatched defensive line of information security.But author Aviel D. Rubin does not rely on cute illustrations alone. A noted security educator and researcher, Rubin collects his experiences in the information security arena in this book and provides an excellent field guide to the fundamentals of securing computer systems against attack. Rubin gives a solid overview of each security problem; he then provides advice and refers the reader to additional resources for deeper analysis and understanding, all in easy-to-read prose. While Rubin has a Ph.D., his writing style is decidedly unacademic, and he never talks down to the reader.Most of the chapters begin by giving the reader a real-world introduction to the problem at hand. Rubin then elaborates on the various technologies and solutions involved. Most chapters also include a case study, which helps to make these esoteric security concepts more understandable.Rubin also succeeds in putting the plethora of risks and vulnerabilities into perspective. Knowing which ones to worry about (and to worry less about) is critical to the proper ranking and handling of information security issues.Among the issues addressed are viruses and worms, physical security, firewalls, cryptography, denial of service attacks, and privacy. The reader comes out of the detailed discussion of these issues with a broad understanding of the elements involved within information systems security.In this case, one can judge a book by its cover.

These illegal acts are generally committed by and for the benefit of two groups. The first are committed by members of their own communist Cuban government to collect funds for government departments and projects, The second group is constituted by Latin Americans sympathizers of Cuban's communist government; they commit criminals acts that range from bank robberies to hostage taking to finance their armed fights.These criminals acts are supported economically and logistically by the communist government of Cuba in their pursuit to export and duplicate the Cuban model across Latin America."},{"Title":"In the Pirates Den: My Life as a Secret Agent","review":"In The Pirate's Den: My Life As A Secret Agent For Castro is the autobiography of Jorge Masetti, a man who worked as a secret agent for Fidel Castro for twenty years.

In what amounts to a stimulating autobiography of an Argentinian who grew up in Castro's Revolution, Masetti weaves his life's story by revealing astonishing facts concerning Cuba's aggressive attempts at undermining both the US and Latin America. The son of an Argentinian revolutionary who supported Fidel's guerilla movement, Masetti describes his loyal commitment to Castro's worldview, only to be dissilutioned by the brutal betrayal of his father-in-law. Readers will learn of Cuba's support for anti-US terrorist organizations and their attacks on US soil. You'll also learn how Fidel Castro successfully supported/advised triumphant Marxist groups. Yet, the most powerful message is left for last, as Masetti undergoes a painful awakening to Castro's brutality, coupled with a deeply moving self-examination about his blind support for an inhumane system.This is a great read.

First, it is a very detailed account of the life of a Cuban spy who worked for the cause of the \\"Revolution\\" for twenty years. The author's life covers his time in Cuba, Argentina, Nicaragua, Colombia, Panama, Mexico and Angola. This book shows just the kind of things that the Cuban government has been up to since the 1960s. On a second level, this book is outstanding in that it clearly demonstrates the failure of the \\"Revolution\\"--and this told from the point of view of a former true believer. The author has done a valuable service by writing this book and telling his story. Those with an interest in Cuba and Latin America will find this book to be well worth your time."},{"Title":"In the Pirates Den: My Life as a Secret Agent","review":"This book is required reading for anybody who wishes to understand the truth about Fidel Castro's Cuba and the damage it has done to the United States, Latin America, and the world. The bunglers who convinced John Kennedy (against his instincts)to refrain from removing Castro at all costs while we still could at relatively moderate cost, have the blood of countless thousands on their hands. This \\"little island\\" led by a sinister, violent crackpot, has done as much real damage to our interests and to the lives of millions of innocent, decent people, as all our other enemies combined. From 1959 to the present day Castro has been intimately involved in fomenting war, terrorism, and the obstruction of genuine democratic reform in countries the world over. Cuban-backed guerrilla movements, though they wandered into a bloody political and military dead end, did much to rob Latin America of the opportunity for 40 years of political and economic development. Military dictatorships across the continent were provoked time and again by terror campaigns directed from Havana. I could say more, but it will suffice to say I know Cuba well, and this book is true."},{"Title":"In the Pirates Den: My Life as a Secret Agent","review":"He took life as a game, took sides with the socialist revolution, and got cheated on. Late did he realize that life is a man's job, and that the revolution was a one man's game: Castro's.The true nature of the revolution: \\"The revolution was a cover for committing atrocities without the slightest vestige og guilt ... we were young and irresponsible. We were pirates. We formed our own caste ... we belonged to and believed in nothing -no religion, no flag, no morality or principle. It's fortunate we didn't win, because if we had, we would have drowned the continent in barbarism.\\"The candidness with which the author details his role in the socialist tentacles of Castro in Latin-America and Italy, makes the book a very entertaining, as well as educational, experience.Masetti's middle-class family life is typical of would-be revolutionaries in Latin America: petit-bourgeois. Caf&eacute;s, promiscuity, idelness, not wanting to work, irresponsibility, and a desire for adventure (whomever it hurts): \\"After smoking (marihuana) I felt like Che Guevara, Jim Morrison, Fidel Castro, Napoleon -all of them rolled together.\\" His first girl-friend is his female version: \\"Her parents were rich and gave her everything except affection.\\" The perfect breeding ground for terrorist punks.\\"All I wanted was to become a member of a military squad.\\" Once he's past the leftist, revolutionary scheme, the world opens for him: \\"Without realizing it, I had just entered the world of 'important people -the nomenklatura.\\" What about equalitarianism? \\"They gave me a charge card that was like a magic key to the good life ... I tried to be careful not to consume more than was necessary. I knew there were shortages in Cuba and that the Cubans were forbidden the delicacies to which I had access. What surprised me was how the party officials who were assigned to me took advantage of the situation.\\"Cowboy mentality and irresponsibility: \\"When I saw what we had, I almost went crazy with joy ... pistols, revolvers, rifles, submachine guns...\\"How to co-opt gullible peons in the West: \\"Journalists, businessmen, politicians: they were all potential contacts. If they showed the slightest sympathy for the Cuban revolution, they would be given 'the treatment' ... There may be many people who would be surprised to see that they had files and to learn that they were Cuban agents without knowing it.\\"The socialists'love of luxuries: \\"When he (Pelado) returned to managua after the assassination of Somoza, the Sandinistas had rewarded them with the rank of major ... like other comandantes, he lived in a luxurious house in Managua and was chauffered around in a Mercedes Benz.\\"\\"The children of high class officials in Cuba usually behave like a caste apart, flaunting their dynastic privileges.\\"Imperialism: \\"Angola was not Cuba, nor even Nicaragua ... many of the indigenous combatants were not volunteers but forcibly recruited slaves ... for the Angolan people, the Cuban presence meant the continuation of war, when their deepest desire was for peace.\\"The real Che: \\"That's the method the Guevarista culture recommends: shoot the weak, those who express doubt.\\"Author's final confession and regret: \\"(In Miami) I met former Cuban political prisoners from the first years of the revolution. I was surprised to find that these men had fought against Batista, inspired by the same idealism that guided other young people of Latin America in their fights against the continent's dictatorships. But what surprised me most was the fact that they welcomed me into their midst in spite of the fact that I was the spoiled child of those who had imprisoned them.\\" \\"During those years of conflict, all we did was destroy. We built nothing.\\"Awesome book.

Of course, within the whole genre, few stories actually are real violent gun-slingers, but for some reason people tend to think that a &quot;good western&quot; is a Clint Eastwood kind of constant-killing story. Admittedly, when I read westerns, that's actually what I prefer - a real frontier justice, shoot-them-until-they're-dead-and-then-kill-them-some-more knid of story, and I bought this book thinking it would be the same. Why did I think so? Becaause of the blurb on the back cover. Yes it has violence, and some gunslinging, but golly, it's not the most important part of the story, and, also by golly, I really, really liked it anyway.It's a pretty darn good story of a &quot;wild west&quot; that is in process of being tamed - the story centers around the main character who is an engineer in charge of building a damn, and the labor struggles he has with the mexican laborers, and, how could it be otherwise? the struggles he has with the woman he really loves who happens to be the sister of a rich boy the main character met many years before who is now working for the main character as a common laborer because he is eschewing his rich, east-coast upbringing in order to discover what it is to be a man.Now, in the realm of books about what-it-means-to-be-a-man, this is not one of the highest literary achievements, but it does pretty darn well, and I'm quite impressed with it.I'm prety in comparison with the generation that grew up with Max Brand, too, but I loved reading the book. I was compelled to keep turning pages because I liked the characters, and because the story was very interesting and written well enough. It is not a book with &quot;impressive&quot; writing skills (i.e., exciting metaphors, similes, allusions, symbolism), but it is an exciting read. It is very close to being great, but doesn't quite make it, and I say that because the author, while writing very well, is not writing in what I would call an &quot;artistic&quot; way - a way that makes us rethink who we are as people, as individuals, etc., and he does not write in a way that excites us with his creative and original use of words - because he isn't creative or original. Brand is still awfully darn compellnig, though, as an author, and this book is recommended, even to those who (like me) actually prefer our westerns to be full of shooting, killing, violence, and black-and-white senses of justice."},{"Title":"Cabin Collectibles","review":"If you are interested in the rustic or Adirondack style, you are no doubt already familiar with Ralph Kylloe, the author of several fine books related to this style. &quot;Cabin Collectibles,&quot; Kylloe's latest offering, purports to offer &quot;a broad overview of antique cabin collectibles.&quot; The photographs, taken by Kylloe, are beautiful, though many of the scenes depicted appeared previously in another of his books, &quot;Rustic Style.&quot; The text, however, is disappointing. A chapter on canoes and paddles reads like a high school sophomore's report on the evolution of canoes in North America. Statements like: &quot;The teardrop shapes of canoe paddles and the graceful, sensual, sweeping lines of canoes carry emotional overtones,&quot; and &quot;Men's snowshoes tended to be larger than women's. Small snowshoes were also made for children,&quot; offer little insight to the would-be collector. Insipid statements like, &quot;Human beings have an incredible propensity to collect things,&quot; regularly appear in the text and then, annoyingly, again as captions for photographs. While Kylloe offers a few gratuitous remarks on collecting, &quot;You don't have to have 10,000 twig stands to fill every last corner of your house...,&quot; one could realistically expect something a bit more helpful from a person who boasts of collecting in less than two months &quot;more than 350 pairs of antique skis and poles, 350 pairs of antique snowshoes, 200 fishing creels, 250 antique sleds, 200 antique camp signs, hundreds of old bamboo fly rods, and more rustic stuff than I can remember.&quot; The book's greatest shortcoming is its failure even to mention so many wonderful cabin collectibles: mounted birds and fish, paintings and prints of rural scenes and nature, camp blankets, fishing reels and rods, souvenir pennants, balsam pillows, and indian busts, to name but a few. While some of these items appear in the photographs, they are not mentioned in the text. If you are thinking about purchasing this book, don't. Get a better return for your money with &quot;Adirondack Style, Cabin Fever, Inside Log Homes,&quot; or even Kylloe's &quot;Rustic Style.&quot; Any one of these books offers better ideas on cabin collectibles."},{"Title":"Cabin Collectibles","review":"Love this book.

So in the fall of 2000 we can out with CABIN COLLECTIBLES.Designed to answer basic questions about only a few of many items often used to decorate rustic settings the book has been very well received from the public as well as from professional reviewers including:\\"Love this Book!\\" Beth Anderson, Log Home Illustrated\\"A fascinating book!\\" Anne Gilbert, Charlotte Observer\\"An entertaining book that won't break the bank!\\" Francis Hines, Albany Times Union\\"Great looking displays...tons of information about rustic collectibles!\\" Julie Gassman, Country DecoratorThe book sold out of its first edition immediately and was reprinted to meet a growing demand. I have been discussing with my publisher the possibility of Volume Two of Cabin Collectibles to offer further information on many of the other items that are often used to decorate rustic settings. At this time, however, I am completing two other large books on RUSTIC SETTINGS. One book will be out in August of 2002 and the other will be on the market a year later.

I read the Amazon reviews last night for this book and was surprised that one person gave it a poor rating because it was difficult to understand. Another person gave it a poor rating even though she had 20 plus years of experience with astrology. I have worked with hermetic astrology for many years and found this book to be an outstanding piece of work! I can only presume that the person who had 20 plus years of astrology meant that the he or she had been reading horoscopes in a newspaper.I am hoping that Mitchell goes ahead with projects mentioned in the back of the book: astrological markers for creative genius etc. I honestly feel that the people who have left poor ratings for this book don't have a sufficient understanding of astrology to understand the content."},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"I spent a few days learning this system and finally got my numbers--it was difficult to work through, but I have well aspected Mercury and Neptunes even by his brutal criteria. The final result for me was that I had few markers for any mental illnesses, but I have been diagnosed in the past by five independent M.D. Psychiatrists with anxiety disorders, and I had only one marker for anxiety with his method! Plus, my Jupiter went down in flames since I have a conjunct (and parallel) with Saturn in the elevations. I strongly feel that this doctor is acting recklessly and irresponsibly, by persuing the Schizophrenia declinations. One control subject he mentioned in the book who has no history of mental illness had many markers for Schizophrenia. How about a self-fulfilling \\"diagnosis.\\" He said the person is at high risk of developing the condition. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who is not grounded about their own mental health condition, it could be damaging."},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"After reading Dr. Gibson's book I was astonished how he recognized the effect of the planetary forces on individuals with mental illness. For far too long, man has tried to deny the effects of the forces around him. With scientific evidence as provided by Dr. Gibson, there is proof that humans are vulnerable to the forces of nature. His book offers a valuable introduction to astrology without boring the layman. It offers a historical viewpoint of astrology without losing the goal of the book. Dr. Gibson has started something new-definitely!"},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"I admit it, I'm a skeptic. Usually, I can fathom astrological jargoneers and come to agree with some of their theories. I've even managed to choke down Crowley's florid, rambling prose but this book was virtually indecipherable. The premise of the subject sounded interesting but, after reading it, I'm still not sure if the author had something interesting to say, because of the unclarity of his thoughts as they are presented by his prose.I didn't see anything legitimately psychiatric presented in the book, and before anyone interprets my opinion of what constitutes &quot;legitimate psychiatry&quot; allow me to offer that I am critical of modern psychiatry, so am open to more interpretations of &quot;legitimate.&quot; The promise of the title is not present in the book."},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"This is the best work, to date, on the subject.

Currently on my reading table, I have the book written by a psychotherapist who dabbles in astrology (Mitchell Gibson--Signs of Mental Illness) and a book written by an astrologer who obtained a degree in psychology (Greg Bogart--Therapeutic Astology). Many authors and philosophers, since the days of Dane Rudyhar and Carl Jung, have tried their hand in legitimating astrology with psychology, often with variable results. So let the buyer beware.In the case of Gibson's book, one must declare his approach too scientific and yet not scientific enough. He talks about control groups, planetary indices of all kinds with authority, but he formulates his findings (and the tell-tale markers of mental illness)on a very limited number of birthcharts per category. (The categories he defines in this work are depression, anxiety, addictive disorders, schizophrenia and ADHD.) The markers in themselves are a very fascinating part of his work, but with the limited empirical evidence used, the list of markers are not comprehensive. I, for example, have not seen any Mars-Pluto aspect among the list of markers cited in this study.Conveniently, Gibson downplays--in the name of SCIENCE, I suppose--the intuitive, mystical side of astrology, as well as some of its most historical features (i.e., the house system, the four primary angles, the impact of timely transits and progressions, T-squares, yods, and grand crosses, the position of Chiron or the nodes, etc.).Furthermore, Gibson's approach to astrological aspects is confusing and outdated to the practicing astrologer. I've learned, some years back, to treat oppositions with less fatalism . I was told that with some adjustment and compromise, these aspects can be made to support and complement each another. For Gibson's thesis, oppositions are still dogmatically viewed as negative across the board. Authors Bil Tirney and Liz Greene has in their own books successfully updated the reputation on the Greater Malefic, Saturn, casting the old devil as a mystical \\"guardian planet\\" of sorts. Gibson maintains that any relationship to Saturn is still negative, no further discussion thank you. Finally, trines, sextiles and many conjunctions--long revered by many as positive, easy-going aspects in astrology--are considered markers for mental illness, according to Gibson's model. One can sense that Gibson is misusing astrology in a strange, opportunistic way. At one point, I was almost forced to cry out, \\"Are we still using the same planets and methodologies?\\" This study is much less of a marriage as it is a possible reimaging of the astrology-psychology union.The graphs, which Gibson offers in his book, highlights the planets in their declinations and longitudes(the zodiac positions, which historically provided the data critical to the construction of traditional horoscopes, are curiously muted here--Gemini, for example, has been reduced [uncited] to a few degrees on the chart). Unarguably, these graphs are very original and ground breaking because they expose mysterious planetary relationships, in the form of elevations, parallels, contraparallels and eclipses. There's some merit in this. Yet,when I tried to apply the graphing procedures to my own data (and to a friend's, who has had a string of major depressions and addictions in her life), I wasn't able to \\"find\\" enough markers or planetary relationships to warrant her (or my) inclinations towards ANY erratic behavior. (Again, the list of markers and empirical sample was not large enough. Meanwhile, studying the subject's natal house positions, zodiac signs and angles, even transits and progressions could have vividly offered more telling markers--all of which were excluded from this book!) Ultimately, I find the charts themselves hard to interpret and have (except in the case of one example) no accompanying data tables to confirm their chart position. One can't tell if Uranus is hidek or exdek, simply by reading its location between +20 degrees and +25 degrees. And the resulting interpretation of these relationships, based on chart visualization, were ambiguous or went undiagnosed.Perhaps this method of determining mental illness patterns using astrological precepts works best with extreme cases. If it could only predict the mental inclinations of such a limited section of birthcharts, then this document should be made more technical and upgraded to the medical, scientific community--who, of course, would unanimously brand it ancedotal, not supportable and a superstitious fantasy. In its current popular/self help edition, however, \\"Signs of Mental Illness\\" fails to offer clear, consistent, comprehensive information for me to keep in my library."},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"This is a wonderful book, based on the principles of the Magi Society (look for their books !). This sounds like (near-)scientific astrology. Far more medical doctors should learn astrology and write their findings down. If they would bring all this knowledge together, well it would be astonishing to see astrology grow in a scientific way. Mitchell Gibson has studied more than 400 charts and has found statistic significant signatures for some sorts of mental illnesses. This is a brilliant work that any serious astrologer should read. I hope that some computerprograms will incorporate his findings in their astrological software to make this knowledge available so that one can do the tedious calculations in a minute."},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"An astrologer friend of mine recommended this book to me. I have suffered from depression for years and I was glad to see a psychiatrist who has the guts to write about astrology and mental illness for the general public. I have read some of these reviews before I bought the book and they only made me want to read it for myself. This book is a brilliant new approach to mental health and astrology. It is different in that he doesn't use the traditional astrology stuff we all know and love, but aren't we allowed to grow and learn! I called Dr. Gibson and talked to him on the phone. He is approachable, friendly, and smart, real smart. He made me feel better about my illness and he gave me some real insight on depression from a spiritual point of view. You really got to read this book with an open mind, and if you do you will grow a lot in your understanding of how the planets affect our brains...Thanks Dr. Gibson!!"},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"While his credentials are promising, he is too disjointed in his presentation for this book to be immediately useful. He jumps from the first few chapters defending astrology in psyciatry and briefly describing the the planets (which would be for complete neophytes to the art), to then presenting very complicated terms and formulas (which would not be understood at all by those same newbies, and only maybe could be understood by an intermediate in astrology). He then skips several crucial steps that would have helped us understand what he was doing, and jumps right in to an example without ever helping us with the formulas. A dozen more pages in the book would have probably avoided this dizzying confusion. He doesnt explain why he limited his study to only the Ptolemaic aspects between planets or why he is steadfast on his use of the \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" planets/aspects. It appears he came by this information statistically, but he does not explain any of his methodology, so it is easy to wonder if he was as truly scientific in his process as he claims to be. After spending a few head dizzying hours reading his examples, reading between the lines, and trying to figure out the formulas (I do have a background in engineering, so that does help), it does start to come together. He doesnt speak of the orbs he used, which can vary so much from one astrologer to the next that this alone could make a significant difference in the results. He did say he gives a blanket 2.5 degree orb to parallels and contra's, which according to Rob Hands methodology is way too wide and a misuse in that application, (but to repeat his process you kindof need to follow the same protocol he used). He does limit it to the illnesses listed in the description, so if you have a different illness to diagnose, forget it. ie: if your client appears to have severe depression, but doesnt fit his profile for this, you wont be able to compare their profile to bipolar disorder, because it isnt in the book. So far, I have been able to obtain results consistent with his for the one ADHD chart I used it on, and the markers were pretty amazing. More applications of the formula may lead to further understanding. In summary, get a translator to help you figure out what he is talking about and how to use it."},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"I've studied astrology for 20 years and have a tough time making heads or tails of Dr. Gibson's system. The biggest problem is that he gives no real standard for the various disorders such as anxiety, depression, etc. He merely lists a number of indicator aspects (ones virtually everyone has a few of), but doesn't say how many factors are necessary for a strong disposition to the ailment. Instead, he merely gives a few case studies.His concept is interesting, but needs to be fleshed out. I'd say this book is a good first draft, but much more research and explanation needs to be given for the general public."},{"Title":"Signs of Mental Illness: An Astrological and Psychiatric Breakthrough","review":"I am a scientist.

Seeing that these two sciences are over 2000 years old individually, I was impressed that Gibson was able to accomplish this feat within a short space of just over 200 pages. The basic premise that mankind and indeed all of reality is affected by a hidden order of forces which is only reflected in the movement of the stars and planets is groundbreaking. In testing this theory, Gibson applies a synthesis of astrology and behavioral science into an astonishly clear and eye-opening new technique which utilizes declinations and longitudinal aspects. He calls this technique &quot;Modern Astrology&quot;. This work is sure to create quite a stir within both the astrological and medical fields and quite possibly, terms such grand elevation, binary eclipse, Hidek, and planetary index are likely to become very familiar phrases.&lt;P! > The book was informative and very thought provoking. The fact that a psychiatrist came up with a way to plumb the depths of a portion of the birth chart which most astrologers eagerly avoid is a little surprising and perhaps somewhat disconcerting.

Pope has previously written Hornblower's Navy, as well as historical dictionaries of the First and Second World Wars and of the Third Reich. Pope describes his purpose in writing this dictionary as an attempt &quot;to lay out the basic shape and structure of the wars, using dictionary format and rigorous cross-referencing to enable a balance between overview and detail, highlighting the many links between that particularly exciting slice of the past and our present.&quot; (p. 10)The Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars is divided into four sections. The first, the &quot;Introduction,&quot; provides a brief narrative overview of the background and events of the era that Pope defines as 1792 to 1815. The second section is the dictionary itself, which includes more than 1000 entries, ranging in length from a single sentence for &quot;Sappers&quot; to seven pages for &quot;Bonaparte, Napoleon&quot;. The book covers the War of 1812 and conflicts fought elsewhere, as well as the European conflict. The third section is a thirteen page &quot;Chronology of the Wars 1792-1815.&quot; Finally, a collection of thirty maps is included which range from a political map of Europe in 1812 to a map showing the opening positions of the battle of Borodino. The author states that the maps are &quot;primarily intended to help the reader navigate around those places discussed in the entries, and are therefore most concerned with naming and marking locations.&quot;As in any undertaking of this sort the author must steer a precarious course between detailing minutiae and painting the era in too broad strokes. Specialists in the era will likely always be disappointed as to the space devoted or slant given to a particular subject. The book, as the title implies, confines itself mainly to military aspects, with non-military topics receiving, naturally, less attention.Three drawbacks with Pope's Dictionary are a lack of references or bibliography, a lack of an index and a lack of illustrations. At first glance one would question the need for an index, but if readers want to know about Plancenoit they will be at a loss. They might look under &quot;Waterloo, Battle of,&quot; if they were knowledgeable enough to know to look there, but even then they would not know what other entries to search under. I tried to find some information on the Spanish prison camp on the islet of Cabrera and was unable to locate any entries that mentioned the &quot;death camp&quot; where 9,000 to 16,000 French prisoners were detained (of which only a third survived). I checked under &quot;Cabrera,&quot; &quot;Dupont,&quot; &quot;Bailen,&quot; &quot;Prisoners of War,&quot; etc. all to no avail. Is there an entry somewhere in the book on the camp at Cabrera? There's no way to know. Bibliographic references under at least the longer entries would both give the casual reader additional sources of information and also give a more well-read user an idea of what sources the author used to write that entry. No pictures illustrating either portraits of individuals mentioned nor of concepts covered are included. A reader would have to look elsewhere if the wished to know what a mortar looked like, what a hussar wore or to see the difference between a brigantine and a frigate.Not an essential book if you already own Chandler's Dictionary, especially considering the price. Facts on File, the publisher, produces books mainly for the library trade, therefore I'd recommend trying to get your local library to purchase it."},{"Title":"What Works in Schools: Translating Research Into Action","review":"This Book is great and set up what is important to work at schools such as factors for schools, teacher, and students necessary to teacher effectiveness and student achieveness.

It would be too basic for a physics professional or even for a physics graduate student. However, it is not basic. Anyone who is not seriously interested in particle physics will quickly bog down and find it boring. For those who are \\"seriously interested\\" it will most likely feed their interest. The book is thick with information, but is written in an accessible style. It is roughly 50% text and 50% photos (some full page, most quarter page or smaller), but this is not a coffee table book. The photos support the text and include captions that explain the photo (not merely summarize the text). Throughout the book, the photos demonstrate significant events (eg, R&ouml;ntgen's first X-ray, the apparatus Chadwick used to discover the neutron, Anderson working with his cloud chamber, Lawrence's first cyclotron) or show portions of the large accelerators or detectors with descriptions of the components pictured.As the authors state \\"This book is the story of how a century of discovery and invention has brought us to our modern understanding of the subatomic particles and the nature of the material Universe.\\" Four chapters (3, 5, 7, 9) provide \\"individual portraits of all the major particles\\" so far discovered. Chapter 3 covers the basic structure of the atom: electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons. Chapter 5 covers particles discovered in cosmic radiation: positrons, muons, pions, kaons, the lambda, the xi, and the sigma. Chapter 7 covers particles or phenomenon discovered in accelerators: the neutral pion, the neutral cascade, antimatter, resonance, omega-minus, neutrinos, and quarks. Chapter 9 covers the particles discovered in modern accelerators: charmed quarks, tau, bottom quarks, gluons, the W and Z particles, and top quarks. Chapters 2, 4, 6, and 8 describe the history of particle physics. Each of these history chapters introduces the people and the devices they used to make the discoveries described in the subsequent chapter. Two chapters (10, 11) \\"describe the questions that are aborbing particle physicists today\\" (eg, What is Mass?, Is there a theory of everything?, Issues in particle astromony). The final chapter (titled \\"Particles at Work\\") describes specific applications in society (eg, TVs, diagnostic scans)The book is as much about how the discoveries are made (ie, the physicists and their experimental apparatuses) as it is about particle physics itself. I read the book with almost no background in particle physics (having read just a few encyclopedia entries on the topic) and found most of the book to be accessible, though never an easy read (about the same reading difficulty as The Economist magazine: economist.com). However, chapter 7 was more difficult and chapter 9 was a difficult read for me (requiring re-reads of many sentences). My knowledge of particle physics is significantly enhanced having read this book and I now have a good appreciation of the accelerators in current use."},{"Title":"The Particle Odyssey: A Journey to the Heart of Matter","review":"I want to write a review of this book because there are only twoother reviews. A book of this quality deserves many reviews to encouragepeople to at least look at it.Particle physics is extremely abstruse, really only for physicistsand people who like knowledge for its own sake. Many particle physicistsdo the best they can to explain their subject in &quot;English,&quot; but I don'tthink that laypeople (incl. myself) can really grasp the subject w/ogoing through the rigors of deriving its basics and knowing howto use its tools, like QED and QCD, etc. (and I don't!).So personally I may be moving away from studying the subject, butI'm very glad I came across &quot;The Particle Odyssey.&quot; They say a picturetells a thousand words - truer words could be spoken as concerns thebook. The reader (even the peruser) can learn an incredible amount atwhatever level he/she is at, just by looking at the pictures and readingthe concise descriptions. We see pictures of the founders of modern physics,their inventions, also great shots of particle accelerators and particletracks, and much more. The book would make a superb coffee-table addition.It could entertain, even blow the minds of people who looked at it, maybespark some interest in younger people, and as I said, anyone can learnsomething at the same time (perhaps unlike a familar coffee table favorite,&quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;!).The text is about as easy to read, given the complicated subject,as possible, thorough, and enjoyable. Together with the pictures, theauthors cover the subject (and I do feel qualified to say this) morethan thoroughly.Anyone with even a passing interest in particle physics would doquite well to have this amazing, remarkable book."},{"Title":"The Particle Odyssey: A Journey to the Heart of Matter","review":"The reason I got into physics in the first place was the combined allure of subatomic strangeness and huge machines at the edge of technology and cleverness. This book distills those attractions in beautiful descriptions and stunning photography. If I ever needed reaffirmation in my choice to become a particle physicist, this book would surely do the trick."},{"Title":"The Particle Odyssey: A Journey to the Heart of Matter","review":"I've always been fascinated with the large and small extremes of physics and while on the cosmological scale there's a surplus of visually enchanting material there hasn't been as much when it comes to physics on the particle level. This book fills that demand.Tracking the advances made in particle physics over the last century, the book includes beatiful images illustrating what the scientists of the time saw and the equipment they used. All of this is clearly and simply explained. The difficulty level of the book increases as it progresses through each new discovery which is to be expected as the underlying physics and detection methods became more complex as well. Still, to someone with an interest in science and will to learn this is a great introduction to a mysterious world."},{"Title":"The Particle Odyssey: A Journey to the Heart of Matter","review":"Can you imagine a coffee table picture book on particle physics?That's what this is, and it's beautiful.Particle physics began in the 1890's, when the early experiments of Thomson discovered the electron. Things moved slowly, the proton during the teens's. The newtron and several other particles in the 1930's. And that's basically where physics was when I got my physics degree more years ago than I like to remember.Then beginning in the late 1960's the world of particle physics exploded. There are more than three dozen known particles. New theories about the formation of the universe have come about. What happened at the big bang, what particles existed in the first few nanoseconds? The development of testing machines undreamed of not so many years ago have begun to answer some of these questions.The title of this book is well chosen. It has been an odyssey. To the outsider, not working in particle physics, it has been mysterious. Newly discovered particles with names like quark, newly discovered attributes like charm, color, and strange have made it impossible to keep abreast of the developments.Here in one easy to read, beautifully illustrated and rather short book is the whole story laid out in a way that conveys just what you want to know."},{"Title":"The Particle Odyssey: A Journey to the Heart of Matter","review":"The Particle Odyssey (2002) by Oxford University Press has few, if any peers: an oversized book (a little under 12 by 9 inches) suitable for display on a coffee table, filled with fascinating photos, and yet one that will appeal not only to the enthusiastic layman but even to undergraduate physics majors.The Particle Odyssey is an excellent introductory overview of particle physics from the unexpected discoveries in the 1890s of electrons, x-rays, and radioactivity to the meticulously planned, large scale experiments in the mid-1980s that detected the W and Z particles (thereby confirming the Standard Model). Furthermore, the three authors - Frank Close, Michael Marten, and Christine Sutton - offer a lucid, intriguing overview of major challenges now facing particle physicists as they continue to unravel the fine structure of matter, and as they join forces with cosmologists to explore the moment of creation.Even numbered chapters generally focus on the researchers and their massive machines. Odd numbered chapters describe the subatomic particles. Surprisingly, this unusual even-odd arrangement works quite well.The Particle Odyssey, despite its abundant photos and diagrams, does require careful reading. The reader encounters neutrinos, muons, pions (pi-zero, pi-plus, pi-minus), kaons (K-zero, K-plus, K-minus), J/PSI, D (D-zero, D-plus), upsilon, lambda, sigma (sigma-zero, sigma-plus, sigma-minus), xi (xi-minus, xi-zero), omega minus, and charmed lambda. And don't forget, there is an antiparticle for every particle. There are also various resonance states for many particles.The three authors (Close, Marten, and Sutton) published an earlier edition, titled The Particle Explosion, in 1987. This new edition, The Particle Odyssey (2002), has two major advantages: one, the material has been updated to cover the years 1987-2002 and two, the graphics are even better.Recommendation: For a more technical look at the standard model, Deep Down Things (John Hopkins Press, 2004) by Bruce A. Schumm is quite good."},{"Title":"The Particle Odyssey: A Journey to the Heart of Matter","review":"Rarely does a scientific book achieve the successful balance of well-written content and lavish, relevant illustration. The Particle Odessey sets a new standard for popular scientific books. The historical overview of particle physics tell the stories with tantilizing detail without distraction.

This book deserves prominent display on your bookshelf and would be a great gift to the science buff looking for a great read. One of the best books in popular science available..."},{"Title":"The Particle Odyssey: A Journey to the Heart of Matter","review":"The dictionary definition of \`odyssey' is a \`long adventurous journey. This single word aptly describes the immense effort that went into the quest for a deeper understanding of the \`workings' of nature and what makes up the range of particles that define our universe.This book competently describes that journey, outlining the \`voyage' into the heart of matter, not only into the atom to study the protons, neutrons and electrons that make up what were once thought to be the ultimate \`building blocks' of nature, but then going deeper into the \`world' of quarks, which we now know are much more fundamental. These, together with leptons (which include electrons) make up all the particles found in nature.These particles of ordinary matter, i.e. protons, neutrons and electrons are only part of the story. There are myriads of short lived particles that are seen in mesons or generated in particle colliders such as the super proton synchroton at CERN in Switzerland. To make sense of it all, in the form of the Standard Model, is an achievement beyond compare. The Particle Odyssey describes this achievement in an easy free flowing style, and with beautiful, and magnificently descriptive photographs and illustrations.The work of delving into, and deciphering the inner workings of nature is a tribute to human ingenuity and inventiveness. If a person would like to get to know the people involved, the machines they used, the results they found, and the conclusions they drew, during this gargantuan task, then look no further than this book."},{"Title":"Karen Finley: Pooh Unplugged - An Unauthorized Memoir","review":"Don't get too serious, and you'll find a damned funny book. Pooh in leather - so hardcore silly. Eeyore as the depressive we've always known he is.

I am an artist, attend many gallery showings, regularly enjoy art books, but I also have a sense of humor. If you're a human being enjoying the full range of your emotions, you will enjoy this. If you have read other Karen Finley books, don't expect a serious commentary on art theory... and that's a good thing. She shouldn't be expected to be serious/detached/humorless all the time, and neither should we. Pay attention to the warning sticker on the cover, don't open the book expecting intellectualism or deconstructing of any kind. It's just supposed to make you laugh. If this seems troubling, it might be helpful to lock yourself in your bedroom, where none of your art school friends can see you and see how low-brow you can go."},{"Title":"Karen Finley: Pooh Unplugged - An Unauthorized Memoir","review":"Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE admirer of Karen Finley. I own most of her various books and CDs and have seen her perform numerous times. However, this book is a massive disappointment. It's so bad I will have to think twice about purchasing any of her future works. Supposedly the inspiration for the book was her daughter's fascination with Winnie the Pooh stories. Karen was bored with the stories so she made a version with all of Milne's characters having various sexual fetishes and psychoses. This concept could be interesting, but Karen Finley thinks that the concept alone is hilarious. She simply presents the characters as deviants and expects us to laugh. But it's not funny. It's lame and it's lazy. Winnie the Pooh with a whip - hahahaha! Roo as a faghag - stop!you're killing me! Christopher Robin giving an enema - uncle!uncle! From the quality of the writing and the illustrations, it seems as if she finished this book in a single afternoon. And then she has the nerve to charge so much for a book that's so damn short.At a recent booksigning in Chicago, Karen read from her book and at the end of every page she laughed quite heartily and looked for the audience to do the same; we didn't. It was one of the most uncomfortable book readings I've ever been to. I wanted to laugh just to humor her, but I couldn't. I was appalled at how bad her book was. Karen Finley is one of the most important artists in America. She's better that this (at least she used to be better than this).Karen said she recently moved to Los Angeles to live in a place that was very, very shallow. Evidently the move has had quite an effect on her."},{"Title":"Karen Finley: Pooh Unplugged - An Unauthorized Memoir","review":"Thanks to a series of successful books and videos, Winnie the Pooh and his playmates in the 100 Acre Wood have become some of the best-loved characters in children's entertainment. &quot;Pooh Unplugged,&quot; by Karen Finley, is a merciless satire of these characters and their world. Pooh and company walking around with graphically portrayed penile erections, wearing bondage gear, and making sexual advances towards each other--this is typical of Finley's work in this book.I have to admit, I found a few of the drawings briefly amusing. But on the whole, I found &quot;Pooh Unplugged&quot; to be a cheesy and crude undertaking. Finley's &quot;satire&quot; is, in my opinion, simplistic and uninspired.I should note that I do defend Finley's right as an artist to make a parody of anything she wants to mock. But I don't see much of a point to this weak effort, whose main goal seems to be to merely shock."},{"Title":"Karen Finley: Pooh Unplugged - An Unauthorized Memoir","review":"I came across this book after being persuaded by Disney's The Tigger Movie that Tigger was gay. The author of this book seems to be on the same wavelength, though Tigger's homosexuality is unfortunately depicted very stereotypically and equated with conditions labelled 'psychoses': he sniffs amyl nitrate and gets turned on by Eeyore wearing kinky leg warmers and lacy undergarments. Piglet is a tough-guy sado-masochist who drives a hard bargain over his appearance in a spin-off, and Pooh is into food sex, exhibitionism, a very unLacanian mirror phase, and an inter-species relationship involving bees. Although rough and ready, the drawings are enough like the originals to make the joke work and the artist's lack of reverence for the Gospel According to Pooh makes a change from all the manuals on Management and Taoism based around Milne's polymorphous characters. The bit I didn't really get is where Pooh and Co. are supposed to be selling out to Disney. It's not as if they weren't clean cut before. In fact, in fleshing out the characters the films suggest some of the depth that Finley suggests their conversion to screen stars has neutralised. The book takes it as read that Disney films make everything they touch totally vanilla innocent. But there are other things going on in Disney films, Hercules being another good example. It's being allowed to 'out' the films' Easter eggs which is the problem. That's one possible reservation about the book, plus the price. You'd have to read it a lot of times and have hysterics for weeks to justify the price tag. Read it in the shop instead and you can do your bit against hypocrisy and hypercommercialism."},{"Title":"Karen Finley: Pooh Unplugged - An Unauthorized Memoir","review":"I thumbed through this book at Barnes and Noble and its not much more than wierd drawing.

A forced marriage ensues as the stipulation for her to go with him to his parents' home, both agreeing to an annulment when the mystery has been solved and it's time for her to leave.Throw in some political intrigue, Meg's in-laws, Drew's friend Red, and Meg's children who seem to soften even his hardened mother's heart, a few murder attempts and the kidnapping whodunit and enjoy this afternoon read. I enjoyed reading ANOTHER LOVE and enjoyed the three-dimensionalism to the characters Ms. Edwards created outside of Meg and Drew.

The plot seemed to start fairly early on and kept on track until the end. The main character, Wolf, sort of seemed a little off course at times but I am not certain if that was due to the characters mental state or the writting itself. I think the biggest surprise in the novel is the lack of Ed Eagle, the lawyer that will become the repeat character for future novels.

This was a great book to have with me because it was really a page turner and helped to quickly pass the time. One thing I think Stuart Woods does well is put several twists into his books which made me look up and say &quot;No way!&quot; throughout this book.The main character is Wolf Willet who we get to know in the start as a guy who likes his routine and has made a large amount of money in the entertainment business. In the beginning he flies from Sante Fe on his way to LA and has plane troubles and lands near the Grand Canyon. He reads the NY Times headline which says that his wife, his best friend, and him are found shot dead at his home in a guest bedroom.

While waiting for the repair with the holiday in the way of any maintenance occurring, he reads the New York Times only to find his wife Julia, his business partner and himself murdered.Instead of reporting that the third body is not him, Wolf flies to Hollywood after his plane is repaired to finish his movie. A week later he hires defense lawyer Ed Eagle to defend him as he expects legal trouble. The Santa Fe cops suspect him of murder and have identified the other dead male as the ex-husband of Julia's look-alike sister Barbara who has a tryst with Ed. Soon another homicide occurs and Wolf is arrested for the murders just when he leans his late wife stole over three million dollars from him, but remains ignorant to a hit called on him.This is a reprint of an exciting fast-paced early 1990s thriller that is fun to read, but stretches plausibility further than the distance between Santa Fe and Hollywood. The twists starting with the insanity of finishing the movie instead of either going with a lawyer to the cops or gong underground as an amateur sleuth to spins on siblings that seem unreal, but in fairness add entertainment. Far from Stuart Woods' best work, his most dedicated fans will enjoy Wolf playing hardball by Hollywood make believe rules in Santa Fe.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Santa Fe Rules (Ed Eagle)","review":"One of the strangest nuances of this book is Ed Eagle, who everyone seems to think is a Native American, but as we learn later, he is really a Jew and was accepted as an Indian because of his basketball prowess. Okay, Mr. Woods, that's original. Too bad the rest of the novel isn't quite so fresh; but indeed SANTA FE RULES manages to weave an involving, if somewhat hard to believe tale.Anyone who's read a great deal of mystery novels will see the truth in this novel very early on. Woods does manage to throw in a neat twist at the end, but it only enhances what an astute reader will have already figured out.Woods writes like a screenwriter; much of his narrative would transfer well to the big screen. A little faster pacing would have enhanced the book as well. But if you're in the mood for a superflous but highly entertaining read, SANTA FE RULES delivers."},{"Title":"Santa Fe Rules (Ed Eagle)","review":"I am stunned this book got so many great reviews. I worked in Sante Fe for a while so thought I would enjoy it on that level at the very least, but I thought it was a complete waste of time. the good news--its a very easy read and you can finish it quickly.As someone else says, the characters are shallow and unsympathetic beyond belief. The women are all drop dead gorgeous and the men are handsome and successful--and rich--so much so that the main character Wolf, finds his young wife dead and hooks up with another younger woman almost immediately! And he's so great even her 8 year old daughter is happy to find mom in bed with him the first weekend she meets him! I guess that's all supposed to be okay once we find out the first wife was pond scum.The mystery is solved easily half way through the book but for some reason these brilliant men are not able to figure it out--because they are too busy being in love and /or feeling sorry for themselves.There is not a single character that I liked or found believable. This is not even a book I will give to anyone. I expected more of Mr. Woods. Now I'm afraid to read anything else he wrote."},{"Title":"Santa Fe Rules (Ed Eagle)","review":"This is an excellent mystery novel, set in author Woods' then home town. If you like Michael Connelly's and Ross Thomas's books, you will like this one as well.I read this after reading the sequel (\\"Short Straw\\"),because I wanted to see if author Woods could really craft a real story. \\"Short Straw\\" wasn't that. \\"Short Straw\\" was written about a dozen years after \\"Santa Fe Rules,\\" and set about 2 years after \\"Santa Fe rules.\\"Well, in 1992 author Woods could craft a real story with plot, scenes, mystery, and the snappy dialogue I found in \\"Short Straw.\\" This is the type of work product which established his then reputation as a first-grade mystery writer.This book, and its sequel are really about three sisters who want to be something more than what their parents raised them to be. What they wanted was to be rich, and beholding to no one. Both books are about how they go from being young Jewish maidens through prison and murder(s) to temporarily meeting their needs, and death.All three sisters interact with the two male protagonists - one a Santa Fe lawyer, and the other a movie producer. The latter is implicated in a triple murder which included some of the three sisters, and the former defends him and has a relationship with one of the sisters. While the story in \\"Santa Fe Rules\\" is about proving the innocence of the movie producer, the theme is the changing lives of the three sisters.There is not a lot of action, but mystery is who the sisters really are and what they did to whom. This won't be the best mystery you ever read, but if you like mystery novels you will like \\"Santa Fe Rules.\\""},{"Title":"Santa Fe Rules (Ed Eagle)","review":"A story that makes you wonder if you are awake or having a nightmare..

I am not sure I've even heard of him, even though there are claims of him being a NY Times best-selling author. That is probably true considering the level of intelligence of many Americans. What is true, though, is what kind of book this is. I was drawn to it because of my interest in Santa Fe. Well, my bad. I got what I deserved. This is, plain and simple, a plain and simple book. Silly. Stupid. Shallow. It's a children's book for grown ups. It probably took him no longer to write than it would take you to read. So, in the end, the joke's on me...I did zip through it. Actually what I found most entertaining about the whole hour and a half experience was his so-called Author's Note at the end. That's where he \\"writes\\" about how happy he is to hear from his readers...but probably will not see your note or care to because he's such a busy and important author and there is no need to really bother him.

Bizarre things always happen to this team in the Savage Land. This book is no exception.The beginning of this arc was what threw me, and what made me only give it four out of five stars. Wolverine departs to the Savage Land to investigate some strange findings that an old ex-girlfriend of his (with red hair, go figure) alerted him to. He goes alone (or so he thinks), not realizing that X-23, his teenaged clone, has tagged along as a stowaway on the Blackbird. First, why does Logan insist on going alone? Why was Storm, the leader of the team, okay with it?Second, why was there no exposition of who Logan's ex-girlfriend was? Granted, she gets killed in the first few pages, but it's nice to have that history.The Savage Land Mutates make an appearance, as well as a new band of mutated dino-lizards called the Haukka. It's always nice to see some new antagonists for a change. Ka-Zar returns, too, but he didn't have much of a speaking role in this arc.When the X-Men are taken hostage by the Haukka, they brainwash Marvel Girl into thinking she is one of them. She's so convinced that she begins mutating herself on a molecular level to even physically resemble one of them. THAT was cool. It was neat to see her lope along with the bent posture like the other lizards, further testament to Alan Davis's artwork.We get to see some interesting interaction between Storm and Marvel Girl in this book, as well as see more of what Storm's powers can really do on a larger scale. Psylocke returns to the X-Men (and from the dead), still looking Japanese, and no longer telepathic, but she's pretty damned cool. If you are a fan of Bishop, you won't see much of him in this story. Logan also inexplicably disappears, by the second issue of this arc, and you never are offered an explanation as to why (even though we know he was kidnapped and brainwashed by HYDRA in his own series, but that doesn't excuse his absence from the Savage Land, hello?).Marvel Girl's character begs further exploration, both in terms of her powers and how she will grow with the team. This book made me forget all of the previous \\"Days of Future Past\\" arcs, thankfully. All of her previous timeline jumps just gave me a headache. Like her mother, Rachel Grey has the greatest capacity for heroism or ultimate destruction.This is one more story arc that made me very grateful that Chuck Austen is no longer writing this series."},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 3: On Ice","review":"I don't read as many comics as I used to back in the day, (60's and 70's), but when Alan Davis illustrates such exotic locales such as the lost savage land of Kazar - I must have and read it!Alan Davis's reincarnation of Killraven was utterly fantastic, his writing skills and fabulous, beautiful artwork shining bigger and better than ever before.And it shows in this blazing mix of savage jungle and mutant X-men graphic novel. Most excellent in all ways. A must have for any comic book fan who loves great artwork blended with beautiful colors and imagery."},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 3: On Ice","review":"I wasn't too impressed with Chris Claremont's \\"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 3: On Ice\\". Most of what he wrote in the first 3 volumes of \\"The New Age:...X-Men\\" was mediocre and a rehash of a rehash.The Savage Land has already been stomped over many times by Claremont; however, I am glad that he created a new enemy the Haukka. I also like a few twists that happened, but the twists don't really seem logical or feasible. Knowing the pasts of different characters, I don't see how easily certain individuals could get caught up in a trap with the experiences they have.For any die hard X-Men fans, I'd say read this book. For the casual reader, other than maybe a new enemy, I don't really see anything coming from this story line."},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 3: On Ice","review":"On Ice, the third collected volume in Chris Claremont's return to Uncanny X-Men, finds the legendary X-Men scribe going back to the well. On Ice finds Wolverine taking a trip to the Savage Land to lend a hand, and soon enough he's in over his head against mutated beasties. Storm and the rest of the X-Men soon follow to help out, leading to their capture and Marvel Girl being brainwashed. Oh yeah, X-23 is here too, and Psylocke comes back from the dead only after a few years since Claremont killed her off in the now defunct X-Treme X-Men. While the overall story of On Ice is fun, Claremont's story is so cliche ridden and loaded with plot holes that you'll wonder if Claremont still thinks this is the 80's, and his dialogue alone is proof of that. Alan Davis' artwork though is what makes On Ice worth checking out, as he provides some wonderfully realized pencils throughout this TPB, and there is just something about his rendition of Marvel Girl that is simply luscious. All in all, On Ice is worth a look from X-fans, and yes, you can do far better, but you can also do far, far worse (Chuck Austen anybody?)."},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 3: On Ice","review":"The X-Men fighting dinosaur men in the Savage Land. A good story with this plot is impossible. To be fair, Claremont's run on this series seems to be a throwback to the style of the eighties, and plots like this did occur in the X-Men of the eighties. However, this kind of story represents the extremely bad and cheezy side of eighties comics that people make fun of. This easily ranks as one of the worst X-Men stories I've read.The reason I gave this two stars instead of one is for the last couple of issues, which are actually quite good. One is Psyclocke dealing with her return home, which spans the X-Men's return from the Savage Land through Wolverine: Enemy of the State and X-Men: Phoenix Endsong. The other is a fairly amusing issue featuring Mojo, although I'm not sure how he's alive, since last I saw he was killed in X-Men #11. His return could have been a story in a spin-off X-book or another Marvel title, however.All in all, I would only recommend this book for completists (like myself)or if you'd rather not go to a comic shop and pick up the last two issues of this volume individually."},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 3: On Ice","review":"Wow was this bad. I was so hoping to like it as I love some of these characters so much (especially Rachel Summers!). Unfortunately, these characters act out of character throughtout and ignore past history and relationships. The X-Men run around like chickens with their heads cut off from battle to battle spouting the same Claremont cliches that they've spouted 100 times before. If you really want to read the legendary Chris Claremont, track down the reprints of X-Men #94 - 200; unfortunately, not even the gorgeous Alan Davis art makes this book readable."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"This book took me by surprise. The first surprise was that ALL of us can be possessed by demons and earth bound spirits (discarnates) and not even know it! How subtle and secretive the dark forces can be. Dr. Modi, M.D., is a psychiatrist who, to her surprise, found other beings inhabiting the souls and bodies of her patients. It was these beings who claimed to deliberately cause their &quot;host&quot; problems. The detailed descriptions these demons (some of them fallen angels) gave on how they became evil is fascinating. Those imprisoned angels (after being freed) gave Dr. Modi very detailed descriptions on how they were trained and forced to do evil. They describe how they were tricked into becoming dark and why they could not return to the light. I was also surprised to learn that these possessing beings can cause us REAL suffering (physical, emotional and mental). Which explains why some conditions never clear up no matter how much medicine we take. My final surprise was how powerless they really are when discovered and how fearful THEY are of the angels and God's Light. Many of Dr. Modi's patients had miraculous healings. This made me take a close look at my own chronic pain and it's possible root cause. Dr. Modi describes how quickly and easily she was able to help her patients free themselves of these destructive influences. Using her techniques, I have been successful in ridding my own long-standing pain and suffering that I thought could not be cured. The Bible tells us &quot;Physician, heal thyself&quot; and Dr. Modi's book gives us the knowledge of HOW to do just that! This book can help everyone to heal him or herself."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"This really &quot;remarkable&quot; book by Dr. Modi is a practical no nonsense book than enables us not only to heal longstanding psychological and health problems, but reveals the answers to mysteries that have puzzled people for millenia. Dr. Modi, M.D., is a psychiatrist who saw the limitations of traditional psychotherapy and drug prescriptions for most mental and physical health problems. Using hypnosis as a tool, she was able to interview the &quot;soul&quot; of the patient to find out the cause of their problems. To her surprise, she found not only the soul, but other beings were often inside the person, entities, discarnated, demons, inner children, past life personalities. By clearing away all this debris, the soul was able to start healing its missing and wounded parts, resulting from traumas of this and past lives. Many patients had miraculous healing from just one or 2 sessions! She interviews actual demons and ghosts and gets detailed answers as to how they get their training in hell, what motivates them, and how to free them into the light. She finds how past life traumas and relationships determine who we know in our present life, and what health problems we now have. She describes how we choose all major life events, both positive and negative for soul growth. All of this is done without religiosity or theory. It is all practical for the healing of bodies, minds and souls. I myself am a very successful health practitioner. after just 4 days of applying her approach with patients I'm also getting remarkable results. One lady I have given dozens of remedies for migraines, finally got them licked for good when we successful persuaded two black demon to leave her head. Jesus casting out demons was no metaphor, it works. This reading is not for the faint of heart. There is detailed description of torture and suffering, often triggering similar memories in the reader.

She helped me to understand that I was actually having psychic occurrences brought about by a psychic opening and a kundalini uprising.D. Needle phobia so bad that sometimes Alien Hand Syndrome would happen. My left hand would shoot out and grab the wrist of a nurse or doctor holding a needle and restrain them until my brain took over.E. A phobia about touching certain kinds of cloth or fabric.G. Fear of being crushed.Many of the problems were healed through past life regression where returning to the precipitating incidents, healing the emotions, forgiveness, and understanding allowed the damage to drop away from me. Other problems were solved by releasing human spirits, minor demonic possession, and releasing and reclaiming soul attachments.It may sound ridiculous but I tell you it is true. I am a highly intelligent, very well educated (Ph.D.) person who held a number of very responsible positions in my community over the years. I am now retired.I currently use my reveled psychic abilities including a talent for healing for the good of others. I've seen several physical miracles occur while doing healings.

I help people using hypnotism much as Dr. Modi does although I do not pretend to have her knowledge or ability. I have released demonic and human spirits.

I have worked in the deliverance ministry and we also dealt with these entities that she describes, yet we were not using hypnotherapy to dig for deeper answers -- we just identified the entities and took them to the Light. It was interesting to learn more about what they can and can't do. I have no fear of them as their only weapons are fear and deception... if you bring the Light down on them, they surrender.Which brings me to ask the question: Why do Catholic priests in their exorcisms mess around for days and weeks trying to expel these entities, when it can be done in 5 minutes -- in Jesus' name? I know because we did it.Lastly, her info on soul fragments is very informative. A lot of good down to earth practical knowledge in the book.I'd also like to recommend the recent related book by Dr Lerma Into the Light -- it will surprise you to find out that the angels of Light and the angels of Darkness often work together. And the dark ones are subservient to the angels of Light.And from what I saw on the references to Dr. Michael Newton's books, several people were upset with Dr. Modi's book, pooh-poohed it, and recommended Dr. Newton's instead.

As a sufferer of mental illness myself, I am constantly looking for answers that traditional doctors are not able to give me. I am very much into new age philosophy and have had numerous psychic experiences in my life. So I went into this book with an open mind. However some of what Dr.Modi says in this book is very hard to swallow. I am willing to believe a great deal but this book is just ridiculous at times. I mean, it was still an interesting read, but I am not sure I buy it. Let me explain.The author basically claims that pretty much all mental and physical illness are caused by spiritual issues. This means unresolved past-life problems, possession by demon or earthbound spirits or soul fragmentation. Much of the book breaks down like this: A patient comes to her saying he has a pain in his neck. She will hypnotize him and in this state he will remember a past-life where he was hanged and then another where he was beheaded. Then she will talk to these past-life souls and send them to heaven. Then the patient is miraculously healed. That is the basic idea of the book. At first this seems almost believable but there are like 3 such cases on every page for 600 pages and eventually it gets too much. The sheer amount of people she has claimed to heal itself is just hard to swallow. I could see a few patients saying this stuff, but hundreds of them. It makes you think that we are all victim to these spirit possessions and every problem known to man is caused by demons. At least that is how the book makes it.Beyond that, some of the cases themselves are just borderline tabloid status. Like she has transcripts where she claims to be talking to these spirits through her patients. Not only earthbound spirits (humans that have died) but also angels and demons and, in one case, Jesus Christ himself. I mean, I am willing to believe that angels and demons exist but I just don't buy that this therapist can freely speak with them. Supposedly these spirits explain in great detail the workings of the afterlife, heaven and hell and the process of reincarnation. If this book is true it is an amazing account and well worth reading. If its bogus, well its still entertaining but feels like you are being taken for a ride. And believe me, I have an open mind. I have read other books about spiritual matters, astral projection, magic, etc. and been able to handle it. But this book is just way off in left-field.I feel bad because I really had high hopes for this book. And it is also hard to believe the whole 600+ pages is a total hoax. So there must be some truth inside there. But I just finished reading it and I am just not sure I can believe even half off it. It does make me more interested in these past-life regression therapies and spirit releasement. Enough that I would be willing to go to a therapist and give it a shot. Maybe if I had first-hand experience with it I could then believe it. But taking this book at face value is a tall order. I'd say if you already believe in this type of stuff then you will probably have no issues and will enjoy the book. But if you are on the fence like me then this book will not really be convincing. To its credit, it is at least entertaining for a 600 page book and still worth picking up if it interests you. Just be warned, its a ride."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"This book looks at attachments of darkness, spirits, and how they suppress the body and mind.

However, this should be the start as even this work does not go far enough to help the reader truly understand what is going on.It was only when I read Shopping For Spirit Part Seven and Eight (albeit a few times) that I began to make more sense of these writings on the 'Soul' and the 'afterlife' represented in these writings. Reading these articles helped me to make the best use of the information presented in these books and helped me to understand how a lot of the information presented through these type of books represented the 'astral afterlife' where lost souls end up, the 'Middle Place' as Jesus referred to it, and were not describing the real spiritual afterlife at all.This 'afterlife' is merely a replica of physical life and has nothing to do with the real afterlife that every soul should enjoy.When armed with this understanding, these books then become a plethora of good information, rather than being one of directing our emotions and beliefs into the astral (archon) thought-form reality.

Sue is a powerful psychic who has decades of experience in possession and spirit attachment (a less frightening, and less overbearing, form of possession).Allen simply looked at someone who attended her one-day workshop on this subject and pronounced \\"you are under psychic attack\\". During a session later that week, with Allen's assistant (Allen being far too busy and important to give private sessions any more), this woman found she was correct. It turned out she had been suffering psychic attack for over a decade - by the long-time mistress of her father - and, once this was cleared, there were measurable mental and physical health benefits which certainly continued for at least a year, after which I lost contact.This nearly 600-page book, by contrast, was so repetitive about \\"god\\", \\"angels\\" and \\"prayer\\" in a christian tone that it could be used as a sunday school text! This despite two assurances at the very start that it was not a religious text. There is a determined attempt to undermine other religious/spiritual beliefs (Goddess worship was blatantly denounced as wrong and foolish). She also uses the old trick of claiming that, if her book makes you angry or upset, then you are, basically, an ignorant fool.By contrast, Sue Allen's book is thorough and down-to-earth, without any religious over- or undertones: it covers similar material in a simpler, and far more elegant, manner. A pleasure to read.However, for practical information that is not available anywhere else, read Swerdlow's books, especially \\"True Reality of Sexuality\\" and \\"13-Cubed\\".

In my search to learn more, and as I begin to work on becoming licensed myself as a hypnotherapist, I found and read Dr. Modi's amazing book. For all that hypnotherapists believe they are a few steps advanced from psychiatry, I now firmly believe that a hypnotherapist merely treating a patient with guided imagery, metaphor, and regression is not enough, and this book (and others dealing with spirit releasement) are the key to unlocking the vast resources within ourselves and our clients. Please give it a read, see if it doesn't make you at least wonder about what more you could be doing. A wonderfully proactive approach to healing, and a life-altering view of the universe presented in a logical and clinical manner."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"Dr. Modi gives all the essential requirements and their reasons for a complete cure of any ailment.

The author is an agnostic, but she presents her truthful findings without discrimination. I recommend this book to everyone who asks about teh cause of mental illness. The purely biological view of illness is outdated and a dinosaur waiting for extinction. It's only a matter of time before everyone finds out the information in this book and others like it and completely overthrow the current medical system demanding effective treatments for their disorders. You can be doctors are afraid of this book and I'm sure Dr. Modi gets her share of persecution. Every great idea was persecuted before being accepted as common knowledge, but when the truth gets out there's no putting the cat back in the bag. This book is a masterpiece and required reading for anyone truly wanting to go into the helping professions. It will open your eyes wide too."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"\\"Remarkable Healings\\" is a true eye-opener to those not yet familiar with spirit attachment and possession. Based on her research and experience with hundreds of patients over more than a decade, Dr. Modi (a Psychiatrist) discovers that traditional talk therapy and medicine is often ineffective when treating patients who exhibit certain symptoms. Startled at first, she discovers using hypnotherapy that many problems originate in past lives and can solved by reliving and processing those memories. Often, life after life patients made the same mistakes and/or decisions and refused to learn from them. Seeing the 'bigger picture' now, they are finally able to heal.She also finds that many problems are caused by disembodied spirits and demonic influences. Many times, when the body of a person dies, its spirit does not know where to go and ends up in another human being (familiar or unfamiliar) and/or is tricked by the dark force entities to work for them.Adding to the credibility of Dr. Modi is that she herself is often surprised by what patients (and their attached spirits/demons) describe. Sometimes this even gets personal in the way that Dr. Modi's own past life memories are triggered.This book is not for the faint of heart. Past-life memories of patients are vividly described (often by the patients themselves) and these include memories of violent deaths, many times through various methods of torture. Also, many examples are described of demonic influence and possession, including many ways used by demons to give humans mental and physical problems. This could induce fear in the reader. However, it is important to keep in mind that there are many excellent techniques that can be used for protection against such forces and that the light is always more powerful than the darkness. So in essence there is nothing to fear. Fortunately, in the book there is ample mention of this and of the beforementioned techniques.Let this not stop any potential reader as also many beautiful descriptions of the spiritual realm (heaven) and its inhabitants are given. Remarkable to see is that these descriptions are strikingly similar regardless of the patient's background (including atheists, and people of various organised religions). I don't agree with an earlier reviewer that the content is too focused on christianity. Dr. Modi goes out of her way to explain over and over again throughout the book that everything written down is not her personal belief but taken from the sessions with her patients.I do, however, agree with an earlier reviewer that there is a fair bit of repetition in this book - usually this serves a function. But in most cases the 'review' section at the end of a chapter can be skipped without losing information.What I liked about the book is that it is organised into handy chapters and (sub)sections. For every cause of current-life problems (e.g. past lives, spirit attachment, demon possession, soul fragmentation) examples are given to distinguish one cause from another. As the causes get more complex and layered (e.g. multiple personality disorder caused by a discarnate soul suffering from multiple personality disorder itself, which attached itself to a soul fragment of the patient) everything is carefully unraveled and satisfactory explained.All in all I found the format of the book very pleasant. Separate, long chapters are used for the main causes of problems: past lives, spirit attachment (including demons) and soul fragmentation. There is a separate chapter describing a few long cases of problems having multiple and complex causes. In a summarizing chapter, startling statistical information is presented based on Dr. Modi's research and experience. According to her, 92% of people have at least one attached discarnate entity, and 77% of people have at least one attached demon. Virtually all people will have unresolved traumas from former lives and about 59% have soul fragmentation. This gives, of course, much to think about. Not only how the reader looks at his or her own problems, but also why this information is not (yet) common knowledge among therapists. Fortunately, more therapists are now working with methods similar to Dr. Modi's.I highly recommend this book as it gives an excellent overview of the field. Also recommended is a similar book by William Baldwin, \\"Spirit releasement therapy\\" (which I have yet to read but I understand is strikingly similar, adding to the credibility of both books).As a final note for non-believers: as Dr. Modi writes, her personal beliefs are irrelevant, but she has noticed that all patients can be greatly helped using this method, and it's the results that count in the end."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"This is a remarkable book about \\"remarkable healings\\". It's written by a woman psychiatrist who through treatment with hypnotherapy, including past life regression and spirit releasement has healed hundreds, perhaps thousands of patients.Both the mental and physical problems of her patients turned out to have been caused by:1) current life traumas incl. prenatal and birth traumas2) past life traumas3) possession by earthbound spirits4) possession by demon spirits5) soul fragmentation and soul loss.Demons can occupy different parts of the patients' bodies causing symptoms in these parts. Sometimes these demons are arranged in many layers in their bodies, one on top of another.These demons are organized by \\"Satan\\" and take pleasure in tormenting in heinous ways those whom they have possessed.Earthbound entities (souls that haven't gone to the Light after death) have possessed many of Modi's patients, and these in themselves may contain demon entities. Many types of demonic devices placed in various parts of the patients' bodies were described by the patients.It must be noted that everything Modi describes is reportedly what she has been told by her patients, e.g. references to demons, Satan, hell, heaven, angels, etc. These are the terms used by her patients, even though they come from diverse cultures and have different religions, and she says this is why she uses them.Treatment is carried out by enlisting help from the angels to transform earthbound and demon entities into the Light and send them to the Light. All parts and organs of the patients' bodies were scrubbed by the angels and all negative entities, energies and devices were removed. Their bodies were then filled with the brilliant white Light, shielded by a bubble of Light and covered by spiritual mirrors and rays of white Light. Soul parts that were with Satan and his demons or elsewhere were cleansed, healed before being integrated in the patient,This is a weighty book amounting to more than 600 pages. It contains comprehensive details of all possible aspects of \\"possession\\", and is extremely enlightening (though this is a \\"dark\\" subject). It made me think that ALL our various ailments, diseases, etc. may be caused by these possessions, in addition to past life traumas, of course. At any rate, it is one valid explanation of the existence of disease, one that we have heard before, e.g. from Christ, 2000 years ago, modern day evangelists etc. (I have myself seen many examples of healings carried out in this way by the latter.)At one point early on in the book the thought occurred to me that tha author herself must be under the influence of these demons, since she kept regaling us with multifarious examples of these possessions in her patients, which had the effect of lowering my vibration and making me afraid that I too would be liable to attracting these diabolic beings (or more of them than I already might have) into my system. But then fortunately she began to describe the healings by the angels and also provided us with prayers by means of which we can ask for help and protection. This helped.But I have to say that the book could easily have been, if not decimated as regards length, at least halved, without this detracting from its message or fullness of necessary information. The author writes extremely simply and clearly. However, both the language of the various patients and the demons speaking through them seems identical to that of the author for some reason (she transcribes the tapes of her regressions/treatments).In short, I found this to be a useful, edifying book, with great credibility (I am not a Christian in the traditional sense, though believing in Christ.) However, it may well have a negative effect on the reader due to the many, many pages of depressing detail of the various cases of possession and violent past life experiences."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"This book is just plain amazing. I would hesitate to write a review because each story is so very personal.

Much detail.(3) Soul Loss and soul fragmentation is clearly explained by the many cases. Before this, this information was incomplete and misleading.(4) Prayers for protection is covered in detail.Her 2nd book, \\"Memories of God and Creation\\" continues the subject matter even further with clarity.What surprises me the most is that the following information got beyond the sensors (lower forces) in the first place. Her two additional books on the subject can't make it out."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"There is no other way to describe Remarkable Healings by Dr. S. Modi than to say it is completely extraordinary, and that it is a timely gift of great insight into the nature of the human mind and spirit. It is a book that should be read by, not just doctors or psychitrists or age-regression therapists, but by all human beings.Dr. Modi is a woman of genuine pioneering spirit who, though having acquired all the conventional credentials as a psychiatrist, was dissatisfied with the meager results of traditional talk therapy and decided to employ hypnotherapy to gain more direct access to a patient's subconscious. In this process, she happened to discover that hypnotized patients would begin spontaneously describing what they believed to be their own \\"past lives,\\" in which they had experienced various traumas that seemed to be causing the debilitating symptoms and illnesses the patients were trying to cope with in their present lives. By addressing these past-life traumas apparently surfacing from some part of the patient's subconscious mind, Dr. Modi discovered that she could effect remarkable, almost total cures for her patients within very brief periods.Dr. Modi avers that she does not know if these past lives reported by patients are real and that she herself has no belief in reincarnation, but she does believe that the therapy is very important because it yields extraordinary cures that have lasted many years for many patients.As she continued to work with hypnotherapy, she discovered that her patients started spontaneously describing that other deceased people were living inside them, that is, that spirits of other people (e.g., relatives, ancestors, friends, strangers, etc.) were somehow indwelling them. And this became perhaps the major focus of Dr. Modi's work--i.e., working with earthbound spirits who, for reasons of either obsessive affection or otherwise vengeful resentment and hatred, had become trapped/embedded within the patient's body, --and, further into this research, working with \\"demon\\" spirits who explained (through the patient) that they existed under the direct thrall of Satan and were assigned to carry out Satan's instructions, both directly and via other earthbound spirits, to make each patient as miserable as possible.Consider the following paragraph from p. 196 of her book:\\"My [hypnotized] patients describe having from one to as many as ten or even more--sometimes even hundreds--of earthbound entities in different parts of their bodies. One patient, as he looked inside himself, described seeing hundreds of human spirits. It looked like a \\"beehive\\" to him. Even when I work with so-called normal people, almost all of them find one or more human spirits inside them, even though they did not have any obvious physical or emotional problems.\\"What is further fascinating here is that Dr. Modi's patients describe, as the therapy progresses, that the liberation of the earthbound spirits is not that of being \\"cast out\\" into some nether darkness, but one where angels are summoned who escort these spirits out of the patient's body away into higher realms of the spirit world where they can undergo healing.What is especially remarkable in all of these patient descriptions of indwelling earthbound spirits and angelic beings that could be summoned to deal with these fixated spirits is that the patient descriptions were basically identical, regardless of their diverse cultural, racial, religious, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds. Skeptics may criticize that these results are probably due to some sort of \\"confabulation\\" or other idiosyncratic artifact of hypnosis, but it is clear from Dr. Modi's writings that such criticisms do not apply at all.Make no mistake--other noteworthy writers/practitioners have addressed similar realities regarding earthbound spirits, e.g., Emanuel Swedenborg in The Universal Human, Carl Wickland in Thirty Years Among the Dead, Edith Fiore in The Unquiet Dead, and, most recently, Unificationist shamanic healer Daemonim. But Dr. Modi has given us a remarkable, profound and stunning written record of research into the revolutionary healing possible through Spirit Releasement Therapy. Her book characterizes a critical aspect of the vision that will be required to usher in a new age of civilization in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"Dr. Modi's book follows in the footsteps of Dr. Fiore, Dr. Baldwin, Dr. Ireland-Frey and others into the area of attachments and how they affect a person's life negatively, especially when it is mis-diagnosed as just a simple disease or sympton of an illness. She also writes about soul fragmentation, which according to her can happen from even too much compassion or happiness, not just a traumatic event. I found the majority of book very interesting, however I found that in many instances it was repetitive especially with the long summaries at the end of each chapter. Also it was extremely judeo-christian in perspective in regards to satan and demons, etc, even though she claims that she receives the same feedback from patients from different cultural backgrounds. Contrary to the findings of the earlier practioners mentioned before which rarely came across non-human entities, according to Dr. Modi they are just as numerous or even more so then human entities."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"this is an amazing book and i hope more people would read it. i thank you and have a blessed day."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"This is one of the very best books I have read on the subject, and I have read many many (\\"Soul Rescuers\\" by T.

I'm very glad I did, too, because it may provide the key to the alleviation of a great deal of human suffering. It also has the potential to herald a revolution in psychiatry, spirituality and metaphysics. Dr. Modi is a mental health therapist and sets out in straightforward terms how she discovered, almost by accident, that many long-standing mental, emotional and physical conditions can be cured by the radical method of healing not the patient but spiritual entities that appear to be attached to them, either to deliberately cause suffering or with problems from past lives that are unconsciously adopted by the patient as their own. According to Modi, some 98% of us have at least one such entity 'on board', which makes the book of urgent interest to practically everyone. Modi's patients state that many of these entities are demons who work for Satan, and the book contains a lot of information on conditions in hell and on other spiritual topics. I have to say I did not find all of the reports convincing, as they seemed to be describing as literally true events that I personally think of as mythological (such as Adam and Eve). Whether this is saying something about Dr. Modi's own belief system or my own incredulity, I don't know. However, it could be that the information was presented to Dr. Modi in a way that would be most helpful to her patients and readers, and that since psychological healing is the objective here, this takes precedence over the conveying of accurate information. Dr. Modi includes some prayers for readers to use to protect themselves. I tried one of them, and after a couple of months I can confidently state that there are very real psycho-spiritual benefits to be gained from their use. If you are at all leery of modern mental health theories and practices, have long-standing problems you can't seem to shake off, or are just an enquiring reader with an open mind, I recommend this remarkable book to you."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"All of the answers that we as human (Beings) search for and many times, for some reason, have an inclination of already knowing, is within.

If you have ever read Journey of Souls or Destiny of Souls or Messages From The Masters (It was recommended to me to read - I'm reading it now), then this book will take you farther/further into an overstanding of what Life and the transition to another life, aka death, is about. There's much more I could say but I don't want to spoil it for those interested and want to find out for themselves. I'll just say that \\"healing\\" is not about prescription meds, surgeries and so-called \\"modern medicine\\"...the body is Divinely designed to heal itself!

For the most part, the author succeeded in keeping her psychiatric bias at bay, though it still showed through at times. This does appear to be very important work that deserves great attention, especally in the medical industry. I agree with her sentiments that the insurance non-coverage of hypnotherapy is absurd (my word).

Almost all of us have had times in our lives when we were vulnerable and open to negative energies and entities because of surgery, illness, trauma, childbirth, death of a loved one, or we were under the influence of alcohol, drugs or medications. After reading Dr. Modi's book I venture that virtually everyone has some of these influences around them on some level whether you know it or not, whether you 'believe' it or not, unless you have done specific work with intention to release those influences. By reading this book you bring awareness of this situation of attachment and possession -- which many people would consider impossible or ridiculous. However, these situations can and do exist and do have terrible consequences in human lives as hundreds of her case studies reveal. The information Dr. Modi provides brings the light of awareness and helps remove the superstition and fear around this subject. This book brought my understanding of mental health and healing to a higher level. This book is suitable for those in the healing professions as well as those who are into self-help modalities and those who want to understand the reasons as well as the cures for human suffering. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness","review":"Great alternate view of mental health. It seems that every mental health practitioner has his/her set of tools and their practice is limited by what is in their toolbox.

She has written many accounts in her book which are remarkable and I found myself really wanting to read and learn more. She was able to communicate with the spirits while her patient was under hypnosis, and after working with them she was able to release them. She says her success with healing her patients is at 100%. I'm keeping this short because there are many good comprehensive reviews about Dr. Modi's book. It IS an excellent book and I wish more people were more open minded to understand this happens even today. And why wouldn't it? It was written about in the Bible - it didn't just go away.

Pretty colours & glossy pictures do not addup to a worthwhile book for knitters."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"Vivian Hoxbro, a Danish knit designer, has uncovered a type of knitting using simple garter stitch that reveals eye-teasing pattern and color when you use several shades of yarns. Yet you only use one color at a time--no color changing per row.As you knit the alternating rows of dark and light yarns, you produce a pattern that is almost an optical illusion--depending on the angle you look at the knit piece, it may appear strongly patterned--or absolutely single toned. The yarns used are shetland-weight in wonderful colors. You can find these yarns in the US, as Mrs. Hoxbro has contracted with an American manufacturer to make them for her. Sources of these yarns, and substitutes to be found in Europe are included in the back of the book.The rules of Shadow Knitting are:1. You always use at least 2 colors of yarn.2. Only one color is used at a time3. You alternate two rows of dark knitting with 2 rows of light knitting.4. You use knit and purl stitches only5. Wrong side rows use the same color as the previous row. The stitches are knitted or purled as per a chart.There are a lot of good illustrations and of course projects including shawls, pullovers, Hoxbro's favorite dolman sleeve tops, jackets, vest, kids' wear, bags and decor items like pillows.\\"Domino Knitting\\" was Hoxbro's previous book about a modular knitting technique. When \\"Dominos\\" was translated from Danish to English, the publisher put it into a small format. This time, \\"Shadow Knitting\\" is published in a bigger sized book--meaning the pictures and diagrams are large and easier to read. This is IMPORTANT--the diagrams of where to change from knit to purl are vital to the design and you want to see this clearly in the chart. But as before, you can enjoy Mrs. Hoxbro's fabulous sense of color. You should swatch some of the designs as they live and breath as no picture can portray in a book.Still puzzled by \\"Shadow Knitting\\" after trying it out? Ms. Hoxbro does give workshops in the US from time to time--her website is viv.dk which will give you access to a newsletter of her schedule and bright examples of her knitting designs from the books."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"If you're looking to get into shadow/illusion knitting, this is, as far as I know, the most comprehensive book out there, and worth the price. Other books only offer very short \\"instruction\\" on it, which tends to eliminate necessary things like gauge, yarn content & needle selection.This book is also chock full of beautiful colour photographs. And most (although, unfortunately not all) of them include shots from at least two angles, enabling the reader/knitter to see how the pattern should look from both angles, which can make the knitting of the item easier.On the other hand, there is ZERO information on how to create your own patterns. Also, Hxbro has a tiring predilection for very geometric patterns, and this technique lends itself to so much more elaborate patterns than that. Annoyingly, everything seems to be in a \\"four row\\" pattern, and there are other options, which is given almost no mention.While I'm glad I bought the book, and it's currently the most comprehensive widely available book, for the \\"expert\\" on the craft to issue such a woefully incomplete reference, especially after such a long delay, is terribly disappointing."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"The adult sweater patterns in this book are completely disappointing. I agree completely with the reviewer who referred to \\"Cosby sweaters\\". The styles are so 80s, I had to check the copyright date on the book to convince myself it had been published recently. All of the garments are in big, boxy styles with large geometric shapes. The narrow striping needed to create the illusion makes all of the patterns very busy. As an adult woman who prefers simple, classic, and slightly fitted designs, I would never wear any of the sweaters from this book. Or carry either of the bags, for that matter. However, there are two children's sweater patterns in the book that look cute.I've never bought any other book by this author so I'm not sure if the disappointing designs are due to the limitations of the technique (e.g. does shadow knitting work best if you're knitting something rectangular?) or the knitwear designers.The shawls/scarf and the pillows seem to come closest to finding a balance between showing off the technique and making something pretty. I wish there had been something more along the lines of the Alien Illusion Scarf in Stitch n' Bitch. Not all shadow knitting needs to be done with geometric shapes!The section on how to produce the shadow knitting effect is pretty clear. I feel like I can go ahead and chart my own illusion design, even if there are no explicit instructions on how you might do that. I really don't know if buying the whole book was worth it in the end though."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"As you may know, the expected publication date for Shadow Knitting was delayed but the result is definitely worth the wait. The physical size of the book is larger than that of Domino Knitting, by the same author, and the numerous color photographs do a very good job of capturing this intriguing now-you-see-it, now-you-don't technique. The designs are simple and timeless, making them suitable for both less experienced and seasoned knitters alike. Even if you decide you do not care for this particular type of color work, the designs alone, like Kimono and Wing Shawl to name only two, are worth the price of the book.There are patterns for the home, children, men and women. For newer knitters who are only familiar knit and purl stitches, the author has included a technique section including illustrations explaining the increases and decreases and other necessary information needed to complete the projects. If you have wanted to do color work but have been intimidated by fairisle and intarsia, Shadow Knitting is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"I ordered this book online b/c I have been wanting to try out shadow knitting and couldn't find it in any local bookstores. Once I got the book home I realized it just wasn't for me. There are lots of patterns for sweaters, vests etc., but nothing that I would ever make or wear. I was hoping for more info on the tech. and charting your own patterns. My brother commented that it was a big book full of \\"Cosby Sweaters.\\" I'd advise looking though the book before purchasing."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"I made the mistake of buying this book without looking through it. I wish I had. I would never make a single pattern in this book. All of the sweater designs are completely unflattering: oversized and boxy. And all of the illusion designs are simple geometric shapes. Nothing is different or interesting.But worst of all: there is no clear section on how to make your own illusion patterns! Luckily I have since found a website that has a tutorial. This book was a complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"Add color to a knitting project and make the most of highlighting and shadows with Shadow Knitting, which demonstrates how to use alternating rows of light and dark yarn to produce subtle patterns. Prior knitting experience and experience reading patterns will assist in the use of an excellent survey which includes everything from the charts and counting needed to produce special effects to color photos of complete projects and step-by-step directions."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"This book explores a process of creating patterns by knitting parts of some rows and purling parts of other row,changing colors only at the end of rows. The results are a subtle patterning. I tried a couple of small projects and found it easier to do, and will try more. Well charted, well explained.Ms Hoxbro is very interesting, I met her a couple of years ago in Copenhagen and learned she learned English, largely self-taught, well enough to write in it. I have several of her books and go back to them for ideas over and over."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"I was rather disappointed with this book. I had done shadow knitting once before, and was really excited wondering what this book had to teach me. Alas, the answer was \\"not much.\\" Ms. Hoxbro has taken what is really a very simple technique and makes it seem difficult with all her \\"must do this\\" instructions. I did modify a jacket pattern to make a scarf, but other than that am unlikely to make any of the projects. As others have mentioned, they are all just too geometric and, well, boring really. The photos do not best show off the illusions, either."},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","review":"I am overly enchanted with this book, who would of thought that a little switch here and there would create a stunning result. Learn how to not only create a work of art, but a conversation piece that will have alot of people saying \\"how did you do that\\" (get the book so you can learn how)."},{"Title":"Principles of Surgery, Companion Handbook","review":"This book is essential for general surgery board review, and helpful for the intern to study."},{"Title":"Albany: Capital City on the Hudson","review":"The book has many beautiful pictures and may easily be dismissed as just another pictorial Chamber of Commerce celebration of a city's history, a &quot;coffee-table book.&quot; But instead, it is a great and accurate account of a city built by Deutsch (Dutch &amp; German) and Irish ethnics, written by a historian and public man of breadth and character, who is intimately familiar, through his family, with the history of the city of Albany to the mid-19th century. I am myself a historian of 19th century New York State, and found the book not only to be very informative, but enjoyable to read as well."},{"Title":"Albany: Capital City on the Hudson","review":"Bravo, finally a superb book on the history of Albany and Albany County by the man who lives and breathes Albany, John(Jack) McEneny.

As Kitty and the teen continue to run into each other, they begin to find out that maybe they're just two sides of the same coin."},{"Title":"The Watcher in the Garden","review":"I hate this book immensely, and it doesn't dominate whatsoever"},{"Title":"Death, Dying and Bereavement (Published in association with The Open University)","review":"I used this book as part of the course it was intended to be a componant of (an Open University course on bereavement).However I would suggest it is infnitely more useful than that, while it does operate form a very a British perspective, it does cover aspects of bereavemnt that are doubtless universal.It is a great resource for helping those in need, it offers words, theories, thoughts and experiences of great wisdom and breadth.

Now when our engineers talk about water treatment I understand everything. It is a first book that everyone should read before they try more difficult and professional literature."},{"Title":"Water and Wastewater Treatment: A Guide for the Nonengineering Professionals","review":"I found this text useful as a mnemonic, a memory tool. There are useful explanations of conventional tools for treating wastewater and water. You won't find many useful graphics but it is a book for the non-professionals. Personally, I find such textbooks useful because of the varied business of the design engineer.

It's a tedious read and provides no other information than a very basic over-view of the subject matter. The black and white only photos and diagrams are of poor quality; the diagrams are repeated throughout the book. The only reason I rated it as one star is because you must give it at least one. While it might be less expensive than others of its genre, the price is not justified by its informational value. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"No where did it mention that the travel guide was printed in 1998. I may find the photos useful but everything else is outdated!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"In general, I consider Lonely Planet (LP) as one of the best publishers which excels in thick, detailed guide books that describes in &quot;text&quot; the best attributes of a city or country. LP is not a book with pretty tourist stock photos. If you want pretty pictures, I recommend the Insight Guides which have at least 1 per page. After looking at a half dozen Beijing (BJ) city guides, this book excels again in describing Zhongguancun, where others fail.Zhongguancun, (Zgc) is like a Chinese Silicon Valley, or computer business development area near Beijing and Qinghua Universities (p149-50) in the older 3rd edition. Zgc is an important hi-tech area for tycoons, business, and consumers alike to find computers and software localized for China. It is located in the Haidian District, NW Beijing, near Haidian Rd and Zgc Rd following the 4th Ring Rd, far outside the Metro ring. Zgc is just south of the Old Summer Palace area. This area is probably best accessible by bicycle, taxi, light rail, and bus. It is about 4 miles (6km) NW of the northwestern-most metro ring station at Xizhimen. Zgc is listed in the index.In the Insight Guide (p198), I saw a Zizhimen light rail stop about 1 mile away from Zgc.LP/BJ 3rd ed (0-86442-547-3), also has a two maps to get a good view of Zgc and the downtown districts, Map 3 for overall Beijing and 10 for the Haidian district. Map 10 also shows the Zgc bus stop with nearby hotels, restaurants, internet cafe, brewery, and universities. This edition has 11 maps.However in LP/BJ 4th ed (1-86450-144-8), Zgc is still listed (p53). Zgc is lost in the maps with only 7 maps, ersatz replaced with 20 pages of pretty stock tourist pictures. I believe LP's editors have stepped in the wrong direction here. Lets hope that they get it right before the 08 Olympics. I read this in the local library.I noticed that LP/BJ 5th ed (1740592816), with a new author is scheduled to be released this month, 10/02."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"The Beijing City guide, is one of poor quality that lacks a lot of information, I was just this past Christmas and New Year on a holiday trip and I was frankly disappointed. These guide included some really inaccurate information on restaurants, the maps are totally inaccurate and the information given is scarce. I really expected more seriousness in this guide -being a Lonely Planet one- that leaves me asking why is Lonely Planet guides so popular? With the maps on this guide instead of finding my way, I got lost! As for the information, it was OK but just imagine trying to find a restaurant that does not exist. Well I think there might be better guides out there."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"I have used this book on a six day trip to Beijing over Xmas 1999. In my opinion the July 1998 edition of this book is too far out of date, and contains an unacceptable level of inaccuracies and inconsistencies. I would also endorse the previous reviewer's comments about the tone of the book, although I would say that a 'right on' sneering attitude seems to be written into too many Lonely Planet books and Rough Guides in general. This book is not worth buying in its July 1998 (3rd) edition. It needs to be completely rewritten and not reissued in a 4th edition."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"I have been a big fan of the LP guides, up to now. I have used them for more than ten years, with great pleasure. This one takes a snide, critical, wiseguy tone, as if the writer didn't really like China much and thinks you won't either.Guides are supposed to show you how to enjoy a place, not load you down with critical material. A sadly deficient departure from LP's previous level of quality."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"In contrast to another reader's review who thinks all travel books should have a positive slant, I enjoyed the frank criticisms - they make me put more trust in the author's recommendations. This has usual tourist information such as places to stay, eat, visit and shop, but also lots of unique info on things such as toilets, spitting and hygiene. I find this book much more useful than the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; travel guides such as Fodors."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"I returned from Beijing last week after spending about 2 weeks in the city. I had and used the Lonely Planet Beijing guidebook extensively. It was at least partially wrong about almost everything. Museums, resteraunts, and other things it recommended were closed. Every phone number was wrong. The guidebook lacked useful information about how to get places, how to orient self, and hours of an establishment. Also, the guidebook was judgmental. I think it is the worst guidebook I've ever used."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"An excellent resource for getting around in Beijing. Perfect for visiting tourist sites such as Forbidden City and numerous other parks. The maps included are great. The pricing information is slightly out of date. China no longer uses duel pricing for foreign tourists."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"I think the other raters have been vastly overcritical in their assessments of this book. True, the tone of the book is somewhat cynical, but I found it nonetheless to be invaluable in a solo two-week trip to China in June. Robert Storey is very knowledgeable on China, Beijing in particular, and I found most of what was written to be quite accurate. I had two problems with the book. First, the book (at least the version I received) was outdated. It's hard to blame the publisher though, given the rate of change in the city. Second, the maps in the book are pretty bad. Make sure you get a better map to supplement what's in the middle of the book. In fact, ignore the maps altogether."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"Many of the things that I tried to do in Beijing failed because the book was inaccurate. Because there has been a lot of construction and renovation in the city since this book was published in January 2001, Lonely Planet's Beijing is already out of date."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"As a fan of LP I was very dissapointed in this book. It seems like the person who wrote this book has been living in China for a while and is not particularly interested in seeing the sites around town. There were plenty of places to eat, stay and party, but not a lot about the amazing things to see in Beijing.For examply it had good instructions on how to get to the summer palace, but no info on what you were looking at once you were there, compared to Egypt guide (for example) where you could happily wander around a temple and happily feel that you don't need a tour guide to tell you anything, the Beijing guide had a paragraph or two saying this building and that building are nice.Also very dissapointing was the history section, As the capital city of a coutry with so much history, old and new, I think that it deserved more than 3 pages."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Beijing (Lonely Planet Beijing, 4th ed)","review":"I found the 2000 version of this guide to be indispensable on a recent trip.Beijing is a city with an incredible amount of things to do and thanks to this guide I was able to get around with ease. The information on attractions was accurate and detailed. For instance it tells you exactly which window sells Forbidden City admission tickets, the exact corner where you can catch a bus to the Badaling Great Wall etc... In addition it had some great recommendations such as the Lao She Tea House.The maps in this guide were not very detailed but were adequate as long as you stuck to the major streets and attractions. One thing the maps have going for them is that major street and places of interest are labeled with Chinese characters, making communication with Taxi drivers a lot easier.The description of the airport shuttle bus routes is confusing - it could have been so much easier had they drawn the bus route on the map.The restaurant recommendations are lame and inaccurate and a couple of the hotels that it mentions were already out of business.Despite some shortcoming, I would rate it as one of the better LP guides that I have used."},{"Title":"The house of the wolf: A romance","review":"Up until I read The House of The Wolf, I did not have a great track record with the classics offered for Kindle. This book was a pleasant surprise. Written as the experiences of a French aristocrat, almost as if it is autobiographical, during the Parisian revolt of the 1500's, this is a story of adventure, redemption and romance. To be sure a great, interesting little read. I could hardly put it down. The ending was not what I expected."},{"Title":"The house of the wolf: A romance","review":"This book was written in old style language. Very hard to read.

Just as importantly, this is no flash-in-the-pan, here-today-out-of-print-tomorrow study tool. Nave's has withstood the test of time and met the needs of millions of users down through the years. This is a work that no clergyman or serious reader of the Bible should be without."},{"Title":"Nave's Topical Bible: A Digest of the Holy Scriptures","review":"This is a logical grouping of verses based on the topics they deal with. This is the perfect tool if you want to know all the verses that apply to a certain topic. The only critique is that Nave's needs to be updated. Much of the language is outdated and it is sometimes hard to determine what heading the verses you might be looking for are under. For instance, greed is under Covetousness.

I like the idea that it groups Bible verses by \\"idea\\" or \\"topic\\". That broadens a good study. You can always switch to a concordance for exact words.In a Bible study at church we're examining the attributes of God, and this Bible is a great help. It also has about 90 pages on all aspects of \\"Jesus, The Christ\\". Another interesting portion are the \\"Quotations and allusions.

You look up a topic of your choice, like \\"self-delusion\\" and you will find a host of Bible verses on that topic. Unlike a concordance where you actually are looking for a specific word embedded in a particular verse, a topical Bible allows you to find verses in the Bible that may not have that word in the verse. So if you were to conduct your own study on the subject of self-delusion, for esample, you would look it up like you would in a regular dictionary (it is arranged alphabetically) and then learn the following taken directly from the Nave's Topical Bible, \\"A characteristic of the wicked, Psa. 49:18. Prosperity frequently leads to, Psa. 30:6; Hos. 12:8; Luke 12:17-19. Obstinate sinners often given up to, Psa. 81:11,12; Hos. 4:17; 2 Thess. 2:10,11.\\" And that excerpt is just the first paragraph. It will continue with \\"exhibited thinking\\" and the verses, \\"Frequently persevered in to the last\\" and the verses, \\"Fatal consequences of\\" and the verses.All students of the Word of God should own a Nave's Topcial Bible. Parents need to equip their children with the ability to use one, also. Bible teachers who do not equip their students with the knowledge of this most basic Bible study tool should be scolded.

In fact, there was something in this book that blew my mind.I've heard Tibetan Buddhists talk about recognizing the \\"dreamlike nature of life\\" and the older I get the more I recognize that sometimes life is so strange that I definitely see that it is like a dream and a strange one. And there was something in this book that definitely rocked my reality pretty hard (which I'm getting to). One of those moments when you see exactly what they're talking about.I was old enough to live through the Kennedy assassination and I read something in this book about that which I definitely would not have believed if I had not read it for myself; I would have been certain it was an urban legend, but it wasn't.It was true.Kennedy's press secretary (in case you don't remember) was a guy named Pierre Salinger. Salinger actually wrote the introduction to this book and therein he told the following story. A few days before Kennedy's horribly tragic trip to Dallas, Texas Pierre Salinger received a letter from legendary psychic Jean Dixon in which she told him that under no circumstances should Kennedy go to Dallas or HE WOULD BE KILLED. Not only did this really happen but Pierre Salinger SHOWED THE LETTER TO KENNEDY WHO READ IT.Kennedy then said something about his Secret Service protection being good and shrugged it off. He went to Dallas and an assassin (as you know) shot him in the head with a high-powered rifle.I read allusions to something like this before but never realized Jean Dixon's predictions and warnings were so pointedly specific and I never would have believed Kennedy himself was aware of it. That is just too strange for words.Pierre Salinger then goes on to recount instances in which he then dreamed the future himself. (We all do that; just track your dreams for a while and you'll see for yourself although they are often about things as mundane as unexpected weather).Anyway, that story by itself means I will never forget this book or regret buying it. And you have to bow down to Pierre Salinger for being willing to go public with this knowing he would be ridiculed by all the people who think their ninth grade biology class had the final word on what human reality is all about.There are other good stories in this book and I thought reading it was very worthwhile, in fact, I bought two other books by the same author. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Dream Keys for the Future: Unlocking the Secrets of Your Destiny","review":"I have been studying dreams for 35 years since i have been 17. It has been a hobby of mine. I have read countless books. Lauren Lawrence's masterpiece Dream Keys for the Future is the best I have come across. It is very clear and easy to understand. The chapters on prophetic dreams are perhaps the best. Everyone is fascinated by the possibility of waking up and having something revealed to us from our dreams, that could take place in the future. The examples she uses both current and past are brilliant. The discourse on the JFK assasination prophetic dream was captivating. At times the writing is so intriguing it as if you are reading a novel since it is so engrossing. To use a cliche this book is a real page turner and hard to put down. This is quite a scholarly study of the dream experience."},{"Title":"Dream Keys for the Future: Unlocking the Secrets of Your Destiny","review":"Pierre Salinger's revealing foreword sets the tone for this intriguing book. Importantly, the book informs us of the many ways that dreams can reveal our future, and in this respect, may be considered a diviner of sorts. The book speaks about something interesting and unexpected: the predictive ability of dreams. According to Lawrence, a predictive dream is unlike a prophetic dream that hooks into the future, in that its guiding information comes from our stored knowledge of the past. Apparently, we repress or just plain miss information during its occurrence in reality, and it is this information that reappears in our dreams at decision-making times in our lives when we need to be prepared for any untoward eventuality. Toward the end of the book, Lawrence offers up a convincingly plausible and original explanation of prophetic dreams, and visions which Lawrence refers to as wakeful, externalized dreams. Also interesting, is Lawrence's interpretations of numerous biblical dreams as she comes up with some startling conclusions.--John Davis"},{"Title":"Dream Keys for the Future: Unlocking the Secrets of Your Destiny","review":"Lauren Lawrence, with exceptional clarity, has demonstrated the scientific basis of the ancient dictum that &quot;we are masters of our destiny...&quot; Packed with fresh new material, she has revolutionized the modern concept of the inner dream world! Her revelations are ground-breaking, weaving an invisible magic thread between present and future... The most important development in dream research since Freud."},{"Title":"Dream Keys for the Future: Unlocking the Secrets of Your Destiny","review":"Lauren Lawrence's DREAM KEYS FOR THE FUTURE gives us insight into a world not many of us know nor understand. Her book offers accessible, intelligent information that can revolutionize one's life. As with her first two books on dreams, DREAM KEYS FOR THE FUTURE is an innovative and unique exploration which explains our dreams. Here then is a best seller in the making! -- Susan Shapiro Barash, author of SECOND WIVES: THE PITFALLS AND REWARDS OF MARRYING WIDOWERS AND DIVORCED MEN"},{"Title":"Russian Poetry for Intermediates","review":"This book is designed for those who have passed GCE O-Level (a British high school version of America's achievement tests), or who have an equivalent knowledge of the language. The text of the poems is in Russian, there is no translation, but the biographical notes for each poet are in English and there is a Russian-English glossary at the back, which saves the reader from using the dictionary all the time. Included in this collection are the luminaries like Pushkin and Lermontov, as well as the moderns like Akhmatova and Yevtushensko."},{"Title":"Everything You Need to Know About Street Gangs (Need to Know Library)","review":"I can't believe I wasted that much money for such a boring book"},{"Title":"Gyppo logger","review":"This memoir was first published in 1960. Margaret Felt recounts the 10 (1944-54) years she and her husband Sonny operated a gyppo salvage logging company within view of Mount Rainier in Washington State. She played many parts - camp cook and flunky; cleaner and painter; bookkeeper; hiring agent; truck driver delivery logs to the mill;grocery and parts buyer;hauler of heavy broken parts from cats and other machinery; and wheedler of creditors as they spent each year in debt, but keeping their crews paid off and their equipment and logging camp in order. All this during a time when women had returned to their homes after World War II to become the perfect wives and mothers. Oh, she was also the mother to two girls. She had spunk and she loved the forests, despite the fact that her husband \\"barbered the green mountains\\" for a living. I enjoyed it very much.Author of A Devil Singing SmallThe Wolf's Sun"},{"Title":"Holy Women of the Syrian Orient (Transformation of the Classical Heritage)","review":"Brock and Harvey provide an English translation of fifteen texts recording the lives of ancient Syrian Christian women, along with notes and an introduction. These saints' lives date from the fourth to seventh centuries C.E. The authors include a helpful introduction commenting on the Syrian Orient, the nature of hagiography, and the problem of literature about women.I found the translations smooth, engaging, and enjoyable, with neither archaic language nor informal breeziness. Despite many recent monastic translations, few are devoted to women. Only two of these lives have previously been translated into English. Brock and Harvey have produced an unusual and needed volume.The fifteen texts are divided into nine chapters. The first is an extract from the \\"Life of Abraham\\" concerning that saint's niece, Mary. A model ascetic, after being viciously raped by a monk Mary turns to a life of prostitution. Her uncle dons the disguise of a soldier to enter her brothel and rescue her. She repents and is saved. Similar themes of sexual sin and repentance sound in the second chapter, the \\"Life of Pelagia,\\" a renowned prostitute who repents and finds a new life--not only in chastity, but as a transvestite. Disguised as a man, she journeys to Jerusalem to live out her days as the male recluse \\"Pelagios.\\"The following chapters are of a different character. Chapter three contains six extracts from different sources concerning female martyrs in Persia; chapter four relates several accounts of female martyrs in Najran, a town in southern Arabia. The fifth chapter contains two selections from John of Ephesus' Lives of the Eastern Saints. Chapter six, within a narrative concerning Abba Daniel of Sketis, tells of the transvestite Anastasia as well as an abbess and a mad nun. Chapter seven, told from the perspective of a woman narrator, relates the trials of a convent undergoing the Diocletian persecution and the martyrdom of the virtuous Febronia. The final eighth chapter is a lavish tribute from the seventh-century writer Martyrios to a spiritual mentor, the elderly Shirin.This book helpfully provides access to a world few could otherwise explore. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War","review":"Gangrene and Glory is a great book covering just about every aspect of medical related issues in the Civil War. It covers key players in the development of medical affairs while bringing forth quite a bit of information to many subject matters. For example, some of the subject matters consist of Confederate/Union healthcare,development,training,medicine,supply,diseases and surgical procedures on and off of the battlefield. Interesting stories are added to certain areas which enhance the book, plus there is mathematical data to back up the chapters. This book is a must read for those interested in medicine and medical operations during the Civil War. It is a somewhat fast read, though gets to the point and has many pictures and is thoughtfully easy to read."},{"Title":"Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War","review":"This subject is often handled too dryly-- with an abundance of stats that ultimately distance the reader from the real horrors of the Civil War. Or, so graphically that the reader is numb from the overwhelming shocking suffering of the era. Freemon managed a perfect balance with this volume. Packed with plenty of little-known information and the author's own perspective, I found it to be well worth the purchase price and my time. Lots of illustrations and anecdotes throughout that illuminate the era as it really was. The author understands the reader's need for occasional comic relief while wading through such horrifically appalling and depressing material. VALUABLE resource and a keeper!! I only wish it were available in hard cover, or at least printed on a higher quality paper."},{"Title":"Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War","review":"This exciting work reads like a novel. It is full of pictures and graphs, but if you read the book from the first page you find that your are engrossed in a story full of vivid descriptions and action."},{"Title":"Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War","review":"I am stimulated to write a review by the previous reviewer. He, perhaps, was looking for an explanatory work with chapters on doctors, nurse, hospitals, etc. The present work tells a story, one might say it reads like a novel. The book describes what happens but only with information available to contemporaries. The doctor-reader can try to use his medical knowledge to make a diagnosis. But the work is not just for doctors: it tells the importance of medical care to the war efforts of North and South and tries to argue that the superior medical care of the North was partially responsible for the Union victory. The miserable diseases and horrible wounds (gangrene) show how horrible the war was for participants and balances the rosy picture of the war given by other works (glory). I hope I can be pardoned for giving my own work 5 stars."},{"Title":"Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War","review":"This book was exactly what I was seeking. The author attempts (with considerable success)to provide the reader with the perspective of the time of the Civil War. Only in the final chapters does he step back and attempt to judge the realative quality of care in the two armies and reflect on the role of medical care in the North's victory over the South. I found the book very scholarly,very interesting and very readable."},{"Title":"Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War","review":"This book is interesting and contains some information about Civil War healthcare that was new to me. However, unlike some of the other reviewers, I did find it far too dry. The title of the book and the description here on Amazon.com led me to believe it would be more anecdotal, with stories of men who survived battle wounds only to face another \\"battle\\" to survive medical care as it existed at the time. This book does contain a few anecdotes, but it is packed with long lists of dry statistics and technical information that is not as interesting to me as a layperson.I don't mean this as a wholly negative review, because some people may like the statistical aspect and may really enjoy some of the very specific information presented. But if you are looking for letters, diary entries, personal accounts of the wounded, etc., this may not be what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War","review":"I bought this book from Amazon.

I'm not sure if there is more good books."},{"Title":"Medical Genetics","review":"I have been teaching medical genetics to medical students and graduate students for more than twenty years, and I have been using the Jorde text for teaching medical students since it was first published.This text is the most succinct text available to my knowledge on the topic of medical genetics. This is perfect for medical students who have relatively little time in their schedules for genetics (16 lecture hours versus 48 hours for graduate students). The text is very clear, has great examples, ties in medical applications with the scientific explanations of principles, and has a wide array of online resources readily available. With very little exception, every page is worth the reading for medical students, and is helpful for them in learning what they need to know to become fully conversant in medical genetics and well acquainted with the general principles and emerging technologies. [I wish the cytogenetics chapter were illustrated better, but this is a minor weakness relative to the other strengths in the text.]This is not the best text available for graduate students in clinical or medical genetics if the text is to be used alone (i.e. not supplemented with articles to add deeper levels of details). For students with a full 3-credit graduate course in medical genetics, it does not have quite sufficient depth, in my opinion. I don't have any significant experience teaching undergraduates, and will leave that area to others.All in all, these authors have put together the clearest and most concise resource on medical genetics, and I highly recommend it for any audience whose needs are for efficient and palatable material on the principles of medical genetics."},{"Title":"Medical Genetics","review":"This book was intended to prepare medical students to understand the basic science principles that form the foundation of clinical genetics. It is not intended to be a clinical handbook. It does an excellent job showing how the clinical genetic diseases illustrate the scientific principles of genetics. I think that it is very well written, and forms a foundation to pursue more clinical studies."},{"Title":"Medical Genetics","review":"This book is extremely limited in discussing how these genetic disorders manifest themselves clinically. I would not recommend this book for students who plan to apply their knowledge in the clinical setting. Explanations of certain genetic terms are not always clearly defined nor are certain biologic processes such as meiosis. Overall, a poorly written book for anyone but a graduate student of genetics."},{"Title":"Medical Genetics","review":"This book was required for our med school PBL courses, and I can certainly understand why. The text is nicely written, and the \\"Clinical Commentary\\" sections are great for understanding how we as physicians come into the picture. A subject like genetics can become very formidable if not presented correctly, but (thankfully) this book got it right."},{"Title":"Medical Genetics","review":"I did not select this book, it was required for a class I was taking, but it is a well written book.

Michael St. Claire, once a young street kid, now is a powerful property deceloper and this is how he meets Leigh. I had trouble identifying with either the hero or the heroine and did not find this book all that interesting. Both characters have painful ghosts to overcome and emotional traumas from the past undermine this prospective relationship. Many might find this book a good read, but I found myself bored half way through the book. I don't know why, because this is the type of book I usually like to read."},{"Title":"Maybe Tomorrow","review":"I agree with the other reader. It was hard to really get into the characters and the way their problems were resolved left me dissatisfied. I could have better spent my money."},{"Title":"Maybe Tomorrow","review":"I picked this book up from the library on a whim. The cover had a glowing review from Nora Roberts, so I thought why not? Let me tell you why not. The dialogue is trite. The plot is boring. Leigh Evans, the main character, is immature, brainless, and cold. She treats her father like dirt for, as a turns out, a very lame reason. Likewise, she takes her anti-men stance too far with her love interest, Michael St. Claire. If she were a real person, I would feel sorry for her family and friends."},{"Title":"Maybe Tomorrow","review":"I could hardly believe the disparaging reviews previously featured. I immediately ran to grab the book to see what all the animosity was about - throwing books on the floor?I read the book and athough probably not the best in the world, I felt it certainly did not deserve the slams it received. Yes, the characters are flawed, but so are real humans. While most of the other reviewers had a hard time with the heroine, Leigh, I had the greatest difficulty with the hero, Michael. What an incrediably obnoxious, arrogant, INSENSITIVE man. All he could do was laugh at every situation not matter how the other person was suffering. I don't think Leigh treated her father like dirt. Considering the brainwashing her mother had accomplished on her, I think she treated her Dad with kid gloves. So she misunderstood her Dad - tell me who isn't misunderstood? I, too, didn't care for how everything was tidied up including the final interchange between Leigh and her father. Life is not tidy. Very, very few of us have a sudden ephiphany where everything in our life is resolved. But then, the majority of romance books are just that -happily ever after endings. We keep buying them, don't we?"},{"Title":"Maybe Tomorrow","review":"Was there a deadline that needed to be met? The ending was so abrupt that it left me totally dissatified. It started out pretty good as a relationship-character story. All of a sudden all the little subcharacters (Shamus/Barbara; Jake/Sheila, etc.) had to be tied into nice little endings except for Leigh and Michael. For all of Leigh's independence, her mere acceptance of Michael's influence on her growing client list was unacceptable. Sure they love each other, but there were still unresolved issues. To be honest, when I got to the end of this book, I threw in on the floor in disgust. How unfilling it turned out to be. I have read Ms. Hohl's other books and I have never felt like this before."},{"Title":"How to Enter Screenplay Contests...and Win!: An Insiders Guide to Selling Your Screenplay to Hollywood","review":"Okay, so the title is completely misleading. After reading the title, I picked up this book expecting to learn about how past winners made it that far, from how they selected the best contests for their screenplay to their techniques in entering. I expected a book full of success stories and testimonials I could look to when feeling a little discouraged. But it's not what I got.I would describe this as a market listing more than a how-to book. It provides information on more than 150 screenplay competitions, with the usual market directory information: entry fees, categories, sponsors, contact information, deadlines, rules, etc. But when it comes to making that leap from an overwhelming list of contests to THE contest that is best for a screenplay (if such a thing exists), the pickings are fairly slim here. The book contains a smattering of short interviews and features on specific contests, but the focus here is on where to go and not how to get there.The fact is that contest information is available (and often more current) in the trade magazines and on numerous websites. This book might provide a good place to start searching for the right contests, but ultimately it hasn't filled any need that I wasn't able to fill elsewhere."},{"Title":"How to Enter Screenplay Contests...and Win!: An Insiders Guide to Selling Your Screenplay to Hollywood","review":"Was so unhappy with this book I resold it the next day. Nothing here that cannot be found for free at a zillion web sites."},{"Title":"How to Enter Screenplay Contests...and Win!: An Insiders Guide to Selling Your Screenplay to Hollywood","review":"For the price of this book, there isn't a lot of information presented here. But the author, Erik Joseph, does at least provide an overview of what to expect when entering a screenplay contest.The first part of the book describes structuring. I was skeptical about this section in particular since I've seen some great screenwriting books devoted to this. And, the author doesn't really go much into structure but scratch the surface, relying on quotes to guide the novice screenwriter.But Mr. Joseph does at least cover what the screenwriting contests consider standard formatting for screenplays. So I'd say his advice on formatting was effective and helpful.As for the screenwriting contests themselves, Mr. Joseph provides a one page overview of 42 screenwriting competitions. This section could definitely have been condensed. I think about every screenwriting journal out there lists these contests frequently in their respective publications (&quot;Creative Screenwriting,&quot; by the way, is my personal favorite of those publications).Further along in the book are a few interviews. I always like interviews in screenwriting books, and I will sometimes buy a screenwriting book just for the interviews. However, these are very short and terse and could have been more effective (I guess not everyone can interview like Barbara Walters, so I'll cut the author SOME slack).An excellent chapter (only two pages though) is entitled &quot;Good Examples of Bad Screenwriting.&quot; It contains actual samples of bad writing in submitted entries. Examining those atrocities was very helpful. However, I thought the author could have expanded on these a little more or explained why he chose specific ones for inclusion (are these frequent mistakes? how can one best avoid them? what are good sources for further refinement of grammar?)Overall, I will give &quot;How to Enter Screenplay Contests &amp; Win!&quot; four stars because it is effective in its discussion of screenwriting contests. However, I would have liked more advice and a longer book (it's 170 pages; but a lot of the pages are partially blank). And the cover of the book was not up to par due to the advertising blurbs on it that were entirely superfluous (&quot;over $3 million in guaranteed cash!&quot; on the front cover; and &quot;win millions of dollars with your movie idea!&quot; on the back cover).In short, I'd like to see a second edition of this book that is expanded upon.

Whicker did an excellent job researching the events in the book and I appreciated the excellent epilogue.

But, if you are from southern Indiana, you'll love it even more. The author has written an exciting, well researched book that tells the true story of Erika Lehman who is a German spy during WW2. She and her father are very close friends with Hitler who is fully aware of Erika's profession and is proud of her accomplishments. Her last mission brings her to America and she infiltrates the shipbuilding facility in Evansville. My heart rate didn't slow for a couple hours after finishing this book.

And, yet, she was also beautiful, womanly and passionate....She was selected to spy on the military works located in Evansville during WWII, where the LST's were being engineered and eventually built that would enable the Brits and Americans and Canadians to attack fortress Europe in mass with massive forces and materials.This is a beautiful story with an amazing amount of background information.I only wish that someone such as Steven Spielberg would pick up on this book and make an action movie of it as it would be notable.Someone reading this book and interested in history might also want to know that toward the end of WWII, the Germans got a bit of payback...there was the mass evacuation of Poland, and Eastern Germany of over 2,000,000 germans, mostly civilians, and that at least 25,000 of those were killed by Russian subs.Over 2,000,000 German women were raped by Russian troops and the following excerpt speaks to this: \\"It began in mid-October 1944, when Red Army forces first broke into German East Prussia. Spurred on by the hate filled calls to violence against Germans by Soviet Jewish propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg, Red Army troops systematically plundered and murdered Germans unfortunate enough to fall into their hands. [3]One of the first towns taken by the Soviets was Nemmersdorf, in the Gumbinnen district of East Prussia. It was only because German forces succeeded in recapturing this town a short time later that the world was able to learn how Soviet troops had set about brutally raping females of all ages, and slaughtering the old men, women and children there. The fortunate ones were shot out of hand. Many were clubbed or hacked to death. After being raped, naked women were nailed to doors in crucifix positions. In one case, a group of refugees was crushed under Soviet tanks. [4]\\"\\"Astonishingly, only about 25,000 lives were lost in what one historian has called \\"the greatest evacuation operation in history,\\" a figure that is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that by this time the remnants of the German air force were almost powerless to fend off attacks by enemy fighter planes and submarines. [5]This record of success masks human catastrophes of almost inutterable horror -- including the three most terrible ship sinkings, in terms of lives lost, in history. The first of the great German evacuation ships to go down, the Wilhelm Gustloff, was hit by three torpedoes from Soviet submarine S-13 on the night of January 30th. It sank after 70 minutes, taking with it at least 5,700 lives, and perhaps as many as 7,000. Only about 900 could be rescued from the sub-freezing waters of the Baltic by convoy vessels. [6]\\"Actually, I've read that the real loss of lives on the Gustloff was more than 9,300, that there were many civilians on board than the official list recorded because of the hurried nature of their departure.In addition, I would certainly recommend \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners : Ordinary Germans and The Holocaust\\" which goes a long way toward showing that Hitler was amongst friends and neighbors when it came to killing their fellow jews."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"Good start.

It was not very creative and I feel it only dragged on.

This is a must read!"},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Kept me way past midnight several nights in a row. The plot and character development that takes place throughout the chapters is fascinating and spellbinding. This true story is better than science fiction. And, for those of you who have not eaten fiddlers at Dog Town or brain sandwiches at the Hill Top, it is worth the trip to Evansville just to do that. I visited LST 325 that is now moored in Evansville near the site of the old Navy shipyard that built the LSTs during the war and personally met Mike Whicker. He is a great guy to talk with, and I hope he writes another novel in the near future."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I can't think of enough accolades for this book.

Very well researched and moves along very quickly. Couldn't wait to get to the next chapter and was unhappy when it was over. Includes insightful look at the internal politics in the Nazi high command, fascinating account of the training program for German spies, and a thoroughly entertaining and suspenseful trip through the Mid-West in wartime."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"This book went into details much like Tom Clancy's do. I became totally engrossed in the story after a slow start. Whicker wove facts about WWII that I had never even thought about. Having gone through one of the LSTs as a child, having a father who worked at the shipyard here in Evansville made it even more fascinating. The German viewpoint was especially interesting."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I was given this book as a gift and let it sit for a month or so before starting to read it.

As much reading as I do, I seldom stay up late with a book. This one had me into the wee hours. Of many standout aspects of this novel, two things are particularly noteworthy: the main character is a wonderful. I was fascinated by her. Secondly, the detail of all things WW II in America and Germany makes this work something very special. The detail fits seemlessly into the story and is of strong interest in and of itself.The only complaint is that that the novel ended. I wanted to read more and more about Erika Lehmann.I thought how great it would be if this were made into a movie but then there's too much here for that. An HBO, Showtime, Starz series would be better. As an actress for Erika look at Carice van Houton in the Dutch movie The Black Book, also set during WW II."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I, like many readers, bought the book because I was impressed by the high amazon.com reviews.

The author bio information says he is a football coach? Unbelievable."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"Invitation to Valhalla is a rare perspective of the Nazi spy effort. Whicker develops the female lead to such a degree that the reader cheers for the enemy. It is hard to distinguish where fact leaves off and fiction begins!"},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"Strong characters, well-researched material, intrigue, and a great WWII story, based on fact, describes this incredible book. Mike Whicker is a master story teller. Invitation to Valhalla is a page turner from beginning to end. The story of Ericka needs to be on the silver screen."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I ordered this book on a whim based on the superlative Amazon reviews. I am very glad to have done so. Mike Whicker weaves an enthralling tale of spy games and political wrangling amid the tensions of World War II with well-developed characters and impeccable historical detail. The protagonist Erika Lehmann is the seductive Nazi spy, perfect in just about every way, and a personal favorite of the Fuhrer himself. We learn about her motivations and gain insight into her personality in an engaging fashion. The other characters are just as well done. I especially enjoyed Whicker's portrayal of Charles Pulaski. The first half of the book is mainly set in Nazi Germany with flashback chapters to pre-war Paris, featuring such notables as Heinrich Himmler, Eva Braun and of course Adolf Hitler. Whicker skillfully portrays the most notorious man of the 20th century in a manner that does not fall into the sterotype of evil madman. The book is worth reading for the author's interpretation of the man alone. The second half moves the action to the American Midwest without losing any steam along the way. Several characters are introduced and their individual plotlines tied together in the masterpiece of an ending that leaves the reader contemplating long after reading the last word. Whicker does not skimp on a single detail with whatever he describes, be it spy techniques for infiltrating foreign countries or Jim Crow laws as they apply to train passengers. As a result one is subjected to delightful period immersion. This book works on so many levels: as a spy novel, a work of historical fiction, an illustration of life in World War II for people of different backgrounds in different countries. One annoyance is that the book blurb on the back cover reveals a little too much for there to be any surprises in the initial chapters. Another weak complaint is that the book ends too soon. But these are minor quibbles; words alone cannot decribe what a pleasure this novel is. Get this book."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"Being tired of reading best seller fiction, I went to the depths of Amazon reviews during a late night marathon browsing session. \\"Invitation to Valhalla\\" was the first spy genre novel I have read. It is also one of the best written novels. Fellow Amazon reviewers were right on the money on this one. A classic which should get far more exposure.DWC"},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I could not put this book down, and I have since ordered a number of copies as gifts for family and friends. Every person to whom I have given the book has loved it also. Several have told me they lost sleep because they could not quit reading it. I highly recommend Invitation to Valhalla, both for its historical content about a little-known WWII event and for its excellent suspense writing."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"Although I live in Evansville (the city at the heart of the novel), I had to be turned on to Invitation to Valhalla by someone on the other side of the world. The recommendation I received, from a friend in Australia, demonstrates the story's universal appeal. I am not usually a fan of the genre, but Invitation was so brilliant I read it three times in a row. Everything from the setting to the characters is brilliant, and obviously painstaking research makes the story undeniably accurate. The approach Whicker takes is refreshingly open. The Nazis are simply Nazis, not glorified or sympathetic, but not demonized either. The metallurgist Mayer is not made to be an impossibly pious representation of his people; this is becoming increasingly rare in books dealing with the era. The heroes are heroes because of their actions, and the villains are such for the same reason. I enjoyed the novel as a Midwesterner, a Jew, and as a historian. Most of all however, I enjoyed the novel as a book lover. You will enjoy this book, and like me you will be waiting anxiously for a second helping of Whicker."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"It's great when you have one you can't put down. They don't come along often enough. By the time you are half-way through this book you might as well forget about going to bed."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I read Mike Whicker's book while enroute to and during a summer vacation in Maine and Massachusetts. I may forget the details ofmy trip, but I won't soon forget INVITATION TO VAHALLA! To say Icouldn't put it down sounds trite, but it was nevertheless true of this gripping spy-thriller based on WWII espionage in my hometown. The German spy who penetrated our weak homeland defences was a remarkable woman who accomplished remarkable feats. This book will hold the attention of a wide age-range and both genders."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I'm not exaggerating when I say that Invitation to Valhalla is the most spine-tingling novel I've ever read.

I didn't have high hopes simply because the trailers made it sound like a spy novel. It's a spy novel I couldn't put down. It also dives into the thought processes and propaganda machines of Nazi Germany, enlightening the reader as to why history turned out the way it did. This is one I won't forget for a while."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I am an avid reader and \\"Invitation To Valhalla\\" is one of the best reads I have come across in a long time.

A highly recommended read.Gerald Hardig"},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"From someone who worked at the Evansville shipyard during World War II, I really enjoyed the book. It kind of leaves you hanging at the end a little more than I like, but the suspense keeps you reading from chapter to chapter, no doubt about that."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"Dont have the words to praise the author enough. He knows the WW2 and has a lot of background about Adolf Hitler and his rise to power and the henchmen he relied to keep him in power.

It was difficult to put the book down once I started reading it!"},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"* SPOILERS...*I have been to Evansville and visited the LST so that is actually how I found out about this book. The first half of the book, I thought was all right but there was too much sadism for my taste. Also the character of Erika Lehmann did not really come out - it was all about men reacting to her, and she was an enigma.The book really picked up for me once she started her mission to the US. I really loved her journey to her destination and her challenges on the way. And the first hint we got to her personality (besides maybe rescuing someone earlier) was when she was deciding what to do with an injured man on the rocks. Interestingly enough we didn't see much of Erika's relationship with her primary target Joe. She just bites him and the rest is history. ??My favorite part was the tension between Joe's uncle and Erika, as well as the time when the FBI agent turned to look at Erica in the nightclub and she was already looking at him. In some ways she was a major creep! And I definitely liked that aspect. Her mission swimming across the Ohio River was a scene that was written just perfect. I kept wanting her to succeed and then had to stop myself and think \\"NO -- SHE IS GETTING INFORMATION FOR HITLER AND THE NAZIS!!\\" I definitely want to buy the next book and find out more of her adventures.Another thing I liked, when you are sort of 'tricked' into thinking that Erika is posing as a blonde but really she has dyed her hair. That shows the author is going the extra mile to make it a good book."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"Wonderful blend of history and imagination.

This novel is not 100% accurate; maybe as accurate as a Hollywood movie, but it maintains the reader's interest, nonetheless. Yes, the LST was developed in the mid west, but the novelist allowed his imagination to run wild--good for us readers, I might add. I just quibble his historical mistakes and slants: Hitler never won an election. Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Hindenburg January 1933, because Hitler controlled the political party with the largest number of seats in the Reichstag. The SA was insignificant after 1934's Night of the Long Knives--Hitler's coup to secure full power. The SS was now in complete control, with Ernest Roehm dead and the SA virtually disbanded; and anywhere between 80 and hundreds of opponents and enemies of Hitler murdered. As for Operation Pastorius, eight German saboteurs landed on US soil in New York and Florida. Two, Ernest Burger and George Dasch, turned themselves in to the FBI and the rest were easily caught. The eight were tried in Washington, D.C. They were found guilty and sentenced to death. Burger's death sentence was commuted to life, and Dasch's death sentence commuted to 30 years; in 1948 both of them were deported to then Western Germany. The other six were electrocuted, not hanged, 8 August 1942 in Washington, D.C. and buried in pauper graves. The Germans never had much success as spies in America. The OSS was founded in 1941 by William Donovan at the request of Franklin Roosevelt then went operational in 1942. It was formed to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for US armed forces. The FBI fought enemy spy activities in the United States and Latin America. J. Edgar Hoover guarded his fiefdom with particular care. I do NOT believe that the OSS operated on American soil, as it would have been against its charter just as it is for the CIA. There were other errors, but this was a fairly good read; my rating reflects that."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews, looking for a thriller that I could really enjoy. Truth be told, put a swastika on the front of any book and I'll probably buy it...the concept of unadulterated evil in civilized western Europe fascinates me. Hard to believe it was just 65 years ago. But I digress.Apparently, Invitation to Valhalla is not a thriller, it's a fictionalized representative of actual historical events. That explains the unevenness of the novel, where I am sure the author worked hard to get the facts straight at a cost to the plot cohesion.But what really ticked me off was when I read one of the other books I bought through Amazon, Reign of the Rat by Gil Smolin, who gave special thanks to his friend Mike Whicker, the author of \\"Invitation to Valhalla.\\" Both books, while enjoyable enough, seemed to have earned praise far beyond what they actually deliver. When great thrillers like \\"Day of the Jackal\\" and \\"Eye of the Needle\\" earn 4-1/2 stars, does this book even approach 5 stars? Heck no.Shame on any author who encourages, or condones, his friends and family stacking the reviews in favor of his book.

However, the book veers between the tone of a novel and that of a documentary. Sometimes this works, as when Heinrich Himmler is dealing with an administrative issue, and you realize, My God, he's matter-of-factly doing paperwork for a concentration camp. And there's one scene where Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbels are all in one room, and the reader wishes the roof would just fall in then and there. But the characters seem one-dimensional in many scenes; for example, what are we to think of Erika Lehmann ? She seems to move through the novel like a robot."},{"Title":"Invitation to Valhalla","review":"The book is well written but it bothers me that Hitler is portrayed as almost a sympathetic character."},{"Title":"DB2 Answers!

Of course, class and status doesn't exist amongst the wonderful peace loving Chinese and their gigantic slave empire, or the happy stoner Mexicans.I also loved how this new age witch doctor actually believes that Christianity and Buddhism are fundamentally different religions. This guy has to read a little Nietzsche.This is the fiction that all drug addicts wish for, that life is wonderful and everyone really DOES love each other, and that if it wasn't for those big bad Europeans we could all be sitting around getting messed up and not worry about eating, sleeping, procreating, building shelters, or other necessities of survival and reproduction.If you are a rich white liberal arts college graduate trying to find some justification for the utter pointlessness of an idle lifestyle, this book is for you.For the rest of us who don't get high every day because we actually enjoy using our limited time on this earth in a productive fashion, this book is useless.I don't know why the author doesn't just advocate outright suicide. it would be a lot faster."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Terrence McKenna was dubbed \\"the Timothy Leary of the '90s\\" by no less than Timothy Leary Himself.

HA! Any avid fan of Mckenna knows from his speeches that he is not for a populace of drug-users. In fact he feels only a select few should experience mind altering drugs, as most aren't responsible enough. I reiterate... VERY misleading on Kirkus's behalf.But onward.. McKenna, more or less sums up all his beliefs on humanity in this one book. It's his thesis on history more or less. He gives good examples of what the scientific community has shoved under the rug, and what these examples could do for liberating our theological minds. At times though, McKenna has the tendency to lose his audience with phrases like \\"Trancendent Other\\". He assumes a lot in such cases, but in the end he does provoke one's mind. Into considering the vast possibilities that remain untouched in Man's early history."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Not something I would normally read, but why not change things up from time to time? Overall, it is very engaging and McKenna presents some interesting theories. I am not sold on the main point, i.e. that psilocybin containing mushrooms played a part in human evolution and are the foundation of the first religious experiences. They undoubtedly played a part in specific shamanistic cultures since the Neolithic period, but he falls into the same trap as Marija Gimbutas (who I was not surprised to see cited in the book) in jumping to conclusions without any contextual proof of their interpretation of artwork from lost cultures. Nonetheless, I found some of the evidence compelling and enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"So it's a book I've heard many talk of and seen at many hippie stoner like friends houses for years (not to label anyone but you know). A mix of enjoying Joe Rogans podcast and Lorenzo's podcast the psychedelic salon has made me sit down and say I need to read this, as a person who hasn't read a book since high school may I mind you. This kicks ass, Terrence Mckenna is the man and speaks of things I wasn't educated on and pulled out of my ass at like age 15 after my first shroom trip, kind of got made fun of for it, so this is great to see educated scholars schooling the world about the truth of spirituality. And after reading most of it, (I am on the last chapter as I write this) I understand Terrence Mckenna's lectures so much better because I feel I kind of get him now."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Food of the Gods is one of the first recommended books that I purchased from Amazon. I enjoyed the idea of learning about the history of plants, drugs, and human evolution, but I had no clue where Terence McKenna was going to go with this, let alone who he was. Having said that, I was very surprised when I found out that the majority of this book was about psychedelic mushrooms and even more surprised when I found myself believing McKenna's arguments towards the benefits of them. He has a very open mind when it comes to things like this and after reading just the beginning of this book, I knew this would be a entertaining read.The beginning of the book is basically a breakdown of the practices of shamanism and other earlier tribes who experimented with psychedelic mushrooms. McKenna argues that the very fundamental things that make us who we are, religion, sex, and language, were all brought on, if not built upon, by the use of psychedelic mushrooms. Through these means we were able to create and build upon the things that make us the evolved humans we are today.I was also fascinated by McKenna's view on alcohol. \\"Alcoholism as a social and community problem appears to have been rare before the discovery of distillation. Just as heroin addiction was the malignant flower that sprang from the relativity benign habit of opium use, so distilled changed the sacred art of the brewer and the vintner into a profane economic engine for the consumption of human hopes.\\" McKenna believes that in these days of our existence we have become a male dominated society. Just to give one of many examples, \\"How many women have their first sexual experiences in an atmosphere of alcohol use that ensures that these crucial experiences take place entirely on dominator terms?\\" Even when we speak of God, we are talking as if \\"he\\" is a male when clearly there is no form that God takes.\\"...I would prefer to separate the vision-producing plants from the popular notion of drugs. The global drug problem is a different issue entirely and has to do with the fates of nations and mega-dollar criminal syndicates. I avoid synthetic drugs and prefer the organic hallucinogens, because I believe that a long history of shamanic usage is the first seal of approval that one must look for when selecting a substance for its possible effects on personal growth.\\" That last sentence is the key to understanding the point of psychedelic mushrooms: personal growth. I have only experienced psychedelic mushrooms once in my life, but it changed the person who I was forever. I had a very deep and understanding relationship with nature that day. You could say I saw the bigger picture of life and it made me appreciate everything around me from the nature that allows us to thrive to the connection we all have as human beings. Some people will never experience psychedelic mushrooms for a variety of reasons, mostly being because it is still considered a drug, but I want to give everyone an idea of what the DEA considers to be the most dangerous drugs on the market: Schedule 1 drugs. This section lists marijuana, peyote, magic mushrooms, LSD, and ecstasy as the most dangerous drugs with no medical value. Some Schedule 2 drugs which are considered to have some sort of medical value are cocaine, crack, speed, PCP, and morphine. Why is it that \\"drugs\\" like marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms are considered to be more dangerous than PCP and crack? Lets just say that hypothetically you and I both do crack and marijuana. Don't you think that our parents would send us to a rehabilitation center for crack users before we went for marijuana? So why is it that most of the examples in the DEA Schedule 1 list contain drugs that many people feel help fuel personal growth? Personally, these drugs are most dangerous to the government than us because they allow us, in the appropriate setting, to think outside the box. If anyone chooses to believe that those Schedule 1 drugs are much more dangerous than the Schedule 2 drugs, they have every right to believe that, but if I can personally grow from the experience of those drugs like psychedelic mushrooms, I guess I am considered to be the most dangerous of abusers in our society."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Mr McKenna's writings flow so smoothly that it is impossible not to read him. The thesis is developed thoroughly in breadth and grows forward with coordination and poise that allows one to read through scientific supporting terminology which one is technically unfamiliar with and still get the greater concepts and conclusions. He is truly the reincarnation of James Joyce as a scientist in pursuit of the understanding of Life. One readily realizes that there is nothing more important than understanding who and what we are and Terence has given us a clear view of a loving world culture that fits the planet like a glove. The buddhist embodiment of wisdom and compassion for all. What an amazing book to read and read again. If there is a savior for our Life form on this planet, it is the late Terance McKenna."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"I seriously was astounded by this book. Great historical knowledge on all sorts of drug and plant use from primates to Bush administration. McKenna really goes in depth about the evolution of language and consciousness. His theory that primates found psilocybin containing mushrooms growing in cow dung in the grasslands of Africa. Is represented quite well. He believes we may have literally \\"eaten our way to a higher conscious\\". McKenna really makes the war on drugs look like an absolute joke. He is subtly condescending of close minded politics yet brilliant and charming in informing readers of the power and potential of consciousness expanding drugs if taken properly."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"This book is very good if you are into evolution, shamanism, and the human life.

Now although this book is not devoid of facts, even Terence would (and did) admit that the theory that human consciousness sprang from the use of the hallucinogenic mushrooms is rather speculative. NonethelessTerence's strength is not science per se, but getting us to thinkand rethink, getting us to break the routine of our normal worldview and look at our lives and life differently....breaking set.Thomas"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Terence gives a history of mans use and interaction with drugs. He sheds light on why in today's society certain drugs are taboo, while other drugs like Alcohol, Caffeine and Nicotine are accepted.

The author's speculations on our long lost mutualist relationship with plants has deep implications in science and offers sound insight into modern conditions of human iniquity.To give you an idea, McKenna postulates that:- The loss of the feminine in today's 'dominator' cultureshas been further catalyzed by our abuse of plants, drugs,and nature as a whole- The psychedelic experience, with its ego dissolving effectsrepresents an important component of the symbiosis of manon Earth- The striking similarities in the chemical structures ofneurotransmitters in the brain and indole compounds inhallucinogenic plants are no coincidenceDespite the exhaustively researched and largely scholarly presentation of this work, unfounded criticism ensues when the subject matter stands as evidence in the indictment of many commonly held belief systems. However, most often the tone of McKenna's opponents caries the confident smirk of one safely distanced from his fierce intelligence, by their lack of experience with psychedelics.Terrence McKenna didn't write for the amusement of those unfamiliar with the psychedelic experience. It was well within his mental capacity and scholarly abilities to legitimize his work for an audience of intellectual indifference. I wont say it's easier, but it certainly displays less integrity and truth of cause for one to cater to the lowest common denominator when attempting to relate ideas of this scope, even if they are only speculative.Neither was it that the uninitiated were intentionally ignored and his priceless intellectual contribution was meant to be out of reach from common people, in an extension of Huxley's philosophy which he is often mistaken for representing.Rather, his weakness seems to be his naivety in assuming that people inexperienced with psychedelics would approach his work with the unbiased mindfulness due of a reader of any great work of cultural and spiritual diagnosis.The fact is that any intelligent, honest approach to this work will inevitably lead one to an intersection with a reality that cannot be negated.Those who are experienced with psychedelics are likely to find in this book truths which they will integrate without hesitance - truths with implications profound enough to dissolve many of the illusions that largely pass as fact.This book is a powerful catalyst of intellectual growth for anyone engaged in the pursuit to understand this world."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Terence McKenna (Food of the Gods), Julian Jaynes (Evolution of Consciousness ...), Camille Paglia (Sexual Personae), and Ruth Eisner (Chalice &amp; the Blade) all look at the same evidence, and come to radically different, but equally radical, conclusions about the origins of what we call civilization (while trying to keep a straight face). Reading all three is an interesting, fun, and maybe useful exercise in juggling different world views. Ask yourself: why did each of them see the same evidence differently?Or, perhaps, it's just a matter of trying to make too much soup from too little stock. The reason we CALL prehistory &quot;pre-history&quot; is that there's so little history to work from, so each brilliant (or not) author gets to project their own interpretation of what they'd LIKE the evidence to mean.In McKenna's case, by the end of the book, it is obvious what he wants the evidence to mean. Terry McKenna wants us all to get off of what the Church of the SubGenius calls &quot;Conspiracy Drugs,&quot; the ones that America got rich off of, like tobacco, caffeine, white sugar, distilled alcohol, and television. If we need to get high or drunk or trashed or whatever, he says that we need to go back to the drugs that first made human beings strong, fast, smart, sexy, and spiritual: organic psychedelics.Of COURSE this is a weird and controversial view point. That's half the fun of this book. You know that only the trippers and the stoners are going to come out of the back end of this book fully convinced. But even if you're not one, you just mind find yourself a teensy bit convinced, and that, my friend, is a strange sensation.Besides, it's a rollicking fun read."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"_Food of the Gods_ by Terence Mckenna is an excellent addition to anyone's \\"alternative anthropology\\" library. New ideas regarding the origins of intellegent life are always very interesting. Mckenna also has some valuble sociological insights regarding the history of drug abuse, and reminds us that sugar, coffee, and chocolate are potent psychoactive substances that are just as addictive and just as unhealthful as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or psilocybin. It is refreshing to see someone try to level the playing field with regards to drug use, and finally admit that almost every adult in the entire western world is highly dependent on a variety of different drugs. It seems that Mckenna is taking a step in the right direction from a civil rights standpoint by lessening the taboos associated with certain drugs that are associated with the counter-culture, while reminding us of the caffeine and sugar addiction epedemic that is going on right under our noses. This book made me realize that drugs which are widely accepted and advocated by civilized society are not that much different from those which are outlawed. Overall, this is a fascinating anthropological and counter-cultural manifesto. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Before reading Food of the Gods, I thought that I was paranoid concerning western civilization. After I finished it, I became aware of all these little and big things which McKenna ties to the ego-dominator complex. McKenna has a way of putting things which describes human civilization as no one else I have read has. He does not write about the psylocybin experience, its effects on the human mind, but the impact of its effects on our civilization, across millions of years. I expected this to be a book of his theories about the Stropharia cubensis species being part of the cosmic gateway of data and consciousness transference, but this is about us, humanity, and what we have done with our minds, our bodies and our planet. This book kind of brings it all back home. I enjoyed it immensely. Get it :)"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"If you are looking for a thought provoking book that is a bit left field, but well written, this book is for you. The main premise of the book is that due to climate changes homonids were forced to adapt eating habits to include previously untried foods, such as psychoactive plants and mushrooms, and that this led to an evolutionary jump for the species. McKenna then shows historically how and why certain drugs have become dominant and what this could mean for humanity. McKenna's idea concerning the origin of the human species is an interesting conjecture but the evidence seems too thin to me, but on the other hand his analysis of the effects of drugs on western civilization hits the nail on the head. Alcohol, tobacco, coffee, chocolate, sugar and television (yes, television) are all promoted or are tolerated by society. McKenna shows you why this is and what it could mean for our future. A previous reviewer said that McKenna promotes the annihilation of the mind, which is patently false. I can hardly believe he read the book. Whether you agree or disagree with the theories presented in this book it will make you think and entertain you in the process. The mind is what got humanity to this point in history and it is the key to our collective future. That is what this book represents, being responsible for our own consciousness and the world that we create."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"I'd just like to note that the implication Ace Backwords made in his review is very misleading.As \\"Ace\\" so eloquently stated: \\"Then one day, McKenna was suddenly hit by a massive brain tumor from \\"a rare and strange form of brain cancer,\\" and died shortly thereafter at age 53. And suddenly people weren't quite as excited about McKenna's theories regarding the injesting of exotic psychedelic drugs.\\"However, the doctors were asked at point blank about McKenna's drug use in relation to his tumor. The doctors reply was that they were in NO WAY related. In fact, they said, the marijuana he smoked should have actually shrunk the tumor! Furthermore, it has been proven scientifically that psychedlic mushrooms are safer than over the counter aspirin! In studies of LD50/ED50 (lethal dose in 50%/effective dose in 50%) in mice aspirin proved to be over 6 times more toxic to the body/brain than psilocybin, the active component in magic mushrooms.The doctors said the tumor had nothing to do with the psychedelic drugs.Also note that this book is absolutely astounding. A must read.:)"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"This is a fascinating world history told through the eyes of the last leader of the psychedelic community. McKenna argues that, before the onslaught of the current dominator-model of society, humans lived in happy partnership, united in their love for mother earth. The key to this society was the ingestion of magic mushrooms, a psychedelic plant that offers its eater a view of a benevolent, beautiful and inherently vegetable mind -- the necessary vision for life in a partnership model.McKenna makes a valid argument and the book is filled with very interesting ideas, though the middle section is bogged down with shred after shred of &quot;evidence&quot; pointing towards ancient mushroom use. This is a truly great book, though Archaic Revival is a much easier and enjoyable introduction to Terence McKenna and his outrageous yet convincing ideas."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"The following review has special application to those who would seek to dismiss this book out-of-hand once they get an inkling of the controversial positions it describes. My questions and comments to these people are as follows:Have you read it? Have you read Eisler's \\"The Chalice And The Blade\\", the anthropological text upon which McKenna bases much of his argument? Lastly, and most importantly, have you experienced psilocybin (the 5 dried gram dosage recommended by the author)? Have you ever tried to induce a mystical experience with the use of this sacred medicine? If not, then what makes you think you have a leg to stand on? Apparently, this is an experience which you won't even allow to be included in your model of the world. And, yet, did you happen to notice the cultural revolution in civil rights and anti-war sentiment which occurred during America's brief exposure to psychedelics?Are you at all familiar with shamanism, the oldest form of spiritual practice on the planet? Have you researched the various indigenous societies around the world which have been safely utilizing plant allies for centuries, if not millenia? Are you familiar with their peaceful way of life? They work an average of sixteen hours a day -- they aren't slaves to a fanatical work ethic. They don't promote a way of life which entails the massive waste of human and environmental resources, and the accumulation of untold tons of junk. They never posed a threat to the survival of all animal life on this planet, as we're doing now. They don't live superficial, unreflective, spiritually-bankrupt lives, as the vast majority of Americans do. They wouldn't know the meaning of a \\"post-modern existential crisis\\". These people never fell from grace. They're dancing in the Garden of Eden as we speak. That doesn't interest you??Psychedelics may seem to be a fringe issue, existing in the margins of human experience, but in many cultures, and for thousands of years, they are or have been recognized as a central part of how we establish harmonious conditions within ourselves, between each other, and in the natural world. \\"It is no measure of health, to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.\\" (~ Jiddu Krishnamurti)McKenna traces the history of man from a unique perspective, drawing attention to a previously neglected, yet formidable, dimension of human experience; namely, our relation to the plant kingdom. He illustrates, with the exactness and discipline of a true scholar, how we have co-evolved with certain plant species, and how human consciousness has (and, consequently, how human events have) shifted in relation to the chemicals we have sanctioned. The abiding interest of mankind in experiencing novel tastes and states of consciousness is, for McKenna, something we need to acknowledge and come to terms with, if we are to reach the next stage of evolution. Just as sexuality was demonized and repressed during Victorian times, our culture is demonizing and repressing the natural human urge to experiment with, and to expand, uncommon states of consciousness through the ingesting of psychedelic compounds.As philosopher Alan Watts wrote in his book \\"The Joyous Cosmology; Adventures in The Chemistry of Consciousness\\": \\"There is no difference in principle between sharpening perception with an external instrument, such as a microscope, and sharpening it with an internal instrument such as one of these... If they are an affront to the dignity of the mind, the microscope is an affront to the dignity of the eye and the telephone to the dignity of the ear.\\"I suggest you look into the recent study conducted by John's Hopkins University, in which psilocybin was administered to subjects who subsequently rated it among the five most significant and transformative experiences of their lives. Rigorous scientific evidence now exists to support the claim that states of awareness induced by psilocybin are indistinguishable from those experienced by the great saints and mystics of all time. I submit to you that there is nothing more humble than a mushroom, and that nothing is more humbling than finding God in a mushroom. \\"The fool laughs when he hears the way. If the fool did not laugh, it wouldn't be the way.\\" (~ Lao Tzu) In short, your dismissive scoffing is grossly insufficient to dispute the solid evidence in support of these claims.McKenna has given us a work, the true importance of which can hardly be overestimated. Like many great visionaries, he did not receive the credit due to him while he was alive. We can only hope that, for the sake of life on this planet, his work will eventually receive the recognition owed to it. Karmically speaking. ;)"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Human evolution depended on psychedelic mushrooms? Mushrooms came from outer space? Whoa! Any lunatic could have made some of the assertions Terrance McKenna makes in Food of the Gods and some probably already have.The difference between brilliance and lunacy is the ability to back up those wild statements with fascinating insights that make people think.McKenna's scholarship is not bound by controlled studies or data in the conventional sense. Unlike most scientists, McKenna is happy to speculate about the possibilities contained in his daydreams about the direction of the human race. Instead of pretending to be the academic expert, the sole arbiter of truth, instead passing off his speculations as conclusive McKenna assumes a tone that invites rather than commands. Though he had plenty of academic credentials to play with (a Ph.D. and decades of research) McKenna doesn't ask you to believe him so much as he asks you to listen. In some ways, this tone makes the wild assertions McKenna makes so much more digestible then so much conventional scientific writing propelled by less ambitious theses. One never need be on guard against the B.S., poorly defended arguments, psuedo reasoning and all the other tradecraft of scientists who care more about establishing their own authority than exploring ideas openly. Indeed, there is no way McKeena could have hid, tamed or toned down his speculations so wisely, he didn't even try to. His work suceeds at a high level because of it.I deeply respect Terrance McKenna's insights because of his approach, his bravery in dealing with subjects and asking questions that automatically made him an academic outsider and because I share his deep, abiding belief that nothing much good has come from Western civillization. He asked the questions he wanted to ask, motivated only by an enthusiasm for discovery.All that said, I have to admit that the central theme of Food of the Gods, that human evolution and mushrooms are intricately linked, somewhat tenuous. One needs to understand that McKenna doesn't deal in \\"probabilities\\" but possibilities and frankly, even though there is not enough evidence to support his primary claims, his corollary evidence and his ruminations about drugs, drug use and modern society and nothing short of brilliant and full of truth.Big picture: This book is the lifelong work of a genius at the pinnacle of his intelligence, clarity of mind, and bravery of spirit. It is a masterpiece.

To some, it will seem crazy, and even McKenna fans have problems with some of his more outlandish theories, but anyone who is interested in the human relationship with drugs has to study and understand McKenna's work.'Food of the Gods' concerns itself with evolution and the possible role played by drugs in that evolution - from the mushroom eating humanoids of the African grasslands to the Latte-sipping sophisticates of the technological age. His central thesis, which is becoming more scientifically acceptable with time, is that mushrooms were consumed by the earliest humans, and that the introduction of this transcendental experience into their animal existence led to the birth of religion, art, culture, and so on.If you're new to McKenna, I recommend 'The Archaic Revival' as more easily bitten off and chewed. This book sits somewhere in the middle of McKenna's cannon for accesibility. For the more advanced stuff, and the metaphorical envelope containing the meaning of life, you should graduate to 'The Invisible Landscape'.However, this is perhaps McKenna's most sweeping, ambitious work, and it reverberates with a lucidity, coherence and basic humanity that makes it easy to recommend to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"I am sure that when Terence McKenna knew he would have to go all the way with his research and essays or he shouldn't have done it at all... he does go all the way and farther.

His stoned apes theory is a bit much to swallow, however the message is an important one. I do believe the psychedelic experience is of immense value to the individual.It is the type of experience that, if nothing else, is of therapeutic value. I do believe there is more research which supports psychedelic therapy. There is a phenomenon called \\"ego death\\" which happens when mushrooms are ingested in higher doses. This is a very peculiar and transforming experience. It can take the most overconfident jock and reduce him to a scared little puppy. This is the type of stuff that has the potential to change society for the better. I do believe we would greatly benefit as a society if we not only ended the ban, but also accepted it as a means of experiencing spirituality in a society whose spirituality has been destroyed by organized religion.His stoned apes theory is not implausible, seeing the world from this new perspective could have helped start our characteristic model building, an idea Richard Dawkins expounds upon with his \\"Necker Cube\\" example. Eating mushrooms and getting horny could have a Darwinian advantage for obvious reasons. A psychedelically enlightened population may be more altruistic than one which is not. It is certainly more plausible than any creation theory I've heard. It is just lacking in conclusive evidence.It is sad that moving forward into the 21st century there are no outspoken spokesmen of the psychedelic experience. Perhaps now more than ever our society is starved for a more profound understanding of the world. This book is like looking through a window into the psychedelic experience; it's neat to look at, but to really be effected by it you have to experience it for yourself.

It's insightful, original, enjoyable, well supported, thoroughly researched, and mind alteringI must say that I've never before tried mushrooms, and was compelled to after this reading. McInnes and his obsession with dissolving boundaries is engaging in the way a poet or novelist would be, more than a scientist or researcher. The book is riddled with the authors side theories, and he makes connections and hypothesis which come from a genius originality . It's very clear when reading that the nitty gritty was not his favorite part of the research, because it tends to drag (Maybe that's just MY attention which drags). Yet his main points were always expressed in very poetic and articulate ways, that verge more on emotional and spiritual proof than empirical.That's just the thing! McInnes claims that science and empirical observation can not obtain full understanding because it does not take into account other \\"senses\\" besides the easily verifiable five. There are parts of his theory that take leaps which don't seem like hard and fast scientific proofs. Yet his belief that subjectivity is as much reality as what we can easily observe sober outside ourselves calls for a change in our approach to knowledge. This books seems to be an example of his new methods.This book is not the ramblings of a brain-melted hippy. It's a call for change from a intelligent, creative and enlightened psychonaut. It's a call for a new paradigm. It's compelling, and openminded, even if it can be a bit charged at times.I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Mckennas voice carries on so gently and purely through this entire piece of work. I was left with a gained sense of respect for these plants of the gods and my interaction with them throughout my life. I learned more about myself and my very own reason for ritual than ever before. RIP Terrance, we love you!!"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"SpiritThis book is a clear and cogent discussion around the most amazing substances ever to be found on our planet: many plants contain molecules that interact with human consciousness in marvelous, magical ways that cannot be described, but nevertheless have a lifelong impact on our sense of who we are, how we feel, and what we think. McKenna has for years been a consistent voice in the maelstrom of disinformation and hysteria that has occurred in the aftermath of the collapse of the drug culture of the 1960s. The popular press has overlooked the fact that for many of the pioneers of the psychedelic drug experience, taking drugs was a part of a legitimate spiritual quest. McKenna reminds us that this use of psychedelic drugs for increasing spritual awareness has been a part of the human experience since before the dawn of history.I can only hope that with our increasing understanding of the role of consciousness, mind, and spirit in the unfolding of the universe, reason will return to our conversations and decisions about mind-expanding drugs. \\"Food of the Gods\\" is a look at humanity's ancient and ongoing involvement with psychedelic plants, and a thoughtful discussion of what we have next to do in order to partner with these plants in discovering our true relatedness with the rest of this planet and its organisms."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"It's not necessary to be a fan of illegal narcotics to find this speculative investigation into the origins of human consciousness both provocative and convincing. I might be described as a moderate drinker at worst, and yet found this argument into the origins of human consciousness utterly plausible. However, if you're anything like the editorial writer from Kirkus review, and obviously uneasy with challenges to your established notions and beliefs, you will probably be resistant to the implications of the author's in-depth research and painstakingly well reasoned speculations. Indeed, you should be resistant to all speculation. The thesis always begs the anti-thesis. It is, however, disingenuous to compile a list of the most extraordinary implications of the divergent views presented by an author and then formally dismiss the work merely as &quot;unconvincing.&quot; I was not convinced by the work. But I could not honestly state that the argument was unconvincing. What makes this book so extraordinary is its ability to lead you to seemingly improbable and impossible conclusions, while rendering you incapable of denying either its sound logic or a better explanation of the facts, which brilliantly supported the thesis."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"This book provides a good overview of reflections of the late Terence McKenna, a celebrated icon of the contemporary psychedelic scene and discussion, comparable perhaps with Timothy Leary in the 1960's. For the curious reader, \\"Food of the Gods\\" offers a rich insight into his thought and its appeal. But that appeal turns out to be rather narrow and limited, unfortunately. Like Leary, McKenna commanded considerable attention, reaching a wide audience and achieving some degree of celebrity. But as reflected in the pages of this book, his analysis and views turn out to be surprisingly (I would even say disappointingly) weak, and fatally biased, with no solid substance.I am sure McKenna must have been a very nice man from what people say, and I don't necessarily suspect he was a dishonest person. Nor is he a bad writer. But for a subject as interesting as the human impact of hallucinogenic fungi, the discussion McKenna offers here leaves a lot to be desired. He tends to jump precipitously to his conclusions, and tries to support his arguments by speculation, often idle in nature, and rarely qualified with any semblance of scholarly rigor. This is surprising (and again, disappointing) because he is apparently well educated.For example, the glare of Lamarck's error is blinding in McKenna's speculations that psilocybin mushrooms may have catalyzed the very evolution of our species from its hominid ancestry. This is a good example of the kind of thought that seems to have excited so many readers of McKenna's works. But if you have a minimally sound understanding of the idea of natural selection, it's actually a little bit insulting to your intelligence (not that I think he meant it to be). McKenna's thesis of the extraterrestrial origin of Stropharia cubensis gleefully throws any and all pretense of informed reason to the wind, and I'm sure that's a lot of fun--but only in a cartoony, conceptually childish way.Readers seeking a more balanced understanding about psilocybin mushrooms will scratch their heads at how oblivious McKenna seems to findings from science. To me his writings recall \\"scientific creationists\\" and their style of argument. In fact, along these lines, one of the worst flaws in this book is its stifling, overbearing, disaffecting ideological rigidity. It is almost like what one sometimes sees in \\"creationism\\" but of opposite, left-wing rather than right-wing, character. The more different, the more the same? This is hokey, corny stuff, and actually not interesting, unless you are really into, well, overt propaganda really, about the \\"partnership\\" society of prehistory, and the \\"dominator\\" culture, and ... it just goes off into this sort of hambone rhetorical bait for anyone who will snap at it. Here, a lot of fashionable, widely circulating fairy tales about prehistory and pre-industrialized culture are installed at the foundation, where only a better informed theoretical perspective could serve. It's Rousseau's \\"noble savage\\" all over again, with PC retooling. (From my perspective, notions that other peoples are better or worse than we are, especially if they are really really different from us, probably tend to distort our image, and capacity for humane understanding, of both them and ourselves, sooner or later).One seeks in vain for a connection of any significance in this book to the prior works of pioneers such as Huxley, Alan Watts, Huston Smith, and R. Gordon Wasson, whose comments about the personal power and impact of their experiences with psilocybin mushrooms and/or similar agents are so insightful. McKenna actually challenges Wasson's thesis about Soma, suggesting it was not Amanita muscaria but ... you guessed it ... Stropharia cubensis. And true to form, he offers nothing amounting to evidence, only a chain of poorly reasoned supposition and speculations--a far cry from the exhaustive research and painstaking studies upon which Wasson based his theory.McKenna argues his ideas with all the passion he can muster, and perhaps this explains part of his appeal for some readers, especially if they share in his brand of polarized politics (note the unbridled enthusiasm on parade in many of the reviews posted here). So if firing your imagination with a lot of wild and wooly psychedelic surmises is your cup of tea, you will perhaps find this book entertaining. It's really a dalliance in mental self-stimulation for anyone whose tastes it appeals to. If a sound, well-informed perspective about a subject as important and interesting as ethnobotany is what you seek, well, this book is still good in that you can get a clear, detailed picture of the Terence McKenna phenomenon, and what it represents as a body of ideas or thought, what it is all about, the better for you to be able to evaluate its relative merits.Apart from that, this is essentially an uninteresting book on a fascinating subject. I would prefer to bear happier tidings, but \\"Food of the Gods\\" really fails to deliver a discussion worthy of the visionary promise of personal experiences with psilocybin mushrooms, compelling and glittering as that promise is.But don't take my word for it, read the book and see for yourself what you think. The good news is, if the king within it looks naked, you need not think there is anything wrong with you, even if you don't hear others around you mentioning this surprising fact. (BTW, McKenna's does have some good essays such as \\"Wasson's Literary Precursors\\" where his scholarship and writing can shine without being muddled by a lot of prank speculation, but they are not to be found in this book.)"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Before I found out about Terence Mckenna I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Before I tried Marijuana for the first time I was very very anti-drug. A complete rationalist who disregarded anything that couldn't be proven in a physical way. Even when I first started smoking I felt like \\"it's just a way to get messed up\\" but always thought deep down there was more to it.Enter my first Psilocybin experience and Terence Mckenna. This was the first book of his I read and it completely changed my life. You don't have to believe every one of his ideas or theories, just go into the book with an open mind. Out of all of his books this is clearly the most backed by factual evidence. It gives a great history on \\"drugs\\" in general, and even delves into drugs most people don't associate with the word such as sugar. A lot of great facts in this book, and you will undoubtedly take something away from it if you allow yourself to step outside your cultural boundaries for the duration of the book.

The premise sounds interesting enough: we stopped doing shrooms and got worse as a society, along with a history of cultural drug use.Let me sum up the book for you in case the premise sounds interesting to you:- Some ancient cultures used mushrooms.- Lots of cultures MAY have used mushrooms but we'll never know- Mushrooms may have helped the human brain evolve and help us evolve language- Ancient orgies on mushrooms are good for society because they dissolve social boundaries- He goes into a history of sugar and says it's just as addictive as heroin.- He goes into a history of lsd, cocaine, dmt, heroin, tea.- He suggests we have become male dominated, loss of feminine societies because we removed drugs from everyday societyThe wikipedia article on shrooms is far more interesting than this book, and better written. That's right, a wikipedia article is more coherent than this book. That should send you running.Have you ever heard an autistic person describe a topic they're interested in? That's a bit like how this book is written. Terence will present a pseudo idea, and then ramble off into barely related topics until you want to die. It is a chore to read. Instead of any kind of solid research, he glues together tangents into a a rickety web of boredom.Let's look at an example gem from Terence's writing:\\"The drive for unitary wholeness within the psyche, which is to a degree instinctual, can nevertheless become pathological if pursued in a context in which dissolution of boundaries and rediscovery of the ground of being has been made impossible.\\"Did you zone out while reading that sentence? Imagine 300 pages of that. He has a remarkable way of presenting ideas in a fog of poor writing. It's the same style of writing as a highschooler with a thin grasp of an essay topic and way too much access to a thesaurus. It's as if Terence knows his ideas don't hold much water, so he throws in as many slightly related things as possible to make it look like he has a solid theory. The worst is when he gets into his own head without relying on any external sources. When that happens, expect to be liberally skipping paragraphs.This book suffers terribly from not having an editor. 90% could be cut out easily and not lose any substance. And once you realize that hearing about someone's drug trip is almost as boring as hearing about their dreams, you start to think very hard about your life and why you're 200 pages deep in hell.Some of his theories, like mushrooms helping our brains evolve language, are completely unfounded, and he has no research to back it up. This would be fine if he didn't devote dozens of rambling pages to them.I don't think ideas about mushrooms and societal integration are bad. I started reading to become more familiar with drug culture and history and potential good uses of psychedelics. But 10 pages in I regretted it. If you think you enjoyed the book then you haven't read any good nonfiction. Compared to persuasive, organized, well researched, non fiction books, Food of the Gods is a pile of trash."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Mckenna definetly has some thoughts to share.

Nevertheless, I believe this book to be highly dangerous, and I will start with some warnings and complaints.1. First, whether or not you believe the current drug laws to be just, the fact is that the drugs mentioned in this book are illegal. If you use these drugs, you could lose your job or worse be tossed into a jail to rot! Is the price really worth it! There are other more traditional ways to attain altered states of consciousness, such as prolonged meditation or prayer, fasting, and various forms of deprivation. While they require more work and effort they are also a far nobler approach than to resort to drug use.2. The author is terribly nave in his belief that the hallucinogenic drugs advocated in this book will serve as a panacea to all mental, physical, and social ills. The fact is that these drugs can be dangerous, and that one cannot function while using them.3. This book is severely marred by very muddleheaded thinking. The author hypocritically ends up advocating restrictions be placed on all sorts of things, from sugar to alcohol to gun control, while at the same time advocating that restrictions be removed on hallucinogenic drugs. The author is totally blind in this respect. For example, we need guns to fend off the very corrupt governments that he spends so much time railing against!4. This book is severely marred by political correctness. The author advocates all sorts of feminist nonsense (something which I have precious little tolerance for), claiming that sexual differences are not innate and that during the \\"golden age\\" of hallucinogenic drug use mankind existed in \\"partnership cultures\\". In addition, the author is highly biased against Western civilization and Christianity (monotheism) in particular. This is unfortunate because it damages an otherwise interesting read.What this book is is a revisionist account of the history of humanity and his co-evolution with various members of the vegetable kingdom. The author calls for an \\"archaic revival\\", emphasizing various forms of primitive shamanism against modern scientism and materialism, but also religion. However, unlike such scholars of shamanism as Mircea Eliade, McKenna believes that the use of hallucinogenic drugs among shamans does not constitute a form of decadence and degeneration. The book is based on a bizarre evolutionary theory, which emphasizes co-evolution of man and hallucinogenic mushrooms, but also is distinct from other Darwinistic theories of evolution in that it appreciates a more holistic view of nature (not to be understood as nature \\"red in tooth and claw\\" or the \\"survival of the fittest\\"). Mentioning such theories as that of the maverick psychologist Julian Jaynes regarding the origins of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind, as man learned to use his two brain hemispheres in tandem he developed self awareness, McKenna proposes that the hallucinogenic mushroom Stropharia cubensis, containing the essential ingredient psilocybin, is responsible for man's evolutionary development into self-awareness and consciousness. McKenna contends that primitive man living in Paleolithic hunter-gatherer societies learned to eat these mushrooms on the African savannah and that these mushrooms played an essential role in his evolution. Although McKenna rejects Lamarckianism as unscientific, his theory contends that by eating these mushrooms man and mushroom co-evolved. The remainder of this book consists of a history of drug use and various recommendations for modern civilization.McKenna's book is divided into four sections: \\"Paradise\\", \\"Paradise Lost\\", \\"Hell\\", and \\"Paradise Regained\\". In the section \\"Paradise\\", McKenna argues that the hallucinogenic mushroom allowed for a golden age of man's development, constituting the original Tree of Knowledge, and that its loss and replacement by other drugs constituted a fall from grace. McKenna mentions the theories of maverick investment banker and intelligence operative turned ethnobotanist and mycologist, R. Gordon Wasson, regarding the substance \\"soma\\" mentioned in both the Rig Veda and the Zend Avesta among primitive Indo-European peoples. Wasson contends that the soma mentioned was a form of hallucinogenic mushroom. In addition, McKenna suggests that the hallucinogenic mushroom played some role in the mystery cults including especially the Minoan and Eleusinian mysteries. In the section \\"Paradise Lost\\", McKenna shows how other drugs came to take the place of the hallucinogenic mushroom. Here he mentions alcohol (especially its harmful effects and addictive properties but also mentioning the role of alcohol distillation as a process of alchemy) and cannibis (which contrary to all common sense he argues is a panacea for social ills). In the section \\"Hell\\", McKenna argues that such \\"drugs\\" as spices, sugar, coffee, and chocolate contributed to a culture of decadence in early modern Europe and created the slave trade. He also shows how these substances can be harmful. Next, McKenna turns his attention to other harmful drugs including tobacco (highly carcinogenic) and opium (mentioning the role of the opium trade and various accounts of opium use among Romantic writers and poets) as well as heroin and cocaine but also television as a drug. Finally, in the section \\"Paradise Regained\\", McKenna mentions the coming development of various psychedelic drugs including LSD-25 discovered by Albert Hofmann and DMT. McKenna argues that these drugs offer man an opportunity to reclaim his archaic shamanistic heritage. McKenna concludes with remarks on the supposed vile nature of the War on Drugs and argues for hallucinogenic drug use.While McKenna's theories are certainly interesting, they are severely muddled and dangerous as I have already stated. Nevertheless, this book does provide much food for thought regarding the nature of man's evolution and the subsequent role of governments in restricting access to certain mind altering substances."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"I have listened to several lectures and interviews by and with McKenna but this is the first book by him I have read. With McKenna there are always things I agree with, disagree with, think to myself well maybe and some things I write off as sheer kookery but I always found him and his ideas interesting.There is a lot I totally or partially disagree with in this. He really pushes his theory that early man injesting Psilocybin mushrooms caused the brain to evolve to a state where man was able to have language, imagination and creativity. I feel like this theory is vaguely possible but extremely sketchy. For one thing I believe the white race is effected differently than non whites by psycheldelics. Plus whites have much more powerful imaginations and the ability to create both in and out of their heads. Before the brainwashed hippy types that read McKennas books start pointing fingers and condemning me for saying this I've read stuff where even these South American Indian shamans that guide white people through Ayhuasca sessions have said they believe that it effects whites differently than other races. I'm also not into how McKenna for a guy that thinks outside the box still blindly accepts the out of Africa theory for the origins of humanity.McKenna is big on Psilocybin Mushrooms and Ayhuasca/DMT. I have experience with mushrooms but none with Ayhuasca/DMT but I think these can be a gateway but are not the \\"Tree of Knowledge\\" as he calls it. He also doesn't promote Cannabis (the true \\"tree of knowledge\\" if there is such a thing) enough. He also doesn't condemn hard drugs like Heroin, Cocaine and Methamphetamine enough. I also think he should give a strong caution about heavy psychedelics. People often aren't quite prepared for what they are in for. While I'm not against people using Mushrooms, Peyote or Ayhuasca I also don't think everybody is cut out for using them. These are not casual or party drugs.All those criticisms aside I did enjoy Food of the Gods. He really nails down the truth on what a brain numbing and dumbing down drug television is and has lots of interesting ideas. Like I said I don't always agree with McKenna but he's always interesting."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"This man is a genius! In Food of the Gods, McKenna postulates that monkeys on a diet of mushrooms, or dipping for insects in mushrooms, ate psychoactive chemicals that eventually played a major part in the evolution of human consciousness.He then goes on to examine mushroom spores and there ability to leave the planet and travel intergalacticly in deep space frozen hibernation before landing on another planet. He describes the mushroom as the perfect vehicle for intergalactic travel and the spreading of consciousness.SPACE MUSHROOMS!The rest of the book is all about mankind's evolution with psychoactive plants by his side. Although he did get some things wrong in this book it was still cutting edge for its time and remains one of the most important thoughts on the topic to date. The world will also miss the man after his recently passing into that higher realm of consciousness.Take this trip with Terence McKenna and expand your IQ."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"This is the first book from Terrence McKenna I have read, but I have listened to a number of his lectures. As it stands, if I had to sum of the book in one phrase it would be, \\"An illicit peepshow of truth regarding our human culture.\\" This book quite literally takes you all over the world, back and forth through time in 275 very novel pages. It employs the character of showing us how closely attached we, the human species, have been to drugs, or altered states of consciousness. There is also an attribute on how we as a species have developed society and religion as result to these experiences. This is a manifesto that beckons the need for further research into the areas of which McKenna vectors us. This book is also far much more than just a pontification about the history of drugs, it also delves deep into human culture and alternative views of how culture developed, especially from the feminine perspective. I have to say those who wish to study our human origins should read this; it is definitely an intriguing compilation, especially with his theories on the origins of consciousness. McKenna does not fail to display his erudition in this work, just as he does in his lectures, which is one of the reasons why he has been a preeminent hero of mine since I came into knowledge of him.Most people are immediately going to reserve themselves in the position of dissenting, more or less because this is not what has been spoon fed to them by the conventional education machine. If you want the truth, or unbiased information, seek knowledge with an open mind, independently and from a multitude of perspectives. Especially, in the frame of the history, but even more so with his theory of how consciousness developed through prolonged exposure to entheogens. His theory for the catalyst for consciousness is very novel and pushes the paradigm on conventional theories. Nonetheless, McKenna's theory is highly controversial and many are likely to disagree without considering its probability. In actuality, Tim Leary attempted to study the effects of drugs on the mind while he was a Harvard professor, so these ideas are not intellectually destitute. Even if you disagree with everything he writes about, the subject matter will at least give you an adverse perspective that is in existence, but is not the orthodox.In reference to the effects of drugs (natural drugs, not pharmaceuticals and alcohol) on the consciousness and the \\"journey\\" into your subconscious, I emphatically agree with McKenna and it is something that is simply experiential. It is an invigorating experience if you allow it to be, you must search within yourself to find answers. I personally like McKenna's rules for experiencing entheogens (as evident on pg. 248), \\"one sits down, one shuts up and one pays attention\\"-especially alone in the dark, no TV and no radio. It may not be for all, but it is quite effective for the psyche and intellect. Unfortunately, do to the politics of the scholarly realm and the laws from the \\"drug war\\" his theories will merely lie in ruin as an anecdotal hypothesis, but has much potentiality for a concrete conclusion.The only reason I did not give this book five stars is due several things I disagree with McKenna on. Throughout this book, and his lectures, he seems to advocate a very socialistic and communist lifestyle, which to me, politically is an issue of dissonance. With this subject I guess we differ on a polarity, but I still enjoy his very eloquent philosophy. At times he also references the \\"barriers\\" that we create to create individual territory, and that we would be wiser to dissolve those and live communal lives. I like capitalism, the harder you work the more capital you receive; in a socialist society those who work hard gain nothing, because everything is of neutral division, and in the end it stifles ingenuity and innovation; and, in the same system the laziest are parasites that reap the rewards. Along with those ideas, he also bends over backwards to force a square dowel into a circular hole, and because of this there are times that makes it hard to concur with him. There are also periods in his book that there exists not enough evidence for the clarity of his postulants.Here are some quotes I found resonance with:Pg. 147 \\"Wife beating without alcohol is like a circus without lions.\\" - So true, but we find that marijuana, an innocuous substance is outlawed.Pg. 148 \\"Yet how can we explain the legal toleration for alcohol, the most destructive of all intoxicants, and the almost frenzied efforts to repress nearly all other drugs?\\"Pg. 163 \\"The \\"recreational\\" context for substance use, as currently understood in the United States, is an atmosphere that trivializes the cognitive impact of the substance used.\\"Pg. 272 \\"If mere preaching of virtue could provide the answer, then we would have arrived at the threshold of angelic existence some time ago. If mere legislation of virtue were answer, we would have learned that a long time ago.\\"In conclusion, it is odious and criminal for me to desire and endeavor to experience mushrooms or marijuana in my own home, but it is ok for America to line up at the pharmacy for their $4 monthly prescriptions for various absurdities; and aside to that, the most corrosive substance, alcohol, in society is ubiquitously supported and served as a nuance of fermented passion, and because of this, the atrocities that it induces America retains a superficial relationship with. - D.R.Thomas"},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Read this book if you don't see how plants have effected society, if you think mushrooms are bad. Do not read this book if you want to try mushrooms or if you've read Mckenna's stuff elsewhere. If you have, you've read this stuff already. If you never had mushrooms, you will want to have them. You probably are better served by reading Whitman or Lorca. You are too eager. Read this book with Schultes &quot;Plants of the Gods&quot;. The two books will inform each other. This book is a wonderful overview of plant philosophy. Schulte's book has lovely pictures and he will back up Mckenna. Better still, read this book to understand why relegion is empty for so many people, how God truly is in the details, embedded so deep, we must wedge our way into molecules to find it, how we must shake off the painkillers and SEE! the world. God bless anyone who is so in touch with the force of God that he/she doesn't start the process this way but for myself there was no other way in and Terence has illuminated the path just fine. Sure he's a kook. God bless kooks. Mushrooms aren't the way. They aren't even the map. They are the bench we sit on to relax midway and figure out where we will go next."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"my first mckenna experience: a sheer delight for anyone who's been bored, confused, disheartened, or annoyed by leary's verbose ramblings! mckenna's clear, laconic prose reads much closer to huxley. 'food of the gods' is in 4 sections with subchapters organized succintly around coherent themes, which make skimming and leaping possible - even on the first read - to parts of personal interest.mckenna sets out to demonstrate, or at least make plausible, the theory that an archaic relationship with psychoactive plants - namely mushrooms - stimulated the evolutionary leap that in 1-2 million years tripled our brain size from that of our then contemporaraneous hominoids. this is more or less an elaboration for mushrooms of carl sagan's proposition for cannabis - that a precultural relationship between hominid and psychoactive plant affected our brain chemistry significantly. mckenna goes on to apply the consequences to culture of this historic theoretical marriage, concluding primarily that a reacknowledgement of a lost link is needed urgently today.mckenna gives some potent evidence, but it is for the most part scant and open-ended. mckenna is not a scientist. this is where academia at large could enter with data stacks and studies - even to disagree. a wealth of possibilities for disciplines as diverse/related as linguistics, visual/social/cultural anthropology, archaeology, art history, religious studies, biology, neurochemistry, and philosophy."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"If anything, McKenna denies such a concept as intangible as enlightment-that was Leary's ego-trip. He's drawing attention to the fact that we are an evolving species that has, up till now at least, made some very selfish and destructive decisions. He claims that psilocybin is a mutagen proven to be capable of aiding in our collective evolution toward balance with each other and with nature. Anyone who claims that psilocybin is not a mutagen that puts man in contact with the vegetable-mind-the \\"mama matrix most mysterious\\" -and catalyses the realization that we are a part of magnificant nature, not something seperate from or stuggling against it, is to put it nicely, completely misinformed. As is anyone who claims that abuse of sugar, coffee, tobacco, chocalate, automobiles & television are not addictions that push us further from nature & away from balance, understanding and integration. People who view their \\"sober,\\" selfish, game-playing, costume-wearing, coffee-drinking existences as productive and meaningful have a little waking up to do.McKenna is far from braindead. Read the book and you may be impressed, as I was, with his daring conjecture, botanical, historical & anthropological knowledge, prose and literary savoir-faire in discussing a topic which society has branded evil, immoral, degenerative or, at the very least, highly controversial. Remember when you claim that his radical viewpoint lacks scientific credulity that our lawmakers are responsible for fanatically denying all access to the subject-matter by legitimate researchers, forcing the study and the knowledge underground.People acting from a basis of profound paranoia are not helpful guides and their insights should be taken with a grain of salt. Unfortunatly, to watch the news or to listen to our politicians speak, this paranoia about things mysterious, supressed or unexplored seems to be omnipresent in our society, which is thoroughly based upon male-ego/dominator values-talk about building your house on the sand!This world is incredibly screwed up. To dream of progress and productivity in a time when we can see that all that these false idols have led us to is disorder and eminent doom is a dangerous delusion. The goal is to keep this planet intact for ourselves, for each other, for our children and for our children's children. Following Christ or whichever pathological egotist claims to be His representative has not been enough, so far, to awaken people to the fact that we are riding a runaway train in which the conductor has hidden from himself the emergency brake. We are living in a time when corporate bigshots and good-ole-boy politicians are seen as the good guys, while spiritual explorers, environmentalists and even Nature herself are perceived by docile masses of egotists, each living in the darkest of personal ignorance, to be pawns of the Devil.We must search for a viable catalyst of selfless thought. To my mind, religion seems only to reinforce selfishness and inequality. Mushrooms, while less than a panacea, are definately a transcendental doorway beyond the restrictions that one's ego asserts over one's consciousness. About this subject, McKenna was far more qualified to speak than am I. If his claim was that mushrooms equal instant enlightenment, then I would be the first to attack his premise. Read the book and take from it what you like & try not to get hysterical or defensive. Paranoia, automatic nay-say and denial will get us no-place. This is just a theory, a stimulating one at that, and it is not inteded to be viewed as dogma or doctrine."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"This book helped me satisfy much curiosity over these interesting drugs and their history. However I didn't end up sharing Mckenna's viewpoint in the long-run. Instead I was able to move on from this youthful obsession. Looking back, this book was probably the most fun to read non-fiction for me and I don't regret reading it at all. Definitely a fun reading experience, but in light of further investigation I personally didn't find it totally convincing. But that's ok!

His research into the properties of ethnogens is unrivaled. But his research into history is awful. For instance, he simply takes for granted such things as the Great Mother Goddess theory, without apparently considering that this was never accepted by serious scholars in the first place - with the exception of Gimbutas - and is now accepted only in the popular imagination. (Read Ronald Hutton's &quot;Triumph of the Moon&quot; for more info on how this theory took hold of popular consciousness.) And he routinely presents various conspiracy theories (the CIA destroyed the &quot;New Left&quot;, etc.) as complete fact without stopping to even consider that alternative viewpoints and interpretations may exist. That is not good scholarship.McKenna was an important countercultural figure and his work has great value, but don't take him as authoritative on purely historical issues. Read him for his unique point of view and for his first-hand experiences with the various substances he writes about."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"This book is an entertaining read and a source of valuable food for thought, but, at the same time, has to be taken with a huge grain of salt. I can recommend reading it, but reading it critically, which is, I assume, what Mckenna would have wanted you to do anyway. He is interested in a variety of topics all related to the use of drugs in human history.One of his basic theories is that the consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms accelerated the evolution of the human mind. First of all, doesn't that sound a bit like Lamarkism? Well, on the surface it does, but there are serious academic biologists who have recently suggested that biological and cultural evolution (such as taking up the use of psychedelic mushrooms) can interact in interesting ways. The \\"Baldwin Effect\\" is what is potentially at play here, the phenomenon that phenotypical modifications (psilocybin induced brain states), while not directly affecting genes, can lead the evolutionary pathway in a certain direction. Acquired phenotypic modifications of the brain come first, and the genotype can catch up later. An excellent outline of these extensions of classic evolutionary theory can be found in Jablonka and Lamb's \\"Evolution in Four Dimensions\\". Is this to say that I am convinced that things happened how Mckenna describes them? No, but it is an interesting suggestion, and not at all scientifically ridiculous.Mckenna then goes on to describe how, in his opinion, the shamanic, hallucinogen-literate societies of the late paleolithic were transformed into the current consumerist, hallucinogen-illiterate, drug consuming, but at the same time drug prosecuting and demonizing societies. And, he argues that the change went hand in hand with a change from friendly partnership societies to ego and power driven dominator societies. Unfortunately, in this part of the book, Mckenna is often too sloppy, even for a book which is obviously meant to be leaning out of the window with speculation. While there is ancient art clearly depicting mushrooms, he sees them almost everywhere, like in an ancient god's round hat and in an upward expanding palace column.The later chapters are again a strength of \\"Food of the Gods\\", where Mckenna gives an outline of the drug policies of the last several hundred years. Of course the historical sources are much more abundant about this period as opposed to pre-history, and Mckenna knows them well. He rightfully angrily describes the incredible hypocrisy which has harmed the lives of so many people. And, again, he asks: what does it say about a society if mind-numbing drugs like alcohol and television are encouraged, but mind-expanding drugs like psilocybin and LSD are criminalized? Why is coffee, which makes you nervous and work harder, found in every office, but cannabis, which makes you contemplative and relaxed, officially banned? Wouldn't a mushroom-using society make very different decisions as opposed to our current tabako-smoking, alcohol drinking society? And, don't our society's alcohol and nicotine inspired decisions often involve wife-beating and drunk driving on a small scale, and war, social injustice and environmental destruction on a large scale? These are viable questions, and Mckenna deserves credit for asking them in an eloquent and readable manner."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"I am all about free thinking and going against established norms etc. and praising shamanism and womens' rights etc., and don't get me wrong McKenna has had some great quotes, but I just didn't enjoy reading this book at all. I think that he makes a good point that primates ate mushrooms and developed consciousness and language etc which is what we became, but I think instead of really making a convincing argument he just kind of rambles and jumps around from subject to subject, making the reader feel like he assumes they already agree with him and don't need to be convinced. Basically I just think his reasoning presentation was severly lacking and that he sounds like a teenager on acid."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"Terence McKenna is passionate about his views on the world and how society has come to be what it is.

Edit: Let me explain that sentence. I'm not saying drugs hindered him, not by any means. I'm saying if drug use in cultures is what you study then it's what you'll go looking for as a cause for evolution of the current human brain. If you go to an optometrist and ask what's wrong with you he'll say it's your eyes, the urologist will say it's your kidneys, and so on cus that's their thing. Again, I'm saying 'because I know of his history AND of a great deal of that being drug related study he may be less objective or more biased about human evolution with regard to drugs. He may be right about drugs changing us but drugs may have had nothing to do with it in some instances.That said this is an amazing book. One of my favorites. The book poses interesting theories to age old questions.\\"What was the fruit in the garden of Eden?\\"\\"Why did our brains grow larger in ratio to our body weight than any animals in a relatively short amount of time?\\"\\"Why is caffeine an acceptable drug to use daily? Should it be?\\"I think people who read this should know it's an opinion given with historical facts to make his opinion seem like scientific and historical fact.For instance he references what drugs were in use in certain cultures at what times then equates their overall temperament in historical events to the widespread use of those drugs. His claims may or may not have merit, we'll never know but it is an opinion none the less.That said it is a very interesting read that is hard to put down. Attention keeping, he has one of a kind theories on lesser known early civilizations that could use a second look.I was sorry to hear his library and personal notes burned up in a fire in early 2007, adding just more mystery to this one of a kind author."},{"Title":"Food of the Gods: the Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution","review":"I enjoyed this book and every single last bit of information with it!

In this brilliant work, he concentrates on Hatha Yoga and its benefits of good health and longevity.This is a book on Hatha Yoga in the classical sense, emphasizing breathing and meditation. Here is a Master who has studied, practiced and analyzed the subject so thoroughly that he can fill page after page with information from scriptures as well as his own experience. For those who are looking for authentic knowledge of asanas (yoga postures), pranayama (breathing exercises) and meditation (dhyana), all that they may need is here, taught by an adept.The book is divided into five parts. Part 1 is general, giving the reader comprehensive knowledge of Yoga the Science, Forms of Yoga, Effects of Yoga on the Body, Ayurveda (the ancient science of Indian Medicine), and Yoga and Longevity. Part Two is \`to-the- point' description of yoga postures, their purpose, technique and benefits. There is photo of each pose done scientifically correct by Yogi Gupta himself. Twenty eight major asanas are portrayed. Part 3 is Breathing and Meditation, not to be missed by any serious student of Yoga. Part 4 is about the need for Yoga, with a valuable section on Relaxation. Part 5 is a Schedule of Courses for Men and Women, with six Tables of postures for different levels.The Master is a God-sent.A time-less work."},{"Title":"Yoga and Long Life","review":"I have read an innumerable amount of books on Yoga by many Masters and have been studying and practicing the science since 1983.

There are 6 pages on Bromeliad history, ecology, and horticulture. 7 pages about the general Bromeliad family. 7 pages about common growing conditions. 41 pages about growing specific genera such as: Aechmea, Ananas, Billbergia, Cryptanthus, Dyckia, Hechtia, Guzmania, Neoregelia, Nidularium, Tillandsia, Vriesea, and brief comments about lesser known genera. 7 pages on propagation. 14 pages on biology, variation (variegation), pest and diseases. 4 pages of Appendix. 3 pages of Glossary. 3 pages of Index by species. It also includes 16 full color pages of photographs. Several other B&amp;W photographs are scattered about the book.The book is about growing Bromeliads, or at least growing Bromeliads in Australia. It occasionally has some local reference to an Australian city or region, but mostly the information is generic. It does suffer from regular references to the metric system and Celsius temperatures. For this reader, being a Yank and living on the frozen tundra up here in Wisconsin, metric &amp; celsius measures don't make much sense.Facts in the book are modestly interesting and modestly informative. It tends to chase around the facts. For example, &quot;overwatering will rot the plants&quot;. Dah - yah think? So, what exactly is the proper amount of water? The book is not always crisp about specifics.It's a good book, but not a great book. There is much information, but the book's structure makes it hard to find. Plant photographs are not adjacent to their descriptions - you have to page around to find the photo. The text is small and therefore reading gets to be a chore.I like sections of the book, but other sections could be much improved. The book is inexpensive, and by that measure you get good value. For the money, it's a good introduction to growing Bromeliads."},{"Title":"Trading Chicago Style","review":"Like my fellow Californian I have read &quot;Trading Chicago Style&quot; by Neal Weintraub.

You will succeed in the Chicago markets if you keep your cool and stick to your system, no matter what's happening.

From 1964 - 1973 was the Mustang's debut as a muscle car. This book will show all of the information about the Mustang from 1964 - 1973.In the sixties horsepower was high and gas prices were low. The Mustang was one of the first cars that started the horsepower wars. As muscle cars started coming out with increased compression ratios and heavier iron the Mustang didn't get left behind. This author captures how the Mustang was designed and how it varied from its competitors. It discusses how the Mustang was a true muscle car with both pros and cons. It also shows how the designers of the vehicle thought out and plotted making and designing the Mustang. This book focuses on Mustangs from 1964 to 1973.The author did a great job capturing the Mustang from 1964 to 1973. He left nothing out when discussing how the Mustang was designed and built. He captures every aspect of the Mustang including the building and design of the engine, suspension, drive train, and body. Everything that was done to the Mustang between 1964 to 1973 is in this book.The author achieved his goal of writing about a book that described every aspect of the Mustang from 1964 to 1973. The writing is very effective and has much strength. The information provided in the book explains every aspect of the engineers design when building the car. The only weakness that the book had was that it didn't mention the Shelby Super Snake which was a car that Carroll Shelby built in the 60s. I would definitely recommend this book to others and encourage anyone that loves Mustangs, especially older Mustangs to read it.The book taught me some things that I didn't know, and I read a lot about these cars. I give the book a thumbs up and I am very pleased with the book."},{"Title":"Mustang 1964 1/2 - 1973 (Muscle Car Color History)","review":"Not very good. Poor facts and mostly talks about Shelby's and the high end Mustangs. Lots of hype and that's about it. Only good things are the photos which are pretty much stock stuff seen else where. Book is just a belly drop."},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Historical Writing","review":"Although at times too abstract the book is a good discussion of historical writing.

Wireless Data technologies is a growing field and this book outlines the architecture and protocol to send data over the CDPD infrastructure. No matter how technical you are this book provides background information, specifications and protocol structure. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking at wireless data and CDPD technologies."},{"Title":"Water Breaking","review":"I usually think poetry is kind of girly and lame, but when I was forced to read this book for a class I was just blown away. The poems are great, filled with energy and great images. They don't turn you off at a first reading with lots of confusing and distracting look-how-clever-I-am antics, but they also hold up to repeated readings, revealing more depth and power each time you return to them. Most poetry tries too hard to be &quot;pretty&quot;--these poems are beautiful. I couldn't believe this was Krajeska's first book!"},{"Title":"Water Breaking","review":"... just for the challenge. This is a compelation of poems written by an obviously disturbed youth filled with imaginative, dark but with a sense of humor, and crisp words producing the kind of poetic imagery one would appreciate when feeling lonely or quirky or both.I enjoyed reading the poems - they leave you with a satisfied feeling of incompletion and melancholy. Great for rainy days, Sundays, and noodle-based breakfasts.

The standards covered in the book and CD are simplified versions - slowed down - of Hotel California, Europa (Santana), Tush, Riders on the Storm and Proud Mary. Once you pick through the tab a few times, you can start playing along with the CD fairly quickly. I'd still recommend that you invest in a utility that let's you slow down the tracks even more to be able to hear the different notes, like Transcribe!"},{"Title":"Ultimate Beginner Guitar Jam with Songbook: Classic Rock (Book & CD)","review":"I was very disappointed with this product. The CD contains some musicians playing and singing each of the songs included. Pay a little more and get the Hal Leonard Publications' Guitar Play-Along series or Wise Publications' \\"play guitar with ...\\" series or Total Accuracy's \\"Jam with ...\\" series. Those series include CDs which have 2 recordings of each track. The first recording has no vocal and the second has no vocal and no guitar. In my humble opinion, having to supply the guitar yourself will improve your playing more rapidly. This product however gives you a recording that includes not only the bass, drums and keyboards but also includes the guitar and vocals. So you can't really see how YOU sound without their support. The one place you get a chance to play without having the studio guitarist playing is on Europa. They give you some space to solo near the end but you had better have a good ear or a transcription of Santana's work from some other source because the accompanying book doesn't give you any clue at all about what to play."},{"Title":"The Wordworth Dictionary of Anagrams","review":"If you love word play like me, you'll really enjoy this book.

In fact, he is one of the most knowledgeable herpetologists alive, particularly on the subject of snakes of Africa and Austral-Asia.Using a combination of data that he personally obtained by conducting uncountable years in the bush of Papua New Guinea (PNG), plus study of museum specimens, observation of captives, and a truly exhausive review of literature, O'Shea has produced an extensive, highly authoritative, and extremely reader-friendly volume. It has been said by some that \\"Only Nixon could go to China,\\" and in a similar vein it is very nearly true that \\"only O'Shea could write the book on snakes of PNG.\\" The book is published on quality glossy paper, includes plenty of line illustrations, and colour photographs (most taken by Mark himself) of pretty much every snake then known from PNG. The photos are generally high quality and allow for easy identification of live or freshly-killed snakes. I would have liked to see a few more illustrations of colour/age variants, and maybe some side-by-side illustrations of similar species that might prove more difficult to discern.The great value of this book lies in its usefulness to the residents of PNG, people who face a high and serious risk of lethal snakebite. Appropriately, there is an extensive section on treating (and how NOT to treat) bites at both the local and hospital levels. The in-country price of the book, I am informed, is considerably less than its overseas cost, making it relatively affordable to PNG locals.There are obligatory and surprisingly fresh reviews of what snakes are, their lifestyles, and the overall history of snake study in PNG, and, of course, one of Mark's exhaustive bibliographies. Each species account includes standard field guide text, including names, length, habitats, identifying features, distribution, and miscellaneous notes. The dimensions are larger than those of most field guides, making it just a wee bit unwieldy to take into the bush, but I would include it in any bushwalking--even in the main cities--of PNG. The snakes inhabit a great many places, but the book is hard to find there. If you plan fieldwork in PNG, whether herpetological, ornithological, anthropological or otherwise, this book is an essential to your kit; don't leave home without it!"},{"Title":"A State of Mind: My Story / Ramtha: The Adventure Begins","review":"This book was so well written that I couldn't put it down.

Hard to put down as it was such an interesting life story. Glad I bought it!"},{"Title":"A State of Mind: My Story / Ramtha: The Adventure Begins","review":"I read the first edition of this book around 1987-88 and reviewed it for a journal back then. Since 1984 I have followed this author's career as a \\"channel\\" of the entity Ramtha that allegedly possesses her at her convenience (\\"they\\" first convened in her kitchen in 1977, so the story goes in State of Mind). In brief, the first edition garners sympathy from naive readers who might feel sorry for JZ as a child growing up in abusive, alcoholic circumstances. The manifestation of Ramtha in her life was coincident with the author and her then husband playing with \\"pyramid power\\", seemingly unleashing an apparition that talked to JZ. According to another author (Jess Stearn, 1985: Soul Mates) who interviewed her then husband, the husband saw nothing but only JZ responding to something--this contradicts claims made by the author. In other words, Ramtha qualifies as a hallucination of some kind. Anyway, the rest is history, JZ met and courted (via her Ramtha persona who indicated that he was her soul mate) the much younger Jeff Knight to marry her around 1980. (I knew Jeff and was a witness for him in 1992 in his eventual legal challenge of a divorce settlement from JZ).This author is by no means unique as a channel as some reviewers appear to suggest. And Jane Roberts was by no means the \\"first\\" of this kind. Spirit possession is pre-historic in human affairs and has been quite common. Recall the oracles of ancient Greece, the one at Delphi being the most famous. During the Great Awakening in 19th Century America, \\"christians\\" were possessed by the \\"holy spirit\\" as a personal entity. As far the Theosophical-Spritualist influenced entities like Seth/Rupert/Jane, there were significant precedents to Jane Roberts in the 20th century including Helena Roerich of Agni Yoga who channeled \\"Morya,\\" Alice A Bailey who channeled \\"The Tibetan,\\" and Guy and Edna Ballard who channeled a host of Ascended Masters through their \\"I AM\\" Activity sect including Saint Germain, especially in the 1930s. The Ballards actually were first to present entities in a form of channeling stagecraft before JZ Knight, who by the way first called her Ramtha cult \\"The Church I AM\\" in the early days of her movement.So, I suggest the reader beware. Too many people have been seduced by words they read and experiences they have after encountering Ramtha."},{"Title":"A State of Mind: My Story / Ramtha: The Adventure Begins","review":"I read the orginal book with a different cover but I believe the story is the same (Perhaps the new one has some revisions)in any case, I recomemend this book for all seekers.

The plot is compatible, yet surprisingly riveting. Each character is keenly developed, which is rare in many sci-fi novels. And each figure plays integral roles in the development of the story, and the overall saga of Robotech. Mckinney retains his readers attention by providing information of a very vague period in the Robotech timeline, known as the &quot;Malcontent Uprisings&quot;. However, even if a reader is solely interested in the events that occur between Macross and the Sentinels, they will also be pleased with the subtle devices Mckinney uses to breathe life into his characters. Each figure from Macross is represnted well, showing the reader what a thorough writer Mckinney truly is. This book is a very fast read, and is recommended to all, fans and skeptics alike.

She had done doctoral students in nursing a great service, collecting around 50 of the classic papers from the early 1970's on in one volume, so we didn't have to dash madly around the library making copies from fragile volumes of 'Nursing Research' and 'ANS'.When I returned to academia this year and bought the newest iteration (the first without Dr. Nicoll's shepherding hand), I was bitterly disappointed. Fully 3/4 of the book is now papers produced since 1990, and almost all the classics are gone.I understand the need to include up-to-date references, but not at the price of banishing the foundational references for our discipline!

In this book, the central theme comes from James's \\"The Turn of the Screw,\\" in which a governess ends up responsible for the death of a cihld in her care. Pepper has concerns about a student named Adam, who seems to merit \\"professional evaluation,\\" that is, she thinks he's got a serious mental illness. She tries unsuccessfully to make this happen but no-one wants to believe that there's a problem.At a class field trip to the Philadelphia library (apparently a massive collection in a very large building), their tour guide (who turns out to be a friend of Pepper's sister) winds up dead and Adam is missing -- so suddenly everyone is willing to believe that Adam is as sick as Pepper had feared. Pepper doesn't think he's responsible but she needs to find him and get him in off the streets. Along the way, she gets involved in the murder investigation, to the annoyance of her homicide detective boyfriend CK. In the meantime, Pepper is having serious problems at work, thanks in part to Adam's parents and to the \\"all I care about is the school's image and financial well-being\\" headmaster, who doesn't want to hear anything remotely negative about the school.I am getting very good at spotting the killer early on in Pepper's series, so I would have to say that this is, for me, one of the weaker parts of the series. But I love the characters and the humor in these books (there are some great one-liners for those who appreciate a dry wit). As I said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Adam And Evil","review":"This series is really a lot of fun, and the setting of a not-so-prosperous Philadelphia prep school, plus the relationship between Mandy and CK is well done. This book didn't knock my socks off, and while it attempted to reach into the dynamics of a relationship gone a bit awry, it was just a little TOO unbelievable. Mandy's mid-career angst - do i really want to be an underappreciated, underpaid teacher - seemed real enough, but that she would actually give up without a fight(initially) over the potential of being sued by irate parents where there is absolutely no valid reason - doesn't make sense. Her overall depression and malaise - where did that come from? All seems well in the end - but maybe a little pre-marriage counseling to seal the deal would make sense, or some Prozac for Mandy... trying to get a real handle on who she is, and Roberts' balance between humor and pathos - seems a little off. Mandy resenting CK because he is doing research about schizphrenia in regard to Mandy's student - what's up with that? You don't have to be a mental health professional to figure out this kid needs serious medication - why is she so protective? Some of the story seems more than contrived to fit the mood - I have liked some of the other books in this series better -"},{"Title":"Adam And Evil","review":"This was the first Amanda Pepper book that I read and I have to admit I am not anxious to read another.

In recent days, Adam seems filled with fear and rage, ready to strike out at anyone. Assistant librarian Heidi Fisher provides Amanda's class with a tour of the public library. Not long after, she is found dead, strangled to death. Adam, who was on the tour, is missing.The police believe Adam is on the run after committing the murder. Even Amanda's significant other, police officer MacKenzie thinks the lad is guilty. Only Amanda believes her student is innocent. She thinks he saw the killing and is on the lam from the murderer. All Amanda needs to do is find the teenager before he becomes victim number two.With the recent violence in Colorado, ADAM AND EVIL has a sad timeliness that takes away from its dark humor and wit. However, what cannot be ignored is that the amateur sleuthing remains first rate and the problems in modern school systems are handled with dexterity. Amanda is one of the better characters in fiction today and author Gillian Roberts keeps the Philly scene fresh even though it is her ninth Pepper tale. There will be o questions questions of why Ms. Roberts is an Anthony Award winner after the reading of this superb detective story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Adam And Evil","review":"Adam! Adam! Where art thou? Amanda Pepper is a high school English teacher who is especially worried about the recently bizarre behavior of one of her students, Adam Evans. Is he involved in a murder? This was my first \\"Amanda Pepper mystery\\" but it definitely won't be my last! The book is snappy, literate, and articulate without being arcane or pedantic."},{"Title":"Adam And Evil","review":"For the first 50 or so pages of this book, I kept thinking to myself, &quot;I've read this book before!&quot; Well, yes and no. I hadn't actually read this title before, but the previous book in this series, THE BLUEST BLOOD. I think one could be excused for this confusion when the heroine is a high-school teacher, involved with books and writing, and her live-in is a cop. And when the plot involves troubled teens, books, protesters and murder, well--confusion would seem to be a logical outcome.Once I realized I hadn't read this book before, I slogged on, but with no appreciable degree of interest, and finally gave it up. I realize the author is highly regarded--and indeed I really liked the first book, TIME AND TROUBLE, in her new series.This one, though, left me cold. Amanda Pepper definitely needs more spice in her life."},{"Title":"Performance Without Compromise: How Emerson Consistently Achieves Winning Results","review":"Aloha,I worked at Emerson and knew most of the people that Chuck mention in the book and just their names show that this man was a great leader in he knew the most important part of leadership, selecting talent, leading them on the right path and getting out of the way.I would recommend this book to anyone thinking of going into business or in business. I think coaches of sports teams would benefit from reading this book.I was in several companies in my career but none that I respected more than Emerson. Chuck and his leaders are firm but fair. I came away from Emerson a better manager.I was specially moved by the words Chuck had for Bill Rutledge as this showed the Chuck we all knew even when he was chewing us out for what we most of the time deserved. He cared."},{"Title":"Performance Without Compromise: How Emerson Consistently Achieves Winning Results","review":"This book clearly lays out the Emerson business planning model, which is the process used to run the business. I work at Emerson, so i aready know a lot about this planning cycle. I think the average reader will not find this book that interesting, but it will useful to know the great information inside it. I wish that Mr. Knight would have shared some more stories about inside the board room and some of the more exciting history of his career. It would also have been interesting to get more about what he personally went through at Emerson and before. Finally, he should have included more about management and the HR side of developing the people."},{"Title":"Performance Without Compromise: How Emerson Consistently Achieves Winning Results","review":"This book is a clear exposition of why Charles Knight is one of the great CEO's of the last fifty years. Emerson is a focussed, consistently profitable company. Any manager, or person who wants to be a manager, deserves to read this book and learn how it's done."},{"Title":"Performance Without Compromise: How Emerson Consistently Achieves Winning Results","review":"Charles Knight clearly has an enviable track record - he and his predecessor achieved 43 consecutive annual increases in Earnings Per Share and Dividends Per Share at Emerson Electric (St. Louis, MO.) During Knight's tenure the firm grew from 12 divisions with less than $1 billion in annual revenues to over 60 divisions exceeding $15 billion. Getting there involved over 200 acquisitions, and an executive turnover rate of less than 4%.The bad news is that reading this book will not make you into another Charles Knight. Some pointers are there, but far more is needed - Larry Bossidy's \\"Execution,\\" and \\"Confronting Reality\\" provide much greater detail and operational advice.The good news is that if you follow the points provided (eg. identifying growth areas to meet targets, rather than simply accepting the growth in existing markets; setting a goal of becoming the best cost producer - worldwide - also leads to best quality, if done correctly; summarizing plans in writing, and providing regular follow-up) - your firm WILL improve (unless is already is doing quite well)."},{"Title":"Performance Without Compromise: How Emerson Consistently Achieves Winning Results","review":"Overall a very good book on the process of planning and business management used at Emerson.What prevents me from giving the book four stars (it's not close to deserving 5), is Knight's internal focus. About two third of the book are excellent, but in the balance, he spends too much time detailing Emerson and its industries rather than rising a level and talking about the impact on business in general. [Chuck: leave the internal focus for a privately published book for staff.]What Knight propounds is a disciplined process, but in my view few companies and managers will have the fortitude to keep this up. Those who do will improve and succeed, but the process is not for non-courageous or lazy, superficial managers looking for a quick fix. He doesn't, however, explain how to avoid this process from slowing down business and becoming a bureaucratic quicksand (such as Cisco has recently experienced).If you are prepared to follow-through using this process, you'll get a lot out of this book."},{"Title":"Performance Without Compromise: How Emerson Consistently Achieves Winning Results","review":"Provides insight into the mindset and energy (no pun intended) into the Emerson organization.

This is not a how-to book; there are plenty of those. When you look beyond the mechanics of the process, the levels of planning meetings and relentless follow-up, you will see how they foster a business climate of trust, accountability and effective communication at every level of the organization.

Knight, the second of only three CEOs since 1954 in the company's history, explains in detail how Emerson built its success by meticulously planning and executing its management system.

First it is a good story that forces you to reevaluate everyday life and things you take for granted. Then it show you how the powers of this world manipulate us to make our own minds our worst enemies but the book does not leave us there. &quot;Secret&quot; takes us on a journey of liberation and on a no-holds barred battle for freedom and justice. The reader clearly sees that there are some things we must do for ourselves. On the surface, one might think Secret was a Black book but it is as universal as Herman Hesse's Sidhartha or Homer's epic tale, the &quot;Odyssey.&quot; You read it knowing that it is cutting through our deception with the authority of a Holy Book, yet it is not preachy. We are co-adventurers with the main character Zafir. We see the truth for ourselves, discover with him, moment by moment. I recommend The Secret of Freedom to anyone who is trying to make sense of this world and would like an uncompllicated but clear account. Written before the movie, &quot;The Matrix,&quot; it reflects a similar Philosophy, while showing us that the power to break free is ours already. You will read The Secret of Freedom again and again."},{"Title":"The Secret of Freedom","review":"A lovely mountain-mist prose, exciting insight, race, discovery, self, freedom: these are his tools. The result is The Secret of Freedom.I am a journalist who met Kitabu while he was in Jamaica and had an opportunity to review his book for a national paper....Extending beyond our 'limitations' Secret beautifully and almost poetically defines the idea that self is a great thing, individual and untouchable -- a core that makes the externals (like skin colour) irrelevant.Written with such self-assured insight that you begin to feel: &quot;Right, RIGHT, that's IT!&quot;, Secret offers a gently prodding look at the old problems. It is exciting to walk with Zafir through his discoveries that freedom lies within himself, and that the imprisoned can be free, even while those who imprison can be chained. The 'secret' isn't a secret at all, but something that is known if you make any attempt to find it within yourself: freedom is the acknowledgment of self, that untouchable core. And Kitabu communicates all this in a simple style that offers a greater vitality to the strength of these truths.The book is a communion with the reader. You feel the freedom here, than read about it, you become Zafir. I cannot think of a better tribute to an author.It quite obviously doesn't hurt that the author is a Zen practitioner and martial arts expert brought up in a Christian home, who has studied and published poetry.His work is a blend of all these, and adds a behind the scenes richness to Secret..."},{"Title":"The Secret of Freedom","review":"If I could write 1,000 words here about Kitabu's book Secret I would. However, I can't even put what I feel about his book into one sentence. This book is so many things in one, that you just sit back after reading it a say one word, &quot;Wow.&quot; I very much wish I could convey my thoughts into words for this book, but I don't think they have words for what I feel. I was so moved. Thanks for another very well written book Kitabu."},{"Title":"The Secret of Freedom","review":"Vernon Kitabu Turner writes from life about life.

It is your book and your life.Highly recommended for both beginners and long-time warriors on the spiritual path.Vicki Woodyard"},{"Title":"The Secret of Freedom","review":"Seeing the warm recommendations here I ordered the book and read it. Not that I didn't like it, it's a simply knit and idealistic tale of liberation from (any) oppression, but the allegory is farfetched a lot... I've found a few sayings and descriptions resembling Zen somewhat, but it reminded me more of the Positive Thought movement - \\"If you can imagine it, you can do it!\\" - and of blunt proselytizing. The intention is good, no question, but - no, I wouldn't recommend it to Zen newcomers, and not to the experienced either."},{"Title":"Soccer Skills & Tactics -","review":"I owned this book as a kid when if first came out (1976). I lost it over the decades, and have finally found it thanks to Amazon.The best thing about this book is NOT the instruction, but the history. Each area of instruction (like Corner Kicks, Dribbling, Passing, Defending, etc) is introduced with some history of the players who were exceptional in that area, and real game situations that illustrate why and how it was important. After that, they give some suggestions about how to improve in that area.This was the only book I had on soccer that was any good to me as a kid, and learning some of the history really deepened my obsession with the World's game."},{"Title":"Where She Has Gone","review":"I was not prepared for this book. I was totally side-swiped for days after its conclusion. Mr. Ricci is a fabulous writer, and I was quite unprepared for the emotions I am feeling still.Mr. Ricci has definitely replaced Graham Greene as my favorite author of fiction, and I am now reading the first two books in this trilogy. Hopefully there will be many more!Interestingly, I live in Toronto, not far from Victor's apartment.

As the story of Victor and Rita unfolds, the deep melancholy grows.Victor and Rita are half-siblings; Rita the product of their mother's affair in her small Italian town while her husband (Victor's father) was in Canada setting the foundation for a new life for his family Over the course of the first two books in the trilogy, their mother dies after giving birth to Rita on the ocean liner bringing them to Canada, and Victor and Rita are raised together for a few years on his father's farm, until Rita is adopted by a nearby couple.The siblings grow up and grow apart, until the opening of WHERE SHE HAS GONE, where they meet again in Toronto-Victor as a grad student/writer and Rita just starting university. The relationship they develop as adults is complicated and sad, but compelling. Ricci's language is distilled to a very simple, effective style, that suits the mood he creates beautifully.All three books in the trilogy are highly recommended, but it's not necessary to have read the first two to be moved by the last (though I'm sure after reading WHERE SHE HAS GONE you'll want to)."},{"Title":"Where She Has Gone","review":"This is a good fictional story, well written but I like his earlier work 'Lives of the Saints' much better, from story development and plot prspectives."},{"Title":"Where She Has Gone","review":"This is the first Ricci book I've read and I liked it so much that I decided to read 'Lives of the Saints' and 'In A Glass House' as well. It's the final book of Ricci's trilogy, I liked it heaps except the final part of it. I was deeply moved by the novel and I highly recommend it. Nino Ricci has made himself one of my favourite authors. I'm curious if he is going to write something else soon."},{"Title":"Where She Has Gone","review":"Overall, it is possible to categorize Ricci's novel as an account of a young Italian-Canadian undergoing a severe identity crisis. The main protagonist of Ricci's novel, Victor, has returned to Toronto from a tour of duty as a teacher in a country in Africa, and is quite unsure of how to structure his future..Ricci deftly introduces Victor and two other main characters in the novel: his half sister, Rita, and a young woman, Elena, with whom Rita has shared a major portion of her life.Rita was born to Victor's mother, who had become pregnant while her husband, Victor's father, had been in Canada working to accumulate the funds that would allow him to bring his wife to Canada. Their mother had delivered Rita while on the ship, in passage to Canada. Following the delivery, their mother died as a result of complications of the birth.An early paragraph gathers together many of the strands that provide the thrust of the narrative:\\"There was also the codicil to his [their father, who had committed suicide] will that I hadn't told her about, his wish that I use my inheritance to help provide for her if she should need me to. He had neither fathered Rita nor been a father to her, had never really forgiven her for the betrayal she was the product of; but he'd carried the guilt of her to the grave. I ought to have brought the matter up now and made an end of it\\" (p. 4).Though their father could not completely abrogate responsibility for the daughter of his wife, his treatment of the girl led to the intercession of a social service agency that placed Rita into the home of a family that also had adopted Elena. Their father's guilt apparently led to his having laid a heavy charge on Victor. His father had,. essentially, asked Victor to act as a channel through which some fatherly obligations to Rita might be honored. Victor's breech of the charge, then, added a deep dimension to Victor's efforts to develop a mature self identity.Eventually, Victor's efforts to develop a mature and satisfying identity led him to return to Italy, after an interval of twenty years since he had departed, with his then-pregnant mother, from the small town in Molise. He seems to have been driven by a vague desire to reveal the identity of the person with whom his mother had violated the traditional role of Southern Italian wife by having engaged in the ill-fated tryst.The venture proved unsatisfactory. Among other revelations, Victor determined that he could not build an identity on the base of his family's history of connections to the people of the small town where he had spent his first years with his mother. Indeed, reactions to his mother's long ago failure to meet traditional expectations still played a part in his relationships with remnants of his family.At the end of the novel, Victor's efforts to put an end to the turmoil of his search for an identity allow him to reach a half reasonable resolution, despite his having failed to develop a clear version of a satisfying life narrative.The core of the novel, of course, centers on a set of constructions that were crucial to the lives of many of the participants in l'avventura. The husband of a family travels to the place, in Canada, to which the family is to emigrate, leaving behind a wife and, in many cases, children. If the marriage bond does not forestall extra-marital intimacy, how is the breech to be construed and repaired by the principals? The seriousness with which the principals must approach the Southern Italian views of the meaning of marriage permeates all of Ricci's novel. Victor, struggling with his own breech of trust, relative to his half sister, travels to Italy, haphazardly pursuing the possibility that if he understands his mother's breech, he will somehow find surcease from his own guilt.However one might react to Ricci's entire work, he/she must appreciate the skill with which Ricci interjects descriptions of the ways that his Italian-Canadians (and the people in Molise) use their personal constructions to react to objects and events in their daily round of activities.As one reads this text he/she regularly comes across neat analyses of the perceptions of his cast of characters, such as that given in the following passage:\\"On our final approach [to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci Airport], the plan swung around to follow the shoreline. The beach there was doted with bits of colour, red, and yellow and blue, from hundreds of beach umbrellas lined up in orderly rows in the still of early morning like mock soldiers awaiting some humorous war with the sea. The umbrellas made it seem like we were arriving in a permanent holiday country, a place that had never known hardship or work, as if those of us who had fled there years before had been fooled somehow, had been packed off on our grim ocean voyages while behind us the bands played and the streamers waved in the wind.\\" (pp. 165-166).To fulfill a reader's expectations to be entertained, Ricci uses variations of the mystery writer's \\"hook.\\" Will Victor discover the identity of the biological father of his half-sister, Rita? Will that discovery help him to understand his mother's breech of Southern Italian conventions regarding marriage bonds? Will Victor discover a positive value in his relationship to the attractive young woman who occupies one of the houses that neighbors on to the property that his grandfather had willed to him?If a reader intends to use a literary work as a vehicle toward achieving the goal of exploring the perspectives concerning Italian emigrants and their offspring he/she would be well rewarded by reading Ricci's Where she has gone ."},{"Title":"Ethology, the biology of behavior","review":"Perhaps the best text book yet written on the study of animal behavior. It is written by an individual who studied directly under Lorenz and devoted his entire life to ethology. Clear concise and methodical.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Lion in the Cellar","review":"I haven't finished it. I expected a light, humorous mystery, but it was TOO light and fey for me. I wasn't interested in any of the ridiculous characters, and I haven't wanted to pick it back up and find out what happened to any of them. I like classic British mysteries by Christie, Marsh, and Tey and I like humorous mysteries like Mortimer's Rumpole of the Bailey, but Branch's style didn't do anything for me. It almost seemed like she was trying to be a slightly darker version of P.G. Wodehouse (who I love) but it didn't work, in my opinion.In the unlikely event I finish the book, I'll post another review."},{"Title":"Chickamauga and Chattanooga: The Battles that Doomed the Confederacy","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable reading. The book goes into depth about the battle that occured at Chickamauga and Chattanooga, but does not require the reader to be familiar with Civil War history. I found this book to be easy to read as well as enjoyable. Unfortunately, Bowers writes with a sympathetic viewpoint towards the CSA and goes into detail about Chickamauga (which was a confederate victory) but barely gleems over the battle of Chattanooga. good book for the lay reader, but you historians and civil war buffs may be disappointed."},{"Title":"Chickamauga and Chattanooga: The Battles that Doomed the Confederacy","review":"No one will ever accuse John Bowers of letting historical facts get in the way of telling a good story. Hyperbole? Lively? This is a good overview of the campaign, especially for beginners, but Bowers is really interested in telling dramatic stories about the major figures. But he needs to check his facts. For example, on page 101 he introduces Ambrose Bierce, a lieutenant in the 9th Indiana Infantry, and uses an excerpt from Bierce's post-war short story &quot;Chickamauga&quot; to illustrate the fighting. But on page 146 Bowers calls him Captain Bierce, an officer in an Ohio battery and chronicler of the battle. Although a serious student of the battle will do much better to read Steven Woodworth and Peter Cozzens, many will find Bowers very entertaining. Bowers is from East Tennessee and is the grandson of a Confederate cavalryman who fought in the battle. Bowers' best story in this book is in the Acknowledgements and concerns a Virginia patrician historian at the New York City Civil War Round Table. This alone is worth the cover price!"},{"Title":"Chickamauga and Chattanooga: The Battles that Doomed the Confederacy","review":"John Bowers has a novelist's ear for dialogue and an almost uncanny knack for entering a period of history long gone. He combines these qualities with a historian's grasp of the Civil War era. This gives his book an authority and readability that brings the whole fascinating crucial battle of Chickamauga and its surrounding episodes to life. It's a brilliant job as is Mr. Bowers' book Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a soldier (Morrow), alas now out of print."},{"Title":"Chickamauga and Chattanooga: The Battles that Doomed the Confederacy","review":"This book is one of the best history books I've read in ages. The story is presented in a gripping style and the characterizations and revelations are done majestically. Take for example this description of Leonidas Polk: &quot;A handsome man with a full head of wavy graying hair and strong Roman features, he always seemed on the verge of giving a benediction or asking that the fried chicken be passed.&quot;Mr. Bower's descriptions are entertaining and enlightening. Chicamauga isn't about strategy, it was a soldiers fight. What mattered was the character of the men involved. This book goes into the details. I cannot recommend this more highly."},{"Title":"Chickamauga and Chattanooga: The Battles that Doomed the Confederacy","review":"This book i find shows a great deal of attention to the failure of the union. It also shows the haunting simularities, not noted in the book, between Chickamauga and Chancellorsville. Both battles included a gap inthe union lines being exploited. Over all, the book is a good read and My serious gratitude to the author for such a fine work."},{"Title":"Chickamauga and Chattanooga: The Battles that Doomed the Confederacy","review":"This book tells the story of two battles, which literall killed the cause of the Confederacy. Chickamauga was one of the bloodiest battles in the Civil War, and the Confederacy lost over 20000 men and the Union lost over 16000 men. Some men burned to death. They raked leaves back with sticks to try to keep the fires away from them. Many of the soldiers were found burned alive with the sticks still in their hands. After Chickamuaga the union retreated to Chattanooga. the Confederacy stayed and celebrated their win. Then finally the Confederacy came and besieged 500 civilian and 35000 Union men at chattanooga. the siege went on for days and days. Men died of starvation. Soldiers were forced to kill horses, dogs,and mules. Then Grant's army of 20000 showed up. Then not many days later, Sherman's army of 20000 showed up. They had a fight that was so furious that men were made armless and legless in a matter of seconds. The Confederacy was beaten back on the third day.Bowers shows a real knack for writing and explaining the battles from the men's points of view. He could have not done better. He showed me facts, the men's point of view, and also who the generals in the battles were. He went into the tactics very well. He made sure the reader understood everything."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],C={key:0},P={key:1};function E(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",P,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",C,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(W,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-bc3e7102"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/3.md","filePath":"drive/3.md"}'),D={name:"drive/3.md"},G=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{R as __pageData,G as default};
