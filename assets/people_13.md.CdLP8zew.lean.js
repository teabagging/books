After slogging through a couple of duds, I hit another winner. Nancy Warren knows how to combine all the ingredients for a good romance novel. The romance kicked off with a bang, moved along at a reasonable pace, and had a good resolution. It begins with Mayor Patrick O'Shea lusting after his beautiful assistant, Briana Bliss. But Briana isn't what she seems. Patrick is a fairly new mayor who beat out a city councilman because someone leaked a 20-year-old sex scandal about the councilman just before the election. Unbeknownst to Patrick O'Shea, the councilman blames him for the leak, and he wants revenge. He talks his niece, Briana, into applying for the job of the mayor's assistant so she can lure him into making inappropriate advances and then tarnish his reputation. Briana is very close to her uncle, and believes the press lied about him, so she readily agrees to his plan to take down his rival. Except that the mayor, despite his obvious attraction to Briana, behaves impeccably. He's also a pretty good mayor. At the beginning of the story, Patrick and Briana get stuck in an elevator when an aftershock strikes Courage Bay. While they're stuck in the dark, Briana seduces Patrick and, armed with a recorder, tapes the whole thing. She regrets it almost immediately. She's falling for the mayor and isn't so sure her uncle Cecil's plans are a good thing. After being rescued, Briana discovers her recorder missing, and it naturally winds up in Patrick's hands. Over the next few weeks, Patrick and Briana's feelings for each other deepen and she finds herself being integrated into his life when she winds up caring for his children in an emergency. She also falls for the children, and they for her. She feels increasingly pressed to tell Patrick who she really is, but waits until she can complete her investigation into her uncle's sex scandal. When she finally finds the truth, including how the story leaked, she goes to tell Patrick. Of course, Patrick had stumbled across the tape of them in the elevator that very day and became suspicious. He isn't interested in listening to Briana's explanations. The next day, she starts packing to leave Courage Bay. But, with some interference from Patrick's sister, they straighten everything out and start planning a wedding.This book dealt with a widower with two children who missed his wife. However, he did not cling annoyingly to her memory or spend an inordinate amount of time lamenting her loss. He moves on. At the beginning of the story, he realizes he must finally be ready emotionally because of his attraction to Briana. It's nice to see the issue raised and handled, but not beat to death. On the flip side, our heroine has a lot on her mind, but she doesn't dither and wring her hands. She takes action and tries to do the right thing, even when it's hard. The ending, too, was well woven and moved me to tears, which is rare. Though devoid of the action and suspense of some of the Code Red novels, this one didn't need them. It was fine just the way it was."},{"Title":"Aftershocks (Code Red)","review":"I have to admit that I've been partial to the CODE RED CONTINUITY SERIES from Harlequin. \\"Ordinary people, extraordinary circumstances\\" is the tagline, and each and every book I've read so far lives up to that expectation. With AFTERSHOCKS by Nancy Warren, we gain another glimpse into life in Courage Bay, California, and just like every town around the world, there are good guys and bad guys, strong people and weak people, and boring and not-so-boring circumstances that throw them all together.AFTERSHOCKS is a little different from some of the other books I've read in the series, in that it's not an action-adventure romance so much as part romance, part political thriller, and part family drama. For Mayor Patrick O'Shea, getting more funding for Courage Bay's Emergency Services department is more important to him than anything-as a former firefighter, he's seen first hand how additional funds will help the citizens of his town in the face of the disasters that seem to hit them on a regular basis. The only thing Patrick desires more is Briana Bliss, but since the woman is his administrative assistant, he knows a relationship with her wouldn't be appropriate.There's another reason Patrick's wary to act on his desire for Briana, and it has nothing to do with the death of his beloved wife, Janie, three years ago. No, his hesitation comes from the fact that his predecessor, married former-Mayor Herman Carter, met his downfall when explicit video footage showed him in a compromising position with his own assistant. Due to the fallout that ensued, added with Patrick's position as an upstanding citizen of Courage Bay, he knows that anyone who knew of a relationship between him and Briana would use it against him.Unfortunately, one of the people who could have the chance to do just that is Briana herself. The niece of a councilman who believes Patrick O'Shea was behind Herman Carter's fall from grace, he gets Briana to agree to find out the dirt on the new, so-called free from sin Mayor, and to use it as revenge for his friend's political demise. From the beginning, Briana isn't sure her uncle's idea is a good one, but she does believe that the press lied about the former Mayor, and tarnished his reputation with their biased reporting.When an earthquake traps Patrick and Briana in an elevator, they know they're at the bottom of the list of people to be attended to by Emergency Services. With tape recorder in hand, Briana seduces her boss, tapes the entire episode, and then is left wondering what she should do about the proof she now holds as to her boss's true character.The only problem is that Briana knows she's falling for her boss, and Patrick has made it clear that what happened in that elevator was far from a casual fling for him. With Briana's uncle harping for the evidence to get revenge on Patrick, with Patrick himself feeling cheated by Briana, and with Briana wrestling with her true feelings for Patrick and what she's done, a truly intriguing plot follows.Ms. Warren has done an excellent job of throwing together two people who really care for each other, then mixing it up with a bunch of outside influences that sway their decisions. People in positions of political authority have to be very careful that their personal lives and decisions are done in a way that doesn't hurt their constituency, and Ms. Warren takes great care to make sure the pros and cons of both Patrick's and Briana's decisions reflect that careful balance.An engaging romance with elements of both mystery and suspense, AFTERSHOCKS is another winner in the CODE RED SERIES."},{"Title":"Exiles of the stars","review":"Andre Norton published four books in her Moon Singer series: &quot;Moon of Three Rings (1966); &quot;Exiles of the Stars (1971); Flight in Yiktor (1986); and &quot;Dare to Go A-Hunting (1989).&quot;Exiles of the Stars&quot; combines Norton's SF Free Trader and Forerunner themes, with some magic mixed in to add weird undertones. These aren't the stodgy (but wonderful) free traders of her 'Solar Queen' series. The crewmates of the starship 'Lydis' are edgy, shape-shifted mutants with extra-sensory powers. Krip Vorlund, one of the first-person narrators was once human, but got relocated into an alien Thassa body in &quot;Moon of Three Rings.&quot; He couldn't go home again, so to speak, because his original body was spaced. The second narrator, the Moon Singer herself (who switched Krip then got switched herself) inhabits a sort of large-clawed, dog shape in 'Exiles,' but retains her intelligence and at least some of her esper powers.The Forerunner theme weaves into the mix when the 'Lydis' sets down on the planet, Thoth in the Amen-Re system, which happens to be particularly rich in Forerunner artifacts. 'Lydis's officers seal a bargain with Thothian priests to transport some of the alien treasure to the planet Ptah for safekeeping (Thoth is in the midst of a nasty civil war). So far so good. But shortly after lift-off from Thoth, the 'Lydis' has to make an emergency landing on the uninhabited planet, Sekhmet.Almost as soon as she touches down, the 'Lydis' comes under attack.Krip Vorlund and the former Moon Singer, Maelen set out on a rescue mission through the ancient, underground ways of Sekhmet, where they encounter jackers (space pirates), Patrolmen, ghosts from their own past, and yet more Forerunner super-technology.The Moon Singer books are not my favorite Nortons. They are a thematic hodge-podge, and it's hard to love a hero and heroine who inhabit non-cuddly alien bodies with super-human powers. However, if you are already a Norton fan and are particularly fond of her Forerunner novels (I think the very first one was the 'Solar Queen' adventure, &quot;Sargasso of Space&quot;), read &quot;Exiles of the Stars&quot;--but only after you've finished &quot;Moon of Three Rings.&quot;"},{"Title":"Exiles of the stars","review":"Exiles of the Stars (1971) is the second novel in the Moonsinger series, following Moon of Three Rings. In the previous volume, Krip Vorlund, a minor esper and Free Trader crewmember, was entangled in a conspiracy by offworld powers and kidnapped from the fairgrounds by a young native lord. Maelen, a Moonsinger of the Thassa, facilitated his escape from prison and then exchanged his body with that of a mindless barsk just before the searchers caught up with them.Maelen was later mortally injured and exchanged bodies with the faithful Vors, one of her \\"little people\\". Thereafter, the Thassa assembly condemned Maelen for the misuse of her powers and took away her Moonsinger wand. She was also rejected from Thassa society for an unspecified period.In this novel, Krip and Maelen are aboard the Free Trader ship Lydis as crewmembers. Krip is now wearing the body of a Thassa and Maelen is still encased in the body of Vors. Krip retains his position as assistant cargomaster and Maelen is valued for her powerful esper talents.The ship has brought a cargo of pulmn to the priesthood on Thoth, only to find that the church and state are threatened by a religious insurrection. A new prophet has arisen in the mountain country east of Kartum after a virulent plague had spread from a new Forerunner cache. This prophet preachs that all Forerunner artifacts collected by the church are evil and should be destroyed.The priests are very frightened and are negotiating a new contract with the Lydis crew to take at least one load of precious Forerunner relics to safety on Ptah, another planet in the system. After the contract is confirmed, the Lydis crew dumps the worthless pulmn and takes on the first load of Forerunner treasures. The loading is opposed by rebel sympathizers, but government troops clear them off the landing pad.The shipment of these relics offplanet is also opposed by some within the temple hierarchy. A fanatic priest from a lesser temple comes to the landing pad with his entourage to curse the ship. He vows to stay there until the treasures are returned.Another priest brings the take-off authorization and remains aboard to escort the relics to Ptah. However, this priest uses a strange device within one of the artifacts to sabotage the ship engines, throwing it off-course. The Lydis crew manages to land safely, but not on Ptah. Instead, they are grounded on Sekhmet, an uninhabited planet in the same system.Maelen soon discovers that they are being watched. Krip warns the Lydis crew, but Maelen doesn't have any certain information on the watchers. The crew establishes communications with a passing Patrol ship, which lands and surveys the situation. The patrolmen decide to take the captain and engineer of the Lydis back to their base to obtain necessary repair parts for the ship engines.Three patrolmen are left behind to help discover some missing crewmembers. Krip and Maelen go with the patrolmen on the search. They find the missing flitter and signs of the missing crew. They also find indications that another flitter had taken away the crewmembers.Maelen and Krip discover that jacks have been looting a repository of functional relics and that a few living Forerunners have preempted the jack operation. These Forerunners have powerful esper powers that allow them to control other people or to force an exchange of bodies. The only female Forerunner has been trying to take control of Maelen, who successfully resists the takeover.Like many works by this author, this novel has fantastic elements in its plot. Body exchange is strange enough, but dead men in stasis who still have psionic powers is way out. However, this work illustrates Clarke's Third Law that any sufficiently advanced science appears to be magic to the uninitiated.Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of psionics and other advanced sciences.-Arthur W.

Our reluctant hero Sean seemed to lack some of the same spark as in earlier books. As a great character, I still, will re-read all the books, and eagerly anticipate any future books. As a point of context, I've read most, if not all, of the books from Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler, John Grisham, Dan Brown, Vince Flynn, Jack Higgins, Ludlom, as well as other authors and genres. I will read the book again, and share it with others, but will look forward to improvements in the future."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"The main character in the novel, Sean Drummond, is an endearing protagonist with a smart sense of humor. The dialogue is sharp and easy to read. I would definitely be interested in reading other books about Drummond, as he is likeable and humorous.However, the plot of this particular novel is rather weak and has more holes than swiss cheese. Unfortunately the book concludes with several loose ends and doesn't really deliver the \\"punch line\\" with enough power. In the end, this book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"I've enjoyed the previous Drummond adventures, which were sharply written and engaging. This latest is a limp potboiler. Haig's character in earlier books was a no-nonsense, mature investigator with a sarcastic wit and focused intelligence. Plots were thoughtful and action was nicely done. In this book, Drummond comes across as a whiny, juvenile crybaby who makes lots of self-centered wisecracks that are mostly annoying. It's like he has regressed into adolescent depression. The griping tone (in the audio version) is augmented by the grade B reading of Scott Brick, who seems to do a fair number of these \\"thrillers.\\" Poor Scott tries hard, but really needs a dialog coach. He pronounces words correctly, but often doesn't get the emphasis or cadence quite right. Worst, his tendency to overact worsens the already irritating whininess of the main character. Reaching for macho roughness, he achieves something like the blubbering of a talk show narcissist. Finally, the plot in this novel, once unwound from its several arbitrary tangents, is fundamentally unpersuasive. The book doesn't hang together, and the chief villain -- pretty easy to guess about 2/3 through -- is uninteresting. Let's hope Haig can get back on the track in his next effort."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Brian Haig is a genius.

Considering that the house is impenetrable with cameras and radar detectors outside and agents inside, no one knows how the killer breached the premises. That is no one until Sean explains the most likely method that led to the assassination of the White House Chief of Staff Terry Belknap, his wife, and their four secret service bodyguards. The message left behind is \\"... the president will be history in the next two days\\".Though he wants out because he knows what will hit the bureaucratic fan, Sean wonders if the mass murders are linked to the $100 million bounty offered for killing the president? Soon a Supreme Court Justice and the Republican National Committee chairman are killed too. Drummond concludes that a mole inside the inner circle of security is giving away information. He must remove the mole before he can stop the killing machine, but has only one day left.In his fifth appearance, Drummond is at his wisecracking best because he has the perfect straight man (make that woman) the tight Margold as his sidekick. Sean is stupendous as he cannot sit idly quiet even when it is his in his best interests while working for the civilians. The story line is terrific, perhaps the best of a strong series as Brian Haig provides a fabulous political investigative thriller that grips the audience from the moment Sean opens his mouth in the affluent Virginia suburbs and never slows down until he gets the final word in.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"The book was entertaining and suspenseful.

Not once has he been thrilled with these changes but this time he wishes he could just turn tail and run.When he's brought in to help the CIA and FBI with a murder investigation involving six victims, it's the start of a bad day that only goes downhill. What he's not initially aware of is that the execution of these people amounts to a political assassination. One of them just happens to be the White House Chief of Staff.For the next 48 hours, Drummond teams up with FBI agent Jennie Margold to figure out the who, what and why of the murders. The twist is that it seems to have something to do with a reward put out for the death of the President and there are guaranteed to be more murders in between...one of which may be Drummond's own. The mastermind behind this killing spree is always one step ahead of them, leaving no doubt as to whom is in control.The suspense begins within the first few pages and remains steady right through to the one-two punch of an ending. The reader is not only kept apprised of Drummond's progress from previous books but also continues to get to know him through the current story. He becomes more fleshed out as the series advances and the reader can't help but appreciate and come to love his ever-present acerbic wit. Haig once again combines this appealing character with a top-notch storyline and comes out a winner."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"I have read all of Brian Haig's five novels and the only thing I find disappointing is that there are no more for me to peruse. Pick up the pace Mr. Haig--you are obviously not writing fast enough!! As noted by other reviewers, Haig's style is very similar to Nelson DeMille's, which is high praise indeed. Major Sean Drummond is a thoroughly enjoyable character and Haig's novels are always tightly plotted, humorous and totally delightful. I highly recommend this series!!"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"If you enjoy a sarcastic, smart assed detective who is on top of his game then buy this book. This is the first time I have read Brian Haig but it won't be the last. The main character Sean Drummond and an unbelievable plot made believable, especially in today's paranoid world drive this story and compell you to keep reading until the end."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Drummond, Sean, R Cath; Major, USA, JAG, is getting a substantial lead on the 'other guy-heroes,' along the heading of 'buying the book just because it's a Sean Drummond novel.'There's a lot of John Corey in Drummond. Corey makes his appearance in Nelson DeMille's \\"The Lion's Game\\" and then really hits the floor running in the recent \\"Nightfall.\\" And there are several similarities between the two cynical, humorous and hard boiled detectives. Both matured under the aegis of a wartime or at least a combat Army; both are Irish, enjoy Scotch, Catholic, aficionados (without the promiscuity) of the ladies, and heavily distinguished with their own barnacles on the ship of life.Certainly Corey is one of my favorites but I think I prefer Drummond precisely for his humanity. Spenser hasn't made a mistake since 1976; Elvis Cole makes them occasionally but he tries VERY hard not to make them and he's very apologetic. But Sean Drummond makes them all the time, feels very aware he's made them, and sometimes he feels badly and sometimes he doesn't care. He is, inotherwords, more like us than Spenser or Cole or for that matter, all the rest.Here he's asked to consult in a horrific multiple murder in McClean Virginia. Like the Palatine Illinois murders of 10-12 years ago, a whole house is taken out in a professional mob-like execution. Pay attention here because just who has asked Sean to participate in the investigation isn't all that clear initially.Mr. Haig weaves a far-fetched plot of a governemnt being held hostage but he does a very adroit job of making it believable. Jennifer Margold is the lovely FBI Behavioral Specialist teamed up with Sean, who travels from contempt to communication to attraction. Will she? Will he? Can they find time while the bodies are piling up?Certainly their relationship is well plotted by Mr. Haig, and you feel, while not apprehensive, with a heightened sense of awareness. And then there's Jason Barnes, son of a Federal Judge rejected for an appointment to the Supremes, who has the second shift of the Secret Service protective unit at the site of the murders, and who suddenly winds up missing?This is the best of the Haig novels I have read so far. With each one he hones his skills further. The dialogue is witty and fast paced and realistic; the plot is complex but made believable by Mr. Haig's descriptive prowess; there are several twists you don't see coming and several facts that are strewn about for you that don't arise again until the last few pages.Good stuff. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Sean Drummond has pretty much done and seen it all. From the killing fields of Bosnia, to the political complexities of 21st century Korea and post-Soviet Russia, to the deadly battelfield of corporate warfare, nothing has prepared him for the carnage that kicks off The President's Assassin.The novel opens upon the brutal scene of the President's chief of staff having been killed in his own home,along with the note that tells official Washington that the President will be dead within 72 hours if a huge ransom isn't paid. Teamed with a crackerjack female FBI criminal profiler, Drummond has to discover who is behind the threat and why before its too late.As always, it is a pleasure to join the sharp-eyed and tar-tongued Drummond as he battles both Washington bureaucracy and an escalating body count to try and find a team of extraordinarily professional killers who always seem to be a step ahead, before they can reach their ultimate target.Haig skillfully ratchets up the suspense with every chapter and the revelation of the motive behind the plot is both unexpected and amply worth the trip. All in all, Haig has hit a home run with this one!"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Brian Haig is an author who takes the time to produce great, plot-oriented books. In The President's Assassin, I was pleasantly surprised early on, as I thought I knew how the story would unfold, but it took a very different turn and in the end, it made sense. Again, just a plain, enjoyable read that encouraged me to get the previous 3 books written by Haig. All three were \\"page-turners.\\"It's unfortunate that so many \\"name\\" authors have sold out by pushing poorly written, uninteresting books. You know the ones where the mystery all comes together in the last few pages and there is NO WAY anyone could have figured it out, because the clues just weren't in the book. - I call that poor writing. My guess is that their agents have negotiated huge pay days for the authors in exchange for an overly ambitious schedule of 1 - 2 books a year...something near impossible to do if one takes the time to do the research and rewrites necessary to produce good fiction.And just to let you know, \\"No,\\" you do not have to read his books in their order of publication. While the main character, a smart-mouthed, sarcastic Army lawyer, named Sean Drummond, adds layers to his character in each book, he stands on his own, no matter which book you are reading.I highly encourage you, if you enjoy well thought out plot-oriented books that deal in murder and mystery, to give all of Brian Haig's books a try. I'm anxiously awaiting his next adventure."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Funny, likable Sean Drummond makes for a fast, really enjoyable great read. No negatives to share. Brian Haig is terrific."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"The latest from Brain Haig brings back Major Sean Drummond currently on loan to the CIA's Office of Special Projects. Summoned to accompany FBI Agent Jennifer Margold, he is his usual anti-authority mouthy self when taken to a crime scene in suburban Washington. Six people are dead including the White House Chief of Staff. If that wasn't bad enough, a message was left behind threatening to kill the President within 48 hours.Not only did they promise to kill the President, the assassination team plans to collect on an Internet website bounty offer of $100 million for the deed. Whoever ran the site, which was up for a matter of days before it vanished, is long gone and untraceable. Those that knew of the site and Sean Drummond did not, believed the site and the offer a hoax. Based on the carnage at the crime scene, which includes the assigned protective detail of four FBI agents, others took it seriously and fully intend to collect.As always happens when the problem is big and about to become very pubic in the media, an interagency task force is created to spread blame and accountability. Sean Drummond, a natural loner with an ability to figure out baffling cases, is assigned to work with Agent Margold. Like the entire task force, the two seem constantly behind and getting nowhere as the assassination team strikes again and again raising the body count and causing panic in the media and in the government.This is an intense novel that constantly encourages the reader to turn the page as Sean Drummond and others chase clues and suspects across the country and back to Washington. While little new is added to the Sean Drummond character, most of the other characters seem cut from the typical thriller stereotypes. Agent Margold with her expertise in profiling comes from a troubled background. George Meany, who happens to be Margold's boss, is still the vain, petty little man and typical of all such bureaucrats everywhere. Numerous other examples exist in the novel and will become obvious to readers. Complex character development is not a requisite of a thriller and it certainly isn't here.That isn't necessarily a bad thing because, at least in this case, it allows the author to concentrate on creating tension and a twisting read that will catch most readers totally unaware in its shocking conclusion. This is an excellent example of how a thriller can be done and done well.This entire review previously appeared online at the vacant funhouse.Kevin R.

This time Drummond's been loaned out to the CIA (to get him out of the hair of his JAG commander), and he gets involved in a whirlwind race to save America from a team of daring and well-organized group of assassins.

I've enjoyed all the Sean Drummond books mainly because he is such a smart-ass character that could be very annoying, but somehow isn't. I'm not sure how realistic the story is, I hope for our national security it is not, but it sure was a page-turner.

It is also the first I've read by listening on audio book. Perhaps, Sean Drummond's wise cracking smart alec personality didn't translate well to being read aloud.The plot has a great set-up, with the president's chief of staff and his protective detail being brutally murdered by thugs that leave a note behind saying the killings are going to escalate and end with the president. Sean Drummond is called in to be on the task force as a rep of the CIA. All other agencies are represented and the task force includes rival George Meany. Drummond is paired with FBI agent Jennifer Margold and they develop a rapport.I didn't really enjoy this book because it seemed like there was just too much Sean Drummond. Too much musing and off the cuff remarks and not enough action or twists and turns. If you haven't read Haig before, don't let my review keep you from trying him out.

I can't get enough of these two characters. Haig's 5th installment in the life of Sean Drummond was just as good as the first four. The story was interesting (though slightly implausible), the main character (Drummond) was great (again) and, as I've become accustomed with Haig's novels, sleep deprivation quickly ensued once I started this book. I was also very pleasantly surprised by the twist at the end. Keep churning them out Brian. Also, please keep Sean Drummond as your lead in all future novels. The wit, intelligence, sarcasm, toughness and pull-no-punches bluntness exhibited by Drummond are what drives your story-lines."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"The President's AssassinI admit it. I'm addicted to Brian Haig. In the past two weeks I've read every book he's written (well, I'm almost done with \\"Man in the Middle\\") and I'll probably go into withdrawal until he releases a new book, as I've already read \\"The Hunted.\\"In this outing, our hero Sean Drummond has sufficiently annoyed his bosses that they've loaned him out to the CIA. That doesn't stop his wise-cracking, smart-mouthed tactic, however. The book opens with a murder scene (a particularly bad one) and the clock starts ticking on a seeming threat to the president's life.Drummond is paired with a by-the-book FBI agent who is also an ace profiler. And Drummond is angry about these murders (more come in the following days). Not so much the political ones as the senseless murders of a Secret Service agent, the brutality shown by the killers, and more. The crimes quickly escalate and a suspect is identified. To say more here would be a spoiler, but Haig truly makes you feel the pain of the victims no one seems to care about and you understand his anger.I read this book, as usual, in about a day or so. Drummond reminds me of John Corey, the hero in Nelson DeMille's novels (Plum Island, The Lion's Game). As I've rushed through Haig's books I don't understand why I never heard of him before and why he isn't a top name author. He really is that good. I hope he comes out with another book soon.

Brian Haig is fast becoming one of my favorite thriller writers and with four books under his belt I believe he's found his niche.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Brian Haig, is now the author of five novels featuring Army Major Sean Drummond. As a graduate of West Point with twenty two years of active Army service Mr. Haig writes of Army practices and military weapons with a knowledge and understanding missing from most authors.In this book a LAW (Light Anti Tank Weapon), and a Bouncing Betty anti personnel mine are used to kill people in just the way that they would be used in practice. It bothers me to read about weapons that do impossible things. (I was part of the design team that created the LAW.)Of course just reading about weapons is not why you read a novel. And in this one the characters and the story are captivating. The plot is fairly simple, you have a pair of heros who have only a short time to stop the bad guys from doing dastardly things.But these are interesting characters, doing interesting things. The only real problem is that you'd better plan on a late evening or two because once hooked you won't want to put it down.This is the first Brian Haig book I've read. As soon as I finish writing this I'm going to order the first four of his books from Amazon."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"I fully realize that as a person who uses English as a second language I'm in a poor position to criticize someone else's style, but this book has really been poorly written. Dialogs are really unnatural (I recall a conversation about one of victims immediately after his death which was just too witty to be real) and some words are used too often. There are pages where the author starts using some expression and simply cannot quit it: in reality, actually, incidentally are a few examples. They pop up every other sentence.I am sticking to the book only because of the excellent narration by Scott Brick (this refers to the audio version)."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"This is the first of Haig's Sean Drummond series I have read. It is reasonably exciting and Haig does a good job of exploring the mindset of psychopathic killers. On that scale, I would have given it four stars but the book's weaknesses caused me to reduce my grade to three stars.First, the \\"twist,\\" whereby the villian is revealed seemed too obvious. Worse, Haig's sloppy inattention to detail was shameful. On more that one ocassion he explains that an FBI \\"SAC\\" is the \\"Senior Agent in Charge.\\" Well, no it's not. \\"SAC\\" is the FBI's acronym for SPECIAL Agent in Charge. Worse still, Haig tells us that federal judges are appointed by state governors. Who knew? I wonder whether the United States Senate and the President are aware of this apparent change in the constituion? Finally, he states that there is no right of appeal from civil judgments, which, not to put too fine a point on it, is a curious proposition."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"I have read Mr Haig for some time and have always been impressed that he continues to exceed my expectations.

Drummond, now seconded to the CIA, and the female FBI agent to whom he's been assigned inspect the slaughter and make some brief deductions. Shortly they find themselves teamed together chasing down their main lead, a missing secret serviceman who hasn't been seen since his shift at the undersecretary's home ended. Meanwhile, the assassins start on a killing spree of high ranking government officials and demand a payoff to make them stop. The pressure is on Drummond and his partner to produce results in short order before the assassins can kill any more.Haig has managed to keep the character of Drummond fresh by continually switching environments. This time Drummond is with the CIA and only circumspec mention is made to his JAG corp status. Another beautiful female is tossed into the mix...his female FBI partner (hey, it wouldn't be a Drummond novel without one, kinda like a Bond girl). From my standpoint, Haig is a master of pace, and this novel is done to his usual high level of quality. Haig novels are sometimes fairly transparent and you can see where you're going. In this novel you can't, until maybe the last 20% of the book or less. Toward the end Haig does some \\"philosphizing\\", but it doesn't drag too much, and he does make a couple of valid points about the criminally insane. Because of the re-appearance of some characters, I recommend reading the Drummond books in order, starting with \\"Secret Sanction\\".As I've said in my other reviews of Haigs work, his writing has a style similar to Nelson DeMille and his \\"John Cory\\" character. In some ways I do think Haig is better than DeMille. Everyone of his books has been nice and tight with little waste in the story telling. It gets to the end right on time, no dragging it out and no \\"How can it be finished? There's more to do....\\".

He is a troublemaker, a smart aleck, the antithesis of a team player. What is even more irritating is the fact that, in a room occupied by any cross-population of individuals, Drummond normally will be the smartest one present. However, it is precisely the qualities that make Drummond so difficult to live and work with that make his exploits such an entertaining read.THE PRESIDENT'S ASSASSIN, Haig's latest Drummond novel, is easily his best. Haig takes Drummond out of the office and courtroom and puts him in the field when he is loaned --- or, as Drummond tells us, banished --- to a CIA sub-agency called The Office of Special Projects. The book begins with Drummond accompanying a beautiful and subtly beguiling FBI agent to a home in a posh Washington, D.C. suburb, which is the scene of a terrifying mass murder. It turns out to be only the first step in a series of planned assassinations that are to culminate in the murder of the President of the United States --- unless a ransom of $100 million is paid.Drummond is involved with the FBI on behalf of the CIA, due to the possibility of a foreign connection, but the combined might and majesty of the nation's law enforcement agencies is found wanting. The people behind the murders constantly appear to be several steps ahead of everyone. To make matters worse, the entire operation seems to have been planned and coordinated by a rogue Secret Service agent.Drummond is at his wisecracking best, saving his best quips for the most inappropriate times, yet his insight proves to be invaluable when it comes to nailing down the trail of the assassins. Things take a sudden and dramatic turn, however, when the decision is made to pay the ransom, and the assassins choose Drummond to make the delivery. A resolution seems imminent, but appearances are deceiving. Drummond cannot escape the feeling that something is wrong --- and, as usual, he is quite right.Haig has pulled off a neat trick here with Drummond. The Army lawyer is obnoxious enough to those around him that he keeps getting passed off to new agencies and given new assignments, thus ensuring that he can be involved in fresh plots with new supporting characters for as long as Haig chooses to continue this fine series. The constant change of scenery between novels also makes the series accessible for new readers. At the same time Drummond is quite entertaining to read about, even if you wouldn't necessarily want to work with him.The result is a series that keeps getting better and better and certainly has the potential to do so for the indefinite future.

His continuous \\"humorous\\" comments are totally inappropriate.I think Brian Haig needs to rethink his main character's personality and give him a little sensitivity."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"the first three books of drummond were very good, then came the fourth one, i failed to finish it. and then, came the fifth. well, the early part of this book before drummond went off with his female fbi team member for a wild goose chase, it looked so promising, but then and again, the suppose-to-be-good story simply falling apart. i think the problem began when drummond changed from his jag uniform into brook brothers threads. making one of the secret service guys to become the conspirator and the killer was a bad creation. sorry, i failed to finish it this time and will not try to read haig's stuff to repeat my die-hard trying. thank you very much."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"This was the first Haig book I've read, and truthfully I can't even say I've read it, since I abandoned the tripe a third of the way into it.

Drummond is fantastic and Haig doesn't go over the top with cliches and shallow sarcasim unlike the recent Nelson DeMille (horrible!). He's likeable, extremely funny, tough, modest, and interesting as a JAG officer.Haig's books don't have to be read in order and each story is a page turner! All his characters, the villians and Sean's supporting cast, are interesting and very well developed. In each book, the ending is a stunner! Just as you thought you had it figured out; he throws a curve ball each time!Thanks Brian!

Thanks again!"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"I did not particularly like Haig's The Kingmaker, and was almost turned off by the negative reviews of The President's Assassin. I read the sample, though, and then the book, and am delighted that I took the plunge.The President's Assassin is superbly plotted and written, and gallops along to a surprising but oddly satisfying conclusion. Haig knows his characters and infuses them with vivid multi-dimensional luminance. It is a great read!One final thought. Some reviewers, both in connection with this book and others, condemn Haig for making Sean Drummond a smart-aleck, quasi clone of Nelson DeMille's heroes. Although Drummond bothered me in The Kingmaker, his observations in The President's Assassin are right-on.Haig's description (through Drummond) of the bureaucracies not only rings true, it is true, which is sad for our Republic. Of course, people are people everywhere, and all countries, whether good or evil, have the same Bell-Curve mix of competence in the structures that run their societies. Haig, who has both professional and personal experience with the highest levels of our government, shines an insightful and jocular light on the bureaucracies in which we put so much faith. It works and gives The President's Assassin a cachet that others of this genre lack. The book is well worth the time and the price. Kudos Brian Haig!"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Mr Haig has created a well developed, smart assed character in Sean Drummond.

It suggests that the President of the United States is the predominant character in the book. It does not become the case at any point. It is the President's Chief of Staff who ultimately becomes the focus on what is a more broad conspiracy whereby the President is supposedly (based on some piece of paper) the ultimate target.The real plot is in how various other persons (including a Supreme Court justice) start dying left & right. It becomes a vast extortion plot that takes twists and turns along the way.

It will not be my last.In partnership with Jennifer Margold, a special FBI Agent attached to the DC field office and Drummond on assignment to the CIA Office of Special Projects, are part of the team that is called to investigate the murder of the President's Chief of Staff, his wife and four of his protectors. It is clearly done by professionals and it is equally clear that they had inside information to accomplish the hit. A note is left behind which warns: \\"You can't stop us. There will be others and the President will be history in two days.\\"True to their words, the killers execute other high profile Washington figures as the team struggles to find an answer as to who is behind all of this.Margold and Drummond seem to be on the track and a breakthrough interview with the mother of one of the Secret Service protectors who has gone missing focuses the investigation. There are numerous wheels within wheels on the team as the various agencys and people in them move to protect their turf, sometimes to the detriment of the search. However, as the net closes on the individual being sought and more killings occur, a ransom demand is received from the perpetrators. They want 50 million dollars in untracable money to call off the killing spree. The government agrees and then the story really starts to get interesting. Drummond is the courier who is selected to deliver the money and Margold is in the FBI Agent in charge of seeing that he survives the experience. Their relationship as the story develops has bordered on the romantic, although circumstances keep it from bearing any fruit, so to speak. To tell you more concerning the problems that are thrown in the way of the delivery of the money and it's aftermath would spoil the story and this is a story that delivers all the suspense and surprises that a reader can take.This is first class stuff written by an author that has a great ability to deliver dialogue so that you swear you can hear the voices involved.

Now there are spin-offs. Prominant political figures are assassinated, along with assorted spear carriers and bystanders who are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Nobody except the killers knows who might be next. It is almost impossible to protect people from a dedicated assassin.Army Major Sean Drummond, a JAG recently enlisted into the CIA's Office of Special Projects, is assigned to the case. He has some relevant experience in his past. He finds himself teamed with a behavioral scientist from the FBI. They become intangled in the petty infighting among individuals who seem more interested in what they will personally get from the case, then in solving the murders.The action takes place over a couple days as they try to unravel the mystery of who is doing the hits. Things become highly dangerous when they discover that the black hats have sophisticated military weapons. Primary suspicion falls on an individual they can't find. The motives are initially obscure, but it seems to be about extortion for a very large sum of money.

That aspect distracted me from truly enjoying the story, but I found that I was generally entertained and I didn't want to put it down, so it definitely rates better than many."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Are you a Brian Haig/Sean Drummond fan who is wondering if you should read this fifth entry in the series? If so, my answer is an unqualified yes. This book is extremely enjoyable; it includes all the elements which I will discuss later in this review which have hooked me on the series. In the event that you want additional details or a plot summary, read on, although your time might be better spent just ordering the book so that you can start reading it as soon as possible.On the other hand, if you have never read any of the earlier books, read further to discover why my personal experience leads me to suggest that you do not start with this one. I want to hasten to add, however, that THE PRESIDENT'S ASSASSIN certainly works very well as standalone story. I just believe that regardless of what your goals are, it makes sense to read at least some of the earlier books in the series first.The first book by Brian Haig which I read was THE KINGMAKER; I found it incredibly enjoyable and my only regret was that I had not read the books in the series in the order in which they were written. (My experience is one of the three reasons for my recommendation to first time readers) While it was a great story, the references to Major Drummond's previous experiences and relationships made me wish that I had more than the summary background woven into that narrative. While this is always the dilemma faced by a new reader of a longstanding series, in this case the fact that this is only the fifth book makes it a fairly easy task to start at the beginning. And while the drawback of starting with the first book, SECRET SANCTION, is that it is not as polished a story (a trait shared with many other first time novels), it is still a tight plot which takes advantage of the author's military background while introducing a wonderful character. I also feel that I would have actually enjoyed it more if I had gotten immersed in the series by reading it first. Second, reading the series out of order in at least one case destroys the surprise element (if not shock value) of developments later in the series. Last, if you only want to read one or two of Haig's works (at least initially), my ratings of both THE KINGMAKER (#3) and MORTAL ALLIES (#2) are a full five stars and thus slightly higher than the five minus which I gave to this story. However, I want to reemphasize that in my opinion you will either enjoy any of Haig's books or find all of them not to your liking.This plot is really simple and very compelling - six people including the White House Chief of Staff are found methodically murdered and a note has been left which indicates that more murders will be committed and then within two days the \\"President will be history\\". Army Major and JAG lawyer Sean Drummond (the James Bond of the legal profession- except with a better sense of humor and irony) is now working on assignment with a CIA cell called the Office of Special Projects. He is ordered to accompany special FBI Agent Jennifer Margold to observe the scene of the multiple murders. Sean's antennae cause him to make several knowledgeable observations concerning the supposedly secure electronic surveillance at the site, and soon he realizes too late \\"in retrospect, I should have heeded the old warning: Never test the depth of water with both feet.\\" He discovers after he has waded in that he is now not just a CIA observer in case foreign terrorists are involved but has become a full fledged member of the investigative team. The only consolation seems to be that despite her frosty demeanor Agent Margold (eventually to become Jenny) is \\"early to mid-thirties, shoulder-length coppery hair, slender... attractive - not beautiful, more like pretty in an interesting way...light on the makeup, heavy on the bitchiness...eyes...a sort of frosted blue, like chilled cobalt\\". The intrigue is ratcheted up when they discover a shadowy foreign group has supposedly offered a bounty of $100 million dollars for killing the President; subsequently the tension escalates when further murders are committed. Jenny quickly identifies a prime suspect; however, the search for him proves fruitless and Sean attempts to follow other leads as the countdown continues.The timeline is chronological with historical background information uncovered by the investigators provided as necessary to supplement the plot. The story inexorably races towards the climax; it is unclear who will remain alive, both among the law enforcement team and the country's leaders. Even in such circumstances, however, Drummond remains his wisecracking self, thus managing to frequently defuse the tension for the reader. And best of all, a lot of his asides and throwaway lines are not only really amusing but wonderfully insightful and totally apt. This story involves interesting political and philosophical considerations, but is primarily a psychology casebook involving a lot of fascinating discussion as the team tries to develop helpful insights. Are the strings being pulled by a clever psychopath, or just a team of very competent murderers/blackmailers? While readers may wonder if they are being subject to even more misdirection than the Feds, my conclusion is that the author provided a few fragmentary clues that hinted at the outline of the eventual outcome.In summary, this is an enjoyable read, a wonderful thriller informed by the knowledge and detail which the author brings to the story. As is true of all of Haig's books, while the outcome is riveting, there are bittersweet elements to the plot. These stories don't end happily for everyone, even those who remain alive. The intensely emotional nature of the last chapter and especially the final few paragraphs certainly reveal the understandable toll that Sean's exploits have taken on him, and provide a truly poignant counterpoint to the violence and treachery which we have just witnessed. An exciting book, and while it is not quite my favorite of the series I understand how it might become yours.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"Master of the political thriller, Brian Haig, again mobilizes his acerbic, sarcastic, yet inevitably efficient U.S. Army JAG lawyer with a special forces background, Major Sean Drummond in the stirring \\"The President's Assassin\\". Drummond, on loan to the CIA is tagging along with FBI agents investigating a professionally accomplished massacre scene is the posh Washington D.C. suburbs. He is partnered with the attractive, tightly wrapped FBI special agent Jennifer Margold, Phd. in psychology and superstar of the Quantico Behavioral Sciences Unit.Upon entering a McLean, Virginia mansion they discover a bloody scene already crawling with agents. Six corpses including the White House Chief of Staff, his wife and a four person Secret Service detail have all been dipatched in execution style. The murder scene also contained a note presumably from the perpetrators threatening the demise of the President within 48 hours. They also learn that a website had been created promising a payoff of $100 million to kill the President.Drummond proves to be instrumental in analyzing the murder scene making Agent Margold look good to her boss Assistant Director George Meany, who happened to have been a rival for the affections for Drummond's main squeeze. The threat to the president heightens the response in every government agency.Within short order White House spokesperson Merrill Benedict and Supreme Court justice Fineberg are killed in spectacular fashion using U.S. military issued weapons. Investigations conducted by Margold, ably aided by Drummond seem to point to young Secret Service agent Jason Barnes, presently unaccounted for. Barnes' father Richmond federal judge Calhoun Barnes, recently considered for a seat on the Supreme Court had shamefully been disgraced as they combed through his past. A motive had been established.Drummond and Margold proceed to locate and thwart Barnes before his plans can come to fruition using psychological profiling to move in the right direction.Haig, a talented writer falls a little short in presenting a convincing enough argument in identifying the bad guys in his novel. He is quite obviously setting us up for a twist as the novel concludes. The interplay between Drummond and Margold, which teems with both psychological and sexual conflict was very effectively portrayed."},{"Title":"The President's Assassin","review":"For some reason, although I follow approximately 50 authors, I had not read Brian Haig's work.

Hindenburg, Ludendorff, and the political branch of the General Staff...Mistake after mistake had been made...the results of an excess of megalomania. Very seldom did the actual governmental leaders manage to prevent the acts of violence planned by the High Command.\\"Lee's book explains how two brilliant military leaders rose to the top of their profession and managed to drag the country into defeat.Hindenburg was actually retired when World War I broke out. The much younger Ludendorff was recognized by his superiors as being the staff officer par excellence. Thrown together to deal with a crisis on the Eastern Front, they performed far beyond expectations. After winning the Battle of Tannenburg by annihilating one Russian army and driving another into headlong retreat, they kept the Russians in check for two years.In 1916, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were offered the supreme command of the German Army. Hindenburg became Commander of the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, Supreme Army Command), with Ludendorff as Generalquartiermeister - Chief of Staff. The two of them became the chief managers of the German war effort for the rest of the war.The OHL was effectively a military dictatorship, which largely relegated Kaiser Wilhelm II to the periphery. The two generals meddled with domestic politics to the point of forcing the resignation of government ministers, including the Chancellor three times. They also held an effective veto over appointments in the state hierarchy.With Russia's withdrawal from the war in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff played a key role in the advantageous Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. In 1918 Ludendorff planned and executed a series of German offensives which came close but failed to collapse the Western Allies (Operation Michel).Expecting a successful resolution to the great German spring push in 1918, Ludendorff realised that the war was lost once the offensive failed, aware that with the arrival of fresh American troops the impetus would quickly swing to the Allies. He therefore, with Hindenburg, transferred power back to the Reichstag in September, demanding an immediate peace; subsequently changing his mind, Ludendorff was forced to resign on 26 October under pressure from Max von Baden's government.Lee does not follow the belief that Hindenburg was the front man for Ludendorff. Hindenburg was the Supreme Commander and Lee offers ample evidence that Hindenburg and Ludendorff were partners, with Ludendorff in the subordinate position.I have a few complaints about this book: Greater length is devoted to how Hindenburg and Ludendorff rose to power than to how they drove Germany into defeat. The same number of pages is given to the Battle of the Masurian Lakes as to the industrial problems of 1917-18. Exactly one sentence describes how the Foreign Minister, Jagow, was forced to resign for his opposition to unrestricted submarine warfare.I would recommend this book as a case study of the problems of command."},{"Title":"Warlords: Hindenburg and Ludendorff (Great Commanders S.)","review":"It is a common misconception that Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany was the primary villain that started the First World War. The collective leadership of all the European countries failed, when Princip assassinated the Archduke and his wife, it started a chain of events that no one person either started or had any power to stop. It was also the case that Wilhelm held much less power in Germany than is commonly thought. The German military wielded great power, although a great deal of it was behind the scenes. Two of the most powerful members of that military establishment were the aristocrat Paul von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg and the commoner Erich Ludendorff. More than any other officers, they controlled the military power of Germany and they kept the nation in the war far longer than would otherwise have been the case.To their credit, both men were organizational geniuses who served their country very well at a time of great crisis. When one looks back at the amount of forces arrayed against the Central Powers in World War I, it is amazing that Germany came very, very close to winning the war. If the Russian Empire had not held out for as long as it did, or if the Germans had been willing to give a little more ground in the east in the first few months of the war, it could very well have ended in early 1915 with an allied defeat. Hindenburg and Ludendorff were also intelligent enough to understand when they were defeated and to force an armistice before Germany was invaded and conquered.After the great tragedy of the war, another came soon after and both men played an unfortunate part in it. As soon as the ink was dry on the armistice, both men began the duplicitous game of claiming that defeat was due to a political \\"stab in the back.\\" By putting forth the myth that Germany was never militarily defeated, they sowed the seeds that led to the rise of Adolph Hitler and another world war. This will forever be a black mark on both men. The stature of Hindenburg was such that if he had simply told the German people that the forces allied against Germany were just too great and that the armistice was asked for before the defeat could be total, they would have believed him. Devoid of the \\"political stab in the back\\" myth, Hitler would have had a much more difficult time gaining power and quite possibly could not have done so.Hindenburg and Ludendorff were two of the best leaders of the twentieth century and that is made clear in this book. Unfortunately, their stellar leadership in the war was not followed by such quality behavior when it was over. Lee does an excellent job in explaining the historical context for the rise of these two men, the service they provided in the war and their failure as statesmen once it was over."},{"Title":"Warlords: Hindenburg and Ludendorff (Great Commanders S.)","review":"In his The Warlords: Hindenburg and Ludendorff, John Lee has put together a thoroughly readable summary of two men who, for a brief period, formed arguably the most powerful partnership in Europe.In brisk, economic prose, Lee analyzes the careers of Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff, tracing their young roots in the value system of the Prussian army and following their separate maturations until the two joined in the Great War. They soon outdistanced the Kaiser in real power, and Lee does an exemplary job in showing how their partnership--shaped, guided, and blinded by Prussian values--did much to bring down the country and system they both desperately wanted to preserve.Much of what Lee discusses has been covered previously by other writers, but he has reassembled the material into a concise volume and in the process, he offers new insights. He is masterly at writing sharp, summary paragraphs. This book serves both as a solid introduction to Hindenburg and Ludendorff and as a provocative review of their deeds."},{"Title":"Warlords: Hindenburg and Ludendorff (Great Commanders S.)","review":"This book shows the clearest reason why military leaders should not be in control of a nation. Hindenburg and Ludendorff were great Field Marshalls, but they were horrible in leading the nation. Yet for all practical purposes, they were Germany's WWI leaders. In fact, Hindenburg made political decisions outside his jurisdiction during the war. However, after the Armistice, both blamed politicians, Jews, Catholics, and other leftists for Germany's loss. They didn't suck it up and admit defeat, but placed the blame elsewhere. Both were not honorable men, they pushed aside critics because they disagreed with them. They ultimately lost the war for Germany.Lee does a good job of detailing the successes and failures of these two men. Hindenburg ultimately selected Adolf Hitler as his successor, and this was his worst mistake. I think the book is a good read on two poor politicians but capable military men."},{"Title":"Silence and Solitude: Inspirations for Meditation and Spiritual Growth","review":"One of the best quotation books I've found in support of one's own inner journey.

When she has done this the degree of familiarity you may have had with the event is forever altered. Previously I have enjoyed her version of events that were famous and or notorious, however this time her subject is one that was completely unknown. Further it was not even a remarkable story albeit a true one until Ms. Bainbridge decided to complete all that might have happened which was a larger piece of the known story. History recorded only the results and consequences never the cause.This is not the Watson of literary fame that spent his time sleuthing with the great Sherlock Holmes. This man is as ordinary as the afore mentioned were extraordinary, and he only rose to average when at his best. The story is based on a true crime of the late 19th Century and one that is committed in this country on a daily basis. This part is important for the Author takes an event that is anything but momentous and makes it an excellent read. Further she ventures into social and moral commentary that is valid and argued to this day.The Reverend Watson commits a hideous crime, not even he contests this fact. What no one can account for is why the act took place and his state of mind when committing it. The writer supplies a multiple decade history of what might have happened inclusive of the briefest of alleged dialogue.The triumph here is a novel that utilizes a host of documents and court transcripts together with letters to a variety of newspapers. But they are only a part, almost addenda to what Ms. Bainbridge adds. It is as though she was given only an answer and wrote a thesis on the question.This is another wonderful work by a writer who is consistently excellent."},{"Title":"Watsons Apology","review":"This book is a real gem.

The story begins with Watson and Anne Armstrong's courtship in December 1844 and takes us through their outwardly quiet, but inwardly evolving marriage for the next 27 years. I am convinced this murder could only have taken place in the peculiarly repressive Victorian era. Ms. Bainbridge does a masterful job of placing us in that period; from the household to the clothes they wore to the transportation of the times.Mr. and Mrs. Watson were a match made in hell, both to be pitied. John was an inward-looking, introspective, self-sufficient, gentle (yes, gentle!) person. Anne was intelligent, needy, histrionic, and highly intuitive. She literally and calculatedly drove him mad because of her disappointed expectations.The last third of the book was devoted to actual trial excerpts. I could have used less of these, as many were repetitious. However, I found it interesting that the defense was clearly angling toward a temporary insanity plea. Edward Stanton, later Lincoln's Secretary of War, defending Congressman Dan Sickles, later Union General, in a scandalous trial, first successfully used this defense in the United States in 1859. Sickles shot and killed the son of Francis Scott Key on the steps of the White House for Keys' improper attentions to Sickles' wife. Sickles was acquitted. From the transcripts of Watson's trial, you can tell this was a new and extraordinary defense in England twelve years later.Ms. Bainbridge is the type of writer you would like to corner and ask, \\"What made you think this, write in this particular way, and where in the world do your ideas come from?\\" She is, as always, fascinating."},{"Title":"Approaches to Teaching Dickens' David Copperfield (Approaches to Teaching Masterpieces of World Literature)","review":"i DID NOT THINK OF THIS A A GREAT PIECE GOING FROM THE VIRTORIAN NOVERLIST EARA."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"Matt Scudder does it again.

Mick says he booked a room in a \\"hotel across the street from the White House.\\" The only hotel that fits that description is the Hay-Adams, across Lafayette park. Rooms at the luxurious Hay-Adams start at $300 a night -- a bit unusual for Mick Ballou, who is described as a brutal killer, a career criminal, and someone who drinks whiskey like water.The sudden mention of the Wall is a plot device, of course, and Scudder later travels to Washington to check whether a certain name is on the wall. Of course, Scudder wouldn't have had to travel -- the Wall names are listed on the internet.The d&eacute;nouement is even worse. The group of respectable businessmen decides that the answer to their problems is to hold the killer in solitary confinement for life, in their own private jail cell, located on a small island in Lake Huron. The businessmen use the racist assumption that a \\"family of Cree Indians\\" who work as caretakers of the island will loyally and mutely participate in their conspiracy to kidnap and isolate the killer for life -- complete with a welded leg shackle.The book started off well, but it really needs a different ending."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"This is another in the Matt Scudder mystery series. In this one someone is killing off the members of a private men's club that meets once a year. The best thing about it is the characterization. Block is a great writer, and even if the pay off on this one isn't great the story telling is. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"Scudder paints a nice picture of grimy new york life as a backdrop to an interesting plot. I liked the overall narrative, but also the mini episodes where Scudder interacts and exchanges stories with the other characters. Definitely not a waste of time."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"The Mathew Scudder novels of Lawrence Block are known for theintensity of both the characters and situations. If any ofyou non-alcoholics want to know what it's like to be an alcoholic,read these books! Thank God I'm not an alcoholic!In most of these novels, the situation is personal with thecharacters: i.e., the murder personally affects Scudder orhis friends (as in &quot;A Ticket to the Boneyard&quot;). This connectionmakes the book more interesting. In this novel, that's not thecase. The plot setup is run-of-the-mill PI fiction, with Scudderbeing hired out of the blue to solve a murder. What savesthis book is the deviousness of the murderer and the superbwriting of Block. This isn't the best book of the series,but it is a great introduction and warm up. You'll need it!"},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"I just read this for the second time, having run out of reading material, and enjoyed it again. Block is an excellent writer, making an interesting read in spite of an unlikely plot. The club of 31 is quite uninteresting, yet Block managed to hold my interest with his great character development and descriptive writing.I have to say, though, I am tired, fed up with the AA stuff. Block's depiction of the AA crowd is accurate, I think, based on my experience with a friend, and his buddies from AA. They spend the rest of their lives telling everyone they can about how bad they were, with obvious nostalgia for the bad old days. It is inescapable, though, that they are losers before and after their joining AA. Maybe that is Block's point, as Scudder is a flat personality, whose outlook is grim, and basically boring outside occasional excitment during his investigations.Is Block an alcoholic?"},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"I've always worried about an author once he becomes rich and famous. Because once he is too successful and cashing in too much, his writing inspiration would soon be jarred by his own glory. This book plus his BURGLAR's series(a ridiculous creation like Lawrance Sanders' McNally series) are the proof that the once great writer is going downhill in a 35 degree angle. Very bad writing and plotting with lot of flaws. Simply TERRIBLE"},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"A boring pastiche of \\"koko\\" (Peter Straub) and \\"10 little indians\\" (Agatha Christie) with the best parts missing. The rest of the plot is a dreary Alcoholic Anonymous polemic. Avoid."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"Multi-award winner Block combines the mystery puzzle format with the gritty style of the American private eye iin this 1994 Matthew Scudder novel.Scudder himself is a somewhat unsettling character - a forthright, thoughtful recovering alcoholic who lives with an ex-prostitute and claims as his best friend a hard-drinking killer.The story's premise is instantly tantalizing, bristling with curiosities. Scudder's new client, Lewis Hildebrand, belongs to an unusual club - 31 men who meet annually to reflect on the year's changes in their lives and to take reverent note of those members who have died. Members speak of the club to no one, not even wives.The last living member chooses 30 new members and the club goes on. That day is quickly approaching.Hildebrand hires Scudder to investigate the alarming death rate among members. As Scudder looks for a thread linking the disparate accidents, suicides and murders, the questions multiply and the angles proliferate. Motive is baffling and the only suspects are the surviving club members.As always, Block's writing is excellent with a tight plot, unusual characters and intelligent dialogue. One of Scudder's better outings."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"I am a huge fan of hardboiled P.I. fiction, and this is the first Matthew Scudder book that I've had a chance to read. And while I found the book to be a bit on the slow side in terms of action, the plot was so fascinating that I couldn't put it down. The book's real subject matter is death, and as one character says, man is the only animal who knows he's going to die. He's also the only animal that drinks. Somehow, there must be a connection. Those strictly interested in shoot-'em-ups and continuous action should look elsewhere. Those who like their P.I. stories on the philisophical side will love it.As a character, I found Scudder interesting, especially his background and his continuous battle with alcoholism. Like any good P.I., he inhabits the landscape around him (in this case, Manhattan) so well that he becomes part of the scenery. I also didn't mind the fact that he was involved in a stable relationship (often a weakness in other P.I. serieses. A classic P.I. ought to be a loner). His love interest is just quirky enough to add spice to the story and isn't used merely to give him a contrived vulnerability. Overall, the best compliment I can pay is that I don't expect that this will be my last encounter with Scudder."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"There is something appealing (to some people, including me) about a 'secret society' that only meets once a year or so and whose membership is selected with no particular requirements beyond the nomination, even though it is a matter of the whim of the nominator. No dues, no qualifications, no rules (except silence about the club). This one has just 31 members, the last one living selecting the next 30, and has gone on for umpty generations. Now somebody is killing the members -- is it to 'inherit' the chairmanship? Apparently not, since a leading member asks Scudder to investigate. Like Rex Stout's &quot;League of Frightened Men&quot; this is a classic of this sub-category of detective-novel themes. The mystery is intriguing, and I am happy to say that Matt Scudder is selected to become a new member in spite of there being some survivors. He should be very proud to belong to such a society (even though it isn't mentioned in subsequent books, but maybe that's because it's supposed to be a 'secret society' -- in which case why did Scudder write about it? -- oh, well, that's the only way first-person narratives get written in the first place). Great idea for an old-man club, though they start out young. Meet once a year, eat well, and sigh 'well, I'm still here'."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"Matthew Scudder is Lawrence Block's remarkable private investigator. He's a former NYPD detective who left the force after an accident left a child dead in a crossfire. Scudder is a recovering alcoholic, attending meetings of AA. (In earlier books in the Scudder series he's always drinking. In time he realizes he needs help.) By the time we meet up with him in &quot;A Long Line of Deadmen,&quot; Scudder has been sober ten years. In this novel we learn of a legendary club that consists of 31 men. They meet once a year until their membership is down to a single member who has the responsibility of recruiting another thirty men to carry on the tradition to wait until all but one of them is alive. The group meets for years and years, considering the new recruits are in the late twenties and thirties. When members of the club start dyeing at an alarming rate Matt Scudder is hired by one of the members to investigate. Characters from past Scudder novels reappear. The ever present Elaine, his call-girl girl friend have developed a more permanent relationship. In &quot;A Walk Among the Tombstones,&quot; Block introduces a streetwise American-American teen that has street smarts. His only permanent address is his pager. TJ is back and helps Scudder with the case. TJ reminds me of a black ten year old I knew many years ago in the South Bronx, intelligent and street wise at the same time. I guess only God knows what became of him. I hope Scudder keeps TJ alive and well and in action in future novels. I enjoyed this Scudder novel as I did the others in the series. It's not as fast paced as the other in the series but does make very well reading. I suggest if you enjoy &quot;Long Line...&quot; you might want to read the others in the series in sequence."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"I'd read anything Lawrence Block wrote, cereal boxes, if necessary--that's how much of a fan I am. His only competitor in a narrow field is Donald Westlake, and Block is a tad or so better.The plot of \\"Long Line\\" involves a tontine, a club of disparate men who meet once per year to see who has died. Unlikely? Yes, but bear with it. After a time it appears that the members are dying faster than normal, and Scudder is hired to find out why. It's been done before with different twists (e.g., Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\"), but it's not bad. I would add only that the first pages were a bit tedious--until Scudder takes the reins. Then the book moves. But it's not the plot that makes this book worthwhile.Block's characters, the ambience of New York City and the dialogue, especially the latter, are what carry this. Block's people are full of contradictions. Too often writers invent characters who stay on a narrow track, but never Block. For example, unlicensed detective Scudder is devoted to his main squeeze, but now and then he strays. His main squeeze is an ex-call girls who has an artsy Manhattan shop and an eye for what is \\"in\\" with the artsy buyers. She can sell \\"paint by the number\\" works for hundreds of dollars if the painting is in an expensive frame. Block's African American friend talks jive and straight, and the reader is never sure which is his real voice.Block invents some streets and byways of the City, but that causes no harm. I wouldn't nitpick that. Block's city is very much alive. His most obvious talent, however, is in writing dialogue. No one does it better. It's funny. It's real. There are very funny throwaway lines.While this is not my favorite Block novel, it's a worthwhle read--and a good deal better than most other crime novels."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"It's a good reading, but compared to the expectation concerning the title, it's actionless. The last 50 or 60 pages are very good, but the others are very slow. By the way, I liked it and will probably read other Block's book."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"The premise is unusual - a secret society of businessmen, that started in ancient Babylon and has continued to this day. A set of 31 men, who gather once a year for a dinner, and patiently wait until only one remains, who selects 30 young men to regenerate the process. But somebody has noticed the current crop is dying at a rate well off the life insurance actuarial charts. Several of these deaths are obvious murders, but others that were dismissed as suicides or accidents are now being re-examined. Matt Scudder is employed to found out if there is a sinister plot to thin the ranks, and if so, why.This book was outstanding. I love Lawrence Block's writing style, whether he's writing about Matt Scudder or Bernie Rhodenbarr. Can Matt Scudder uncover a mass murderer who has patiently worked for years before he strikes again? You'll be on the edge of your seat as you read this one."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"This is an exemple of how to make a very good book from a good idea. This was my first Scudder's book and still one the very best."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"One of Block's works that takes a while to get into to and then it's hard to put down. I am a huge Block fan; however, this book certainly isn't his best. I would recommend reading it, as with everything Block does, it's worth it."},{"Title":"A Long Line Of Dead Men - A Matthew Scudder Mystery","review":"I just finished Lawrence Block's latest Matt Scudder book, \\"A Drop of the Hard Stuff\\". It's his first book in a few years and I found it of 5 star quality and wrote a review for Amazon. But it is not Block's best Scudder book. That was \\"A Long Line of Dead Men\\", originally published in the mid-1990's. (After the first attack on the World Trade Center but before the second.) I make it a habit to reread the book every few years, but I hadn't done so in about 5 years. So, I went back and read it, hoping it would be as good as I remembered it. And it was.Lawrence Block's novels - and he has had several series using different characters - are never particularly action-filled. Oh, people get killed - in Block's \\"Keller\\" series a lot of people get killed - but he's not a graphic writer. In the Scudder series, Block writes in the first person, as Matt Scudder. Scudder is a retired cop, a recovering alcoholic, and an under-the-table private investigator. People hire him to \\"look into things\\". And as I wrote in my review of \\"Hard Stuff\\", most of the Scudder series touches on AA and its Step program. \\"Hard Stuff\\" was heavily into it and this book, \\"Long Line\\" also uses AA as a plot point. But the focus of this story is on a club - a private, secret men's group that meets yearly at a steakhouse in New York. The \\"Club of 31\\" meets to mark the march of life and death. Every year they enjoy a good meal, good drinks, good conversation, and list the men who have died since the club was formed. Then, when the club is down to the last man living, he chooses 30 young men to start the march all over again. The old list of names is destroyed and a new list of names begins as the 30 age. A long line of dead men.But the members seem to be dying off at a quicker rate than nature or accidents would account for. By the time Matt is hired to \\"look around\\", the club of 31 is down to 16 or so members. Scudder takes the case and begins a quiet search for who is knocking off the members. The only ones who know about the club are the members themselves, so suspicion is focused inward.Now, Lawrence Block is a master of dialog and conversation. Most of this book is written as conversation between the various characters - Scudder, his girlfriend, the club members, TJ, old friends who are cops and drinkers, etc. Each character is finely drawn and the information about them expands in Block's dialog.This is not a book for readers who want action. Neither is it so cerebral that it's in any way boring. Block is such a good writer that each page of this book is a treat. I thought it was the best mystery/detective book I'd read when I first read it years ago. I have no reason to change my mind about it now!"},{"Title":"Europe's Crumbling Myths: The Post-Holocaust Origins of Today's Anti-Semitism","review":"This book is an important human document. It is I believe essential reading not only for those who care about the Jewish people, but for those who care about the face and image of Humanity. Manfred Gerstenfeld, presently Chairman of the Board of Fellows of the Jerusalem Public Affairs Center, has interviewed a number of scholars and Jewish leaders and presented findings that support the contention that the recent upsurge in European anti- Semitism has strong roots in attitudes and actions in post- war Europe. He has also in the first half of the book provided a remarkable survey essay in which he comprehensively analyzes individual European countries relation to this issue.As one of the interviewees Professor Yehuda Bauer reminds ,\\" There is something unprecedented, frightening, about the Holocuast of the Jewish people... For the first time in the history of the human race, a decision developed in a modern state.in the midst of a civilized continent, to track down, register, mark, isolate from their surroundings, dispossess, humiliate, concentrate transport and murder every single person of an ethnic group, as defined not by them but by the perpetrators. Not just in the country where the monster arose, not just on the continent the monster first wished to control, but ultimately everywhere on earth, and for purely ideological reasons. There is no precedent for that'. This Holocaust or Shoah (the Biblical Hebrew term for it) involved the murder of over one- third of the Jewish people, approximately six- million people, one - and half million under the age of eighteen, and effectively eliminated or diminished to minimal numbers and significance the great share of European Jewish communities.The myth or the expectation that Gerstenfeld talks about is that the Europeans somehow learned the lesson of the Shoah, and presented a humane face to the Jews who had survived. In a well- researched and thorough analysis he country- by - country shows how this claim is more myth than actuality. The son of a distinguished Dutch Jewish communal leader Gerstenfeld knows the world of the Netherlands intimately. He exposes the Anne Frank story inspired myth that the Dutch were true protectors of the Jews. In fact the Germans relied on local Dutch personnel to help destroy seventy- four percent of Holland's Jewry, the largest percentage destroyed in any Western country. Gerstenfeld notes that it was Dutch collaborators who in fact turned Anne Frank in and led to her murder.Another country analyzed closely is Austria whose people so disproportionately were represented among the murderers. \\"Simon Wiesenthal claimed that the Austrians were involved in killing nearly half of the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Austrians represented 8% of the German population after the Anschluss; but they comprised 40% of the staff and 75% of the death camps. They were notoriously over-represented in the SS. The Austrian method of systematically robbing the Jews of all their possessions became a model for the German Nazis\\"p.54 The Austrians for years denied any part and responsibility claiming the present regime and people had no connection with their Fascist predecessor.Germany too, the architect and main perpetrator of the Holocaust has not as many believe made a wholly fundamental change in action and attitude as surveys of anti- Semitism among the population today clearly show.The stonewalling of various countries and groups in regards to the reparation issue is another major subject in the book. Often this stonewalling is accompanied by an effort to disparage those victims asking for reparations. Gerstenfeld cites the historian Ronald Zweig who shows how Jewish demands for reparations have been an important element in enabling other groups persecuted by the Nazis to receive compensation.In the second part of the work David Bankier describes in detail the cool reception Jews were given in post- war Europe. Ephraim Zuroff talks about the way most war- criminals lived long and protected lives untouched by the governments that should have prosecuted them. Yehuda Bauer argues forcefully for education on the Holocaust, and confutes the myth that research on it has been \` completed'. The courageous Deborah Lipstadt talks about the sin of trying to equate other far more minor injustices with the Holocaust. Nathan Durst analyzes the way a Europe psychologically unable to accept its part in the crime, moves toward a new way of blaming the Jews, this time the Israelis. Michael Melchior talks about Israeli government attitudes to a number of Shoah- related issues. Yair Sheleg discusses the often too insular Israeli media's attitude toward the difficulties of Diaspora Jews. Avi Beker destroys some of the myths around the restitution issue. Isaac Lipschitz shows how Dutch society discriminated against the victims. Naphtali Lavi in an aptly titled essay 'Fighting for Crumbs' talks about restitution and Eastern European governments. Laurence Weinbaum talks about post- war Poland and its changing attitudes. Shmuel Trigano considers post-war France, and Irwin Cotler discusses one of the major themes of the book, how post- war Anti- Semitism now takes the form of anti- Israel behavior, and how the disease of the extreme Right has become too the ailment of the extreme Left.This volume was written and published at a time when the \`New Anti -Semitism' is gaining ground in the world. The one Jewish state in the world, Israel is now subject to calls for its \` extinction' in something like the way the Nazis called for extinction of the Jewish people as a whole. If the would- be perpetrators now come from the radical Islamic world, and not from Europe it does not mean that European peoples do not have the responsibility to recognize the evils of their past, and stand in the forefront of those defending the Jewish state. That the opposite of this is now occurring and predominant European opinion tacitly supports the new anti- Semitic program is a chilling reminder of how History's evils do not disappear but often take new and horrendous form."},{"Title":"Europe's Crumbling Myths: The Post-Holocaust Origins of Today's Anti-Semitism","review":"The crumbling myths of the title are European remorse for the Shoah/Holocaust and its treatment of the survivors. On the surface antisemitism had disappeared from Europe towards the end of the 20th century. But the collapse of the Camp David talks in 2000 and the Second Intifada triggered an eruption of the plague that resembled the 1930s epidemic. The most visible results were violence against Jews and vandalism of their property in France, the UN's 2001 Conference against Racism in Durban that turned into a judeopathic hatefest with no protest from the European delegations and the start of the slow, almost imperceptible opinion shift of the mainstream left-liberal media. Then various opinion polls indicated that a majority of Europeans considered Israel a major threat to world peace and confirmed rising antisemitism amongst them.Behind these developments however, lie years of effort by the Arab World and the Extreme Left plus an uncomfortable fact: drastic demographic changes in Europe where the number of immigrants has surged whilst the policy of multiculturalism has failed. Muslim immigration to Europe brought Islamic antisemitism in contact with its western residues in the host societies.Raphael Israelireveals how the elemental antisemitism of Islam interacts with two residual varieties of the European tradition, that of the xenophobic Right & the anti-Zionist Left. Of course a pathology that festers for millennia is firmly embedded in the collective subconscious of a society. The recrudescence of European antisemitism seems to imply that it is impossible to eradicate the prejudice that is so deeply rooted in the communal psyche. The author/interviewer consulted fifteen experts in different disciplines from various countries in order to examine this mental virus that infects the Old World.In Part One, Gerstenfeld surveys the post WWII situation on a country-by-country basis. He employs, amongst others, the following criteria to determine the truth: the treatment of Jews after the war, the treatment of war criminals, reparations and restitution of property, Holocaust education, psychological rehabilitation and the interpretation of facts as memory versus truth. The results of the survey inspire nausea, particularly in the cases of Poland, Austria and Holland. Quotes from the writer Imre Kertesz reveal important aspects of antisemitism in Hungary. Today, Brussels, capital ofEurabia, emits a torrent of anti-Israel statements. And it turns out Denmark does not have such an unblemished record after all. The role of Switzerland's banks is scrutinized, the changing policies of the French government are charted and the strange dynamics in Greece are explored.Part Two includes contributions by Deborah Lipstadt on Holocaust Denial and attempts to equate it with other instances of injustice, Irwin Cotler who explains how antisemitism has mutated intoanti-Zionismand migrated from the Far Right to the Left and Nathan Durst who describes how Europe copes psychologically with its complicity in the Shoah by displacing its guilt onto Israel. Yehuda Bauer disputes the mantra that Holocaust research has been completed whilst calling for more education on the subject. Avi Beker and Naphtali Lavi both look at the restitution issue. Ephraim Zuroff discusses the lenient treatment of, or complete lack of action against war-criminals in countries like Sweden. The most recent assessment of Scandinavia is Gerstenfeld'sBehind the Humanitarian Mask. Other essays deal with the relationships between the Israeli media and Diaspora communities and aspects of post-war history in France and Poland.Since the 2003 publication of this book, matters have deteriorated alarmingly. The United Kingdom's BBC, Guardian, Independent and Observer and most left-leaning continental media continue their unbalanced reporting on the Middle East conflict while Sweden's Aftonbladet has revived themedieval blood libelin a piece of shoddy writing which the Swedish government refused to condemn, ostensibly owing to freedom of speech. Accusations against Israel are trumpeted but when disproved, there's virtually no effort to correct the impressions or apologize for the deception and/or incompetence of the media. That's why so few people are aware that both the Jenin \\"massacre\\" and the Ad-Doura affair were hoaxes.Stephanie Gutmannoffers more insight on the media war against Israel.The European Union is a two-faced beast. On the one hand it promotes anti-Zionism and its twin anti-Americanism while on the other it organizes conferences on antisemitism and commemorates the victims of the Holocaust. According toCaroline Glickthe cult of victim worship and the projection of guilt have led to Holocaust fetishization in Europe. She compares the memorials to the dead with the anti-Zionist agenda of the academic, media, political and religious elites. The dead are cherished whilst the sins of their murderers are being projected onto their surviving descendants. Despite Iranian threats to \\"wipe Israel off the map\\" and the ayatollocracy's open mockery of the negotiations that were meant to prevent it acquiring nuclear weapons, individual European countries carry on a roaring trade with the rogue state.InA State Beyond the PaleRobin Shepherd examines the battle of ideas between non-Muslim westerners about Israel, documenting in detail the expanding scope and influence of European opinion-formers' enmity towards the Jewish State. This animosity has spread from the far left to the mainstream liberal-left as confirmed by Bernard Harrison. Shepherd identifies the causes as Europe's civilizational exhaustion and its symptoms like the post-Holocaust guilt complex, embrace of pacifism, appeasement and relativism. The world wars and the continent's murderous salvationist ideologies have made the intelligentsia reject all frameworks like nationalism or religion.AsChantal Delsolobserves, a morality of complacency has deprived Europe of a system of ethics whilst promoting self-interest and subjectivity. That's why the Eurocrats scapegoat Israel whilst ignoring Putin's atrocities in Chechnya, human rights abuses amongst their own alienated communities and in the Arab World, and genocide in places like Darfur. Further information on Europe's antisemitic past and its current decline is available inMenace in Europeby Claire Berlinski, While Europe Slept by Bruce Bawer and Constantine's Sword by James Carroll."},{"Title":"Songs that Lift the Heart: A personal story and Then sings my soul (Double-Back)","review":"Blessed with a deep voice, George Beverly Shea sang on an amateur radio program which boosted his career to NBC and a nationwide audience.

A collection of essays, stories, memoirs and photographs all based around the theme of London, it contains works by such well-known authors as Anthony Bailey, Ian Buruma, Amit Chaudri, Hanif Kureishi, John Lanchester, Dale Peck, Will Self and Graham Swift plus articles by two writers for the Observer. Sandwiched in between all of these works are ten 'London Views', where various authors ruminate on their favorite or most memorable views in and about the city.Many of the essays are accounts of the author's memories of their time spent in London, as in the childhood memories of Ferdinand Dennis and Ruth Gershon or the more recent recollections by Ian Hamilton and Lucretia Stewart. My favorite part, however, was the short fiction, especially Philip Hensher's mysterious tale of real estate in the late '80s and Lanchester's quirky story about an accountant's experience of a bank robbery. I also enjoyed Helen Simpson's 'With a Bang,' an account of life in Kew in the age of Nostradamus, an appropriate addition to a volume published in 1999.The stories taken collectively give a really in-depth view of London at the turn of the century. Yet even if you're not interested in London per se, the writing here is good enough to warrant buying this anyway."},{"Title":"Loving in Time of War","review":"This volume contains poems previously reviewed in Desperate for a Clearing, States of Grace, and Doing Least Harm. The latter is also available from Amazon and has a independent review.As usual, Aliesan's poetry uses words sparsely and carefully, building sharp images which often are natural or mythical. In this volume, she shows herself to be equally at home with the urban and scientific.The poem she uses as a &quot;forepiece&quot; well illustrates her style: &quot;when the dark birds fly over / we stand and wave our arms / no don't come down here / meanwhile the birds / say look they need us / and we almost flew right by&quot;.The collection ranges over the shroud of Turin, horse training, heart arrhythmia, WW II, a history of Ireland, an urban psalm ... through it all one senses a gentle, socially conscience, spiritual alive poet.If you enjoy contemporary poetry, Jody Aliesan's work is worth noting."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Reading a book can be like going on a blind date. The air is full of questions, and, as you lay eyes on that first page, you may find yourself only mildly intrigued or full-tilt attracted.My first blind date with a Coben novel left me head over heels. I loved the pacing, the intricate plot, and most of all the attention to family and relationship. &quot;Gone for Good&quot; and &quot;Tell No One&quot; were masterpieces of suspense. &quot;No Second Chance&quot; felt a bit more contrived, but I still enjoyed it throughout.&quot;Just One Look&quot; is full of suspense, no doubt about it. The plot unfolds in all the right places. The characters react as might be expected. Yet, I felt as though I was taking apart a music box that had been robbed of its melody. Coben's family rhythms and song seemed muted. The plausibility of the scenario was strained. Sure, I was entranced by Grace's search to discover the truth behind her husband's disappearance and a decades-old photo, but I was not emotionally invested.That said, Coben is a master of the serpentine mystery. My love for his writing is steadfast. Next time around though, I hope his characters have a little more time to look me in the eye and draw me into their world. In this book-dating scenario, for me, it's all about relationship."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book held my attention for most of it. When I got round to the final chapters I almost put it aside but having invested time in reading it I continued to the end. I found the end confusing and not very satisfactory for that reason only three stars."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have been a Harlan Coben fan for quite a while now, and having read EVERY book he's written, discovered, through Amazon, there was one I had missed, one written a number of years ago. This is \\"Just One Look.\\" Very different from his others, and, unlike where I read for half an hour or so before going to sleep, this book kept me turning off the light, trying to sleep, turning the light back on, reading, and going through the whole process again until I had devoured it whole. Even the ending was as it should have been. I can't wait for the very next Coben to come along."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Great book. I have not read anything from him that I didn;t like. Always looking for the next one! He is a very talented author. If you like Dean Koontz, you will like him."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book is what we have come to expect from Harlan Coben - a mystery that wrenches in your guts, people you love unfortunately die, and just when you think you have the whole thing figured out he cuts a hard left that rolls you over into a new direction. I like these stand-alone novels a lot better than the Myron Bolitar series of books, and Coben is one of those authors who snares you pretty fast and has you thinking about the book even while you're not reading it. Well done, and I am looking forward to more!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"THE SETUPNominally, the principal characters are Grace and Jack Lawson, a pair of boring suburbanites--both with disturbing pasts, which it turns out, are linked. The story begins when Grace finds an old photo of Jack with three other young people, in a stack of freshly developed photos. When she shows it to Jack, he drives off, without even a goodbye. Then, while being tailed by a part-time private detective (Rocky Conwell), Jack is kidnaped by a psychotic professional assassin (Eric Wu).The background to the story begins 15 years earlier when Grace was nearly killed by a stampede at a rock concert, at which Johnny X was the lead singer. Wade LaRue was convicted for discharging a gun in the air at the concert. Mafioso chieftain Carl Vespa's son was one the the people killed by the stampede. Gordon McKinsey, a security guard at the concert, was hailed as a hero. Coincidentally, Jack and all of his friends other than Jeri Duncan went into hiding shortly after the concert. Shortly after discovering that she was pregnant, Jeri was killed in a fire. It was while in hiding (in France) that Jack met Grace.The events of the novel are set in motion by three independent events: LaRue will shortly be released on parole. McKinsey (who has become a police captain) is dying of cancer. Monte Scanlan (a professional assassin) confesses to Scott Duncan (Jeri's brother) that he had set the fire to kill her. In the coarse of the novel, the young people in the photo are identified and located (dead or alive), with the exception of the mysterious Shane Alworth who has not been seen for 15 years. Without revealing any spoilers, the rest of the story is about Grace's metamorphosis into a detective who (with the assistance of her friend Cora Lindley) uncovers Jack's past, and of course, Jack's incarceration and ultimate escape.COMMENTSThis is a pure mystery novel, featuring multiple mysteries. In addition to perhaps a dozen essential characters (few of which are fleshed-out), the novel features about two dozen \\"accessory characters\\", some well developed, some not. Virtually all of these \\"accessory characters\\" could be deleted with no effect on the story whatsoever. The development of these accessory characters may seem to the reader to be a waste of time--and a waste of the reader's time. Actually, these accessory characters are subtle \\"red herrings\\". That is, the reader has no way to know which of these characters will (or will not) emerge as significant characters. The extent that a character is developed is NOT an indication of his/her ultimate importance in the story. Indeed, new significant characters ARE introduced late in the novel. Each of the numerous characters provides additional opportunities for misdirection, and indeed, shadows of suspicion are cast on many of them.Such a pure mystery novel requires red herrings and other misdirection. Coben has chosen to provide the red herrings and misdirection subtly, which is less annoying to than stories with just one or two major red herrings, or excessively strong misdirection. As a pure mystery novel, \\"Just one Look\\" it is very well crafted. It will keep you guessing until the very end. Mystery novels can be unsatisfying if the reader guesses wrong about the bad guy. No chance of that with \\"Just one Look\\".CAVEATSThe novel begins with a sequence of three completely unrelated chapters, each with a completely new and different cast of characters Practically speaking, the story actually begins with the sixth chapter, by which time many readers may have decided to find something else to read. Such \\"front loading\\" of rip-rap is a common feature of mystery novels. Whether or not this is a successful strategy may depend on the reader's tastes. Caveat, the first three paragraph of this review can serve to provide the essential connections if you haven't read the novel yet.This is not a book to be read casually--i.e., one or two chapters, every few days. It requires your full attention and concentration. Taking notes is probably a good idea. The novel is especially difficult for audiobook readers, who cannot easily \\"flip back\\" several chapters to refresh their memories , and who normally do not have access to a summary or an annotated cast of characters. But that is probably true of all mystery novels. Perhaps the real lesson is that mystery fans should stick to printed versions.It may be a personal bias, but I found myself unable to relate to the main character (Grace), and therefore I had little sympathy for her plight. Jack is only a cut-out generic \\"victim\\" of little interest. Eric Wu, the psychotic killer, is just too much of a demonic monster. A number of other potentially fascinating accessory characters are introduced, leaving the reader frustrated wondering why such an interesting character was not developed. Many or most of these appearances are cameos from earlier Coben novels.The very last twist is excessively contrived. Nominally, the photo was simply a generic photo of Jack and three friends. The twist turns on the assumption (for which no basis is given) that the photo was taken at the concert.VERDICTGiven the significant caveats above, the story is fast paced and compelling, with interesting characters."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I did not understand the ending to this book. There, I said it.Now, I do understand how it turned out. I just don't get how we got there. There are so many hidden motives, masked identities and dark secrets that you practically need a flow chart to keep track. Seriously, you will probably enjoy this book more if you take notes, write down names and facts and then draw arrows.Wu was too much of a robokiller. Liked Charmain a lot.Harlan can write a tense scene, like when Wu accosts and kidnaps Grace in the schoolyard, not knowing she has a gun strapped to her ankle.This is my fourth Coben and I will continue to read his work. Next time, though, I'll have pad and pencil ready."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This has to be one of the best suspense thrillers I have ever read. There were so many twists and turns in this one, I felt like I was on a roller coaster. The surprises kept coming right up until the very last page. The story begins when Grace Lawson picks up a newly developed set of family photos and discovers a picture that doesn't belong. A picture taken about 20 years ago with a man in it who looks like her husband, Jack. Jack denies her suspicions but vanishes into the night taking the photo with him. Thus begins a journey for Grace who is trying to figure out who is really in the photo and where is her husband? I have never read a book by Harlan Coben before. I am going to put every book he has written on my wishlist."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"The plot was fun and interesting, and could have been done in about 70 pages. The rest of the book was mindless filler.For instance, he describes exactly how Grace tricks her son into eating more fruit and less cereal by sneaking more and more banana into his dish. What does this have to do with the story? Quite frankly, I think he hired a housewife somewhere to fill in the pages between the 70 relevant ones. I had to skim about 40% of it. It's sad when pressure from the publisher makes good writers turn out drivel."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"i've read all of harlan coben's books, and while just one look is not his best, it's certainly a fast-paced read. the novel is a bit far-fetched and not as well grounded as his previous works, but the pace will have you finished rather quickly. needless to say i'll still look forward to coben's future works."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have read most of Coben's books and particularly enjoyed &quot;Tell No One&quot; and &quot;No Second Chance&quot;.In fact, I was so excited I ordered an autographed copy immediately upon learning of the book.I made a mistake. This book is very shallow and just not of the caliber of previous efforts.After 50 pages or so, I realized things would not likely get better and that proved to be accurate. In previous books, you can hardly wait to turn the page and hope the book never ends.In this one, you debate whether to turn a page or close the book.Just One Look is a good title, take a look and pass it by."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This is my first Harlan Coben novel and though it was a page-turner at first it became improbable very quickly.By the end of the novel it seemed as though the author needed to wrap it up but he had forgotten how many sub-plots he had created. I was left confused and unsatisfied. It was almost as if a few pages had been ripped out of the book and I never got a plausible answer as to how everything fit together.It's so hard to find a good author nowadays!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I had to force myself to finish this monstrosity. The storyline involving a strange photograph seemed like a good one at the start, but the nonsense about a riot at a rock concert years ago just didn't grab my attention the way the author intended. Sorry, just didn't work for me. I found the end of the story ridiculous too."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"What can a woman do when her world is suddenly turned upside down, when everything and everyone once safe is now imperiled? That's the question posed by bestselling author Harlan Cohen in his latest thriller, &quot;Just One Look.&quot;Coben's not a newbie at the game of suspense having taken home an Edgar Award, the Shamus Award, and the Anthony Award. His tales are complexly plotted and compelling as attested to by &quot;No Second chance&quot; and &quot;Gone For Good.&quot; He packs a knock-out punch and leaves readers wanting more.Speaking of knock-out punches - two more are delivered by able readers. Carolyn McCormick, who delivers the abridged version, has multiple stage, screen and TV appearances to her credit. She's the voice of a woman pushed to the edge to protect her children.A singer and spoken-word performer, Carrington MacDuffie, voice of the unabridged editions brings a wide range of vocal experience to her performance, imbuing it with passion and pathos.With &quot;Just One Look&quot; listeners meet Grace Lawson who has picked up a recently developed set of family snapshots. She's surprised to find one photo that she doesn't fully recognize - there are five people in the photo, one of whom appears to be her husband. Where did this picture apparently taken some 20 years ago come from?Her husband, Jack, denies any knowledge of the snapshot saying he's not the man in it. Yet, late that night he drives off with the photograph. There is no note for Grace who has no idea where he went or why he left.As the days pass she finds no help from the police or friends. Yet, it becomes increasingly obvious that she is not the only one looking for Jack. Unknown others pursue him as Grace searches for answers, any answers in order to protect her children.&quot;Just One Look&quot; is Harlan Coben at the height of his powers - a terrific listen."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Coben may have left his &quot;series&quot; detective stories behind -- but he has written all four of his &quot;stand alone&quot; mysteries following a formula as familiar as the world of an oft revisted detective. &quot;Gone For Good&quot;, &quot;No 2nd Chance&quot;, &quot;Tell No One&quot; and &quot;Just One Look&quot; all have common plot threads.#1 Coben Plot Device: Missing immediate family member and frantic search for him/her -- #2: A marriage or significant romantic relationship torn apart -- #3: Menacing inhuman hit man -- #4: Suburban New Jersey setting with tons of local references for Jersey/NYC readers -- #5: Close relative with an agenda the protagonist knows nothing about -- #6: A mob related character who may not or may not be as evil as he seems....The list really goes on.While some common elements from book to book can be expected -- Coben is simply mining the same territory and shuffling details to tell something close to the same story each time.Still, I have to say -- I did not completely predict the ending of this novel and that is to Coben's credit. However, without giving final outcome away I will say that many readers -- especially female mystery readers -- will not be satisfied with the conclusion of this book.Kudos here for creating a female protagonist with the normal soccer Mom issues -- instead of the usual lone wolf female hero seen in so many detective/suspense novels.Too bad she is knee deep in so many plot detours and convolutions.Coben is still a cut above the average mystery writer -- but faithful readers will not find anything new in this latest offering. It simply doesn't live up to his previous novels."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"this is my first coben book. it is faced-paced and kept me hooked ,until about the last 1/4 of it. became very complicated and somewhat difficult to follow. and in the end, you are still left with questions."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Right from the beginning, you get hooked on the story line. The mystery keeps expanding as more information comes to light. The plot does get very complicated but that's the type of story I enjoy. I couldn't put this book down! Luckily, I was on vacation and had the time to read it in short order - otherwise, I would have been getting very little sleep until finished it. The characters are likeable and fairly realistic. The story telling is top-notch - not a lot of bomb-fog written to make a small story fill up a full-sized book. I recommend it to anyone that likes a good story that keeps you wondering what's going on."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Harlan Coben once during an impromptu book signing and I am glad I did. I am still new to mysteries (being a mainly sci-fi/fantasy reader) but reading his work has been nothing but great pleasure.I have noticed that he is truly a master of the twist, that is, the unexpected hitting you full force just when you think you have figured it all out. I read this novel within four hours and was not disappointed in the least. It all starts with a photograph found by a suburban wife while picking up her children from school. From there begins a story involving an ice cold Asian assassin, a husband who is more than meets the eye, and a 15 year old rock concert that changed the lives of everyone within the novel. This novel, like so many of his others novels, kept me guessing to the very end.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This is my second Harlan Coben book and i'm still undecided if I enjoyed this as I did the first one I read (Tell No One). I agree the plot of the book started out great and I was pretty much hooked, wanting to know - who are these people in the picture, why was 'Jack' taken etc. Though threw out the book i was waiting to find out whats going on; but he seem to have left almost EVERYTHING for the last pages. So I have to agree when some people said some things could have been left out. He definitely could've gotten to the point a lot faster than he did. Though all in all the ending story line was good. Though i'm hoping the next Harlan Coben book I read will be somewhat more entertaining like \\"Tell No One\\"."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Very tight plot; very tense and the Wu character was the scariest in quite a while. Hope I never run into him.Overall, there was too much description of mundane things (feeding kids breakfast and dwelling too much on it) but overall a fairly good read.

Try Dennis Lehane also!!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Before we go any further, can someone please define the current definition of \\"best-seller\\"? After the last three or four \\"best-sellers\\" I've barely managed to finish, the line is looking a little blurry. Does an editor get to look at any of these books? I don't think so, judging from the college-level writing, punctuation and just plain silly plot-lines. Are we to believe that all the foo-fah-rah described in this \\"book\\" is over a stolen song? Heartless hench-men paralyzing and killing innocent people? Frustrated housewives chasing after the aformentioned assassin? Mafia Dons strutting through the story? All this for a stolen song? After fighting my through all the pages of trite dialogue and \\"won't someone think of the children\\" baloney... a stolen song? Puh-leeze!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson has the stereotypical North American dream life ... a good husband, a happy marriage, two well adjusted children, a lovely home and a successful career as an admired artist that actually generates enough income for her to consider herself prosperous. Her world, metaphorically travelling at a comfortable pace down Main Street, suddenly accelerated into a curve and took a high speed turn on two wheels into a threatening narrow dark alley on the day she found a twenty year old photograph mysteriously tucked into a package of newly developed shots she had just picked up at the camera shop. The old photo portrays a group of young friends, one of whom appears to be her husband as a much younger man. When she asks him about it, he hotly denies it, clearly covering up something. He leaves the house and promptly disappears without a trace.In \\"Just One Look\\" Harlan Coben takes his readers on a roller-coaster ride through a Byzantine complex plot as Grace searches for her missing husband. His writing is breathlessly urgent. The tension is palpable and the compulsion to turn the pages is quite unavoidable. But somehow, after all was said and done, the novel failed to completely satisfy.Psychedelic drugs and stampedes at a crowded 1960s rock concert, a ruthless near invincible Ninja style hit man, a Mafia Don with a soft spot in his heart for Grace's predicament, police who don't believe that her husband has disappeared at all, plagiarism and theft of song royalties - it's difficult to imagine what else beside the kitchen sink that Coben could have tossed into this plot! Another reviewer suggested that Coben told an intriguing story that was as \\"complex as a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle, but never confusing\\". Frankly, I disagree. The plot was convoluted and I felt it took considerable concentration to hold the threads together and to keep the entire story intact.I enjoyed the novel but, personally, I like my thrillers to be just a little less effort and a little more brainless enjoyment. Here's the suggestion - if you're looking for PURE brain candy, this isn't your book! If you're looking for mental stimulation and you like a great suspense thriller as well, this is probably a cup of tea that will warm your heart.Recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I just got done reading the book just one look by Harlan Coben and i have to say its a book that kept me reading and reading till the very end. ITs a book that you won't want to put down. Trust me its worth your money. This is the first book by Harlan Coben that i have Read and i am going to read some more in the future. Hope you do to and enjoy it especially this book."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I enjoyed this thriller because I found it a bit different from the usual serial killer story or police procedural. The plot centers on an event that happened years in the past, which not surprisingly provokes consequences in the lives of the main characters in the present. And the ending is a real surprise, unlike many novels of this sort.I'm often able to figure out the twists and turns of a novel's plot, but this ending really blind-sided me, and for that reason alone I'm giving it 4 stars. If you're looking for a diverting paperback to read on vacation this summer, Just One Look will fill the bill nicely."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This is another of Harlan's fast-paced, page-turning stories. I loved the strong character of Grace but the bad guys were flat and stereotypical and the story seemed overly-complicated.

Until she realizes that one of the men in the picture is her husband and that the photograph in question was taken at least fifteen years ago. After Grace confronts her husband with the picture he suddenly flees their home leaving Grace and their two children with a lot of questions. When the police wont help her, Grace must dig into the past and find a way to bring her husband home but as she soon finds, there are so many secrets in both her and her husband Jack's past that their whole marriage may be based on a lie.With a dangerous killer after her and others looking to unearth the mystery of that photograph Grace must race against time and look deeply into not only her husbands past but her own as well in order to uncover the truth and stop this killer before he harms Jack, herself and most importantly her children.\`JUST ONE LOOK' kept me up late into the night trying to finish this fast paced thriller. And while I highly recommend, well anything by Harlan Coben really, I did not give \`JUST ONE LOOK' my usual Coben five star rating. This is because there was so much going on in the last 30 pages or so that it got a little jumbled. Nonetheless, this is definitely another great novel by Coben, 4 stars!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This was my first Harlan Coben book and it was a page turner in that I was compelled to find out how all the strands of the story fit together. However, the book was frustrating in parts where Coben would digress into the minutiae of some of the characters lives and their thought processes; I just wanted him to get on with the plot.The opening of the book grabbed my attention, but after a time the introduction of character after character was too much; I was thankful that Beatrice Smith didn't make an appearance. I felt let down and disappointed when I finished the book. There was this sense of 'Is that it? Was that all it was about?'"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"An odd and ultimately somewhat unsatisfying mystery. Grace Lawson picks up her photos and finds a 20+ year old photo of her husband in the pack. He sees it - and disappears.After being rebuffed by the police, Grace sets out to find him. She has help from an odd assortment of characters. An assistant federal district attorney. A reputed mobster. All are tied to her by a decades old incident.The characters are reasonably well developed, but still never become compelling. The plot takes one twist after another, some of them predictable, some not. The ending struck me as contrived.It's not a bad book; it's just far from a totally engrossing read. And, as noted, it on the unsatisfying side. Kind of like a barely passable lunch: it all looks good on the plate, but simply doesn't taste quite right.Jerry"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Here we have a novel with an already played out story line. A happy homemaker gets a surprise package in her photo of her hubby with old college buddies. He leaves and is kidnapped. The happy homemaker suddenly gathers more guts and courage than originally depicted in the first part of the book as she jumps head first into finding her hubby. Coben fans are probably thinking about now, \\"Didn't that happen in No Second Chance?\\"Anyway, the happy homemaker goes through a rather deep and dark world in her journey to recover hubby and joins forces with such characters as a mobster in an attempt to find him. From there, the plot takes so many twists and turns that you will need a map and a scorecard to keep track. I don't know if the author felt that the simple storyline needed to be complicated or such a complicated tale needed a simple storyline. Either way, the last pages is like a debrief as the author brings together so many loose ends.I like this author, but I think he needs to take a step back and find a new direction in his storylines. So many times, writers get caught up in the \\"if it worked once, it will work again\\" pattern. Still, the book is enjoyable and a recommended read."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Borrowed from the local library... I loved this novel!

So, it's a little far fetched - aren't they all? At least I didn't see the ending coming a mile away like with other mystery novels.

Loved it!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I love the male-female way Coben writes. The thriller action bits are male, while the emotional stronghold the books have over the reader can only be seen as female. A winning combination!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This the most suspenseful and intriguing book of Coben's that I've read to date. From the first page onward, this is a page turner that you struggle to put down. It will keep you up late reading. A gripping element is that the main character is a more or less, typical mother and wife who works from home as an artist. She is living a normal life after recovering from a horrible accident 15 years earlier. Then a strange event occurs and her husband disappears. Readers are introduced to a twisting mystery that is not fully disclosed until the end. Through the plot, you will be wondering what the truth is. The characters run the gamut from a nosy neighbor, a vicious killer, a mob boss, questionable friends, and mystery relatives. I can't imagine how Coben hatched this idea but it is captivating. The only downside is that there is a little scratching your head when it is all over."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I couldn't put it down.

Sure, it is not on the level of Gone For Good or Tell No One or a lot of the Myron Bolitar stuff, but what is? I think our expectations for Coben are so high that we naturally rate this one too low. I agree that the plot is a little bit too complex. I like having a clear idea of what happened at the end, and I do, but I feel like I needed to take notes and draw diagrams on a board in order to fully understand everything.

I enjoyed it, but it did not enthrall me the way his last four books have. I still look forward to his books in the future."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben's new book &quot;Just One Look&quot;, like his earlier work, is hard to put down. His style is compelling and his heroine, in this story, could be you, watching and wondering as the comfortable life you inow and love disappears in an instant.The tangle of characters in &quot;Just One Look&quot; starts with husband and wife, Jack and Grace Lawson. Grace is semi-famous as the survivor of a tragic stampede at a rock concert, where 18 people were killed when an out of control crowd tried to escape gunshots. The tragedy is known as &quot;The Boston Massacre&quot; and Grace still limps due to her injuries in the melee.The Massacre haunts the parents and loved ones of those who died and Grace knows that the disappearance of her husband one night is somehow connected with her past. She can't help but feel responsible for Jack being missing, since she showed him an old photograph of 5 people; the picture mysteriously appeared in the most recent package of photos she had processed at the local Photomat.Jack's in the photo, but Grace doesn't know the identity of the others...Coben follows her efforts to find the truth about the picture, and to find Jack. Over time, she learns that the others have been tainted by tragedy, have disappeared, or have lost their own lives. In trying to solve the mystery, Grace enlists a mob connection, Carl Vespa, whose son died in the Massacre, local police and attorneys who are all somehow connected to the photograph. Serial-killer-for-hire Eric Wu (who appeared in Coben's &quot;Tell No One&quot;) is the key to deaths and disappearances. Grace is able to follow the thread, while trying to keep her small children safe.Although I was taken with the tension and the mystery of the plot, I was sorely disappointed at the overall quality of the book. Coben seems caught, in his last four works, with a tangle of spouses with mysterious pasts and present disappearances. Although I could not guess the outcomes of this particular thriller, (they remain vague and unsettling, then tumble out of the final chapter) neither was I very interested in the motivations of the characters or the secrets from the past.Coben needs to incorporate his tension-filled style with a new and more unique plotline in order to keep the audience he's built since he stopped writing his &quot;humor-thriller&quot; series about sports agent Myron Bolitar. In &quot;Just One Look&quot; he gives us great pacing, but then dumps the outcomes one after another in the final chapter. There's not enough new here to be wildly enthusiastic, but I'm not ready to give up on Coben just yet. Still, &quot;Just One Look&quot; could have been titled, &quot;Same Old, Same Old&quot;."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I became a Coben fan after reading _Tell No One_ &amp; (my favorite!) _Gone For Good_. In _Just One Look_, Coben continues his husband-and-wife-something-in-the-past story line (to say nothing of his bright-colored book covers/jackets)--although it (story line) is not as (barring believable) magnetic. However, there is the &quot;Cobin-ending,&quot; but nothing as gripping as the two previous books. Futher frustrating, there are too many characters directly (or indirectly) involved in the protagonist's struggle to find the truth--(the past and her husband), which complicates and obfuscates the plot. Always Cobin, though, leave it to him to pen stimulating end-of-chapter hooks, just enough to MAKE you turn the page...and another....Nothwithstanding the three stars, I quasi-enjoyed reading it &amp; would recommend this novel, but only AFTER reading (in this order) _Gone For Good_ &amp; _Tell No One_, both of which I assigned 5 stars."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Had to put it down after just the first couple of chapters. Will probably throw it away. Typographical, grammatical, and expositional errors were so numerous that they became a complete distraction to enjoying the story. This novel is very poorly written and it appears that it was not edited at all.I do not recommend it, and I hate to give it the one star rating that I gave it."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book will have u on the edge of the chair craving for the next page ..I started reading it at work ...bad idea.. I couldnt put this book down .The plot is very well developed I particularly like the fact the writer make this story as human as possible sharing weaknesses and doubts of the characters the same I had as I was reading ,basically as the story unraveled i had all my questions answered,I dont find this book unrealistic ,psychos exists and well planned crimes aswell ...The end is sort of disappointing but I have to say I really enjoyed this book ,Harlan Coben is on my favorites list after this."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Very good, solid effort. Intricate story, interesting. This is a real book. Coben is a very interesting writer, good to read.I read and rate 8 to10 books in this genre each month. I rate each book based on a 0-5 point scale. This book rated as follows: Characters: 3.50. Realism: 3.00. Description: 3.50. Ah Ha: 3.00. The Read: 4.00 Overall, the book ranked 93 out of 364 books."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I picked up one day and finished the next (and I'm not a fast reader). Mr. Coben gives his usual twists, turns, subplots and false leads. He does a reasonably good job of fleshing out the characters (for a thriller/ mystery). He keeps you guessing until the end. No deep thoughts just a MIND NUMBING THRILL RIDE. Perfect for summer."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I loved this book, I couldn't not put it down. I have read all of Harlan Coben's books and am a huge fan of all of them. His reoccuring character, Myron Bolitar, is missing from this novel but still has many characters that will no doubt keep your interest. I have passed this book along to friends and it has made them fans of Coben also...definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I read this book in one night-I work in a library and everyone that has read it have given it 5 stars.

It was a page turner from start to finish. Full of plot twists and cliffhangers, the book will really captivate any reader who likes thrillers. And, it is an easy read...the main plot isn't too complicated and unlike some other thrillers, there aren't too many sub-plots to try to follow. Coben has done it again!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"If you are looking for a synopsis of this book, you can read the previous hundred plus reviews, they all did a good job. Well, all the other five star reviews, anyway. If you are just looking for a recommendation of this book, or any other book by this author, I'll say this...Go ahead and purchase any, really any, book by Harlan Coben, you won't be disappointed. My only disappointment is that this is the last Harlan Coben book that I hadn't read yet and as far as I know he doesn't have another one coming out anytime soon. The reason why I kept this one on the back burner was, in part because of some previous reviews that stated that this novel was only mediocre.I'm not a published author, an English professor, or a real academic type, so if there is sloppy writing, or gross errors in style, living in the pages of Just One Look, as another reviewer has mentioned, I (average Joe reader) didn't notice them. In fact, even if there were errors, I would have been too busy trying to figure out the mystery and enjoying every word on every page to notice much else, which also includes husbands, kids, dogs, and TV.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"DOT is back. I just flew across the country, so I had to find a book to read. Well, I read this book by accident. I picked up Haren Cohen because of a friend's recommendation. When I called the friend who recommended Cohen, he said he never read Cohen's books. He actually recommended Harold Coyle. Oh well, it doesn't matter. The book was excellent. It grabs you from the beginning. The suspense of who did what and why keeps you turning the page. The author gives you just enough along the way before the truth comes out. I can pretty much tell you that no one will guess the finish. The author twisted and turned each character so that you might guess one or two mysteries, but not all. That is the reason why I liked the book. I kept guessing and the surprise was on me. Some stated that this was an unrealistic story. Well, I don't see it being that improbable and who cares if chances of this happening is small. It is a fictional book. Overall, the book was fast pace, page turner. The storyline was great and it was entertaining (especially during my flight across the country. I finished the book during the flight). I recommend this book to anyone who got few hours to kill. Hope this helped. My next book is \\"The Last Templar\\" by Raymond Khoury. Until then, DOT out!!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I went back to the first few chapters 8 or 9 times. Who Cora was really? Monte who? What was the name of the hit from the Jimmy X Band?Now here's the good news. It's vintage Coben, interesting, in some instances riveting, with excellent plot development, and par for the course, good dialogue. But in the words of Cram, 'I got two problems.'Grace goes to get her kids. Grace is a suburban Mom. OK, A little eccentric. Not a professional Mom. And she stops at the Fotomat. The Customer service Dude is one of those self important teenagers who treat you like an idiot that you know ought to be taken out in the alley and beaten, just because.Come on. You're lying if you don't know what I mean.Grace picks up the pics from the kid's apple orchard trip, and is stunned to find a picture of 5 kids from a college 10 - 15 years ago in the center of the pack. Well, if she is stunned, Jack, her husband, acts like he's seen a ghost. And then disappears. Grace, who truly loves Jack, is then left clueless. And the bodies start to pile up. OK. I digress. Here are the problems.Sooooooo many people. Martial arts psychos. Mobsters. Dumb policemen. Smart policemen. Bored housewives. Really, with Coben you're always going to get a lot of characters thrown at you. But here . . . let me tell you. One reviewer said she had to write down the characters. Word.Secondly. What doesn't compute for me (and Mr. Coben has done this before) is to get you to believe in the honesty, fidelity and love of a marriage, and then develop one or two INCREDIBLE SECRETS that you just think wouldn't exist if they really loved eachother. I mean if you have confidence in a character on the outside of the plot and he turns out to be, well, a nutcase, OK. But if the whole purpose of the story is that YOU CAN COUNT ON . . . and then you can't, well, you'll understand. Good stuff. You won't be disappointed. But \\"The Inocent\\" is, I believe, substantially better. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Wow! This book had my head spinning! The twists held up right to the very end!Grace picks up photos one day and in the family pictures, she finds one that looks to be about 20 years old and her husband Jack is in it.

This book will not leave you hanging if you want a great thrill ride."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I haven't read a good mystery in awhile, but I picked this up and flew through the book in a weekend, renewing my interest in the genre. Sure, tying all those loose associations up together was a little far fetched but this was a great read. I've been reading too much NY Times and not enough books."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Just One Look is the latest paperback available from thriller-writer Harlan Coben. If you aren't familiar with his work, maybe you saw the movie One False Move, featuring Billy Bob Thornton and Bill Paxton? That unforgettable film was based on the fifth title in his backlist, although I'm not sure how closely the film mirrors the author's vision. Anyways, back to the review...Usually, Coben's tight plots appear innocent at the outset. Grace Lawson, -- a suburban New Jersey wife -- picks up a packet of photos from the hipster clerk at the local Photomat, and upon arrival home, she finds a mysterious snapshot tucked away inside the envelope. While it puzzles her (it seems 15 years old) the copy also intrigues her, and she actually makes a return trip to the developer to inquire about it. The picture is of a group of five people, one with their back to the camera. There's also a blonde in the photo, her face scratched over with a razor blade. And one of the band guys standing in the print is quite unmistakably her husband! Still, while the presence of the odd shot mixed in with the others inside the wrapper irritates her, she won't get rattled over it until much later in the wee hours of the morning.Sometime after arriving home and putting the kids to bed, husband Jack runs across the curious photo she accidentally left on the kitchen counter. Then she starts to quiz him about it upon noting his alarm, and he becomes evasive. Grace worries that she's nagging him, but then she starts to realize how little she really knows about his past. At least the part of it from before their marriage. Jack sequesters himself in his office with his cell phone, for thirty minutes, to avoid her prying questions. Then, after he's finished on the phone, he jumps into the mini-van, without speaking to Grace again, leaving hastily in the dead of night. Stranger still, he's taken the odd photo with him and disappeared!This one plotline -- alone -- would make for an interesting novel, but then Coben crams in a serial killer (Eric Wu) involved with organized crime, a cruelly disfigured limo driver with a sunny disposition towards children, a mobster named Vespa whose son was trampled to death at a concert, a nosy Ho-Ho-Kus mother named Charlaine that's interested in her accountant neighbor, a veteran police captain named Perlmutter, a mass-media spectacle, and a famous former rock star, named Jimmy X. Coben also goes the extra mile, giving all his characters very complicated back stories and secrets that they don't want divulged. The wonderful thing about this book however, is that the author can even keep all the plotlines stitched together for so long.Only problem with Just One Look is this -- the action peaks way too soon, and there's too much aftermath. It takes Coben 53 extra pages of exposition just to explain away what happened, who did it, what their motivations were, and why. I can't personally think of any other way he could have written it off, but I do think the climax should've appeared closer to the end of the book. While this paperback kept me hooked the majority of the time, the ending lacked a certain oomph, therefore I'm somewhat dismayed, giving it only 3.8 out of 5 possible stars.New readers of Harlan Coben should take note that the bad guy in Just One Look is actually a carry-over from a previous novel, Tell No One, where he was first introduced. Having discovered that fact, I plan to go back and read that installment. Litfans should also note, this book is not part of Coben's popular Myron Bolitar series, said series being based on a real person.Endings aside, I have just two questions for Mr. Coben. Where do you come up with all the memorable ideas? And, do they just materialize in your head... while you're jogging?[...]"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"As usual Harlan Coben has written an amazing mystery with lots of twists and turns that lead to a satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"When Grace Lawson picks up a packet of family photos from the developer,she finds a strange photo of a group of young people posed, including one who looks like her husband, years before they had ever met. When she questions her husband about the photo, he brushes off her enquiry and leaves the house. After a couple of days, she reports him missing, believed kidnapped. Fifteen years previously, Grace had been present at a rock concert when a stoned out young man fired a shot which caused a general panic. Eighteen people were killed in the crush and Grace herself was badly injured, leaving her with a permanent limp.Whilw she was recovering, she was befriended by the families of the victims, including a gangster whose son was killed and who assures Grace that he would be there for her if she ever needed help.She contacts him and the plot continues to thicken, with several sinister characters appearing, and this is where the story began to muddle for me, as the situation grew more and more involved and unlikely. The finale takes ages to explain as the threads of the story were sooo involved. It was all too hard!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book hooks you in from the very first sentence until the captivating ending. It's an easy read without excessive descriptive wordage, but with analogies that we all can relate to on a daily basis. This is a must read!!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"When a mysterious photo appears in Grace Lawson's holiday snaps she is completely unprepared for the effect it will have on her life. It's an old photo and one of the people in it looks a lot like her husband, even though he denies it's him. However, when her husband disappears only moments after seeing it, the only thing she can think of that may be related is the photo.Grace takes on the role of investigator after failing to convince the police that her husband may not have left willingly. The ensuing hunt becomes increasingly desperate and Grace has the added burden of caring for her two young children while fighting off the feeling that she's all alone in her search. The questions she has to answer, where is her husband and why has one of the faces in the photo been obliterated by an X?The presence of an assassin named Eric Wu, first introduced to scare the pants off us in TELL NO ONE, adds a certain level of unbridled terror to the story. Eric Wu is a martial arts expert, specialising in incapacitating or killing his victims simply by attacking pressure points on the body. He is a man completely devoid of emotion, effectively a killing machine and a formidable opponent. He has been hired to eliminate the people in the photo and it looks as though nothing's going to stop him.As the investigation unfolds, we begin to find out more about Grace's past which is cunningly woven into her current crisis. The addition of a few menacingly dangerous characters like the enigmatic Cram and his boss Carl Vespa provides an added surreal dimension to the story. The obviously dangerous Wu and the violence exuded by Cram sets the scene for a tantalising showdown.Harlan Coben has once again produced a thrill-ride of a book with unexpected twists, unlikely heroes and an unusual outcome at the end. His new speciality of books about marriages in which secrets come back to haunt the spouses is continued here and it works just as well her as it did in his first stand-alone, TELL NO ONE."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I looked forward to Harlan Coben's new book and I thought it was interesting and I love any book with plot twists galore. The only negative is that it was not as funny as his other books. Maybe he was trying to make the female character more serious than his other main characters in previous books. I will still read all of his future novels as he is my favorite new author."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I'll dispense with the plot summary: you can read it elsewhere on the page, and since this is a Harlan Coben book, none of the threads will make any sense until the last pages anyway.Coben writes twisted thrillers. His usual device is to have something in the lead characters past break out with deadly consequence. Coben makes this work by treating memory not as a series of photographs, but like holograms: change your angle of view a little, and an entirely new picture emerges.I liked this book (I listened to the unabridged audio edition), but found it more confounding than usual for his work. Having the protagonist a woman was a nice change; using multiple points of view for the narrative was not. I didn't particularly care to go through all of Eric Wu's analysis of each situation: he's established as a man of action, so let's just keep up the pace shall we? Also the periodic asides of having Grace fret over her parenting foibles - like letting her children play \\"Gameboy\\" too much - seem ludicrous while they are pursued by killers. It's almost as if he's expecting criticism from the PC crowd. Maybe that's what you have to do to include children in your novels today.I was also somewhat disappointed in the explanations. The motive seemed a little out of balance for the levels of deception involved and the body count. And when I say (spoiler alert!) there was no one left to root for at the end, I mean it.By all means, read some Coben novels; but don't lead off with this one."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I loved the old Myron Bolitar Series. Read \\"Deal Breaker\\" or \\"Drop Shot\\" to see Coben at his best. Just my opionion (and maybe my taste. I hope he brings them back."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Just One Look is everything you look for in a suspense novel. It departs from others of its type by making the protaganist an ordinary person living an ordinary life. If you love thrillers, but are tired of police procedurals, this book will give you that fix. Book was fast paced and well written. I couldn't put it down. I like that this is a stand alone novel, making it unnecessary to read previous works. After reading this, however, I will certainly check out his other bestsellers. This book has twists at the end that I never saw coming. As soon as you discover the twist, you are given another one. My only critique is with the editor. I noticed several gramatical errors that should have been picked up. I still highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Although it's tough to write, I was a disappointed in Just One Look. I'm a huge fan of Harlan Coben. I've read all his books including his first two before the Myron series that are out of print. Someone Just One Look seemed hurried? Not as well thought out as his other books? I'm not sure exactly, but I definitely agree with others, that there were too many characters and I didn't wind up caring as much about the main characters as I have always done in previous books. I would have liked to know more about the main characters (especially Grace's husband Jack) and less about the many secondary characters. Grace and Jack needed more back story, more to give the reader's a reason to root for them.Gone for Good, gripped you and kept you turning pages from the first sentence. Just One Look was good, better than alot of what is out there, but it was much easier to put down without having to know what happens next.I know 4 stars probably sounds high for this review, but it was still good, I still recommend it, just not as highly as previous books. The references to characters from past books is fun. I was was surprised and pleased by those."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I waited so long for a new book to come out by this author, who is one of my all time favorites. However, I cannot begin to tell you how disappointing this book was. No where near the perfection of Coben's previous novels."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben is actually one of my favored authors, however, this book was a complete and utter let-down. Just the cover alone becomes annoying with the cutaway partial cover. The story itself was subpar after his past efforts. The characters are not interesting for the most part and everyone in the area seemed to be involved in the storyline. Eric Wu, the torturing villian, is a revisited character from one of his past books. Grace Lawson is your heroine with the character flaw of having a bad leg. Carl Vespa and Cran are the most underdeveloped supporting/main characters in the book (Coben would ramble on about other people's backgrounds but left these two virtually without a history). Cora, the best friend, is unimaginative as a supporting character. The plot is so convoluted and messy as to be nearly unacceptable. The diversions of guilt were poor, and the police investigators linked everything together too easily. The whole background on the photo, which is the focus of the plot, left the ending stagnant. I felt there were so many problems with this book, that I can't recommend it to anyone, which is sad because Coben is a splendid author and normally has some very interesting stories. \\"Just One Look\\" should be as hidden as the ridiculous plot of the book."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have a feeling that Coben's high school creative writing teacher told him that you MUST have someone disappear and reappear as someone else or disappear and eventually come back as yourself. I have read the last 4 of Coben's books and am surely seeing a trend.A pack of Photomat pictures has an extra one inserted from many years ago. Husband disappears on the night wife shows him the photo. Nice premise. However, this one fails to deliver.It hearkens back to a rock concert from 15 years ago when 18 young people were killed in a stampede caused by a gunshot. Who did what, when, where, and why is too mind-boggling. After finishing the book, I'm still not sure what happened. Will probably pass on Coben's next."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"When I ran across Coben and his Bolitar series, I bought the first three books and read them in sequence. I was hooked. Funny, excellently-plotted, and full of suspense, I even count TELL NO ONE as one of those books that influenced me to become a mystery writer. So it was with great relish that I snagged myself a copy of JUST ONE LOOK in order to, well, take a look.What resulted was an absolutely putrid piece of fiction. I'm stunned, honestly, that my man Harlan could have written a book this bad. To call it sloppy would be an insult to sloppily-written books. JUST ONE LOOK is more than sloppy: It commits some of the most egregious errors in the fiction writer's coda. The dialogue reads like two people chatting about the weather; the story pretends to move forward when nothing actually happens; characters are stock cardboard and do stupid things in the name of plot; and there are continuity errors to boot (in one section, a cop parks his car and steps out; a chapter later, the same cop has just finished pulling into the driveway). I'm grasping for the reasons behind such a drastic drop in quality from a guy who can plot circles around his contemporaries.And all I can come up with is that Coben got lazy after his previous successes. I guess everyone's allowed a misfire now and then, and it bodes well that he got back on the saddle again with THE INNOCENT, the novel that follows LOOK. It's just too bad that it had to be such a huge bomb from one of the best mystery writers still active in the genre. If you want good Coben, pick up TELL NO ONE, GONE FOR GOOD, or any title from the Bolitar series. Skip JUST ONE LOOK."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book was just too unbelievable. Long married people who know nothing about eachother. A wife who is reluctant to approach her husband when she sees an \\"old\\" picture of him and another girl in a group of young people. Too many unrealistic subplots with \\"surprise\\" explanations which make little sense and are way too convenient. An old rock concert where many young people are killed and thier parents are still walking zombies unable to cope with their deaths 15 years later. A mafia \\"sugar daddy\\" savior who always appears at just the right time. It is all too mundane, like a soap opera, and boring. Harlan Coben has written some good books. I am presently reading \\"The Innocent\\". I hope it does not end like \\"Just One Look\\"."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Just One Look catches you on the first page and never lets go! I am relatively new to Coben- having read about 4 of his books now and am impressed. This one in particular is a real roller coaster ride! It starts on the first page and by page 5, the reader may decide this is going to be a l-o-n-g night!I read it in a day and a half! I was impressed with the many turns and twists Coben creates to keep the reader engaged. I was not as impressed by \\"Caught\\", however, the author did his homework in this one!If you are looking for something that is engaging and does not let go until you read the very last words, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben can write. I get pulled in and gripped. I go for the ride and I'm willing to suspend disbelief ... and then, just like he does in most of his non-series books, he has to go way too far at the very end. And so, while everything else is 5 star, the implication at the very end removes a star. Not as bad as \\"No Second Chance\\" but, darned close. I wish he could drop this habit so I could just plain relax and enjoy reading his books - not so many great writers around that you can afford to go without even one. So, aside from this flaw, great plotting, super writing - the actual plot ending is downright brilliant and unexpected - don't get me wrong, it's the funky twist at the very end I'm griping about, not the basic plot arc and ending - good characters, well developed. It' worth reading, just pretend the last couple of pages don't exist."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I love Harlan Coben' books. Love his special brand of sarcasm and the way he keeps a story going. I usually have a hard time putting them down and this book was no exception. I read it in one day. About half way through, I looked up from the book and told my husband it was my favorite Coben book yet. And then I finished it. The final main truth was a bit like a HUGE vitamin. It's wasn't IMPOSSIBLE to swallow, but it wasn't pleasant, either. But then, Coben took it a step too far and made a twist that, for me, was just too much. I feel bad for him. He writes in a time when readers expect a big 'Sixth Sense' twist. But, if you can't substantiate it - or give it enough mystery to make the reader draw their own hazy conclusions, then don't write it. This twist was too concrete and needed concrete proof to believe. But none was given and all my attempts at drawing hazy conclusions ended with my mind saying, \\"No, that absolutely makes no sense.\\" If you choose not to read the Epilogue, you might get the entire pill down painlessly.4 stars because I really thought it was going to be the best Coben book. The ending was almost disappointing enough to give it less, but I honestly loved it so much until the end, I had to give it 4."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Although I am not quite finished reading the book, it is quite a thriller, which has come to be expected from Harlen Coben"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Talk about twists and turns....in \\"Just One Look\\" Coban has pulled out all the stops.

Then the fun of unravelling these pasts presents itself and its solution.This is an ingeniously intriguing story presented by a master storyteller who introduces so many twists and turns you are at a loss to determine whether you are coming or going.

Just One Look, while a page turner, is in my opinion not up to par with it's predecessors. That said, Coben writes a better &quot;page turner&quot; than most of his peers. The book revolves around a photo found by Grace Evans, a NJ housewife. In the photo are an old picture of her husband along with other people she does not know. When she asks her husband Jack about the picture, he immediately disappears. Her investigation uncovers years of a cover-up involving an incident that involved her from years past.The plot, while enough to keep me interested, did not measure up to Coben's previous three books. How about another Bolitar, Mr. Coben?"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben continues to prove that he is one of the best thriller writers around at the moment. A page turner is a much used phrase but in this case it is really appropriate. The author's books are always so well structured and his character's well rounded. He is obviously comfortable with his style and ability and this transmits itself to the reader making the reading of his books sheer pleasure from start to finish. Coben has now got a string of best selling crime novels behind him and all I can say is that I hope he continues to write for many years to come. The author lives in New Jersey with his wife and four children.A convicted hitman suddenly decides to confess to a murder that occurred over twenty years ago. He says that he killed the sister of the District Attorney. Why he decided to own up to the killing now no one knows, as he refuses to reveal his reasons.

When her husband, Jack, sees the old photo of five people, he freaks, quickly leaves home and disappears. Grace goes to the police who pretty much dismiss her plea for help since her husband is \`of age' and can do whatever he wants.Cora is a good friend of Grace's, and a bit of a computer wizard, who tries to help Grace find Jack via the Internet.Eric Wu, a weird Asian monster, is killing or horribly disabling people with just his hands. Who is the mystery person who has hired him to do this...and why?Charlaine is the neighbor of a skinny loner, Freddy Sykes, who Wu has left for dead in his bathtub. She suspects something sinister going on, calls the police, and takes off after Wu who ends up shooting her husband.With all the on-going subplots, you begin to wonder where this is all headed. But the author manages to tie everything together at the end. Do you know who you married?"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I really liked this book and had a hard time putting it down. A break to read a chapter turned into five chapters.The ending, however, left me completely unsatisfied. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I had to keep scrolling down to find the reviewers who like me LOVED this book-and if you take the time you will find them. I thought this was one of the best books I've read in a long time. The greatest compliment I can give this book is that I had no idea what was really going on...and you don't have the whole story until the very last page. I am a HUGE fan of thrillers/police/detective stories and my major complaint is that 99.9% of the time, even with the BIG names, I know exactly what is going to happen long before I even reach the middle of the book. I find it annoying and even insulting that a 40 yr. old housewife can figure out these great mysteries while the police veteran, great detective or even Army Ranger or Navy Seal cannot seem to put the pieces together. If you are interested in a fantastic story that will keep you guessing, give this a try! It's my first Coben and I can't wait to try more!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book came highly recommended, and that's the power of advertising, I guess. Still, JOL was an interesting read. The mystery is deep, complex, and Coben takes care to tie up all the threads. But for me, I never get a chance to invest in the characters because I'm so busy keeping track of the plot. I got to the end of it and thought, so what?The book comes seriously close to matching wits with the likes of Koontz (quit groaning) and Patterson, but despite its technical sharpness, it just barely misses the mark for me."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson is in big trouble...she just doesn't know it yet. She's an ordinary suburban housewife. She's happily married, has two children, a house, a minivan and a penchant for photographing family outings. When she picks up her latest set of developed photographs she is startled to find an old photo containing five people (one who looks strikingly similar to her husband, Jack) nestled among her new pics.This is the beginning of a conundrum that revisits a 20 year old accident that left Grace with a physical impairment and an unlikely connection to a local Mafia boss. When Jack disappears, Grace becomes embroiled in a situation that poses a serious threat to her family. Determined to find Jack as well as discover what part the old photograph plays in the puzzle, Grace embarks on a course that brings her face to face with a brutal killer.Like a dislodged bit of snow that begins its tumble down a mountainside gathering more and more speed until to turns into a full scale avalanche, Just One Look is a story that continues building clue upon clue, assailing your senses and stimulating your powers of detection until you're sure you have the solution. Corben, however, is a superb storyteller and when all the plot and sub-plot threads are brought together we find that the solution is unexpected and holds more than one unanticipated surprise."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson picks up her developed roll of film only to find a strange 15 year old picture of her husband and friends stuck in the middle of the roll. When she confronts him with it he leaves the house and disappears without a trace. Drama involving bad guys ensues. The remainder cannot be easily described because it is completely unbelievable, and not in a shocking suspensful way.This was my second attempt at a Coben book and I have confirmed that I'm just not a fan. His books are mindless entertainment which is fine with me, but the plots are ridiculous to the point of distraction. Just One Look's story is so contrived that it makes it difficult to enjoy. I'm a big fan of the \\"whodoneit\\" genre, but Coben is not for me."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"After reading several books by Harlan Coben, I may have to nominate the man as the most underachieving writer in the business. Coben does have talent; his dialogue is sometimes witty, his plots start out as interesting, and he can create a sense of tension that pulls the reader in right at the beginning of the book. Unfortunately, though, it seems that Coben typically runs out of steam after the first 40 or 50 pages of each book because after the initial set-up, his novels typically fall flat on their faces.Just One Look has a lot of the flaws that Coben's other books share; the characters are all stereotypes, the plotline seems soap opera-ish, and there's just too much going on that has nothing to do with the main story line. The plot itself just isn't very interesting; something happened at a rock concert a long time ago and a bunch of people got killed. It seems like something you'd find in a young adult book aimed at teenagers, not an adult novel. Tied-in with this plot is the fact that a woman who was injured at the concert but survived now has to deal with the fact that her husband has disappeared. Once again, it just doesn't grab us.Coben goes on for nearly 400 pages with long description of mundane topics such as breakfast cereal and video games. Action is going on as well, but it seems to have nothing to do with the main plot. Then, in the final 30 pages or so, Coben dumps about a dozen \\"surprises\\" on his readers which supposedly explain the whole book but in reality simply make the story far, far too complicated and extremely unbelievable. By the time we reach the end of the book, we neither know nor care what actually happened to these characters.My advice? Give this book \\"Just One Look\\"---a very quick one---and then move on to something more interesting."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I was turned off from the very first page of this book by the author throwing his \\"Look at me...I'm hip with today's pop-culture\\" attitude in my face. It was not only non-original, but insulting.His writing reminded me of one of those parents that has all the answers and loves impressing his kids (and the neighbors') with every detail about them. Not one page went by without a plug for a current TV show, website (Did he REALLY just write an entire page on how email works?!), or a stereotypical suburban-housewife tool (is he getting a commission?).He has turned a modern, popular style of thriller writing (a la Da Vinci Code) into a sad and laughable clich&eacute;. I only decided to finish this book to see how bad it could be, and finally, he delivered. I can honestly say this is the worst book I've ever read and have no idea what the back-cover reviewers were thinking when they decided to (earn some cash and) praise it. Sorry folks. Quite frankly, this book condescends the intelligence of the reader and goes to show how anybody can get published if they have the right connections or a few past successes."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I was given 'Just one look', a superb Harland Coben thriller, by my English teacher to read over our October break - she said that we should be able to finish it by the week we go on work experience, which is a week on Monday.I finished the book tonight. I found myself literally up every night until around 1/2am reading 50-100 pages each night. The book was ace!Coben keeps us gripped at every stage, shivers literally run down your spine and you can't stop thinking about what will happen next. I just couldn't handle the late nights turning into sleepless nights filled with the thoughts of what would happen next.I'd thoroughly recommend this book to all and I'll certainly be taking a read at his other books, which I'm told are equally as good.Some may say that the last few pages of the book dragged on a little as the story came to a conclusion but, for me, it was perfect. It was a time when I literally found myself saying \\"ahh... that's why...\\"A great read - recommended to all."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Within the first five pages, this book will have any suspense reader hooked on an intriguing premise - this is Coben's trademark and one of his strengths as an author. Unfortunately, the rest of the book fails to hold up against the initial setup. Most of the book is a by-the-numbers recount of the heroine's steps to unravel the mystery that her life has become. The results are surprisingly boring, especially by Coben's standards. In the end the explanation of it all is buried under a heap of obligatory surprise twists that are as implausible as they are incomprehensible.The book also relies on a lot of Coben's favorite themes, i.e. the secrets that permeate everone's lives, family bonds and modern American suburban ennui. However, this time, the treatment of these themes seems like self-plagiarism. His writing is as crisp as ever, which further makes it a shame that the subject matter just isn't there.I highly recommend \\"Gone for Good\\" by Coben instead. It was an absolute thrill ride that I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"What a frustrating disappointment. I enjoyed Coben's earlier work, but this one was truly frustrating and a let down. For those of you smokers out there, its like when you are out of smokes and then you find a stale one, you smoke it, and while you are disgusted by the taste you can't put it down.It took me over a month to finish this book, while I usually finish these 'novels' in 2-3 days tops, and on occasion I've finished entire books on long flights to Europe.The book is frustratingly complex, would it have killed Coben to start the book with a press clipping that describes what the Boston Massacre was all about? Why make the plot lines so complicated. I've sworn off the book and put on the bookshelf no less than 5 times, and in the interim I've read three other books. But I keep coming back to finish it..The most impressive characters; CORA the sultry friend, Perlmutter the aloof police captain, and of course Grace. The lamest; Eric Wu, Vespa, and Jimmy X..Recommendation; buyers beware, you will finish the book but you will hate every page of it.."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Normally I can't put down a Coben book. However, I have to agree with one reviewer who asked, did he write this book?The plot is interesting, a wife who discovers a picture of her husband and a long ago set of friends. When questioned, the husband scuffs it off but then pretty much immediately disappears. Leaving her to wonder is there more to this picture? The ride that ensues is filled with a lot of suspense, tension, curiosity. As the reader, you do feel as compelled as the wife to try and figure out just what is going on and how do all of the pieces fit together.I guess what disappointed me in this book was that it just felt like it had TOO many twists and surprises. For me, that's a fatal flaw for a book or movie. As for the ending...was a pretty good surprise ending, but I still felt like all of the twists were over-shadowing that. The several other Coben books I've read are different from this one, in the way that the story is just as suspenseful and exciting, but they are more straight forward and not so muddled.Even still, the book wasn't a bad read, but it wasn't my favorite of Coben's. However, for getting it in the discount bin, it all evened out I suppose!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"'Just One Look' is my first Harlan Coben novel, is probably won't be the last. It has that fine quality of being both well-written and yet easy to read. And the author clearly plotted the intricate story very well. The ending is a bit ... excessive, but not too outrageous.As for the story, we have a housewife who unexpectedly finds an old photo of his husband and friends when retrieving prints from a photo lab. When she shows the photo to her husband he freaks, runs out, goes missing, then all sorts of murder and mayhem result. The author does an excellent job in unravelling the mystery, and all questions are eventually answered. However again, it would have be prudent for him to have exercised some restraint towards the end.Bottom line: a surprisingly good thriller.

Grace goes to bed unsure of what to think about the photo and awakes to an empty bed...Jack left in the night and has not returned.Grace goes to the police for help, but finds it pointless as they think her husband just left her. Knowing she must look for her husband on her own, Grace starts tracking her husband's steps and finds several suspicious phone calls placed days before his disappearance; one to the sister Grace didn't know he had, and another to a man who has since been murdered.The deeper Grace digs she realizes that she knew nothing about the man she married, and the only way to learn the truth is to confront her own dark past.\`Just One Look' is a secret filled thrill-ride that will have you reading well into the night. From the exciting opening to the stunning conclusion you will be held spellbound by a thriller that doesn't quit. The story moves with gale force and is packed with twists, turns, and surprises galore all blended together by Harlen Coben's smooth writing style.Harlan Coben is one of my favorite authors and his long list of excellent novels just got longer with the addition of \`Just One Look', his newest blockbuster.Expect to see \`Just One Look' on all the bestseller lists.A definite MUST read!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I found myself hooked by this book and the feeling lasted...until three quarters of the way through the novel. At that point I became a bit disappointed. I feel that the author got off track and did not know how to bring together a believable closing. Things got convoluted and there were too many convenient events and coincidences. I felt let down by the ending. However, the book is still very entertaining and I recommend it. It would be a good book to read on the beach...I agree that the book is poorly edited but I don't fault the author for that."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I agree with Eric's review - Gone For Good and Tell No One were the sort of great books that keep you reading until 3am. Just One Look is in a different (lesser) league. Terrific beginning, then it all goes downhill.The plot doesn't really make sense, and I've read far too many crime novels where the hero or heroine happens to have a Mafia boss on tap to help them out when the going gets rough (I'm thinking of the Spenser novels in particular). Grace was a pleasant enough character but the endless stuff about how much she loved her kids, what they ate, what they wore, what they were reading and so on got very tedious. And is it just me or are his folksy little authorial asides (er, um) becoming really irritating?This is a harsh review, because a new Harlan Coben is still a treat. But this is really not that great."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have enjoyed all of Coben's work but this one certainly had me wondering what kind of changes success is making in his attitudes. I couldn't decide who he had more contempt for: his own characters or me as the reader. This story was contrived, unbelievable, and unsatisfying. His tacked on surprise ending casting Grace in a dark role in her own tragedy was distasteful to say the least. His careless and senseless killing off of one person after another was even more so. The truth certainly didn't set any of these people free, everyone in the story was left impoverished and diminished, and for what? All in all the whole story just left me with a very bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"If you've never read one of Harlan's books before you'll enjoy it very much. If you've read ANY of his books you'll find it is just the same recycled story every time.

It certainly wasn't predictable!It seemed to me that there were too many characters to follow and keep up with and I don't think the story would have lacked any without a few of them.I had a rough time in the beginning, however, became very interested throughout the middle of the book. I also believe that if I would have read the story rather than listened to it, that it would have been easier to get into and stay with the story."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I enjoyed reading the novel despite the violence it portrayed.

I had to keep reading to see how they got away or not."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Book Review: Just One Look by Harlan Coben 4/5This book starts with much promise but as usual with these books it can be confusing at first with so many characters introduced in so many seemingly unrelated situations. However, just as you think you can't take in any more disjointed facts the action picks up and as the book progresses all the separate lives are drawn together.Just One Look has an unlimited number of possible suspects when Jack Lawson disappears. Has he run away, been kidnapped, killed? His wife is left to find out and it all seems to stem from events 15 years before.As usual I cringed at the descriptions of sadistic violence but these are few mostly the book is filled with intrigue. After the dreaded kidnapper Wu is out of the picture (I won't tell you how) there are still more loose ends than spiders have legs. However, these are quickly resolved with a few surprises on the way. Park of me wished these were resolved as the action took place as they all seemed more like a summing up or after thought when in fact they were crucial to all the events in the book.Overall an enjoyable read, as expected from Harlan Coben but a few answers earlier would have helped.Gail Jonesauthor of Family Secrets"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben is probably my very favorite author. And the books I like best are the ones where I am hooked within the first page or two, SO i was very excited when this book was one of those that made me excited and very interested from the very first page! At first I thought it was like his usual books where he has about 3 main characters that it kind of oscillates between throughout the chapters, and that is mainly true, except this book (and one other that I have read of his recently) have a bit TOO MANY characters to really keep the story straight and to try to figure anything out. There are the main characters of course, the \\"stars\\" of the story- but it becomes hard to keep track of all the more minor characters throughout and the role(s) they play, how they interconnect. Even towards the end, as I was patiently waiting to finally make sense of all of it and tie all the loose ends together, I found myself repeatedly having to go back to previous parts in the book to refresh myself on who some of the smaller characters were and what they did/said. It is a little too scattered and too much information for me, and I am an avid, adept reader. I read a book every other day! Not all of Coben's books are this way, but this and a couple others are..If you like books with a lot of characters, and you can keep a lot of little information stored and add it all together, you will love this book- it really does have an interesting story. But for me, I found it a bit too confusing. It would be easier to comprehend as a movie, though we all know books are usually better..but in this case, maybe the opposite would be true! Worth a try if you like Coben's other works, though."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"In usual Coben style, the opener is shocking, electrifying, and exciting. You just have to keep reading because the plot is incredibly interesting and well-planned. The endings aren't always what you expect, and I like that.

I wish the book wouldn't have come to an end. Page after page the excitement just keeps building. This is one I will definately read again. I will most certainly purchase more of Harlan Coben's books from Amazon. I bought my Kindle Fire from Amazon. What a convienience to buy a book from same, and be reading it just moments later without even leaving my chair. Gotta go, I am buying the new Lee Child book next at Amazon. I won't even have to wait!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben never disappoints...I loved the unexpected twist at the end. These are what makes reading his books so good. You think you have it all figured out and then everything changes. Love it!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben's JUST ONE LOOK is one of those fun, mindless books to read on a plane or on the beach. Filled with suspense and irony, this book engages the reader. Coben may not be the next literary genius, but he guarantees the reader excitement."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"\\"Just One Look,\\" by Harlan Coben is one of those books written at a level of sophistication whereby almost none of the characters are likeable. The heroine remains likable until the last pages of the book (there is no hero) and then the author takes that away from the reader, almost. I like books with a likeable hero and heroine, but that's just me. To pull off this jaded world view, the plot becomes extremely complicated, until it finally casts doubt as to the goodness, fairness or honor of every single character. The book opens with the heroine Grace Lawson finding an old photo taken of her husband Jack and four other college kids. After showing hte photo to her husband, he leaves and is later kidnapped. This is followed by a series of horrific murders at the hands of Eric Wu, an Asian martial arts killing machine. When I finally found out who Wu was working for, it just didn't add up. There were several plot twists that were not believable. Coben is a talented writer and I understand that many of his novels are much better than this one, so I'll definitely try another one of his books."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"The story is far fetched with impossible twists and turns and yet I could not put the book down. I was up until 1:00 am reading the last 250 or so pages and then I couldn't fall asleep as I was still contemplating the story."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Compared to Cobens earlier Myron Bolitar stuff this is a very big improvement in reading quality !"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book's ending is a little unrealistic but it's still not a bad read. I love Harlan Coben's books but this isn't one of his best. The thing is if someone else would have written this book then I would have thought it was a pretty good book. So even though I have very high standards for Mr. Coben, I still have to give this book a good review. I enjoy the build up of the book but felt like he really rushed the ending. I did find the twists and turns that Coben is known for to be exciting but I wish there would have been more throughout the book instead of having most of them at the end. Overall, this is a quick read that will for the most part keep you interested. I would recommend this book to mystery readers."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This was a great book. Although you are kept guessing I would say that all the loose ends are tied up in the end. It was not predictable so that by the middle of the book you are able to put the pieces together. Was it believable? Some reviewers thought the story line was a bit far-fetched. I didn't find it far-fetched per-se, perhaps improbable, but its fiction. I didn't expect it to read like a newspaper. I think the fact that it was so unexpected added to the suspense. Just don't start reading this if you have work the next day. You will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"(Actually 3.5 stars)I have not read any of Harlan Coben's Bolitar series, but I've read all of his \\"standalones.\\" Now, after Tell No One, No Second Chance, and Gone for Good, I am seeing a pattern in these books. Unfortunately, Just One Look falls into the same pattern. It goes like this: Average suburban protagonist experiences something that shocks their \\"normal\\" world. This person always has legal connections, and always has a wealthy protector/benefactor who helps provide assistance but just might be involved in the foul play. A close friend who is helping is either suspect or directly involved. And then at the end, the past unravels and everything comes together.The good news is that just like the other three novels, Just One Look causes the same page turning frenzy. It asks the reader to guess how things will unravel, but always introduces twists that the reader doesn't see coming. I did like that Coben introduced a female protagonist for the first time who was a brave and strong character. However, many of the other characters were two-dimensional and filled with witty quips about suburbia that we've all read or head before.While Coben clearly can write and has a great mind for plotting and suspense, Just One Look had a rushed feel to it. Part of this probably comes from the fact that there were more typos in this book then in any recent novel I can recall. One or two I could understand, but there must have been twenty missing or extra words in the version I have.Having said all that, because of those positives I mentioned, I would recommend this book for those seeking a quick, snappy page turner and I will try Coben's next novel. However, if you're looking for the quality development of Dennis Lehane or Michael Connelly, it's just not to be found here."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I enjoy Coben's books--they always have a surprise ending and usually one that's totally unexpected--this one is no exception.

You won't be unhappy about reading this thriller- Larry Hobson- Author- &quot;The Day Of The Rose&quot;"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Just One Look is not the roller coaster ride of Coben's other books; Tell No One, Gone For Good, and No Second Chance. This book is more a trip on a slightly rolling sea....until the last few pages when you are hit by a giant wave you didn't see coming. Pure Harlan Coben.I agree with other reviewers that this latest adventure is not as outstanding as Coben's others. Let us not forget, though, that a good Coben novel is better than 90% of other authors' great novels.As I'm sure you know by now, this is a story of a happy, successful couple with two children who are blindsided by someone placing a 15 year old picture in with recently developed family snapshots. The husband disappears, the wife searches for him, and a myriad of characters pop out of the pages from the past of both husband and wife. Both of whom have a serious past.Oddly, for 2 people who have been married for years, these two know basically nothing about each other's lives before they met. That takes a bit of a leap of faith. Another criticism is that I really wasn't invested in the two main characters. Coben failed to develop them to the point where I particularly cared what happened to them. This is not to say that I didn't want to know how it all would end, because I did, and read this in one day. Unlike Coben's past 3 novels, however, I was able to put it down for minutes at a time and go about my day.Yes, some of the characters are stereotypes and the one I came to care about most was a pure Coben twist character - a woman who is in the right place at all of the wrong times and, in my opinion, was the true heroine of a story which didn't contain many, if any, heroic folk.This is a story of how youthful indescretions can wreak havoc and come back to haunt you many years later with the help of a few flawed personalities. It is definitely a must read, a good story, and an ending that made me want to go back and reread the whole story to see why I didn't see that big wave coming."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"If only Harlan would go back to what he does best, that is writing about Myron Bolitar or at least, something clever and amusing. This latest offering by Mr. Coben is the most commercial and uninteresting book yet. He obviously wants to appeal to all the soccer and stay at home moms out there who want to read about one of their own involved in a mystery. However, we really don't care about her, her husband or her neighbors. That's what this book is about, with an Asian murderer thrown in. The characters are not worth reading, or caring about. It took me about 4 attempts to finally finish this mess. Don't get me wrong, I love Harlan Coben books, having read them all, but this one is downright painful to read. Hopefully he will go back to his old style and former characters. However, if people keep clammering for this type of pap, then again, maybe he won't."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I really enjoyed the book, just as satisfying as the rest. I listen to all of them while driving around Los Angeles for work. my only comment would be that I prefer when the actor's read books, rather than authors. Great book overall."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben's JUST ONE LOOK is another great formulaic thriller by the author. Coben's THE INNOCENT, NO SECOND CHANCE and GONE FOR GOOD, if you read them around the same time, will all seem familiar. You'll note the familiar plot points, twists and turns, characterizations. So, though Coben breaks no new ground here, he still delivers an incredible novel that is perhaps the darkest of most of his recent thrillers.The suspense and thrills all evolve around one mysterious photograph. The photo shows up in a role of pictures Grace Lawson just picked up from the fotomat. Inside this batch of new photos, Grace finds and old picture of 5 college students. One girl has her face X-d out and one of the bearded men appears to be her husband Jack. She is curious about how the picture got in with her new photos and when Jack gets home she shows him the picture. Jack asks her where the picture came from then vanishes within minutes. Why did he vanish? Who was in the picture with her husband?This novel, like many others of Coben, features a tragic event that happened in the past that is ultimately tied to the pain of the present. Grace has a history of her own. Many years ago, she earned her fifteen minutes of fame by surviving a panic-driven stampede at a rock concert. Eighteen kids died that night, but Grace didn't, even though she was seriously injured. Her survival meant a lot to the familes of the victims. So, while Grace has a tragic event in her past, what could the picture featuring her husband be about that could cause him to vanish.The plot moves quickly as Grace tries to find out the truth. She is aided by Carl Vespa, a mafia type goon whose son died in the stampede. She is also aided by an the actions of a suffering housewife and an obsessed district attorney. Coben's writing is fun and he makes many solid observations through his characters. Don't worry, the twists keep coming until the final page, and although they all might not be believable, they all tend to make sense. My only complaint is the \\"incident\\" that ties Jack Lawson with the four people in the picture and also makes them fear for their lives isn't one that should necessarily be that threatening. But if you can suspend your disbelief for a moment, and you must do that reading a Coben novel, you'll find this novel just as enjoyable as all the others.Coben is one of my favorite authors, and I have yet to read any of his books featuring sports agent Myron Bolitar. I look forward to reading those as well. JUST ONE LOOK is a book definitely worth checking out!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book takes off from page one and you will NOT want to put it down until you have read all of it.It is an exciting, suspenseful story, with many twists and turns to keep you guessing but then it all starts to fall apart at the end.To me, the explanation of why everything occurred was way too far fetched and unbelievable.I loved the book - up to the end."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but I make the same conclusion as for Harlan Coben's \\"Tell no one\\". Although quite some suspense is built throughout the book, I was somehow disappointed overall. The story is rather cheap and too artificial. Not bad as holiday entertainment, but not a novel that I would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I read this very quickly! I enjoyed it,a fine writer- master of the craft! Read it!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book was very good. It had alot of action. This is the second book that I have read by Harlan Coben. I plan to read others by this author.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Coben does not dissapoint. If your from New Jersey you must get into his books."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson, suburban wife, artist and mother of two young children, finds an old photo in a pack of new pictures she picks up at the Photomat. One of the people in the picture looks like it might be her husband. Shortly after she shows the picture to her husband, he goes missing. In Coben's past novels his main characters have been men who have to do battle with evildoers. I was curious to see how he handled a woman as the hero. In past outings, Coben's male heroes bumble around, get lucky and save the day. Grace Lawson is considerably stronger and smarter. This makes for a more believable tale. Toward the end of the story, I thought the conclusion was going to be disappointing....too simple. But there were several surprising twists that made for a very satisfying ending. This was a fast paced and very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book is by far not his best.....the plot is too complicated and very hard to follow.....the last few chapters finally bring everything together but it's tough getting that far...usually I can't put his books down, had a hard time not doing that this time...hope the next one is better"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Just One Look is no where near Coben's usual entertaining fare. It is more like a 2 1/2 star effort.As usual his main characters are very likeable - a suburban housewife and her kidnapped husband are people you want next door. The housewife/artist is the star and the presumptive solver of the mystery.The mystery starts off well with a mystery picture slipped into apple-picking prints at photomart. From there the story spirals, occasionally out of control. There is a cool bad guy, but the reader is given no real idea of who is or why he is there until the plot is sorted out at the very end. There is really no build-up. There is only event after event after event, none of which go together well. Suddenly - like an epiphany - the plot is resolved in the last ten pages or so. The answers seem to appear out of no where. htere is little telling how Mrs. Suburbia unraveled it all.Besides the good characters - and there are a few good ones other than the couple and the abductor, there is not much to recommend this book. All of Coben's others are far superior."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This was my third Harlan Coben novel, after Tell No One and No Second Chance. Despite the thrills and chills, I couldn't quite connect with the characters. If you never identify with the main characters in some essential way, it's hard to care what ultimately happens to them. Some indefinable magnetism was missing this time. That's all I can blame. The plot and dialogue were as inventive as ever."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Well I can not say that this book was not great,... at first. I was rather disappointed with the stale ending. The typo's were not great to see, yet Hello editor's.The end came to fast, I found too many inconsistencies that were not addressed at all.I really like reading H. Coben's book's, he is one of my favorite authors, yet this book just didn't seem to have the same Harlan flow about it. Usually he is more patient and expressed in his writing. I am sure his next book will make up for this one."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I finished up Harlan Coben's latest novel Just One Look. A page-turning mystery that delivers pretty well all the way through.A woman by the name of Grace Lawson is living a normal life until she picks up a package of pictures from the photomat one day. In the package is an older print of a group of people, one of which looks like a younger version of her husband. When she asks him about it, he denies that it's him, but takes the picture and heads out late at night. And like all good mysteries, he doesn't return. Grace is trying to piece together what's going on when she gets a call from him asking for &quot;space&quot; to sort things out. The police aren't quite sure what to think, especially when Jack's disappearance is tied into a murder and a near-killing from someone who is expert in martial arts. The picture is the key, and they start to figure out who each person is. But all the people have either been murdered or have disappeared. The killings get closer and closer to Grace, and the race is on to find the killer and Jack before she's killed.Overall, there's good suspense and action. The thread that ties everything together is slowly revealed throughout the book, but each revelation seems to bring a new plot twist that takes it all in a different direction. At the very end there's a number of things that come together quickly with a number of turns, but it all seems to be a bit muddled. Not exactly a feel-good ending, but still worth the read."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"&quot;Just one look&quot; is a complex mosaic where neither people nor events are what they seem. Grace Lawson is a content suburbanite and artist with a loving husband and two children who has reconstructed her life following a traumatic incident in her adolescence.On a routine trip to pick up a developed roll of film, she finds a picture which does not belong. Examining it closely, she sees mostly strangers and a man who strangely resembles her husband. After innocently asking her husband , Jack about it, he hastily dismisses it yet abruptly disappears without a reason. Grace is plunged into a complex web of events that have their origin fifteen years ago at a rock concert that turned into a tragic stampede when shots were fired into the crowd where Grace was there in attendance. Unknown to her she is pursued by a faceless assassin in her quest for the truth about this innocuous picture and her husband's peculiar reaction to it. A skeptical police officer, an underworld figure whose son died in the concert, a sister-in-law, who is a legal advocate are characters who will either aid or deter he in her fierce quest for sanity and balance in a world where there are no guarantees or security. &quot;Just One Look&quot; ,at times is a hodgepodge with detours which may sidetrack the reader and requires a determined attentiveness. The suspenseful elements do lead to a conclusion that is plausible and unexpected. Grace Lawson is a tenacious heroine who will not be denied at any step of the way especially when the lives of her family are at stake."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This is my fourth Coben book and they all sort of run together--all have been excellent; this is more my issue--I knew I had seen Eric Wu and Hester Crimstein before (and was the &quot;sports agent&quot; friend of Grace's a subtle nod to Coben's earlier work--something about a sports agent/dectective?), I just couldn't remember the books specifically. That isn't CO Also, it was nice not have a doctor as the leader character--instead we get a strong woman. The story is indeed engrossing and I read it in one day. However, toward the end, the twists are dizzying and, while satisfying, I had to read a few paragraphs twice to follow along. There are the usual great characters, suprises, but was it too much? And why all the typos? Seriously, don't they have editors? Still, well worth a read. Coben is still better than the vast majority of folks out there today."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Sometimes Harlan Coben reminds me of the great mystery/detective writer Raymond Chandler. Particularly this recent offering has similarities with &quot;The Big Sleep.&quot; It is a runaway plot punctuated by very strong, but flawed major characters, lots of violent action, and complex plot streams that cross but never seem to connect. I enjoyed the ride, reading this wonderful page-turner. But, the ending is simply amazing and incomprehensible. The plot is a mad clockwork of unrelated and tangentily connected relationships that cannot be explained in the end. You know that a novel is in trouble when the characters have to talk to each other, or reminisce about what really happened to no conclusion for the final chapter. Like other reviewers, I am struck with the large number of errata. Misspelled words, inappropriate word usage, punctuation errors and shoddy editing abound. Shoddy spelling is amazing in a best-selling book by an esteemed author like Harlan Coben. I can't really recommend this book, other than for the experience of a fast-paced run through an increasingly series of plots that never really end or are resolved. Maybe, like the lead character, the author simply ran out of energy or strength to continue to understand or explain."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"My first Harlan Coben novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A good mystery, sans graphic language and violence, but a good story line that kept you thinking you had everything figured out, only to realize that you didn't until the very end and even on the last page you were wondering if you had the right ending."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Granted Just One Look had a familiar feel to it, but that just makes it easier to get into. I thought it was intriguing enough to keep turning the pages until the end, which only took me about 3 days. I love that Harlan Coben always has a surprise twist at the end so you can't predict the outcome. I must admit my favorite thing about Harlan Cobens books is the setting. Since I used to live in NJ, specifically in one of the towns mentioned in this book, I get a kick out of seeing the name in print. I feel like I can visualise the story since I used to drive the same streets."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have been reading Harlan's books for years now. I really enjoyed his Bolitar mysteries and thought &quot;Tell No One&quot; was excellent. Of all his stand alone mysteries, I liked this the least, although I did read it in two days and thought it to be hard to put down. I just thought the story was too contrived and unbelievable. I thought the characters needed more development especially the bad guy.I thought the ending was very unbelievable. Even though it was and exciting read, after I was done, it felt like a meal with all desert and no meat and potatoes- very unsatisfying. I recommend his earlier books. I am hooked on his books though and will probably buy and read the next one too. I recently read&quot;Persuader&quot; by Lee Child and found it to be more satisfying"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I discovered Harlan Coben and his new thriller \\"Just One Look\\" by picking up one those cute little free samplers that publishers place in bookstores to promote new books. The sampler included a preview chapter that left me hanging and yearning for more. I went back and bought the book and was hooked right at the beginning when a typical suburban housewife goes to pick up a pack of photos from a photomat and gets home to discover that someone has mistakenly inserted an almost 20 year old photograph of young adults, one of whom looks like a younger version of her husband.That same night after showing hubby the photo, she hears his car screeching out of the driveway--out of her life. For good, it seems. This book is an emotional rollercoaster and I enjoyed every second of the ride."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Injured during a stampede at a rock concert more than a decade before, Grace Lawson is unaware when she finds a misplaced photo in her order from a photo shop that this will lead her on a trail full of mystery and intrigue, back to that one day in time.Harlan Coben has written another great mystery, full of twists and turns, one that will leave you guessing until the very end. This was one book I was anxious to return to and didn't want to leave while reading. I really enjoy this author's style."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson, wife and mother, picks up her developed photographs at the local shop and finds an unexpected photo in with her family pictures. She recognizes her husband, as a younger man, in the picture. Later that night, at home, she walks in on her husband staring silently at the photograph. He is gone within hours and Grace doesn't know why. Her only clue is the photo, which she has to rely on to unravel her husband's life. But he hasn't run off to find an old love. Grace, her children, and her husband are now in grave danger because of this old photo.A life can unravel so quickly, based on what we don't know about those we love. Sometimes it's just one thread that is pulled, as in Grace's life. Grace has quite a history herself. She was hurt at a concert before she met her husband and has had amnesia about the event. She must come to grips with her own past as she discovers her husband's.Coben's characters are interesting and spunky. In this particular instance, he is able to capture parenting realistically in Grace. I picked up on the twist that I thought he was developing, but it was still fun to read because he didn't actually reveal it until the very end. Very good summer read if you're looking for a page turner!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben is one of my favorite writers, and even though I am still ticked off he hasn't given us a Myron Bolitar in years, I still found JUST ONE LOOK a good read. Perhaps it is a bit overplotted, and yes, the editors left in numerous typos, but at the heart of the novel is Coben's dry humor, his keen understanding of relationships and his witty use of plot contrivances.Grace Lawson is a great heroine, one who will do anything to protect and defend her family. Eric Wu is a cold, heartless and despicable villain. Carl Vespa is your typical mob don, but one whose respect for Grace is admirable. Cram, his henchman, is a memorable character---a bad guy you can't help but like. Jack Lawson is not in the book much, but his unseen presence forms a strong foundation, even as we find out the truth.The plot jumps back and forth, and as layer upon layer of hard to swallow events are revealed, we still find ourselves mesmerized with Coben's brilliant narrative style.Perhaps the most vile character is Scott Duncan; once you read the book you'll find out why, and Coben does pull a biggie at the end that makes you wonder, how heroic is Grace?But, undeniably, JUST ONE LOOK is a great read, just wish Coben would stop tormenting us by not writing any Bolitars!!!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Although this book wasn't as good as his previous three novels--particularly Tell No One--I still couldn't put it down. I was abducted into the drama and tried to read it wherever I could. He, as well as Dan Brown, has mastered the page-turning prose, where the reader cannot physically stop reading. That said, though, the conclusion was too convoluted to be praised. The outcome is totally unguessable--and not in the traditional mystery novel way. You don't nod along like you do when reading Sherlock Holmes unraveling a plot. With this, you just kinda go, huh?"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Having read all eleven of Coben's books, I can say that \\"Just One Look\\" continues in the same vein as the rest. His books are fast-paced with plenty of plot intricacies and interesting characters. I've never been able to put one down, once started.The shattering of Grace Lawson's domestic tranquility by an out-of-place, strange photo in a packet from a fast-photo mart and the abrupt departure of her husband after seeing the photo grabs the reader immediately. But, by examining telephone records and using the Internet, Grace is able to make a beginning in sorting out her husband's disappearance and his connection with the photo taken some fifteen years ago. The investigation moves into high gear with innumerable interactions with an assortment of friends, policemen, lawyers, criminals, and mafia types, some with intricate ties to the time of the photo. Grace learns that her past is also intimately connected with this turn of events.The plot does get a bit tangled toward the end, as well as stretching plausibility a bit. One could have hoped for perhaps a cleaner resolution of the mystery. Warning to the reader: pay attention to the rapid-fire twists and developments. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"masterfully and mysteriously woven into a tapesty of suspense. A tense thriller that will have you forgetting about the world about you and immersing yourself into the over-turned life of Grace Lawson.Happily ensconced in the role of suburban housewife and mother, she is surrounded by a truly thoughtful and dedicated husband and two beautiful children. Like so many of us do on outings with those we love Grace captures the happy times with her camera and brings the pictures to be processed.It takes &quot;Just One Look&quot; to realize that among them is one that surely does not belong to her. It was taken at least 10 years before and captures unfamiliar people grouped together...unfamiliar except for one...her husband Jack. Where did the picture come from...why was it given to her...who are these people?She shows Jack the picture and he is so shocked that he leaves without saying a word and then is not heard from again. Grace's search for both her missing husband and the answers to the myriad questions that have arisen because of this picture is presented to us by this multi-talented writer who uses his intimate knowledge of the english language in such a way as to capture our imagination and sweep us along from page to page.You may have to put the book down from time to time to attend to the world around you...but the story never leaves you and you know you will return to it as soon as time permits...or if you are like me; you will carve out a piece of time no matter what.&quot;Just One Look&quot; is a gripping novel ... read closely and you will find allusions to some of his Bolitar characters; which I for one thought was clever. But then, I would expect no less from Harlan Coben. You bet he is one of my most favorite of all authors and his continuing success in writing complex mysteries(as opposed to the many simplistic ones that are on the market) proves that many, many other readers enjoy his imagaination and his style. A wonderful thinking man's mystery from mystery's forever-thinking man. Thanks for another great one, Harlan!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Having devoured the past three or four Coben books, I found Just One Look to be extremely disappointing and frankly boring. I kept reading the book in the hope that Coben's signature surprises and twists/turns would redeem the book. Unfortunately, such was not the case as the storyline is altogether implausible with characters that are hardly compelling. Finally, the story simply does not make sense. Hopefully, Coben's next book will be return to his previous efforts.If you're looking for other enjoyable authors pick up anything by Lee Child (Jack Reacher series) or Clinton McKinzie (Antonio Burns series)."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Never reading Coben's work before, I was intrigued by the story line of Just One Look and decided to pick it up. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised and finished the book in two days. Just One Look is a rapid page turner that I had trouble putting down for even a moment. Employing a strong central character in Grace, a suburban mom of two kids, coping with the rapid disappearance of her husband after discovering a mysterious photo depicting him twenty years earlier, Coben briskly, yet suspensefully, unravels the mystery of a related event in both Grace's and her husband Jack's lives that affects them forever. Just One Look is an exciting journey with enough twists and turns to keep you flipping pages. The final 30 pages that pulls the story together is refreshing, surprising, and intelligently designed by Coben."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I anxiously awaited this later thriller from Harlan Coben and, after reading it, was a little disappointed. I guess I was expecting another &quot;Tell No One&quot; (in my opinion, his best). I found the basis for the whole story a little weak (deaths at a rock concert)--I was expecting something a little more intruiging (such as ties to Islamic terrorists). Character development was a little weak. Mr. Coben brought in numerous characters from previous novels, and I wish that he had perhaps discussed their pasts a little more (I found myself wishing that I had gone back and re-read &quot;Tell No One&quot;, the origin of a few of the characters--Eddie Wu and Heather Crimstein, to name a few). Things got really complicated at the end, and I really didn't like the way the story ended, but all in all I am happy I read it and will definitely read more Harlan Coben novels in the future."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Who cares? Plot twists for their own sake just give you a headache. I good story where you care about the characters and care what happenes and why can benefit from such twists. But here, the twists are just to twist, like in a noose! I've read everything Harlan's written. Looks like he owned his publisher one. Looks like he played games with his plot just to show you he could. Looks like he puts in irrelevant suburban details to add pages to the plot. Looks like you should Tell No One about this book. I hope his talent isn't Gone For Good. After reading this book you may consider No Second Chance. But if you Look Away! you'll be grateful. This Fade Shot may be a Deal Braker."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book was unbelievably bad. The author is a horrible writer and I have no idea how this made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. One of the things that made it especially frustrating was how he would constantly meander off topic to mention something completely mundane and unrelated to the plot. I specifically remember a dramatic chase scene in a supermarket where the author pauses to inform the reader why a supermarket keeps the milk and eggs at the back of the store.Because I was truly desparate for reading materiel, I finished this book. Trust me, it was not worth it. The characters were shallow and the scary mystery is not so scary after all. Avoid this book."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have read all of Mr Coben's books and this is probably the least enjoyable.I dont mean to dwell on the editing but its really terrible. The main reason I am writing at all to ask where is Myron Bolitar? That was the best series that I have read in a long time and why have you given up on M. B. Why does everyone want to fix what isnt broke??"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"The book starts with a wonderful idea that other reviewers have commented upon. Harlan has the ability to move his story along so one can not put it down. AS itdevelops one begins to focus upon different characters. The problem is that there are too many coincidences and also the end is too pat. I thought the end was just not satisfying.Harlan has so many insights in living in the suburbs. He does a wonderful job on the socialization of the car pool line and raising children."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"See storyline above.Coben's writing style has a tendency to pull you in. The pace. The mystery. The suspense.This book is worth reading, though it's not his best. Most of the mysteries and questions were thrown at you in the last few pages (making it complex enough to make you loopy).Recommended."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I READ AUTHOR'S OTHER NOVELS, AND PURCHASED THIS WITH ENTHUSIASM.

HOPE AUTHOR TAKES STOCK OF HIS IDEAS, IN THE FUTURE, OR REFRAINS FROM 'HURRY-UP WRITING'...."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"The twists, turns, and number of characters were just too much. There was definitely a surprise ending though. I'd recommend Coben's latest thriller, The Innocent over this book.(...)"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben seems to be all over the place these days. His name keeps popping up here and there. It's not really surprising, given that he has written a number of increasingly competent and popular thrillers over the past several years. But the reason for his recent notoriety may well be due to water cooler word of his latest novel JUST ONE LOOK, which is far and away his best work to date.Coben's recent novels have a unifying theme running through them: disappearance. This is not to say that all of his novels are alike; the opposite in fact is true. JUST ONE LOOK also deals with a disappearance, but in this case we know exactly what happens to the missing person. The question that keeps the pages turning and the plot chugging along is the &quot;why&quot; behind the event.The person asking &quot;why&quot; is Grace Lawson, a suburbanite who splits her time between her work as an artist and her duties as wife to Jack Lawson and mother to their two children. Grace's placid life is shattered when she picks up pictures of a recent family outing at her local photomat store and finds a picture in the group that does not belong. It seems much older than the other pictures and is not one of her family, but of five people. Grace does not recognize four of them, but the fifth person looks like a much younger version of her husband. When Grace shows the photo to Jack that evening, he denies that he's that person.Later that night, however, Jack makes a hushed phone call, drives off with the picture and does not return. Over the next several days Grace does a dangerous juggling act, attempting to shield her children from Jack's absence while trying to determine the reason for it, as well as the secret behind the photo. When Jack calls Grace shortly after his disappearance, stating that he needs some &quot;space,&quot; she realizes that he is in terrible danger. What she does not realize, however, is that she and her children are in dire jeopardy as well. Grace acquires some likely and unlikely allies, some of who seem to know bits and pieces of the puzzle of her husband's life. But when Grace discovers that her home has been under video surveillance, she realizes that the only person who she can trust is herself.Coben throws several interesting twists into JUST ONE LOOK. For one, the reader learns almost immediately what has happened to Jack. Grace also undergoes an interesting transformation, from secure hausfrau to avenging angel, even as she is dragged kicking and screaming toward it. There is also a villain, a shadowy, terrifying character named Eric Wu who is described by one of the principals in JUST ONE LOOK as being so scary that ... well, read the book. I won't give it away, as it's but one more example of Coben's ongoing growth as a writer.But what is truly fascinating in JUST ONE LOOK is the manner in which Coben weaves the undercarriage of this tale and then slowly uncovers it. Coben's narrative pacing has never been better. This is a complex tale, and in the hands of a lesser writer the explanation would have been a hurried, wrap-it-up affair. Not so with Coben and JUST ONE LOOK; matters continue to be revealed even on the final page. Even though it's only May, JUST ONE LOOK may be the beach book of this long, hot summer.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson met her husband while in France and for her it was d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, a feeling that he was her soulmate and logically he felt the same way to. They married and moved back to the states and are living in their own home with their beautiful children. They are very happy together until the day Grace goes to the photo store to pick up some pictures they developed. One of them doesn't belong with the rest. It is a picture of two young women and three men taken a couple of decades ago and she thinks one of the men in the photo is Jack.When she shows him the picture, he stonewalls her by going into another room and shortly after he drives away from the house. Grace waits for him to return, but he never comes home so she goes to the police. Jack calls her using a code word to tell her he's in trouble. The man who kidnapped Jack also killed many others and he isn't hesitating to murder Grace if she keeps on asking questions.Harlan Coben writes a superb crime thriller using so many red herrings, twists and turns that readers keep their eyes glued to the pages trying to figure out who is after whom and who is the mastermind calling the shots. The heroine is a strong willed person who refuses, even in the face of threats, to stop looking for her husband though one must wonder about the safety of the children. When she does find him, it is in less than ideal circumstances. JUST ONE LOOK is one of the most satisfying crime thrillers of 2004.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I really enjoyed this book, as I have many of Coben's. But as the mysteries are revealed in this convoluted story, a major plot error is also. Coben really muffed this one and as soon as I find his website I've just got to ask him about it! I don't want to spoil the story line for anyone, but the error involves the photograph and how the people in it are identified. Anyone else catch this? It made me crazy!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This is one of those books that sucks you in because there seems to be so much unexplained stuff at first. However, the ending explanation is so far fetched and out of left field that when it comes you leave yourself shaking your head.Grace, a married woman goes to pick up her photos from the photomat. When she gets them there seems to be an old photo slipped into her package. The photo has a very young version of someone who looks like her husband along with four other people. When she asks him about the photo, he is visually upset and abruptly leaves the house and then becomes abducted.Grace goes to the police who seem to want to do nothing to help. As the story rolls along, people are being abducted and paralyzed and tortured by an unstoppable Asian guy. Everything that happens in the story seems to be somehow connected to the photo along with a concert that Grace had attended many years ago where the crowd stampeded killing several people.There are some pretty tense moments throughout but when you find out what really is going on, it reminds you of a soap opera that tries to tie up a story line with stupid reasoning and implausible story.I heard that this is not one of the author's better books so I will try to give him another shot."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"The reason I enjoy reading Coben books is the fact that, in the middle of the story when I am completely in the dark and wondering how on earth the story will end, I can be secure in the knowledge that it will come together and make sense. As one reviewer alluded to, when I read Dean Koontz, I don't really try to guess how it will end because important players could be anyone from aliens to ghosts to members of a secret government agency. This is fine, but when I read Coben, I want good solid logic. This did NOT fit that description. This is the first Harlan Coben book I've read that left me saying - \\"You've got to be kidding\\". And, the characters weren't very likeable as far as I'm concerned. The lead female is strong, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"The plot was interesting, though overly complicated and difficult to untangle even at the the end. Finding out that virtually everyone ended up being guilty of something or other was not a satisfying end to a mystery, either.Perhaps because I listened to the (abridged) audio version of the book I felt there were gaps in the story that made it difficult to suspend disbelief. For example, the missing father's children suffered no anxiety or related behaviors while their dad was missing, a goon was watching over them, and their mother ran around trying to solve the mystery. And that mother seemed to have inordinately long periods of free time to chase kidnappers between taking the kids to school and picking them up. The story was from the perspective of a mom, but written by a man who gives the impression of not knowing or just ignoring the real impact of children on the lives of adults or of disruption on the lives of kids. This made the kids and even the mother seem more like flat plot devices than real elements of a believable story. I had a hard time caring about any of them because they were just puppets.More importantly, I was turned off by the unrelenting, even gratuitous, use of graphically depicted bad-guy torture procedures. I eventually felt used, as a reader, strung along in a posture of cringing disgust at violence used apparently in order to keep the suspense up, when better characters and writing could have carried it instead. A little graphical yuk may be ok, but I was left feeling that what could have been a reasonably enjoyable story had left me unnecessarily worse off than before I started it.This is my first Coben book and I was hoping to have \\"discovered\\" a satisfying new author. I hope the other stories are written with a more discriminating hand."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben, well known for his series featuring Myron Bolitar sports agent AKA as detective, has written four stand alone books. Previously I read the first three titles, Tell No One, Gone for Good and No Second Chance and found them somewhat remarkably similar but good and exciting reads. His latest book Just One Look again is a roller coaster ride when a woman picks up freshly developed photos from a Photomat and events begin to spiral out of control jeopardizing her husband and family. As in his other books, events from the past catch up with the presnt and the reader doesn't know who or what to believe as the good guys and bad guys change from minute to minute and the characters become more and more interesting.As in Coben's other books, though, I found each stand alone a bit more and more convolutd and by page 300 of this one I was tired of trying to figure out what was going on. I went with the flow and finished it up not really bothering to figure everything out to my liking. I do think if you've never read Coben you may find this to be a very exciting book but I am getting a bit tired of his far fetched plots. I did in the end rate it with a B since it had a few good moments but just not enough.My favorite that he's written so far continues to be Gone for Good. I would certainly recommend that title as well as his first stand alone, Tell No One."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"If you are going to buy just one book published in 2004 then this is the book for you. Coben has again written another brilliant adventure full of twists and surprises but be warned his style is a bit different in this one to previous independent novels. It is not a bad thing but if you purchase only wanting his usual old style then you may want to know. In Just One Look Coben writes a lot of pages through the main villain's eyes, similar to the way Dean Koontz or James Patterson do. It works extremely well in this novel but obviously most Coben books have you guessing who the bad guy is for most of the book, I mean you still get to that with who hired psychopath pressure point assassin Eric Wu, but like I said it's a different style. Wu is an exceptional and very interesting villain, one of my favourites by any author. The other main difference is the main victim/hero of this novel is female (Grace Lawson) whereas usually the main character is male in Coben books but again this works sensationally here. I loved this new style and it complements and blends in well with Coben's successful traditional way of writing. Coben even has aspects of his last Myron adventure in here by talking about Little Pocahontas' trial which is happening in the same real time as this independent adventure.The basic plot of Just One Look is that Grace Lawson, crippled in the Boston Massacre years earlier and now mother of two young children picks up a developed roll of film from the mall and finds an old photo amongst it with a blond girl crossed out, and amongst other figures someone she thinks could be her husband. When Jack (her husband) sees the photo he leaves the house without telling her and never returns. This is because he has crossed paths with Eric Wu an ex Korean torturer now assassin for hire who knows how to bring anyone down with his bare hands and can paralyse just with one pinch. Who hired Eric Wu? What will Eric do to Jack and others? Who put the old mysterious photo in with the others? Why did Jack react the way he did to the photo? Can Grace protect herself and her family from its secrets?Check out Coben's other masterpiece independent novels as well such as Tell No One, No Second Chance and Gone for Good and also his Myron Bolitar series, I would recommend starting those from the initial Darkest Fear novel to get the most out of them."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Is this the same Harlan Coben I've come to know and love? The Harlan Coben who gave us Myron Bolitar?Ugh.I'm about halfway through \\"Just One Look\\" and ready to cast it aside. This reads like the first-draft, fourth-rate, churn-'em-out dreck that litters bestseller lists (think Nora Roberts or Danielle Steel). Where's the trademark Coben snappy dialog? the informed insider's slant on topics like professional sports? the twisting yet plausible plots? the smart cynicism tinged with heart and style? Where's Big Cindy when we really need her?Harlan, we hardly knew ye."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I am a fan of Coben's Myron Bolitar series - always enjoyed all of them, but this thing is just not up to it. The plot is far-fetched, the main character does not ring true, and accuracy is off-center. The plot: a tangled mess of \\"rock and roll\\" tragedies and deceptions going back 15 years that seems just plain unrealistic - if fiction calls upon us to suspend our disbelief, Coben simply did not warrant my giving up any sense of what constitutes good fiction. Main character: her emotions regarding the central event in the novel are not believable - as are her choices and decisions regarding her own safety and that of her child. Finally, a character hands the main character an automatic pistol and casually tells her to pull it out, point, and start pulling the trigger - the sum of her weapons training. And Armonk, NY is across the Tappan Zee, east of the Hudson. And...The central issue is the plot. I expect crime novels/thrillers to be a bit of a stretch, but this one floats well above the reader's plane of existence and just is not significantly clever to justify that departure from the planet."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I enjoyed the writing and I was quickly drawn into the story. I was eager to find out what happened, but I was very disappointed in how the mystery was solved. Perhaps Coben was particularly rushed or uninspired when he was writing the second half of this book. I stayed in it for the pay-off, but there was none.There is actually a scene that reads like an episode of Scooby-Doo, in which the answer to the biggest mystery, solved off-stage, is revealed to the culprit.I don't mind that the scary guy is Korean, but since people don't know his name, they (and therefore, the author) repeatedly refer to him only as \\"the Asian man.\\" Gracious.I'm curious enough to read another Coben book because I enjoy the \\"my life isn't what I thought it was\\" premise, but I hope I won't be wasting my time."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have to admit I miss the original series character and when I read the inside jacket of this one I felt the author had already covered this ground in his past few stand alone books.With that said, I was pleasantly surprised that despite all this, I really enjoyed this book.I felt the characters were well developed and each had a voice of their own. By this I mean that I could read dialogue between characters and I would know who was talking. And he did this without being repetitive in their dialogue.While the plot I feel is almost too complex and little hard to grasp and buy into at the end, it sure was a fun ride getting there.Mr. Coben -- please bring back some of the humor your original fan base came to love!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben is one of my favorite authors, but this is not his best. The story never engages the reader, and perhaps even more annoying, are all the typos in the book. A few typos would be understandable, but 30-plus is unexcusable in a major novel. The typos start in the book's second sentence (&quot;stuck in that the (sic) lull when the music first starts...&quot;) , and continue throughout the book up to the third-to-last page (&quot;I know all about it. I've seen in it (sic) lots of cases.&quot;) and second-to-last page (&quot;He didn't go [] (sic) the concert&quot;). Even in spots where the book starts to mount some suspense, the appearance of yet another typo yanks the reader out of the book and ruins the suspense. It almost seems like the uncorrected proof got published as a hardcover. (Harlan, get a new copy editor!!!) I can only hope that his next book will be better."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson has a good life, a devoted husband, two lovely children, a nice home and a successful career as an artist. One day she discovers a twenty-year old photograph in with a set of newly developed family photographs. In the old photo is a group of young people, one of which looks like her husband. Her husband, Jack, denies that it is he, but he shortly disappears. The police are no help so she delves into Jack's past herself and finds that she really did not know her husband at all. Grace also has a past. She is a survivor of a stampede at a rock concert known as The Boston Massacre. After being nearly crushed to death, Grace became the poster child for the news media. In Grace's search for her husband she discovers that her past and his past are intertwined.Harlan Coben tells an intriguing story that is as complex as a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle, but never confusing. There are many twists and turns along the way with a nice surprise ending. It is an engrossing book and was very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"After a sleepless night gobbling up my first Coben novel, \\"The Innocent,\\" I rushed out and bought this one. And once again I was compelled to finish it in one day. Yes, the criticisms of other reviewers are valid. The plot is confusing and contrived, and the ending leaves you somewhat flat. Many characters aren't fully fleshed out. However, Coben does an excellent job with Grace and Charlaine, two strong, resourceful women. I was moved by his dead-on depictions of the special love parents have for their children. And his numerous pop culture references ring true. Most important, \\"Just One Look\\" is an exciting read that's impossible to put down ... which, in the end, is job one when writing an escapist mystery."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This was the first Harlan Coben book I have read and after reading some of the reviews on this site, I have decided that if they thought this was not one of his best than I can hardly wait to read his other stuff. I thought this was one of the best books I have read in a while, and I am normally a very disciplined reader and can put down a book at any time and I found myself reading this at stop lights (I was almost done and driving to work)which is something I have never done before.I found this book to be compelling, interesting and different. When you always have at least three books going, (book on tape in car, one in my handbag, and one on my nightstand) to find a new author that writes this well is exciting."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Having seen Harlan Coben's name on the covers of novels for years, I finally broke down and decided to read one. Unfortunately, I didn't pick the right one to start with.JOL starts out well enough. There is a good mystery, and it definitely keeps you interesting. Then things start to unravel. The truth starts coming out, and bit by bit the story starts becoming more far-fetched. By the time this one is over, you'll be sitting there scratching your head and wondering why your name was left out of this book...after all, everyone else in the world was apparently in on this deception. The closest I can come to explaining this is a soap opera. As the end was revealed, it was like &quot;Your brother-in-law's second cousin's third wife's stepmother was married to my twice-removed uncle's niece's third child's grandson&quot;. It was just too far out to be real.I love a complex story as much as the next guy, but even the most complex plot needs to have SOME grounding in reality--unless it's a Dean Koontz or Stephen King kind of thing. This one just stretchs the believability too far."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"OK, I've read some of the other reviews and their criticisms are valid; nonetheless, I couldn't put this book down. And I love the fact that the plot is complex, and the way Coben has so many dire consequences evolve from a few seemingly minor events. That said, I agree that many of the characters are underdeveloped, although I did think Grace was well done. My personal biggest complaint was that the REALLY BAD bad guy was so much a cardboard stereotype. I know tha psychopaths exist, but this guy was pretty far out there, and also, too much of a &quot;perfect killing machine&quot; for my taste. It just doesn't SEEM real."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Harlan Coben was born in New Jersey in 1962 and is best known for his Myron Bolitar novels. \\"Just One Look\\", however, is one of his was stand-alone novels, and was first published in 2004.Although Grace Lawson is a well-known artist, she's better remembered for an incident known as the 'Boston Massacre'. Fifteen years before the book opens, Grace was in the front pit for a a Jimmy X concert - a show that had been due to start at 8:30pm. The crowd are, obviously, a little agitated when it hits midnight and there's still no sign of the singer. Unfortunately, at that point, things move a little beyond agitation when three shots are fired. The resulting mayhem eighteen people dead and Grace, briefly, in a coma - with a variety of injuries. A year later, she movea to France to study art and meets Jack Lawson there - the man who was to become her husband. It had been love at first sight for the pair, though each kept their secrets : Grace couldn't really talk about the concert (her memories were still a little fuzzy), while Jack had a falling-out with his family - the details of which he was also reluctant to share.Grace and Jack returned to America, shortly after Grace fell pregnant with their first child. (Emma is now eight, while their more recent addition, Max, is six). Her troubles start as she picks up some freshly-developed photographs from a family day out - when she discovers a photo she didn't take in her packet. At first she thinks someone else's photo has accidentally been sorted into hers - but then she suspects it's been placed there on purpose...There are five people in the photo and, judging by the quality of the print,and the style of dress, it was taken around fifteen years ago. One of the faces has been covered with a large 'X', while another - she thinks - is of Jack...but, at a point in his life before she had met him. Later that night, when Jack arrives home from work, he sees the photo and - within a matter of minutes - nips out the front door and drives off without a word. When he doesn't return, Grace knows he's in trouble. She's right : what she doesn't know, however, is that Jack's been grabbed by Eric Wu - not a man you'd want to mess with. The police, initially, assume he's just done a runner (possibly to scratch a seven year itch). Grace, on the other hand, knows better - and so starts trying to discover what's happened to him. Luckily, she has a couple of useful allies - including noted Mafia Boss Carl Vespa and an Assistant US Attorney, Scott Duncan.Although I don't think \\"Just One Look\\" will ever be considered a classic, it's certainly much better than a Dan Brown book. Admittedly, there wasn't much in the way of tension or fear and some of the characters - the friendly neighbourhood Mafia Boss, for example - were just a little bit too convenient. There also turned out to be a few too many connections between the key players...however, I did find it to be a very enjoyable, pacey and easily read book and it's certainly worth a rattle."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"A lousy book. Having read the three books by Harlen Coben before this, I was relishing digging into this one. Those books kept me on edge--I literally couldn't stop turning the pages.This one, however, was a chore to get through. The continuity was horrible. The characters weren't very likeable. And the plot twists were, well, too twisty, like when you twist a piece of taffy too much and it gets so thin it falls apart. That's exactly what happens to this plot. It just falls apart.Somebody (it couldn't have possibly been the talented author of the previous novels, could it?) overworked this one to death!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Then pick up a Harlan Coben book. I tell my friends when they get tired of the same old suspense novels, to try one of Coben's. They are nearly impossible to figure out and the end always throws two twists at you. One, you could probably guess and the other from left field. If you read thrillers to try to guess the author's ending, then don't pick this book up. You will just get frustrated and yell, \\"No one could have guess THAT!\\" hehehe A friend of mine actually did that. But, if you read for the thrill of the ever-changing plot, love when you can't put a book down, and thrive off cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Each time I read a Harlan Coben book I am skeptical and say he's not going to suck me in using the same story each and every time. But each and every time you read his books it's like the others don't exist. This guy can really create an island where you can't wait for the next page and are afraid if you put the book down you will never make it back. This is a great read, lots of fun and has the usual warped ending. Great beach and summer reading here."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson is a happily married mother of two whose world is suddenly shattered when her husband, Jack, disappears. Harlan Coben's &quot;Just One Look&quot; follows Grace's desperate efforts to find out where her husband went and why. Did he leave of his own volition or was he abducted? The one clue that Grace has is a twenty-year-old photo that shows her husband with four other people. Who are these people and what do they have to do with Jack's disappearance?&quot;Just One Look&quot; has a strong opening but it falters towards the middle and completely falls apart at the end. Many books deal with a husband or wife who vanishes without a trace. It's one of the oldest and most effective hooks, since a missing spouse is sure to grab the reader's attention and gain sympathy for the protagonist. However, in order to sustain interest, the author must also create well-developed characters and an engrossing plot. Coben does neither. Jack is a cipher, Grace is little more than a frightened and confused woman, and the villains are straight out of central casting. Two of the clich&eacute;s in &quot;Just One Look&quot; are a mob-connected wiseguy out for revenge and an Asian killing machine who disables his victims with his bare hands.In almost every thriller written today, the reader expects the obligatory twists and turns towards the end, and Coben dutifully provides plenty of surprises. These unexpected plot developments do not save the book because they are too illogical and melodramatic to be taken seriously. &quot;Just One Look&quot; promises a great deal with a very exciting opening, but the convoluted and overwrought conclusion undermines everything that has gone before."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"If I were ever to write a book I would want to write a suspense novel about a normal person caught up into a life and death struggle beyond their control. Twists and turns of the plot would be a prerequisite with surprises galore. I would take great pains in creating the main character as the neighbor next store- no special forces agent or high powered political bigwig- just the sort of person who worries about making dinner for the family or having the time to go to the kid's soccer game. Yes, books just like what Harlan Coben currently writes.In this latest thriller, average housewife, Grace Lawson is picking up photos from her local photo developing stand. The packet, however, contains an old photo purportedly of her husband, Jack, and several other people. When she shows it to her husband, he denies that it is him. Yet, that night he disappears. Grace is determined to find out what happened to Jack. Her search takes her directly into the path of a killing machine called Eric Wu (who the reader might remember from TELL NO ONE, however, this time sans the even more terrifying Larry Gandle). At stake is not only her own life but those of her husband and children.Harlan has, once again, penned a novel that reaches to the underlying terror that lies deep in the heart of every person. JUST ONE LOOK has as its main protagonist a female ( a bit of a change for Harlan). He explores how a simple event like picking up family photos can lead into something way beyond what an average person faces. Characters are thoughtfully created with such care that even those with only minutes left to live are fully realized with complete pasts. (Eric Wu, however, is a bit of a stretch.)Harlan, for many years, has written an excellent series starring Myron Bolitar, a sports agent cum PI. They were amusing books but all of them had a bite to them. They were definitely not about sports. Now Harlan is into these standalones of which JUST ONE LOOK is the fourth. TELL NO ONE is definitely his breakout book and catapulted him onto the bestseller lists internationally. He has a lucrative contract way beyond his wildest dreams and legions of readers. These books are good and solid entertainments. They are well worth purchasing and reading on planes and by the pool. I would compare his work to that of Cornell Woolrich --the everyman placed into a perilous situation. However, I still feel his best work lies in the old Bolitar series. It was in that setting that he so effectively probed the darkness that lies in the heart of man. I know he has one or two more books to write on this current contract. However, I hope he goes back to his roots by writing about truly sympathetic characters that use self deprecating humor as a means of combating life threatening danger. You wouldn't know it by reading these books but Harlan is a very funny man. As his readership grows, however, I really don't see that happening."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I've been a big fan of Coben's books since the Myron Bolitar series. His latest, Just One Look, is a book you won't be able to put down and will keep you in suspense from the very beginning to the very end. It is well worth reading. With that said, Just One Look, on a comparative basis, ranks a notch below two of his other stand-alones -- Tell No One and Gone For Good. While the main character, Grace, is well-developed, the more secondary characters -- and there are so many of them you need a scorecard to keep track of them -- are not particularly well-developed. Further, I had some credibility issues with some of them. The basic plot is a simple and interesting one -- a suburban housewife picks up some photos from the store, one of which is an old print depicting her husband with other people from his college days. When the wife shows the photo to her husband, he leaves home and disappears. When the wife soon learns that her husband has been kidnapped, she goes off to search for him. While this plot is suspenseful, it is not especially original, as Coben has used some of his plot devices in his other stand-alones. For example, the concept in Coben's three previous books is one in which the main character's happy life is upended by some event that the reader can easily relate to, and the use of a kidnapped family member was a key factor in Coben's last book, No Second Chance. So, I'm starting to miss some of the originality that I'd come to expect from Coben. Perhaps, he needs to take a step back and have his next book or two feature the main character, Myron Bolitor, from his excellent mystery series. As mentioned above, Just One Look has many characters that at times makes it difficult to remember who's who. However, Coben does neatly tie all the loose strings together involving these characters and who did what to who at the end. Please understand that my criticisms are not MAJOR ones and should NOT deter you from reading this book, especially if this is your first book by Coben. Coben remains one of my favorite authors and I think he'll be one of yours as well."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"When I was about halfway through this book, I knew something was not right with it. Since Coben is a favorite of mine, I kept wondering: Did Coben really write this? So I came online to read other readers' reviews. That was helpful, especially the one- and two-star reviews, because those reviewers were saying the same things I was thinking as I was reading. Their reviews convinced me that it wasn't me - I wasn't crazy - and to plod on, realizing the book probably wasn't going to get any better, but I was curious enough to want to know just how bad it would turn out to be. The answer? BAD. Really, really bad."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"My first Coben book was a disappointment. The storyline started pretty good for this reader, but somewhere along the middle I got bored and realized I made a bad choice."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book started out well, it had me hooked. Then it started taking weird turns that I never quite figured out. The villian, and a really BAD one, seemed like a robot more than a person. I never did quite figure out his part in all this. I mean I did, but I didn't!The ending had me scratching my head thinking maybe I should read it again because I wasn't really sure what happened. I think I'll pass, however. It's just too confusing!I will keep reading Harlan Coben books because this is the first one I haven't loved!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"In the end, the characters are just not believable. Enjoyed the first third of the book and had to push myself to finish it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"It all starts when Grace finds a picture that does not belong in a packet of pictures that she picks up from a photomat. The picture is old, and has her husband, along with some other people including a woman with a \\"X\\" though her face. When she shows the picture to her husband he disappears, and the adventure begins. What follows is a rolling, rumbling, roller coaster ride of kidnapping, murder and deception. There are many plot twists to keep you guessing right to the end. The writing is so crisp and tantalizing that the book is difficult to put down until you have finished. Is the plot believable? Well - there are stanger things that happen in this world. In any case the book is highly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This book is classic Coben...put your hands up and enjoy the ride. Coben puts you through twists and twists and although I guessed one of the major twists at the end, I was completely baffled about the rest. Coben makes you want to read his book a second time and see what you missed; he's great! Although this book is not quite as good as \\"Tell No One\\" and \\"Gone For Good,\\" it ranks up there with \\"No Second Chance.\\" For everybody that thinks that this Coben book was not as good as his others, just remember that it is still better than 90% other books out there."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have, yet, to find the perfect mystery novel, but Coben's books are fairly close. They grab your interest from the start, throw enough red herrings at you to keep you guessing, and are an easy read.The plot in this book was well thought out.

Just One Look is his most masterful thriller yet. As always, I pick up one of his book late at night hoping to read 50 pages before going to bed, and end up staying up all night (and being a wreck at work) because I have to stay up and finish it. Great characters, the most intersting and credible plot yet, more twists and turns than Space Mountain, my only regret about this book was that it ended and I had to read other authors.I wont do a plot summary since there are many others, but let me say that this is THE BEST HARLAN COBEN YET!!!!! I only wish I didnt have to wait a year for the next one."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"This guy needs to go take a creative writing class.The plot is somewhat interesting, but the writing style is rough. Coben constantly interrupts the story, going off on some insanely boring tangent, with no relation to the plot.When he introduces a new character, he buries us with pages of the character's biography. Throughout the novel, he puts us to sleep by dedicating several paragraphs to minutiae, such as the entire morning routine of a mother that has to feed her children and send them off to school (3 pages!). I guess he doesn't have enough to say, and has to fill the pages with something.This book could have used a good editor."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"Grace Lawson was just a normal housewife until the day she picked up some pictures at the photo shop and found an old picture of her husband in college with four other co-eds whom Grace doesn't know.

Coben couldn't have been any more clearly writing this with the movie contract foremost in his mind. Between the bad prose, the inane plot, and the tacky corporate product placement, this one is a complete waste of paper."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I've loved all 10 of Coben's previous novels, but this one is utterly AWFUL. It is convoluted and several notches below his usually high standards. Miss it.Maybe, with Connelly &amp; Crais returning to their bread &amp; butter characters, Coben should consider giving us a new Myron Bolitar mystery."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"In my opinion, Harlan Coben's writting style is, unfortunately, a tad sophomoric. I hate to say it because I respect the fact that he actually wrote a book which is a huge accomplishment. In fact, he has written quite a few books. But honestly, his writing style kept me from getting very far into the book. I don't know, others might like it, I don't. Here are some excerps and you can judge for yourself:\\"Linda Morgan, the United States attorney, leaned against the back wall trying to give off the ease of Sinatra against a lamppost. Standing behind the prisoner were two beefy, nearly identical prison guards with tree-stump arms and chests like anitque armoires...Scanlon's lawyer, a ferret reeking of checkout-counter cologne, rounded out the group.\\"\\"Scanlon looked like an aging playboy who might have squired a Gabor sister in the fifties...His graying hair was slicked back, his teeth cigarette yellow, his skin leathery from midday sun and too many long nights in too many dark clubs.\\" (and that's only 2 pages in)I think a college professor might give him an \\"A\\" for his use of metaphors, similes and adjectives. I however found it to be overdone and in the end too destracting to even get through the novel. I think I will stick with the likes of Jeffery Deaver, Patricia Cornwell, David Baldacci, Ken Follett, etc. Turned out to be not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"So many authors' books get tiresome and repetitive after you read a few of them-but not Harlan Coben! Just One Look is his most masterful thriller yet. As always, I pick up one of his book late at night hoping to read 50 pages before going to bed, and end up staying up all night (and being a wreck at work) because I have to stay up and finish it. Great characters, the most intersting and credible plot yet, more twists and turns than Space Mountain, my only regret about this book was that it ended and I had to read other authors.I wont do a plot summary since there are many others, but let me say that this is THE BEST HARLAN COBEN YET!!!!! I only wish I didnt have to wait a year for the next one."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I have read several Bolitar books, and a few of Coben's stand-alone books. This one falls into his \\"middle-class thriller\\" genre, where people just like you and me find themselves thrown into mysterious and/or deadly plots. The set-up of the plot is fine, but there are so many red herrings and tangled plot threads that it becomes hard to keep up with where Coben is taking us. At the end you'll be saying \\"huh?\\" or maybe \\"duh.\\"I got the feeling I was being \\"written down to,\\" as if he were trying too hard to show that he knows all about what life is like for parents and kids in suburbia. And you'll note that he makes more than one reference to characters in his Bolitar series. This one is not worth the time you'll take to read it."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I don't know how to start, but I'll just dive in...this book is passable at best. This was my first foray into any Coben and it just left me wishing I would either have started with a different book or watched Jersey Shore instead (yes, it's that much of a waste of time). If you like more than a platoon of characters using more than two sentences to flesh them out is not even necessary (saying their cardboard cutouts is too generous, cardboard is much too thick) is your style coupled with pedestrian (at best) writing...I suppose this is the book for you. Saying that there is hardly anything or anyone worth caring about in this books is saying too much. No real story telling at work here either. No doubt you could sit and rip through it, skimming much of it, although I kept my discipline and read every word (to my chagrin), and not find it the time sink I did. Hook? Not really much of one and once it's totally revealed you just sit there and say, \\"that's it?\\". And twist, good Lord, if this is what his audience likes then more power to them. In the end, Just One Look appeared to me to be something that the author just churned out for some contractual obligation. I will say this--Just One Look, well, that's one look too many. There's a lot of self-published stuff better than this."},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"The richness of his characters and the twists of his plots in addition to just great writing and storytelling has Coben may favorite contemporary writer. I think Myron Bolitar is one of the great continuing characters of current fiction but Coben's other books are even better. Write on and don't sell your name to lessor talents!!!!"},{"Title":"Just One Look","review":"I would if pressed give this book a 3.5. Overall I thought the plot was good and well written. However, what I did have a problem with was the fact that there was a great deal of time building the puzzle/mystery, and then when it was revealed I found myself saying \\"I just don't get it,is that it\\"? It just seemed like a little toooo much effort, for toooo little results.However, I will not spend this time rehashing the plot, which most reviewers have already done, I will spend it briefly giving you an idea of why you should read this novel. Grace, the sole survivor of a massacre that occurred at a rock concert(known as the Boston Massacre), has been living her life for over 10 years with only her limp to remind her of the events of that fateful night (she doesn't really remember the incident or what really happened, only what people have told her). Having met her soulmate, and wonderful husband, Jack in France while she was recovering, she thinks life couldn't be any better. She has two small children and has become a successful artist. Anyway, her life begins to spiral out of control when she discovers an old photo in her picture order of her husband Jack with four other people, among them a picture of girl with her face crossed out. After she confronts Jack with the photo (which he denies any knowledge of), he leaves the house to never be heard from again. Grace doesn't understand what any of this could mean, and starts out to discover the truth. On the journey to the truth, Grace's life is influenced by several people, among them a grieving mobster (Vespa), who wants revenge; supportive friends (Cora); a killer confessing; a United States Attorney and brother who wants answers to who killed his sister; a crazed killer (Woo); a nosey neighbor who learns more than most about the truth; a sister-in-law with secrets to hide; and an interesting plot that begins to unravel leaving you with more questions than answers. With several killings and other evil deeds, the plot of why was Jack taken eventually comes to light. So even though you will still have a few questions at the end of the story, you would have enjoyed the winding road that you took to get you there."},{"Title":"Going Public","review":"A rather funny novel about three guys who set up a business as assassins, complete with advertising, publicly traded stock, and hostile takeover attempts.

The addition of the male view was refreshing without diluting the sheer energy of the interaction between main characters."},{"Title":"Cow country","review":"Will James' collection of stories and illustrations is a beguiling antique, first published in 1927. The theme is the changing culture of the West during the first 25 years or so of the 20th century. Cattlemen and cowboys struggle with new methods and technology. Environmentalism is threatened. Cow country gradually changes ownership, and the stage is set for clashes in vision. Out on the Y-Bench spread, the new owner is a dude who tries to impose European ideas of saddles, livestock husbandry, and range management. Grizzled Bearpaw and the boys take exception to these mandated changes. Humorous confrontations ensue. In another story, two old timers just can't stomach encroaching civilization and head west for California, until real estate developers scare them back to Wyoming. The presentation of the book is more than its content. The many charcoal and pen-and-ink drawings look as rustic and hardened as the weather beaten cowboys, wild horses, and longhorns they portray. The first person narratives of the Westerners are rich with vernacular and colloquialism. The stories are lightweight, but hearfelt. More as written portraits than tales of Western adventure. Will James' work as an illustrator compares favorably with Remington and Russell. The book celebrates his love of the land and the animals, a change of pace for modern readers. ;-)"},{"Title":"Cow country","review":"I read this book to my daughter every night as I am trying to put her to sleep. These Will James books are really good. The stories in Cow Country are full of action and always seem to have a twist at at the end.

These are great books that should never be passed up!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Longarm and the Lone Star Rustlers (Longarm Giant)","review":"Impostors being the main storyline made the novel a very far-fetched fictional.

These are mostly well-known techniques for producing web standards compliant CSS designs, however quite often their implimentation is poorly documented or non-existent. So having a diagram / screenshot rich book layout is quite illuminating. Here goes.AlphaImageLoader for IE5.5 ++This technique is great for all uses of PNG images. PNGs are particularly fun to use in stylesheet backgrounds. Looking for that plush drop-shadow? Here's the solution.Remote RolloversJust like Flickr does with notes [..] it is often handy to javascript to do remote rollovers. But is there a CSS-way to create remote rollovers? With images it's not very difficult.position the div containing the image relatively (this means every element within this div can be placed relative to the image)empty span before the link you want to tricker the hoverposition hover content absolutely (be clear, this is absolute position relative to the image div)there's a little workaround for IE doing remote rollovers, require all a:hover within the image div to border: none, so that a hover border can be place on each hotspotElastic-Liquid Hybrid LayoutsThis is one of my favorites. Using max-width as a percentage and width in ems, the layout will scale relative to the font size (which should be placed at 62.5%-62.5% of 16 is 10 pixels) but never scales larger than the browser window. Yeah!Don't forget to scale your images when using liquid or elastic layouts.set the image as a background images, and just crop it with a relative CSS boxor put the image on the page and set a width % with a max-width of the actual width of the image (&lt;a href=\\"http://tuscany.cssmastery.com/\\">book example&lt;/a>, see the three content images changes has you resize the windowMore Conditional StatementsFrom now on, this designer will be using conditional statements for all those IE6 folks who haven't yet upgraded to Longhorn or switched to a Mac.Min-width and Max-width for le IE 6This simple statement set's the min-width and max-width of #container and #footer using a javascript extension. It will break our CSS validation, therefore it should go in a ie.css stylesheet.

It was a great help! While I haven't read a ton of other CSS books to compare, you can't go too wrong by choosing this one. I still refer back to it once in a while when I want to remember things like how exactly Internet Explorer's old box model differs from the W3C version, or to figure out what's wrong with my floated layout.The book starts out with a basic introduction to CSS, and then goes into a number of more advanced tips and tricks (with examples) that help show different CSS principles in practice. There's also a good discussion of different filters you can use to target certain styles to particular browsers in case one browser renders differently than others. These filters should be avoided where possible because they make the CSS uglier (and often not technically valid), but they're good to be aware of when nothing else seems to be working.A second edition of this book was published in late 2009. I have not yet had a chance to read that edition, but if anything it should be more useful than the first. It is noticeably thicker and contains new information about CSS3, updated browser compatibility information, and additional case studies."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Andy budd and his cohorts have crafted a book that might just be the only practical CSS reference (unlike a CSS property dictionary) available to professional web developers today. The book encompasses what industry experts are already thinking and what novices need to comprehend. The authors are precise with their explanations and a majority of the book is filled with what I will call, \\"intellectual brevity.\\" In other words, as a senior user interface developer, I appreciate the fact the authors get in, tell me what I need to know, and then get out. This is done in manner that allows for the book to remain a useful resource even after the initial reading.In a nutshell, CSS Mastery encompasses a majority of the semi-advanced CSS techniques that can be found from online web development publications and blogs. Of course, a major advantage of the book is these concepts are all explained by several people with a collective wealth of CSS experienced and knowledge. The beauty of this book outside of the authors' CSS wisdom is that it brings all of these techniques to the reader in a well organized and digestible format.A monumental part of the book is stated in the first sentence of the second chapter which reads, \\"Three of the most important CSS concepts to grasp are floating, positioning, and the box model.\\" I couldn't agree more. After this statement, Andy proceeds to solidify the three concepts through the rest of chapter 2 and the entire book. Now, if you get anything out of this book it should be just how pivotal the first sentence of chapter 2 really is on the road to being a CSS master.If you're looking for something a little new, the last three examples in chapter five demonstrate some groundbreaking usages of CSS. As well, the book gives some face time to the (not so) soon to be CSS3 specification. \\"Not so soon,\\" in consideration of how long the CSS2 specification has been completed.Really about my only critique of the book is in Chapter 6, in which I think more time could have been spent detailing the styling of forms and less about their layout. In addition, I felt like the usage of tables for an HTML form layout should have been addressed.Other then my small gripes about chapter 6, the book is a must have for any CSS professional!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Andy Budd's new book 'CSS Mastery' is a real gem! I'm only half way through and can barely put it down. Its very well written and very nicely laid out, and yet it's the content that is king here!The book is filled with a wealth of to-the-point pracitcal examples, all detailed with logical rationales, for making CSS with clean mark-up really work in a world of variably compliant browsers.A perfect compliment for the seasoned web pro, and ideal for the relative nubee as well who wants to learn the craft of clean XHTML and CSS design and layout the right way from the start. For the rank beginner, a good place to dive in is Craig Grannell's comprehensive 'Web Designer's Reference', followed by Dan Cederholm's superb 'Bulletproof Web Design'. Those two works, coupled with Andy Budd's 'CSS Mastery' are sure to elevate the quality of web sites everywhere.Many of those brain-storming thoughts like \\"wouldn't it be great if I could just do ....\\" will find a positive reply here, and I suspect 'CSS Mastery' will wind up, along with Cederholm's new book, as one of the most dog-eared reference favorites among active web designers.Throw in Jeremy Keith's timely new book 'Dom Scripting' and you've got it covered from A to Z!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"The book's subtitle is \\"Advanced Web Standards Solutions\\", which partners it explicitly with the excellent \\"Web Standards Solutions\\" by Dan Cederholm, also published by friends of ED.It's a legitimate comparison, as Budd's book is good follow-on. While Cederholm's book concentrates mostly on semantics, and only introduces CSS, Budd's book is concerned mostly with the dirty truth of browser incompatibilities, hacks and the disappointments behind the theory of CSS. That's not to say he forgets markup or semantics; there are regular mentions of accessibility, which is refreshing in CSS books as they generally tend to pander to visual designers exclusively. I was also pleased to read a discussion of the recent fad of abusing the dl element.Budd is not only opposed to markup abuse; he also cautions against wanton CSS abuse:There is a rather unfortunate overreliance on hacks and filters, especially with those new to CSS. When something does not work in a particular browser, many CSS developers will immediately employ a hack, seeing it as some kind of magic bullet. In fact, some developerss seem to measure their expertise by the number of obscure hacks and filters they know. (page 155)Amen, Brother Budd!The two chapters that have been the most practical use to me as a reference have been the \\"hacks and filters\\" chapter and the \\"bughunting\\" chapter, the latter having very useful information on IE bugs and hasLayout. It's saved me hours when banging my head against a CSS brick wall. Much of this information (by no means all) is available scattered around the Web, but I'm not a great fan of Googling for frustrating hours when a deadline looms, if I can have it all explained to me in one place.For me, there's not much to fault in the book. There are a few inconsistencies between Budd's chapters and the case-studies by Messrs Moll and Collison. For example, Budd writes (correctly) on page 64 that \\"many of the most popular screenreaders ignore elements that have their display value set to none or hidden\\", whereas on page 193, Collison writes \\"Use display:none wisely ... Spare a thought also for anyone using a screenreader for hidden content still exists and will therefore be read by such devices\\". The publishers should have caught this contradiction.One of my biggest bugbears, the Accessibility Old Wives' Tale(tm), is to be found on page 130: \\".. many screenreaders will ignore text between form elements, unless they are enclosed in a label.\\". So, which screenreaders are those? Gez Lemon, one of the people I trust most to test his code with assistive technologies, has written accessible form help that has plenty of text outside labels. So this is a plea to all authors, not just Budd: if you make statements like \\"some browsers\\" or \\"many screenreaders\\", please identify the culprits.The faults I find are comparatively trivial compared with the time that this book has directly saved me - and, as I don't get paid by the hour, I like saving time. It's a worthy companion to the Cederholm book, and I've no hesitation in recommending it."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Before buying this book I owned four books on CSS including both editions of Eric Meyer's \\"Cascading Style Sheets The Definitive Guide\\" (O'Reilly). Meyer's book is a very good reference book. It gives you all the syntax and rules for using CSS; so I rate it high in giving me knowledge. \\"CSS Mastery\\" wasn't written as a reference book, it's strength is in showing you the right way to do CSS.For example, to get a web page the way want it I often find myself using many classes to differentiate selectors in my markup and thinking that's a good thing. In the first pages of the book Andy makes a case against using more than a few classes and completely convinced me to change my ways. I was technically competent, now I'm wiser. And if you are already familiar with CSS usage the book is an easy read.I recommend this book to anyone with knowledge of CSS already. For beginners I would recommend Eric Meyer's book (the O'Reilly book mentioned above) as a reference and this book as a CSS style guide. Maybe the only two books needed on CSS."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I am a quick-fix guy. If I run into a problem with my website I look for the 1st script, code, or hack that best fits my problem, then customize it accordingly. Andy is a professional. He is less concerned about the quick-fix than he is about proper code usage and browser compatiblity on a long-term scale. If you are very concerned about the latter, browser compatibility, then this book is for you.However, be aware, this book was published prior to the release of Internet Explorer 7. So although Andy goes indepth about the compatibility quirks of IE 6 he fails to cover IE 7. The good news is that IE 7 seems to have patched up some of those IE 6 quirks, so if you take Andy's advice and use the standards compliant CSS then you should have no problem adapting your website to more and more standards compliant browsers.This book also gives some previews of yet-to-be-released CSS 3 as well as proper HTML and XHTML use.Finally, as an amateur CSS programmer, I felt, before I read this book, that I was not utilizing CSS to its max.

So when I bought it I thought it would be just a good reference and gap filler, but as I started reading I realized how much I was lacking in my CSS knowledge!This book goes over everything you could possibly imagine. After reading it I understand what the browser is thinking as it parses your css and html files. It also uses diagrams and example images to show you how things work. It explains all the advantages to using CSS instead of hard coded markup.This book goes through all the styles in CSS 2.0, all the browser differences (although it does need to be updated to include IE 7), and gives example websites.One of the reasons I chose this book was because of the glowing reviews it received. It was absolutely worth it!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"From novice to intermediate, this book encompasses the basic to advanced features of CSS design. It covers the major browsers, shows issues associated with each and offers one or more solutions to solving them. As a veteran web developer/designer I bought this book as a refresher for my CSS skills but actually learned a myriad of new techniques which I can take to my job. I've passed this book along to my junior designers and we all use it as our main reference for CSS goodies.Good job Andy!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I have worked with CSS about 2 years. I read Molly E. Hlzschlag's Cascading Style Sheets - The Desigers' Edge as my first learning book. That book gave me basic knoledge of CSS but that wasn't enough. Many times I copied and tweaked other people's code from blogs but I didn't always understand what I was doing. There were missing parts in my CSS understanding. This book CSS Mastery provided me those missing parts. Andy Budd knows what many developers are missing. If you're a very begginer, you might find parts you don't understand in this book. But as you build your skills, you'll learn more and more from this book. This book is indeed a \\"must have\\" and a good reference book as well."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"OK, so I was a little hesitant to pick up this book despite all the great reviews. It was all the errors that were printed in the book that I was unsure of. Most of these errors were typos but some were errors in the code. If you don't know much about CSS these would be hard to spot.I decided to get the book, which I am still reading, and decided I should hi-light all the errors in the book so I am aware of these issues and can fix them fast with no problem. I found that the books are now being printed with about 80% of these errors fixed. All the typos are gone, and most of the code has been fixed. There are still some odd typos in it, like on page 41 it reads when it should be Some Text. But their mostly small little details. It looks like some of these errata were found after the seconded pressing with the fixes and didn't make it to print. I would still highly suggest this book to anyone wanting a further push into the CSS world. I use CSS everyday but found a lot of information in this book that I had no idea about.If you do plan to get it I would suggest running through his errata page (http://www.cssmastery.com/CSSMastery-Errata.pdf) and check for the errors. It may take a few minutes to do it, but it will at least stop you from pulling out your hair when working through the book."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I am going to go out on a limb here, and assume that if you are currently reading this review, you are interested in web design. If that's true, then you should really purchase CSS Mastery by Andy Budd (AndyBudd.com). No, seriously - Just buy it right now, and read the rest of this review later.This is one of the most valuable web design books I have ever read. You could think of it like a compilation of every cool CSS trick and technique that has been discovered / invented to date. While you might be familiar with some of these methods already, having them all at your fingertips in one place makes this book worth its weight in gold.Ever wonder how to do those cool Flickr style roll-over tags? Confused about the many available methods of text / image replacement? Longing for an effective way to comment your code? Need a better understanding of all the CSS hacks and filters (yes, there's a difference) out there? This book covers it all. It's not only smoke and mirrors though, as there are several chapters on solid principles such as specificity: descendant / child / adjacent selectors, as well as absolute and relative positioning. There are also the requisite chapters on advanced layout techniques and creating functional navigation systems.As if that wasn't enough, Andy has enlisted the help of two other CSS Masters: Cameron Moll (CameronMoll.com) and Simon Collison (CollyLogic.com) to help wrap things up. These are two guys who are not only visual design experts, but also know how to create beautiful code. They have each contribued a case study chapter, showing how to create a professional looking site from scratch, describing each step along the way.Dan Cederholm (SimpleBits.com) has described this book as \\"a card catalog of indispensible solutions, tricks, and tips that a web professional such as yourself should not be without.\\" CSS Mastery isn't for beginners, but if you're already familiar with the basics and are ready to kick it up a notch, this is the book for you. I am typically not one to over-hype things, but I was genuinely impressed with the sheer amount of information packed into such a concise read. It is definitely one that will remain near my desk, within arm's reach, for years to come."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"If you only want one book on CSS, this is it! Not only is the reference complete. But it goes one step further offering examples of how to apply CSS. In my opinion that gives it the edge over other books I have on the subject. This is one book that will never go in the garage sale!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is helpful. And i needed it for school so it worked out well =]"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I'm a developer with minimal experience designing web pages \\"by hand.\\" Most of my work on the front-end includes using built in templates and designers to do the front-end magic for me.I decided to change all that and picked up this book. In a couple of days I was up and running creating some pretty cool front-end designs...plus, the advice in this book matched almost all the advice I was getting from one of our top front-end guys."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book requires that you have some previous CSS knowledge. The first few chapters provide a quick and thorough review of things that you should already know about CSS. The rest of the book is packed full of useful CSS tips. I take Web Coding classes and can say that this book very closely follows the same teachings of professors. I would recommend this book for intermediate level CSS people wanting to hone and advance their understanding of CSS."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"If you're completely new to CSS or even if you've been working with it for quite some time but haven't quite mastered properly laying out your site with pure CSS, this book will change your [web design] life!To summarize, this book took me from \\"still partially relying on tables for layout\\" to \\"completely free of table-based-design\\""},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"very helpful if you already have a basic knowledge of css. lots of great tips and tricks for the aspiring web master."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"The book is well writtenIt gives an insight into the relationships between CSS & DOMOn reading this book you gain a full and balanced insight into the rational and practical uses of CSS"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that isn't already a CSS guru, like Andy himself and the other authors. And maybe even those expert users would find something useful in the book.It's very well written and organized. And it's a must have to any serious web developer."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Every page of this book has useful information. It is not thick, but has a lot info about CSS, and how different browsers understand (display) it. I use this book at work and I am very satisfied (unlike some other books I bought)."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is very designer-friendly. It is hard to find technical manuals that speak in plain enough English that less technical people can still find useful -- this book does just that.CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Concise: an introductory chapter, a chapter explaining the box model, 5 short chapters covering the most useful basics of a few ways to use CSS, two chapters on hacks & bugs, and two case studies. A few hours and you're done -- ready to hit the ground running. This book is by no means a thorough reference: instead, Andy Budd gets down to the point quickly with no extraneous explanations or examples.Each topic is addressed with a short, lucid explanation, accompanied by some code, useful graphics explaining concepts, and an example. Andy's style of presenting the material carries the same succinct, high-quality feel as his work (see clearleft.com).The number of techniques, bugs, hacks and filters can be quite overwhelming for a newcomer, especially due to browser inconsistencies. It is therefore imperative to start coding immediately in order to become familiar with the techniques and gain some confidence in using them. This is not due to the nature of the book, but instead due to the nature of CSS. As for me, I'll be referring to the book on countless occasions in the future."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is exactly what I want in a Web or computer book ... short and too the point. It teaches by example rather than lengthy explanations. After a brief recap of CSS basics, you jump right into real-world examples of styling tables, lists, links, etc. The section on hacks and filters serves as a quick heads up to cross-browser compatibility problems. The case studies at the end really bring everything together.Even though this book was published in 2006, it still feels cutting-edge today. This is not a CSS For Dummies book. This is for those who have already had some exposure to CSS and HTML, and want to start doing cutting-edge designs. Thanks, Andy!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"A useful, well written guide to using CSS in modern websites. I'm not the type to skim read technical manuals. I like to read them cover to cover, and this is the kind of book you will happily read in full.My only reservation is that the book seems written too much around the examples provided, rather than aiming to give more general and transferable examples to work through.I tend to try and learn most of this stuff through online tutorials, so I was reluctant to fork out any money for a book. But it was worth it."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is a strong purchase anyone looking to build upon their CSS skills. It's thorough, humorous, and to-the-point. CSS Mastery by Andy Budd should be the logical next step after reading CSS: The Missing Manual, which I highly recommend for anyone new to CSS and CSS concepts."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I can not argue with many of the other reviews which describe the errors in the book. There are more than a few. However, most advanced CSS users should be able to spot the errors relatively quickly. But lets not concentrate on the errors.This book is one of the few CSS books that lives up to its title. This is a book on Mastering CSS, and is an advanced book on CSS (the only truly advanced CSS book that I am familiar with). I find myself re-reading this book quite frequently, to reacquaint myself with the information within. CSS is all about details and the results in multiple browsers. This references helps describe the differences not by simply pointing them out, but by illustrating why they occur.Highly recommended book... any developer who uses CSS should have this reference at their disposal."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Received book almost immediately...enjoyed the contents. So far, this is one of the best books I've read on this subject. I wish i would have read this one first."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book was in a sense life changing for me. It helped lay the foundation for my understanding of CSS and ultimately led me to a job in web development. The writing is very accessible and easy to read. I highly recommend it for anyone who is starting out with web standards."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is well written, a breeze to read from cover to cover. It is laid out well, with a logical progression of topics. And it cleared up many misconceptions I personally had with how to use CSS. Unfortunately, CSS references on the internet often use bad techniques due to a misunderstanding of what some key declarations mean. In my attempts to emulate some of these techniques, I frequently found myself having to make large amounts of change for browser compatibility, etc. This book has shifted my perspective on how things should work. Since then, my time spent fine tuning has been minimal.I would highly recommend it to anyone who was self taught and having troubles getting things to work like desired. Great for beginners up to intermediate too. I think anyone who is truly advanced in CSS will be familiar with most of what is covered, but maybe not bad as a reference."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"If I were to recommend one professional level book on CSS, this is it. It offers real world solutions that work across browsers and that are fully standards compliant. Explanations are clear. Examples are well chosen and described and I've found solutions for head scratching problems that actually work.This is probably not the first CSS book that a web designer should buy. Take the \\"Advanced\\" part of the title seriously. But if you have your HTML and chops and a basic understanding of CSS, it definitely belongs on your bookshelf. Or if you're like me, it will be handy on your desk with coffee stains on the cover. It's my first choice reference for anything CSS related."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I heard that this book was for \\"Advanced CSS Programmers\\" a while back, so I didn't get it. However, I got it a couple weeks ago because since then I picked up a basic understanding of CSS. I'm half way through the book, and I just want beginners to know that you should get this books first. It's a great introduction, and everything is so well organized. The code is all explained with great detail. This is going to be a very valuable source for me for years to come. Get it!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This is a decent book on advanced CSS, although there is more coverage given to CSS basics than I would have thought. Pretty much everything I read in this book I have read at an earlier time on one of the many excellent CSS sites on the web, including w3Schools, aListApart, 456 Berea Street, etc etc. While this book puts it all in one place, its easy to build a bookmark collection of good articles online that you can cut and paste from. This will likely be the last web technology book I will buy...online has surpassed the printed form in both quantity and quality. I do have some gripes with the specific content covered - much of it covers what I consider to be pointless chrome like dropshadows and rounded edges, and other gimmickry. Yet where is the discussion about modelling css for large organizations? I work in a firm where literally hundreds of people are using css everyday, and there are serious large-scale modelling issues.[...]"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"After going through a round of book buying on Amazon (mainly Ajax and PHP books), I originally decided that this would be a 'glancer' at Barnes and Nobles. Having spent over a year designing full CSS w3c-compliant sites, I though there wasn't too much more I could learn on the subject. A day later I spent over an hour at B&N; reading this book and then decided to purchase it. It's that great.This book doesn't just tell you about CSS, it shows you how to do it right, in both a standards-supporting approach and a clean, efficient, code-consolidating way. While it's not necessarily for beginners (it doesn't discuss basics) it should eventually be read by anyone who thinks they've mastered CSS or would one day like to.Among other things here are some things in the book that I found useful:-The CSS box model and how it works. [Including why margins collapse on one another.]-CSS Image maps, drop-shadow methods, and rounded corner methods - [All fascinating and useful.]-Using CSS with dynamically created content [One tip in particular that really helped me out.]-Creating icon links via padding-left, nesting absolute divs inside relative divs, and other creative ideas.I plan on getting my work to purchase a copy of this book and make it mandatory reading for any future web designers we have. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It's half the price then what you'd find at the regular bookstore and you'll definitely get your $20 worth."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I gave this book five stars because it fit the needs of our development team perfectly. It is relatively short, but not too fast-paced, it contains plenty of useful and practical examples, it is forward looking in that is mentiones some tricks that are not supported by old browsers but will be supported by most browsers once IE7 comes out, and yet it is well structured and well written, in a way that keeps the reader interested throughout most chapters.Our small team of Ruby on Rails developers used this book to get up to speed on modern CSS with a lot of success and very short ramp up time. I would highy recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their understanding of modern CSS, get very practical advice and knowledge but not to get drowned in details or history."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Yeah, I have quite a few books on CSS [I don't think it's easy to learn really, one would think so!], and so far this one takes the cake. Even though it says 'Mastery', yet the author is actually quite thorough on all the terminologies, etc. even if you're just starting CSS. Certain things take a bit longer for me to absorb, but he does an excellent job explaining them.Start with this book."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"In my small opinion this is a must-have book for designers wanting to learn CSS. It's probably not for the hard-core coders but more for the massive number of designers who do web as part or all of their service who want to step up their skills.As well as an excellent foundation explanation, the book shows perfect examples of pretty much all the key elements you would want to know (multiple list styles, image usage, navigation methods to name only a few).I found this book lit a lightbulb above my head several times about things that I just couldn't get my head around before as well as made me understand the foundations well enough that I could jump online and find solutions (that I could understand - not just cobble together) to more advanced techniques.I've bought a few CSS books in my search over the last year or so and can honestly say that nothing else has come close to what this book offers in every respect.also, as a small note: it made a change to use a book made for designers that actually used great design in both the book and the examples shown. Too many other books are written by people who call themselves designers yet use terrible examples and methods. This may seem unimportant but it's not. How can someone teach you design tips when they may not know the right angle of approach."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Mastery in CSS design is not just being able to create the layout you want that looks great in Firefox; it is being able to do so and be confident that you know how it will present in older browsers and IE 5/6. This book will get you there.Budd describes all the usual techniques for doing total CSS layouts but includes all the gotchas that you have to troll Google for when debugging. It seems like every other paragraph has a last sentence saying 'oh yeah, add this bit so MSIE 5 doesn't barf'. Hugely valuable book for understanding the overall techniques as well as the weird little browser errors and compatibility issues that can take hours to track down and fix."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"The book started out very good by clarifying a few things I missed in Elizabeth Castro's - XHTML & CSS. The author's explanation of the cascade & specificity was not very clear. He only gives you a basic introduction to positioning & fails to truly teach you how to use the CSS positioning properties in an effective manner. My top complaint though is the fact that the case study at http://tuscany.cssmastery.com breaks in IE7 (W T F ?) I would suggest reading Michael Bowers Pro CSS & HTML Design Patterns for a much more informative view of the cascade, specificity & positioning along with code that actually works in projects you may be trying to style up now! That being said - the book does have good sections on commenting your markup, application of filters & hacks & troubleshooting your designs."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is solid and informative. The author's writing style is clear and professional. I like it. The book includes discussion of the box model, margins, background images, sliding door techniques, form styling, liquid layouts, rollovers, IE issues, and some cool tricks such as the elastic image. There, the image is styled with percentages instead of pixel measurement. This allows the image to scale with the liquid page layout. Good stuff!Calling it \\"CSS Mastery,\\" I expected something more, something jaw-dropping. The dotted leader isn't bad, but I've seen it before. I know from trawling the net that Dave Shea has an article at \\"A List Apart\\" called \\"CSS Sprites: Image Slicing's Kiss of Death\\" (2004). In it, he demonstrates how to set up a CSS-driven light-up nav panel with different shapes and colors for each button. The technique relies on a bitmap sprite sheet. That trick isn't in here. It should be. It would be great if one of the vaunted CSS gurus (and there are many) would produce a truly advanced CSS book that includes all the wild and visually impressive things one can do with CSS. I had high hopes this would be that book, but no.So this book is more for people who are new to CSS design, but it is a good book and worth the money. It does include lots of useful information, and I did pick up a few tips. The author elegantly combines ideas I've seen in various other places. Less experienced coders will learn a lot from reading it, but it doesn't offer as much for more advanced CSS designers. Therefore, I give it four stars. Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I'm a big fan of Eric Meyer's CSS books and used to recommend one of them to CSS neophytes. Now I'm recommending \\"CSS Mastery.\\"The trick with CSS is getting the core concepts mentally cemented in place. \\"CSS Mastery\\" is well-written, well-organized and extremely clear. That makes it approachable and that means what you read will stick.\\"CSS Mastery\\" is not a CSS reference manual.

It wasn't until a friend showed me some cool techniques from the book that I properly read though it and regretted not buying it sooner!Though it's aimed at the intermediate web designer, it is well written and I would certainly recommend this as an essential buy for all web designers. The book begins with Clear:Left's Andy Budd provides most of the content starting with a chapter about well-structured and meaningful mark-up. It's these best practices that will help catapult you into the realms of CSS Master! It then recaps on the box model, positioning and floats, making it easy for a beginner to pick up this book and run with it, before moving into the techniques, with clear and concise examples, including a couple of good chapters on bugs and hacks.The final two chapters are where Simon Collison & Cameron Moll step in to demonstrate these examples in two real-world showcase websites.

Their tips and suggestions will save hours of experimenting and give you and understanding of why things work."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This is actually the FIRST promgramming-related book i've ever purchased from my own free will. As a programmer and graphic designer, everything I have learnt with CSS has been self-taught from all the great tutorials and CSS sites plastered over the web.Now, I am a pretty good CSS developer, but upon opening the first chapter I knew straight away, this book will sharpen my skills more than what i thought possible. I thought to myself intially, I hope this isn't a book written by a bunch of old, boring people who don't have a clue about cutting edge techinques with web 2.0 (i know, i know, it's only a term) and that they wouldnt cover things like CSS hacks, workarounds, etc.Oh was I wrong. This book is written by people who are the behind the cutting edge designs we are inspired by today and cover topics from the box model to hacks and workarounds commonly practised today.I can't go into too much detail because believe me, there is too much to cover. But seriously, CSS Mastery is one helluva book. I gave it an easy 5."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I bought this book just looking for some tips on things to do and not do with my CSS, and for that purpose, it delivered perfectly. The pages are filled with useful bits that cover basic and pretty advanced topics in CSS. Best of all, there are a lot of snippets with useful hacks to make code work cross-browser.If you are a self-taught web developer/designer, I would definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I LOOOOVE the fact that this book is STRAIGHT TO THE POINT! It's only 244 pages but with NO FLUFF!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is chock-full of real world design experience and challenges with the amorphous convergence of browsers and CSS standards. Very useful and well written. It was to-the-point, and avoided overexplanation. Not a reference manual, but rather an implementation and troubleshooting guidebook."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I was having trouble finding a CSS book that could help when I realized that I could stop looking at beginner books and move on! This book is great; in the first chapter alone I learned 4 things and just kept learning the whole way through. A great resource and easy to understand."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This is one of the best books on the subject I read so far. There is much stuff here however, and sometimes many concepts are concentrated in just a few lines. It will take time to test all this knowledge."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This is without hesitation the best book on CSS I have ever read. Furthermore this book will make me reread the other CSS books I have so that I may at last grasp all the techniques hidden in them behind all the mumbo jumbo (you know when the author says \\"do it that way because it's the way it's done\\" - really meaning that's the way he does it but never explaining why he does it).A must buy."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I joined with a group of people, all learning CSS from the same book.

You will learn everything you need to create a good CSS site. Enough said!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book has some useful information and is really targeted to the hardcore CSSers, who already know the basics (& a little bit more). It outlines clearly many topics and use some good examples (with some minor typos). If you are a beginner, I would not really recommend the book as it may overwhelm you with too technical stuff and exceptions. A good way in learning is not to provide exceptions at the beginning of a learning experience, but more towards the end. But that always happens with folks who know their stuff too well. So, get your basics and foundation right first, know about CSS and THEN go for this publication."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Content Overview:This book by Andy Budd covers CSS topics from a beginners level to a more advanced level. I'm an advanced CSS user, but I actually enjoyed reading the entire book from cover to cover. I find that reading over things you already know or use is a good idea; you never know when you will pick up a little trick that will save you some time every time you are writing CSS. Plus, if you really do know and use a technique 100%, you can give yourself a pat on the back..haha.Topics covered in this book include:* Doctype* Margin Collapsing* Box Model* Using Background Images* Relative, Absolute, Fixed Positioning* Image Replacement Techniques* Styling Links, Lists, & Forms* Layouts (2 & 3 Column, Elastic, Fluid, Fixed)* Hacks & Conditional StatementsWhen I read a book, I put bookmarks on the MOST important parts. These are of course the most important to ME, maybe you wouldn't even care about these topics. I do this so it's easy to get back to these sections of the book when I'm designing and coding.. so I don't have one of those, \\"I read about that somewhere\\" moments. Below I will quickly explain what I found to be the \\"bookmark worthy\\" parts of the book.THE REST OF MY REVIEW IS HERE:[...]"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I'm very surprised that no one has mentioned the glaring errors in Chapter 3. A lot of the code does not match many of the names from the downloaded files. The code from pages 52-53 is identical to 50-51 even though it mentions that there are different images. The color they mention doesn't match the images. So far, NOT IMPRESSED!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I've gone thru half the book, and I'm very disapointed to say the least.I've done some html and css for abaout a year now, and I have'nt had any problems following a book in those subjects until now.The images that you need isnt there and when they are there the exercices doesnt work as you expect, inspite that I doublecheck 5 times so that I don't forget something in the code.. so boring.I'm convinced that most of the \\"5-star\\" reviews are sent in by the authors themselves. I dont recomend this book."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book is a good alternative to the Zen book as it is completely task focus. You pick this book up, and you learn what you need to learn very quickly, the authors of this book did a great job organizing material so that it is easy to focus in on what you need very quickly."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I'm not done with this book, but I feel I have learned a great deal about the do's and don't of css design. I have this book and CSS the missing manual; they are both very good and would recommend them both.This book focuses on good CSS design, it is not really a CSS reference manual there are many other books that do that well. What this book does is show you what works in real life and what doesn't."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Very well done and enjoyable to read. I will caution however, that it is definitely for Advanced CSS coders. Nevertheless, the examples were really good and references to other links and websites very helpful as well."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"CSS Mastery by Andy Budd is basically updated version of Web Standards Solutions by Dan Cederholm. I wouldn't hesitate tell anyone Web Standards Solution is the best CSS book out there, but CSS Mastery makes it complete. I recommend to read Dan's book first because of his excellent teaching style, and then enjoy Andy's get-to-the-point style with this book."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This is a great book, but not suitable for novices. This was my first book about CSS, and I realized that you need to have a fundamental understanding of CSS before you dive into CSS Mastery. So, if you are a beginner get your basics somewhere else. If you are an intermediate CSS coder, this will teach you many new tricks.However, it is missing CSS references."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"After giving a reputable online college a chance, I found myself frustrated with their teachings of xHTML in a class called \\"WWW Fundamentals\\" which talked about CSS and I didn't learn what I needed to know about writing CSS code for the web. I decided to look through Amazon.com's extensive list of books and came across CSS Mastery, by Andy Budd. This book taught me more in a single week than what my class at the Art Institute taught me in 6 weeks. Through this book I have successfully kicked the habit of \\"table based design\\" and now I'm designing web standard based custom web pages using &lt;div> tags and CSS.Tables is for tabular data now and I find I can get more control over my web pages using CSS. This book also teaches you how to overcome the most dreaded browser of all time- Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0 (although I don't hack for 5.5 since it's now a dinosaur) due to it's loose interpretation of CSS standards. Anyone looking to get more control of their web designs should pick up this book and read it several times. From it, you will finally understand important fundamentals such as: The Box Model, Redefining Tags, Class, and Pseudo-Class, Floats, and positioning.I have been recommending this book to everyone who is looking to better their skills in CSS and you can see most of my work online:[...]This may be the best money spent on a book if you are a web developer.As of 2010 I now own an advertising agency ( [...] ) and I still find myself using this book from time to time. I even recommend this book to my employees!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This was the first CSS book that I purchased. I was always hesitant to purchase a book on CSS because most of the resources that I've found have been mostly beginner's tutorials or instruction and I felt that I had at least a \\"beyond beginner's\\" understanding of CSS. I wouldn't go as far as saying I'm an expert at CSS, but at least mid-level to advanced. However, this book had some previous good recommendations from amazon.com so I bit the bullet and bought it. I must say that I was NOT disappointed!This book starts off with a very quick introduction/recap of CSS basics including good code structure and organization, validation, DOCTYPES, common selectors including IDs and classes, pseudo-classes, and the advanced selectors such as universal, child, attribute and more, and some wonderful reference on the specificity and inheritance, or the \\"Cascade\\", the core of CSS. Although this introduction is provided, it is relatively short at about 25 pages and I would suggest a good working understanding of these basics first, as it will help understand the rest of the book easier as opposed to trying to learn CSS for the first time from this book. The following chapter is another quick 15 pages with on \\"Visual Formatting Model Recap\\" including the Box Model and Positioning, two EXTREMELY important concepts to understand CSS properly. Although it is short, it is an extremely powerful section.Chapter 3 finally jumps head first into the code with \\"Background Images and Image Replacement.\\" With the movement towards \\"Web 2.0? websites, one of the most common features you'll see in these websites is rounded corners. These can be difficult to achieve successfully and the authors make it very easy. This chapter also touches on different drop shadows and image replacement techniques, which are useful for placing a logo in place but still having the text remain search engine friendly. Chapter 4 is a fairly short chapter on \\"Styling Links\\" with some interesting uses of attribute selectors.Chapter 5 is all about \\"Stylig Lists and Creating Nav Bars\\" including the popular \\"Sliding Doors\\" popularized by Douglas Bowman of Stopdesign and first published in October of 2003 in A List Apart online magazine. During the section on creating nav bars, this chapter shows how to use CSS sprites for rollovers and visited links, something which I'll be blogging about soon. Chapter 5 also shows how you can use CSS to create image maps, something I've never even thought of doing with CSS.The next two chapters are two of the best in the book I think. Chapter 6 deals with \\"Styling Forms and Data Tables\\", while Chapter 7 tackles \\"Layout\\". I think that styling forms properly can be one of the most difficult things to do in a website Chapter 6 shows some good tips and tricks to handle this properly. After all the chapters on styling elements, comes the final code chapter which deals with Layout and shows how to center designs, create two and three column layouts, and liquid, elastic, and hybrid (elastic-liquid), or fluid, layouts.As any web designer knows, IE doesn't do the best job of displaying HTML and CSS properly according to the W3C. Fortunately, the last two chapters in the book are about \\"Hacks and Filters\\" and \\"Bugs and Bug Fixing\\", two excellent chapters for dealing with the countless IE CSS bugs. Finally, the last two chapters of the book are Case Studies that put everything together and take you through building two different web sites in a Web Standards way with CSS.Overall, this is an excellent book, one I'd highly recommend to any web designer, or CSS developer, looking to expand their knowledge of the powerful language that is CSS. Definitely worth adding to your library. On an additional note, this book is published by Friends of Ed, a fantastic publisher of technical books, and one of my favorites. I currently own 8 books published by \\"Friends of Ed\\" and 2 more from their parent company Apress, all of which are excellent books."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Not a beginner's book and thank god for that - beginners should start online anyway.If you've been working with CSS for a while but have some nagging questions that never seem to get answered about the tricky stuff like certain layouts and centering, this is the place to go. Andy Budd appears to possess that rare quality that makes for an excellent how-to author which is a deep awareness of just how hard it was to come by his own solutions to CSS issues and focus on those in his book rather than just reiterating stuff you could get from w3schools and peppering it with the occasional tip that's useful."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I'm a jack of all trades freelance developer. I buy a lot of computer-relatedbooks. I'm usually disappointed. But not with this one.This book not only has the straight scoop on css positioning I was lookingfor (plus backward compatibility tricks for IE6)it is also well written and easy to read.I don't see how this book could be given anything less than the top possiblerating."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"As a long time user of CSS, I figured I would pick up a few gems from reading CSS Mastery. I was dumbfounded when it seemed to lift the wool from my eyes and shake up the way I analyzed CSS related tasks. Andy Budd is a CSS god and proves it with his clear and concise examples and explanations. Anyone that works with CSS on a regular basis is doing themselves a disservice by not reading CSS Mastery."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"When I heard Andy Budd (http://www.clearleft.com/, http://www.andybudd.com/)was writing a CSS book I knew I had to get it. Andy is one of the top UK web designers for past years and anything he has to say you should listen. :)This book is for anybody who has played around with CSS a little and wondered \\"what the h*ll can I do with this stuff?\\". CSS has been around for awhile now, but only recently has the most current browsers been able to support the cool stuff you can do with it. What cool stuff? You need to buy the book to find out, but I'll give you some highlights...First off, the first chapter explains how to use document types, divs and spans, validation, basics of CSS (selectors, pseudo-classes, child and sibling selectors, attribute selectors, etc), how cascade and specifity works, and how to organize your style sheets. A great primer to the rest of the book.The 2nd chapter focuses visual formatting with CSS with the Box Model, Positioning and Floating. This is an important topic because creating CSS layouts requires a good understanding of how these topics work (and work together) in creating \\"real-world layouts.Chapter 3 talks about using background images and replacement in creating rounded corner effects, drop shadows (4 different kinds), and some cool image replacement for optimizing search engines and screen readers (accessibility).Chapter 4 has some great examples on styling links to create efficient CSS buttons without the images or the JavaScript for the \\"roll-over\\" effect. Yes, CSS can create some cool buttons without you ever having to use Photoshop. :)Chapter 5 continues with styling links but extends it in showing you how to create button nav bars (horizontal and vertical) and adds a few tricks with using some image placeholders and sections to create some nice looking professional navigation for your website.Chapter 6 focuses on the right way to use tables: for displaying data (not layout for web sites - no more nested tables). With the use of the very popular border-collapse property and others, Andy shows some very eye-please table layouts.Chapter 7 in my opinion is the meat-and-potatoes of the book. Its goes over some how to use CSS in creating some standardized layouts. The whole point of CSS is to separate your content and layout and this is the way to go. It is explained in a very easy to follow manner with plenty of screenshots to show you each step.The rest of the book (Chapter 8 and Chapter 9) review the common and not-so-common CSS hacks that are used to overcome some browser deficiencies. I can't tell you how many website I had to search to find out about these, and its all here in these 2 chapters!.The last part of the book has 2 Case Studies that show how a website created purely with CSS was created from beginning to end. A great finish to a great book.Throw out all your other CSS books and just get this one."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This is quite a useful book, as has been well documented in other reviews. The tips are helpful, the examples are useful, and the typography and layout are easy on the eyes.However -- and this is a big however -- the book is riddled with technical errors. The errata file, available for download from the publisher as a PDF file, currently runs a whopping 11 pages. While a small handful of errors in a technical book's first edition is inevitable, 11 pages is not a small handful for a book as thin as this. It's really inexcusable that so many errors -- some of them quite obvious -- made it past the editor."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Before you buy this book from all the glowing reviews check this link below, & it will show you all the aggravating typos in this book. (10 total pages of corrections.)http://www.cssmastery.com/CSSMastery-Errata.pdfIt makes it very irritating to use.The book is good if you are ready to stick with it, but before I buy from these authors again, I am waiting for the errata to be a few months old. It kind of feels like a ripoff to get a book that you have to constantly go back & forth to a pdf (painful) to make sure it isn't a typo on your part when css does not work as expected.I like friends of ed books in general, but we do pay money for these things as customers & should demand more from authors."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"While I don't recommend this book for beginners, it is close to a perfect intermediate text on using CSS well. The book covers the most common tasks a web designer will encounter, and clarifies some of the complexity of CSS. The book also covers cross-browser issues - the most common problem that web developers will encounter."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"It's been awhile since I've enjoyed a good technical book. Most of the time they drone on and on about stuff I either already know or more often, stuff I don't know and would take years to know. It's so great when I find a book that matches where I'm at technically and one that really becomes part of my everyday working life. Designing with Web Standards was one, CSS Mastery is now the other.Andy Budd now lives right next door to Zeldman on my desk. Seriously, CSS Mastery is a great title. It's not beginning CSS, which means you should have some working knoweldge of CSS already before you pick it up. This isn't a book that teaches you to know CSS, it teaches you to master it.Andy covers the stuff that will supplement your existing knowledge. He doesn't waste time telling you about the difference between a class and an ID, or the value of shorthand. What he does tell you is why some margins collapse in some browsers and not in others, and how to fix the problem. He briefly explains the attribute selector, but goes right into how and when you might want to use it.The chapter I found the most valuable to me was the section on forms and tables. Being primarily concerned with layout and text, I haven't had to spend a lot of time looking at data, whether it's being input (form) or output (table). Again, Andy doesn't spend too much time talking about the details of creating a form or a table, but he doesn explain how to style each section of data with real-world examples and backup ideas, or alternatives to his style.I especially love the last two chapters, where Andy let's Cameron Moll and Simon Collison have at it with a couple of design, applying some of the things Andy talks about in the book. It's awesome to get their perspective, and it adds a ton of credibility to what Andy has to say.I recommend this book to anyone who has a firm grasp of CSS already and wants to take it further. If you're not completely comfortable with CSS, you might want to check out some other resources first. Or... just be aware that you might not get some added explanation to Andy's techniques because he assumes you already know."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"If you are a web developer or designer and haven't read this book yet, you are cheating your employer for the extra time you spend, and you are cheating yourself. Doing web dev without the knowledge of this book is like repairing an automobile with a pair of pliers. It's not the easiest way to get things done.The mystery of why some divs don't hold their size, why they don't stay in place, how to get divs to wrap, and then more importantly, stop wrapping.Yes, you'll learn how to make web 2.0 looking tabs, and rounded corner boxes. But you can find that code on the Internet. You get this book so you can understand HOW that stuff works."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I worked with this book for about 4 days over the holidays playing with CSS. When it initially arrived, I was suprised that it was only about 1/2\\" thick. The first two chapters are basically a recap of CSS at the upper /intermediate level.I really wouldn't recommend this book for someone that wants to learn CSS, but rather, this book should be used for those who are looking for a reference on how to deal with specific browser issues( especially IE ) and CSS.There are two major issues that I do have with this book. One, the author tosses out bits and pieces of CSS source code, but never includes the source code in its entirety. You can, of course, download the complete source code from the authors site. The problem with this is that if you have the full source, but the book only explains specific elements, you may become lost when viewing the full source.Second, I belive that the author could have included more detailed information on real world problems when dealing with visual layouts. For example, CSS has nifty features like being able to place a border around a box, something that you have to do with spacers when using tables. However, coming from a table based layout world, you can split a table in half, and in the bottom right column stick in a footer that will \\"float\\" with the contents of the left column, something that seems to be a bit of a challenge to do. Yes, maybe I need to go back a step and find another book that details this information, but from the books description, I came to believe that these types of scenarios would be discussed.Nearly every page of the book deals with CSS and how IE needs a hack to display properly. It almost makes the reader feel over consumed by the fact that CSS is just lovely, but \\"I\\" need to keep a complete journal on everything to include to make CSS work with IE. Actually, the author should just come out with a pocket reference book named \\"The Complete CSS Hacks Pocket Reference\\" - that nearly sums up what this book is about.I'll probably stick this book on the shelf, as I know it will come in handy at some point when dealing with specific problems that I may encounter with CSS and those pesky IE issues. Overall, the book should simply be named \\"How to make IE display CSS properly\\" rather than CSS Mastery."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Well, maybe I don't know everything there is to know about CSS, but I totally refurbished the look and feel of my web site with the help of this book alone.In particular, I brought a web site that looked like it was done in the \\"stone age\\" of the Internet (you know, the 1990's) into the 21 century with a state-of-the-industry look and feel -- while preserving the brand identity -- with this book alone.I had never used CSS at all before, and I accomplished this during my \\"down time\\" in a week.If you are new to CSS and want to get up to speed quickly, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"To my web designer friends who are ready to move beyond DreamWeaver/GoLive and start doing things the \\"right\\" way, I have been recommending Dan Cederholm's \\"Web Standards Solutions\\" as the best beginner's CSS and HTML guide. I also tell them that they should buy this book, CSS Mastery, at the same time and start reading it once they have absorbed all of W.S.S.CSS Mastery doesn't QUITE cover enough of the basics of applying CSS to HTML for it to qualify as a beginner's book. However, it does such an incredible job of covering every possible aspect of designing with CSS that it makes the perfect intermediate book.When beginning to learn web design using pure XHTML and CSS, there is a lot of ground to cover, especially if you are used to working with tables. You can either spend countless hours online searching for all the tricks and work-arounds necessary to effectively use CSS, or you can buy this book and find them all in one place."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Great book. This covers more advanced topics like hack management and teaches frontend developers to work around known browser bugs. Andy Budd does a great job explaining the \\"hasLayout\\" issues and proposes workable solutions. One thing of interest was the remote rollovers that use CSS - the CSS version of image maps.He also does a great job keeping \\"code\\" consilidation as an ongoing, underlying premise throughout the book. He uses a few examples of combining classes, which help keep the (X)HTML and CSS bloat factor down to a minimum.The idea of fluid or liquid layouts is taken one step further than other books on CSS. He focuses on making all elements within the site fluid, not just the text and parent containers. With the methods taught in this book, your images will also respond to the size of the browser window. Nice touch.He discusses advanced topics in a manner that are easily digestable. We saw a British Invasion in the 60's with the Beatles. It looks like we may have another British invasion now - in the world of web design and web standards. He is one of many outstanding developers/authors from England who are rising up in the web arena."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"CSS Mastery is a wonderful book if you want to learn CSS and the correct way to code it. There are a lot of CSS resources out there and some lead to invalid code, this book shows you the best way to create valid CSS code. I highly recommend this book to anyone however, if you are new to web design and CSS it might be a little intimidating."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Having taught myself CSS layout from what I could g00gle on the net I often found CSS-P more trouble than it was worth. CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions helped me understand things that weren't so obvious to me like specificity, browser incompatibilities and hacks, and how to debug a layout. I can honestly say this book has saved my designs from eternal cross browser debugging. It is a wonderful book for anyone who understands CSS but hasn't grasped it fully. The book also explains some of the limitations of CSS confirming that CSS is not the final solution for web design.The only minor disappointment was when I finished the book and wished there was more. There are only two case studies at the end of the book, websites that Andy explains how to build, but they are fairly thorough examples. I feel like I am now ready to create more complex CSS based web designs."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"After checking out barnes and noble and deciding it was too expensive, I came to Amazon.

It just needed to be done fast and it looked good in IE 6 (which is what all of the users on the intranet for the company I work for used), but as time moved on, our intranet tools became more complex, and the company began supporting other browsers with better standards such as IE7 and FireFox, I knew that I had to do things the right way, which prompted me to get this book.

I've used CSS in a limited manner for years, but never done any really serious development. This book helped me gain an actual understanding of what is going on behind the scenes. For example, I never realized that vertical margins are collapsed. It also helped explain some of those annoying float clearing issues. If you already know about those, you may be looking for a more advanced book, but it does cover these beginner areas very well. I knock off a star for lack of coverage.

Andy Budd does an incredible job of articulating the different aspects of CSS. From basic positioning to advanced layout and \`tricks.'The book's style is a very easy read, packed full of great code snippets and screenshots. Andy goes through each aspect - and gives you several options to achieve different tasks. So, while some may prefer method A, he also covers methods B, and C. This gives a designer a great arsenal of tools to get the job done. While showing the different methods, he also goes into detail about the positive or negative effects of using one method over another (such as image replacement).While the book is an easy read, it seems targeted to the more advanced CSS developer. Each chapter seems to build on the previous, giving you a strong foundation to work with. By the end of the book, you are ready and itching to dive in and create something elaborate. In fact, the last 2 chapters are case studies by Cameron Moll and Simon Collison - and they only fuel the fire to get started right away. Their case studies present fictional businesses and websites, demonstrating many of the techniques covered throughout the book. This gives you a hands on visual to play with and tweak, and help you get a better understanding of different nuances of CSS.If you work with CSS everyday then this book is a MUST have.

It is quite heavy I must admit as many times I find myself needing to re-re-read parts of some chapters and some parts I just have to skip and come back to when I come across a similar situation in my work.It's worthy to have on your bookshelf but definitely needs a bit more time than other books I have to digest all the new information."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"There are just so many positive things that I have to say about this book I'm not quite sure where to begin. First, I really wish I came across this book last year when I began learning about designing Websites with standards based CSS and HTML.In that time, I spent countless hours on all kinds of different reference and CSS group sites reading articles and copying suggested fixes and CSS solutions. I accumulated a dozen authoritative links, some with handfuls of links themselves, to reference CSS solutions, fixes to particular quirks and of course hacks and filters. However, amidst the sea of information you still really end up experimenting yourself to determine the particular merit of one solution to another... all of which adds up to a pretty high learning curve which is why some experienced veteran designers still use tables to some extent for layouts.However, with this book. Andy Budd lends an authoritative, straightforward and experienced voice to the elements, quirks and challenges that you'll face as a CSS designer. Plus he steps you through the solutions without weighing you down with unnecessary technical discussions and jargon. Here is a problem, here is a damn good solution. Some other reviewers have gone more indepth about this book and many suggest only intermediate level designers should use it but even as a beginner you should have this in your collection.Else, you'll find yourself like me in hindsight wishing you had it a long time ago."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"There is a review from 2006 that says this book has a huge errata file. The first printing had some errors, but they have all been fixed in the later printings.Overall the book is truly exceptional. Up-to-the-minute CSS info presented in a very readable way.I would say this is a great book--both if you are new at or more experienced in CSS."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"I've read several CSS books, most of them thick, dry tomes.This book is relatively small (254 pages, including index) and easy to read. But more importantly, it's clearly written. The author has a real talent for getting across concepts that other authors make difficult.Moreover, the book is filled with very practical, useful tricks that you can use to enhance your sites, while increasing your knowledge of CSS.This is not a start-from-scratch \\"learn CSS\\" book, but if you already know the basics, I *highly recommend* this book."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This is a fantastic book for the Working Web Designer who needs to understand how to use CSS. The projects used as examples are simple enough that you can learn the techniques and interesting enough that you will be able to use them (or derivatives) in your own work.This is not a complete CSS reference book, and if you're new to CSS I recommend getting this book AND something like the \\"CSS Pocket Reference\\" from O'Riley."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"This book absolutely accomplishes its mission of providing a useful, accurate desk reference for those of us who know how to create standards-compliant CSS/XHTML Web sites but can't always remember every trick there is. Rather than having a hodge-podge of code snippets, Web site bookmarks and scribbled notes, I just use this book. It's an excellent companion to Jeffrey Zeldman's \\"Designing With Web Standards,\\" which I also highly recommend. The only CSS \\"trick\\" I wish the authors had included was a solid, reliable drop-down menu system that degrades gracefully. Just a nit-pick, hardly a weakness."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"(originally published on http://www.last-child.com)Don't let the title of Andy Budd's recently released book, CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions, fool you. Yes, it is filled with advanced CSS information; but it isn't just for the advanced programmers. I bought this book with the hope of learning some of Andy Budd's positioning, descendent selectors, and cross-browser techniques. I didn't expect to learn some of the basic elements of CSS.Easy to read and useAndy's writing style is easy on the eyes. He knows when to skip remedial information and when to point out the important tidbits that save an hour or so. For example, Budd describes the behavior of collapsing margins with a clarity that other books have lacked....It may seem strange at first, but margins can even collapse on themselves. Say you have an empty element with a margin, but no border or padding. In this situation, the top margin is touching the bottom margin and they collapse together...This is why a series of empty paragraph elements take up very little space, as all their margins collapse together to form a single small margin....Margin collapsing only happens with the vertical margins of block boxes in the normal flow of the document. Margins between inline boxes, floated, or absolutely positioned boxes never collapse.CSS Mastery - Advanced Web Standards Solutions pgs 32,33I've already placed a few flags in the book and they'll multiply as I return for more techniques. Was this book worth purchasing? I found a number of techniques from Andy's personal toolkit that made the book worth 10 double espresso mocha frappathingies. Here's a tip that was particularly timely for me. Andy discusses the use of links with spans to create disjointed rollovers. I'm having an issue in IE6 right now with the span not being entirely clickable....Unfortunately this example doesn't quite work in IE on Windows. It would seem that IE/Win has problems targeting nested elements inside an anchor link, using the :hover dynamic pseudo-class. However, there is a simple, if somewhat odd, workaround. Adding the following rule on this anchor's hover state seems to fix the confusion in IE and allow it to honor nested hover state rules:#pic a:hover {border:none;}-CSS Mastery - Advanced Web Standards Solutions, pg. 107That is the kind of gem that only comes from experience.Who should buy this book?This book falls into the category of CSS/HTML theory from beginning to end. It starts with the basic platform of semantic coding and moves on towards the final use of advanced techniques. It is a nice replacement for Eric Meyers on CSS and More Eric Meyers on CSS, both of which give basic techniques and information but lack the style of Budd's designer eye. This book reminds me more of The Zen of CSS Design : Visual Enlightenment for the Web by Dave Shea and Molly Holzchlag. CSS Mastery and Zen of CSS are written from the developer/designer's viewpoint. Both contain tips and techniques. While Zen touches lightly on the coding, Budd takes you full circle, from theory to final production."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"Last week, I bought CSS Mastery. I have been working with CSS for page layout for about 3 years. The first year was mainly learning through tutorials from Macromedia and trial and error. I also spent time away working on fund raising for my ministry role with Campus Crusade for Christ. About a year ago I implemented my first site using CSS and XHTML for layout. Since then, I have done about 5 more designs including several my personal blog. I would consider my CSS knowledge and experience as intermediate. So I was excited to get this book and improve my skills.And I have not been disappointed. I have only read a couple of chapters of the book, but it has already been very helpful. The first chapter alone was worth it for me. I went back and rewrote the code for a site that I have been working on. Because I had a better grasp of some foundational principles, I was able to implement better coding which cut down on the amount of code and needless div tags. I appreciated all the tips that Andy gave on structuring, planning, organizing and maintaining stylesheets. I learned so much from only 25 pages. And I was able to immediately implement what I learned.This morning I read the second chapter on the visual formatting model (box model and positioning) while waiting for new tires to be installed on my car. I was restless with ideas as I gained a better grasp on these foundational concepts. I can't wait to start using this knowledge to build better layouts and implement better solutions. I just barely got into the next chapter on background images and image replacement. My mouth is watering with anticipation of what I am going to learn next. I can't wait to learn more and using it in practice.This is the most practical book on CSS that I have read or looked at. I have tried to work through some others books that are mostly exercises. I gain some insights here and there. But this book has taught me so much and really filled in my foundational knowledge so that I can take my CSS to the next level. This is going to be one of the books that stays on my shelf for quick reference."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"\\"CSS Mastery\\" is a fast-paced, hands-on, nuts-and-bolts workbook for web design standardistas. The book is worth buying for Chapter 2 alone, \\"Visual Formatting Model Recap\\", where you'll no doubt find yourself often enough while wrestling with CSS positioning oddities. A chapter on table styling is welcome as well, as tables have their place in web design yet are often given short shrift in CSS books.This book is not meant to dazzle with sweet design inspiration (get Andy Clarke'sTranscending CSS: The Fine Art of Web Design (Voices That Matter)for that!)--but you'll find solid techniques and plenty of them. The included case studies will help you to understand and develop a good workflow as well.This book is a well-crafted and valuable tool which should be in every web designer's toolkit."},{"Title":"CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions","review":"A brief but concise book that covers everything you need to know to build an effective web standards CSS site.

I am mostly relying on graphical guys to create html templates. Now, I might have some control on the graphical side."},{"Title":"Time and Relative (Doctor Who)","review":"As the first in a new line of Doctor Who books, TIME AND RELATIVE had a lot that it needed to accomplish. Not only is the first story of a series held up (perhaps unfairly) as representative of how the line will progress, but it helps to establish the tone and style of a particular publishing group. With the Doctor Who book market already stretched to almost the breaking point, this new line will have to accomplish great things in order to justify its existence to the consuming public. Fortunately, it turns out that this book is a fine example of a good Doctor Who story. It isn't the greatest Doctor Who adventure that has ever been written, but there are many little reasons that definitely make this worth the time it takes to read.As a story that is told entirely from the POV of Susan's diary, one may be a bit concerned with exactly how well this will be executed. During the course of her travels on-board the TARDIS, Susan was not always the most interesting of companions despite the unique relationship that she shared with the Doctor. When I heard that TIME AND RELATIVE was set before AN UNEARTHLY CHILD and that there would be no viewpoint outside of Susan's, I feared the worst. Susan dealing with rotten teachers. Susan dealing with catty classmates. Susan dealing with... boys. The horror, oh, the horror.To my complete shock, my favourite portions of the book were those that focused on Susan's comparatively mundane adventures at Coal Hill School. Those diary entries are excellent. Many teenagers feel like outsiders at times, but an alien from a far off place stuck in an English school in the 60's is truly a unique individual. And Kim Newman captures her perfectly. As a character study of the two explorers that we met in An Unearthly Child, this story excels. The mystery that was so prevailing and compelling about those early days is back in full force, though there is a slight added twist, which you'll have to read for yourself to discover.The story actually takes a slight dip once the main plot begins and the inevitable Doctor Who monsters show up. They're quite well written and interesting, but these passages simply aren't as good as the sections that heavily feature Susan's thoughts. Her viewpoints and opinion come through occasionally, of course, but they're spread too far apart. Susan and her strange Grandfather are the real stars of this story, and we hate being distracted from them, if even for a moment.The plot itself is fairly simple and occasionally borrows from other stories, but it is quite well suited to the novella format. The ending is perfect, with the actual turning point at the conclusion being a stroke of genius. There are only a few points where it feels like a run-around, which it really is at the heart of it. It's all this other wonderful stuff around the bare plot that makes it so enjoyable.As the beginning to a new line of books, TIME AND RELATIVE largely succeeds. If you're curious about this series, then know that this story is a great beginning. It plays to the strengths of its novella-sized format and includes some excellent character pieces. It may not be the greatest Doctor Who adventure that you'll ever read, but it's certainly one of the better ones."},{"Title":"Time and Relative (Doctor Who)","review":"Stellar debut installment of the Telos novellas! (And far better than Frayed, which was published later but takes place before it.) This very unusual Doctor Who novella takes place eight months before the very first episode of the television show, in 1963, and is told in the form of Susan's diary. Kim Newman has the character's voice down incredibly well - a necessity, considering the format - and actually makes the story almost entirely a solo one, with the Hartnell Doctor only really coming in at the end. Perhaps what impresses most, however, is Newman's steadfast attention to detail; in every way imaginable, he makes you believe that this story really does take place in early sixties London, incorporating pop culture, lingo and even the attitudes and rituals of the time. For any fan of early Who, this is sure to be a massive treat."},{"Title":"Ride Like An Indian!","review":"I have been hunting this book down for years, as it was well-remembered from childhood.

It is particularly valuable for the skeptic, as it was written by a skeptic (or at least he started out that way). It looks at the skill of communicating telepathically with animals from an 'outside' viewpoint, allowing the reader to step back and consider with a critical yet unprejudiced eye just what they are seeing. I think this book will open skeptical minds at least to the overall idea that what they are looking at is possible, even if it does not convert them totally to the cause. A definite recommendation to all with an interest in the subject, and a fine 'first look' for those who wish to know more.Thumbs up.[Another good book for the beginner and those who are looking at the subject from an outside perspective is Patty Summers' book, &quot;Talking With the Animals&quot;.]"},{"Title":"Communicating with Animals: The Spiritual Connection Between People and Animals","review":"My curiosity with Animal Communication lead me to pick up Arthur Myer's book on communicating with animals. It is a must have for anyone interested, curious, and even skeptical on the whole subject. Myer has more or less written on his investigation with so-called communicators; their stories, their techniques, and has left it up to his reader's to believe or not to believe. This is the foundation for anyone opening their eyes to this world. Though it is not written to &quot;teach&quot; you animal communication, it certainly sheds light on the subject enough that will encourage you to desire to learn more."},{"Title":"Communicating with Animals: The Spiritual Connection Between People and Animals","review":"This was a book that raised my curiosity in the introduction then pulled me further within it many fascinating chapters on the world of communicating with animals.

I wish that I could communicate with a fly like that or ants even!&quot; The more I read and become more used to the idea - the more I want to do it! Then I read Communicating With Animals and I really believe that I can. As lots of the animal communicators, Arthur Myers writes about says: We all have the ability. We just have to do it!

The stories are thought provoking, if you keep an open mind. The author doesn't claim to have had any experiences with animal communication himself, which grants some credibility to his work. Rather than jumping on the bandwagon with his interviewees, he stands back and offers an objective point of view. Always reminding the reader to 'suspend his disbelief' He simply illustrates what others have shared with him, while participating in workshops and lectures along the way. Helpful is the guide at the end of the book which outlines contact information for various animal communicators across the country. The last chapter is a bit much though, which focuses on the consciousness if trees and even rocks. But don't let that stop you from enjoying this wonderful book. You will look at pets in a whole new way."},{"Title":"Communicating with Animals: The Spiritual Connection Between People and Animals","review":"Art Myers has captured the essence of psychic nature, including human nature, in this study of non-verbal communication between species.

The book was indeed on &quot;Studio&quot; photography. I was hoping to get some more general expert insights on lighting and posing. Instead, I was overwhelmed with suggestion about what kind of equipments to buy. The author assume that you are a professional photographer, who owns a studio, a medium format camera, and $10k+ for some lighting equipments. If you are such photographer, you might like this book. For me, I was lucky enough to own a 35mm SLR and a decent flash. This is not a bad book and the presentation is very personal, but this book is not for me. If you are like me, who just want to improve your chances of getting good pictures of your families and friends, try ISBN 1584280344 instead."},{"Title":"Posing and Lighting Techniques for Studio Portrait Photography","review":"Allen's book on studio lighting and posing is generally a good overall study of techniques and recommendations. The book is aimed toward the professional photographer or the experienced amateur. There are fine examples and detailed instructions on metering multi-light setups. The posing information is less useful, but is still well thought out.A significant flaw in the book is the editing. There are several mistakes with sample photos - photos mislabeled and some photos mistakenly shown multiple times rather than the photos that the text refers to. This will leave some people who have not done much studio work scratching their heads when their tests look nothing like the examples in the book. Fortunately, most of the samples are correct and the errors are fairly obvious as long as the reader is paying close attention.Another drawback are the lighting diagrams. They are so far from being &quot;to scale&quot; that their usefulness is greatly reduced.And lastly, there are many many cases where the author goes into great detail describing equipment and techniques that would have been much, much better done with a simple accompanying photograph of the apparatus. Basically the only photos in the book are the portraits (most of them quite nice), but almost every chapter is just begging for some small photos of the equipment being talked about."},{"Title":"Posing and Lighting Techniques for Studio Portrait Photography","review":"Being new to studio portrait photography, I have bought or read almost every book on the subject.

My portraits have improved by orders of magnitude already and I continue to gain knowledge with each rereading."},{"Title":"Posing and Lighting Techniques for Studio Portrait Photography","review":"It is obvious from this book that J.J.Allen has a wealth of experience as a successful portrait photographer.Unfortunately, this does not translate into being a good instructor.While Mr. Allen clearly knows his stuff, his lessons are wordy, incomplete, and not well thought out. The portraits used to illustrate a point seem to be mostly chosen from his file cabinet rather than shot to illustrate that point. In some instances, examinations of the portraits reveal themselves to be shot in a method other than what is described.Most of the fault, however, lies with the publisher, Amherst Media. The lighting diagrams are completely out of scale and sometimes wrong.It is exhaustive to try and match, for instance, such elements as Image 22 and Image 23 with Diagram 11 and Diagram 12 on pages with no numbers with the accompanying text on pages 36 and 37.On the good side is a wealth of excellent portraits in a plethora of styles and methods and a few true nuggets of solid advise that will be truly useful to the aspiring portrait photographer.All in all, it is not a BAD book, it is just that for the money, there are many that are a lot better."},{"Title":"Posing and Lighting Techniques for Studio Portrait Photography","review":"I have spent a lot of time trying to find books that would help me improve my skills in portrait photography.

(The other is _Towards Understanding Islam_, another essential to read and if possible, own.) If someone is interested in at least just knowing what Islam is, I would highly recommend this book as it succinctly covers all aspects of Islam and thus clarifies many of the negative stereotypes portrayed in the Western media. Dr. Abdalati's knowledge of Islam shows through in his writing style which is smooth and uncomplicated, making it enjoyable to read regardless of age or educational background.For example, he covers topics such as the Five Pillars of Islam; the importance and rewards of prayer and fasting; equality of the sexes and women's rights; sin; peace; sports; clothing; and discusses the role of the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him), listing further refernces to look up in the _Qur'an_. In addition, Dr. Abdalati writes about how Islam can be, and in the lives of many Muslims around the world, IS incorporated into daily life.&lt;&lt;Dr. Hammudah Abdalati graduated from of Al-Azhar University in Egypt; received an MA in Islamic Studies from McGill University; PhD in Sociology from Princeton University; in 1958 he joined the Department of Islamic Culture at Al-Azhar University)--back cover, 1980 edition&gt;&gt; I hope inchallah that you enjoy this book!!!"},{"Title":"ISLAM IN FOCUS","review":"I found this to be a very good starter book in most areas. Basic subjects are covered such as the five pillars and about applying Islam to one's daily life.The chapter dealing with prayer was superb and is one of my favorite books dealing with the issues of prayer right after \\"The Illuminated Prayer\\" by Coleman Barks. Basic concepts are covered as well and may well give the non-Muslim Western reader a nice window into the day to day life of Muslims and how religious Muslims use the principles of Islam into their every day lives.I do, however, have two points about this book which did bother me somewhat, hence the 4 stars instead of five. The author occasionally justifies the Islamic point of view by stating that people \\"in the West\\" do bad thing A or bad thing B. I don't find this type of approach all that helpful when trying to reach a Western audience. Also, I feel that if an Islamic concept is good enough for all to follow, it should be able to do so on its own merits and not by comparing it to another system to \\"prove\\" how good it is. It looks too defensive.Also, the mention of polygyny is not covered from both sides. It does give the androcentric point of view that any man who is not receiving enough sex from his wife is able to just take another. This way of using (or abusing) polygyny is often pushed by most (male) scholars, but other interpretations are out there that favor the woman, but are often overlooked by the male power structure. Amina Wadud's \\"Quran and Woman\\" gets into this topic from a more female balanced point of view, and reading the two together should give a fuller idea of the various views on polygyny. Related to this, the author correctly lists how Islam gave women rights, but gets into little detail of the day to day realities for Muslim women, which, believe me, are far from the rosy picture often painted by the male scholars.Still, I would totally recommmend this book even with my disagreements, if nothing else for the excelent chapter on prayer. Back in the days when Islam was held in higher regard, scholars often agreed to disagree and few stated that they were absolutely correct. It is something we have left behind in these Wahabi styled times, and something we could use again."},{"Title":"ISLAM IN FOCUS","review":"This book explains all the basics of Islam in a factual, non preachy and very readable way.

Great!"},{"Title":"ISLAM IN FOCUS","review":"While scholars are trying to discern the identity of the four (perhaps five) authors of the Pentateuch - the first five books in the Old Testament, some people still believe their uneducated church elders who claim that Prophet Moses wrote them instead. In fact, these books as they exist today in the Old Testament, are nothing but \\"hadith\\" - hearsay accounts of what Moses had said that were written much later by others (see Richard Elliot Friedman's \\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\").New Testament Scholars, as well, are trying to figure what is authentic and what is bogus in the New Testament after the Romans did their hatchet job on Scripture at Nycaea (see Malcolm Muggeridge's \\"The End of Christendom\\"). Added to this are the thousands of mistakes made by scribes - some intententional, that have made their way into current translations such as the King James Bible (see Bart D. Ehrman's \\"Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why\\"). And we have learned that books are missing - books like the Gospel According to Thomas and According to Barnabus. But most pointedly, where is the Gospel of Jesus According to Jesus? Much of this mischief is rooted in the Roman takeover of Christianity.Why would God leave us without unadulterated guidance? What to do?That's where Hammudah Abdalti's book is a like a breath of fresh air - where a truly honest reading of God's Last Testament, titled the Recitation, has resulted in evidence that God did leave us with untainted Guidance. About the changes to the Bible that the Romans did, the Last Testament addresses those and tells you what is bogus and what is not. It tells you how to call on those who follow those adulterated accounts (People of the Book, i.e. Jews and Christians) to return to true guidance and worship of God. If a Jew or Christian wants to know what pure worship of God is all about without the Pagan influences of Rome, then the Last Testament is the one to check out: \\"He has revealed to you the Book, confirming the scriptures which preceded it; for He has already revealed the Law [Given to Moses] and the Gospel [Given to Jesus] for the guidance of men, and the distinction between right and wrong\\"(Last Testament 3:2). The Law Given to Moses is missing from the Old Testament, save the \\"hadith\\" or hearsay accounts of it. And the Gospel Given to Jesus is missing from the New Testament, save four hearsay accounts. But the Last Testament is clear.Abdalati, a sociology professor from Canada, is excellent at explaining the Last Testament and how to apply its guidance to everyday life and family matters. Many people who follow the guidance of the Last Testament refer to themselves today as Muslims, which means \\"of submission to God\\". But many who call themselves Muslims are in fact not of submission to God, but are \\"mu-Shaytaan\\" (of submission to Satan) or \\"mu-nafiq\\" (of submission to hypocrisy) or \\"mu-jahil\\" (of submission to ignorance). Most are mujahil - they don't even know what they are saying when recitating the same prayer 17 times daily during their five worship periods. That equals = no guidance. Abdalati addresses this ignorance in his book and explains how to apply Submission to God (Islaam) to one's life and familial relations. It is an excellent sociological account of Islamic life for Muslims and will help to address the Dark Age that Muslims have descended into along with the rest of Christendom."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"Edward Said's definition of the intellectual as someone who &quot;speaks the truth to power&quot; is hardly an original notion. As any literate person will know, it recalls and derives from the Greek concept of the &quot;parrhesiastes&quot;, the truth-teller. Crucially, not anyone who speaks the truth is a &quot;parrhesiastes&quot;. A grammar teacher, for example, may tell the truth to the children he teaches, but he is not thereby a &quot;parrhesiastes&quot;. However, when a philosopher addresses himself to a sovereign, to a tyrant and tells him that his tyranny is wrong, the philosopher not only voices the truth but also takes a risk. It is this element of risk and what we might call disinterested courage that defines a figure like Socrates but also a contemporary like Noam Chomsky. Of course, both the Greek notion and Said's concept, equally, exclude those who serve the status quo. Henry Kissinger is neither a &quot;parrhesiastes&quot; nor an intellectual. A merchant banker may utilise or produce &quot;ideas&quot; but he is too bound to the dominant system to be capable of truly critical thought. What this book addresses, though, is not so much the intellectuals themselves as the way they are perceived in different historical and social situations. What value does this figure of the truth teller, the risk taker, hold in different polities? In totalitarian societies he is paid the grotesque homage of censorship and state violence. In the U.S.A. and many Western democracies, by contrast, he is usually treated with contempt or barely concealed irritation. I have seldom seen &quot;intellectual&quot; used favourably in the British press. It is, all too frequently, prefixed with &quot;pseudo-&quot; or &quot;trendy&quot;. What Said's book demonstrates is that the idea of the intellectual has an ancient and venerable history, and that power and truth are seldom comfortable bedfellows."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"In this slim, yet thought-proking volume, Edward said attempts to provide an outline of the function and duty of the intellectual in modern society. Implicitly, Edward Said goes about the task of challenging the increasingly cozy relationship between the so-called intellectual, i.e., academia, and the political/military power structure that has developed in the wake of McCarthyism and the subsequent paranoia of the Cold War. Case in point, do you know where Napalm was \\"invented\\", not in the bowls of the Pentagon, but at Harvard University, by scientists (intellectuals) with a duty to expand human understanding and knowledge, not to be used as a means to power and destruction. That, Said would contend, is precisely the problem with the role of the intelelctual today. Au Courant the climate of the \\"expert\\" reighns supreme and almost completely in the cause of war--in whatever manifestation it is found. Unfortunately, this is a problem that has been ignored for far too long, obscured with baseless, yet effective, claims of a leftist domination of academia to which Said's subtle analysis provides a vitally important counter.Using the example of intellectuals such as James Baldwin, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Viginia Woolf and Noam Chomsky as a model of intellectual vigor and concern for social justice, both in words and in action. In this vein Said offers a critically important meditation on the vital influence that such can have on public opinion and, more importantly, government policy. Thus, the intellectual in today's society, in Said's mind, has a duty and an obligation to be an agent of social and political justice--a radically dissident voice if need be--against the dictates of blind power.For those who admire critical thinking, moral courage and a helthy respect for honest debate Representations of the Intellectual is for you. There awill always be those who seem to believe that ad hominem attacks and smear campaigns can replace critical thinking and objective analysis, both of which are only a substitute for intellectual vigor. Yet, many of his critics seem to be perfectly content with a system in which the main function of an intellectual is as a petty propagandist of pragmatic ideology, providing justification for the continued imperial wars of aggression, right-wing insurgency, political assasination and even genocide, carried out by Western powers since WWII. Those who ignore these facts are either grossly naive or recklessly misguided by their own historico delusions.But, for those who want to get beyond the simplistic dualisms and vacuous black/white oppositions by all means, read Said's book--your view of the intellectual in Western society will never be the same."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"Edward Said is a distinguished professor of Literature at Columbia University. These are the Reith Lectures he delivered in 1993. He is a Palestinian Christian who has long been involved with issues of human rights there and around the world. Said deplores, here, the pressures and seductions of 'professionalism' on the intellectual in today's society. He describes these as coming from specialization, from of the cult of the certified expert as he calls it, from coopting by social, educational or political agendas, and, from commercialization, which sees all ideas as a product in a market, held to standards of economic viability rather than truth. The intellectual, he argues, must rigorously maintain objectivity and espouse activism. An attitude of being outside the conforming principles of associations, even those by which the individual is defining himself, is the impulse to conscience which is the key message of this thesis. The obligation of advocating for what is 'true' or 'just' is implicit with this. Authenticity and spontaneity in assessing these issues are instilled first by developing that moral sense, secular and flexible, and applying it in the context of broad learning. Those are compelling and challenging standards, which anyone who aspires to the intellectual, in character or understanding (and that should include all of us) must aspire. One can then differentiate this from the burgeoning 'intellectual industry' of today, traders in credibility, mercenaries for whatever paradigm happens to be ascendent and expedient. Said's own life attests to the influence one can have if honest to the concepts of universality, humility and integrity he discusses in these fine essays."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"Said succinctly examines what constitutes an intellectual and what role he or she has in society. He represents the intellectual as someone who is an amateur, independent of special interests, and an activist willing to take on personal risk to speak the truth. But perhaps more important is the intellectual's reliance on reason and honesty as opposed to the constraints of dogma or ideology. This book is an important read for anyone whose work puts them in a position to affect policy or public opinion."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"My personal favorite of Said's books.For those who feel ambivalent about Said's specific political views, this book touches on them minimally. (Though, obviously, his thinking is informed by those views throughout.)The general question is: What is the role of a true thinker in our times? If you believe the \\"authorities\\" (i.e., the New York Times, or Charlie Rose, etc.) they are just scholars or thoughtful observers with a public voice. The upshot is that the intellectual is nothing more than an ambassador -- a mouthpiece -- for received opinion (that is, the orthodoxy). Intellectuals are nothing more, in this popular view, than a kind of secular clergy.Representations of the Intellectual skewers this notion, and beautifully. Said had a singular breadth of mind. In Representations, he draws on a expansive knowledge of disparate fields to offer a convincing picture of the intellectual as a reasoned, passionate dissenter."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"Said paints a lonely picture of the intellectual: always on the fringe, always challenging the status quo, and always on guard against manipulative influences. It is a very personal portrait, and a (intellectually) passionate call for people to broaden their scope of knowledge and to put their ideas into action, to question what we shouldn't easily accept and to defend marginal groups that lack political power. If you think highly of the French intellectuals like Sartre and Camus, or any other modern thinkers, you may want to read this very short book."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"The 1993 Reith Lectures, compiled and adapted for print in this publication, are as close as Edward Said has ever gotten to writing a manifesto of his personal beliefs. 'Representations of the Intellectual' is a superbly incisive analysis of the social importance which intellectuals occupy. It culminates in an impassioned arugment for intellectuals to challenge common societal assumptions of what constitutes the norm by broadening their individual fields of interest and taking a greater interest in cultural and political history.The Annales School historian Marc Bloch once described the task of social historians as entailing 'years of analysis for a day of synthesis'. This might well describe the extraordinary erudition of Said, who has always synthesised his encyclopaedic knowledge of politics and aesthetics - whether it be literature, classical music or the visual arts - into highly original works distinguished by their breathtaking interpretive ingenuity.Said's critics, including the folks at 'Commentary', demur at the all-encompassing nature of his mind, to which the sheer quantity of his publications bears explicit witness. But as 'Representations of the Intellectual' demonstrates, Said views the role of the intellectual as being both public and professional; for him, it's a role which naturally occasions shared knowledge in a public domain.Said is hardly Panglossian, though he is unapologetically idealistic, insisting that universities, even today, are a 'quasi-utopian space'. The Humanities have clearly changed in the last couple of decades. Said celebrates the emergence of culturally inclusive literary theory such as feminist and queer studies, which accord with his personal understanding of intellectuals as critically engaged individuals not afraid to question populist rhetoric and speak on behalf of hitherto suppressed or unheard voices in society. Thus he rails against political correctness on both Left and Right - here, he includes zealous theorists who are infatuated with esoteric jargon and language games - so that, as the final chapter of 'Representations of the Intellectual' proudly proclaims, they might 'speak the truth to power'.Said's politics are uncompromisingly Leftist, and his vision of a world in which the vagaries of cultural difference are not merely tolerated but actively surmounted, only seems compatible with a multicultural democracy (which, Said realises, inevitably has its own share of problems. For example, he abhors the modern role of the United States as an ostensibly humanitarian interventionist. Utopia, indeed!) Yet he doesn't actively seek to change the world. Rather, he wants to fortfy intellectuals with moral courage by encouraging them to embrace their individualism and social importance. In the end, the fact that Said has a social vision at all is just as important as its potential to be enacted."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"This is a short popular introduction to the social role of intellectuals, taking off from the polarity of Julien Benda (free-floating) vs. Antonio Gramsci (organic) intellectuals. While Benda has always had a conservative flavor, his advocacy of independence and integrity (as opposed to his conservative notion of the intellectual's obligation to the eternal verities) is nonetheless important, so Said could be considered a left Benda-ite (as could Russell Jacoby). Said advocates the independence as well as the engagement of free-floating and academic intellectuals. He writes of the difficulties of negotiating the cosmopolitan and the national commitments of intellectuals, also of the experience of exile and marginalization. He also addresses the polarity of professionalism and amateurism, holding to the side of the \\"amateurs\\", without disavowing membership in academic institutions. He prefers the role of \\"speaking truth to power\\", which also means avoiding the twin temptations of self-submission to gods that inevitably fail and apostatic dogma-hopping. (See also my review of Benda's THE TREASON OF THE INTELLECTUALS.)"},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"A collection of six lectures given as part of the BBC's prestigious Reith Lectures, this short book contains Said sees the intellectual's role in society as that of a valuable outsider, one who can break down the stereotypes and categories that limit thought and communication. These thinkers are the ones that he believe can question special interests, corporate thinking, blind patriotism, even class or racial privilege. Above all, the intellectual is an exile and an amateur-that is, one consigned by choice to the margins. And one who can \\"speak the truth to power.\\"No stranger to controversy while alive, one cannot help but read biographical inferences in Said's essays. He chooses figure like James Baldwin, Virginia Woolf, Henry Kissinger and Jonathan Swift that resisted money or power to uphold intellectual honesty and rigor of thought. They are also individuals whom social transformation was an essential goal-much like Said. Regardless of one's attitude to Said's own politics, this collection of lectures given a decade ago remain imminently pertinent and timely for discussion today."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"\\"Representations of the Intellectual\\" is a compilation of the six Reith Lectures that Edward Said delivered over BBC Radio in 1993. The title is somewhat misleading: Said doesn't really examine representations of intellectuals so much as offers a prescriptive way he thinks they should function within a society. His particular interest is the intellectual in the late twentieth century, confronted as they sometimes are on all fronts with ideological and political concerns. How is the intellectual to align himself or herself with these, or should they?The title essay was for me the most interesting, drawing a sharp distinction between the conceptions of the intellectual developed by Antonio Gramsci and Julien Benda. Gramsci himself discerns between two types of intellectuals. Traditional intellectuals are the \\"teachers, priests, and administrators, who continue to do the same thing from generation to generation,\\" while organic intellectuals are \\"directly connected to classes or enterprises that use intellectuals to organize interests, gain more power, get more control\\" (p. 4). Gramsci thought that everyone has the potential to be an intellectual, even if some people do not function as intellectuals in society. In his 1927 essay \\"The Betrayal of the Intellectuals,\\" Julien Benda's decidedly less demotic, even Platonic, ideal of an intellectual suggests that they are \\"a tiny band of super-gifted and morally endowed philosopher-kings who constitute the conscience of mankind\\" (p. 4-5). Benda thought intellectuals had largely given up the objective, dispassionate analysis of issues and had become corrupted by special interests, politics, and vulgar nationalism. Said uses Gramsci and Benda as touchstones throughout the essays for what he thinks the intellectual should, and shouldn't, strive toward.The rest of the essays revolve around a small number of reoccurring themes. The intellectual should always wear the mantle of the exile if not literally, then at least figuratively. Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski are two such figures, even though Said displays sublime self-control in not pointing out that they both used their intellectual firepower to further the hegemonic interests of the most powerful nation in the world. Said also favors the approach of the amateur over that of the professional. The professional is epitomized by the \\"impossible to understand classroom technician, hired by committee, anxious to please various patrons and agencies, bristling with academic credentials and a social authority that does not promote debate but established reputations and intimidates non-experts\\" (p. 72). Instead, the amateur (literally, one spurred on by care and affection) works outside, or at least in addition to, his or her narrow specialization in an effort to understand matters in a broader context.This is a solid foundation, but left a lot of important questions are completely unconsidered. What about those intellectuals who seemingly do align themselves with avowed political concerns? Do Noam Chomsky's endorsement of anarcho-syndicalism and continued skepticism regarding many American foreign policy decisions mean that he cannot be considered an intellectual? Apparently not, as Said refers to him approvingly at least once.And while the scope of a set of six lectures, each originally a radio address with a duration of thirty minutes, is almost necessarily narrow, the essays don't address the dynamic change in the role of the intellectual over the centuries. While Said's ideal of the intellectual is almost necessarily a public intellectual, such a thing would have never existed in medieval Europe. Would the fact that a member of the medieval clerisy was almost always a member of the Church change anything here? Or that the Renaissance artist was always beholden to a wealthy Maecenas, whether religious or secular? I realize that these questions are beyond the scope of Said's project, but I found myself wishing for a book-length treatment that would have given them thoughtful consideration.Most of the material here is a noncontroversial adumbration of what has been said about intellectuals by others: the intellectual should (excuse the clich&eacute;) \\"speak truth to power,\\" shouldn't be the tool of political or ideological interests, should eschew narrow professionalism. Having previously read Said's \\"Orientalism\\" and \\"On Late Style,\\" both of which were innovative and thought-provoking, I found these essays to be relatively conservative. For the most part, the intellectual as exile, as someone not beholden to deeply entrenched ideological or political interests, and as passionate amateur are not new. Reading Said always leaves me wanting the wild-eyed radical that he is so often accused of being by predominant American neoconservatives, although in this case, I was left with something much more pragmatic and altogether cautious."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"Said succinctly examines what constitutes an intellectual and what role he or she has in society.

I have read this precious book several times, nonetheless, when I was reading what Said wrote about the Gulf War, I confused it with the War on Iraq. Then, who is a real intellectual?

A real intellectual seeks the third way."},{"Title":"Representations of the Intellectual (Reith Lectures)","review":"Edward Said's earnest but flawed Representations Of The Intellectual (1994) is a shrewdly - argued, frustrating book that ultimately can only serve to further polarize its readership and reinforce deep prejudices on all sides of the political debate. Conservatives will have a field day with Said's subjectivity, dramatic sour grapes, self - martyring sense of his own \\"exile,\\" and misappropriation of his own ground rules (he decries the West's use of the expression \\"Arab World,\\" but repeatedly uses it himself; he warns against nationalistic pride, though he has written six or more books with either \\"Arab World,\\" \\"Islam,\\" or \\"Palestine\\" in the title), while those on the left will find his often unconsciously smug arguments soulfully moving. Sadly, Representations Of The Intellectual never rises above reflecting a second - rate thinker with a good throwing arm, one aimed right at the United States government for failing to perfectly fulfill Said's stringent humanistic ideals on a global scale, ideals he providentially sees as both the birthright and bread - and - butter of the born intellectual, a word - like \\"truth\\" - whose meaning he never makes the effort to define.The badly - titled Representations Of The Intellectual is really only a salty mix of Prophet Against Empire with some To The Victors Go The Spoils thrown in to bolster Said's general sense of awkward sportsmanship. If Said has one loaded arm broadly aimed at the West and at the United States in particular, he holds an errant gun, squarely pointed at his own foot, in the other. Anyone irrationally arguing for the permanent application of universal human rights as social policy is bound to see vociferous dragons, red in tooth and claw, looming from hazy corners of the world map, whether they're genuinely there or not. The major problem with Representations Of The Intellectual is not Said's objective goals, but the childish, often depthless manner in which he rationalizes them and hopes to bring them to fruition. What caliber of argument is it to suggest that desiring a place at the victor's table is reason enough to be given one? If the victorious are generally awful, abusive, and corrupt on principal and always to be held in suspicion as Said believes, then why seek a place at their table at all?For a proud and vocal advocate of both free thought and speech, Said has very specific, narrow ideas about the role and duties of intellectuals (\\"The intellectual always has a choice either to side with the weaker, the less well represented, the forgotten or ignored, or to side with the more powerful,\\" \\"I think the major choice faced by the intellectual is whether to be allied with the stability of the stability of the victor and rulers or - the more difficult path - to consider that stability as a state of emergency threatening the less fortunate with the danger of complete extinction, and take into account the experience of subordination itself, as well as the memory of forgotten voices and persons\\"), which frequently reveal an almost absurd lack of insight into human nature, basic psychology, common sense, and the role these dynamics play and have played throughout history. Said prefers to ignore a world of intellectuals, from Sade through Lautreamont to Darwin, Emerson, Nietzsche, Freud, Frazer, Jung, and Eliot, whose intellectual worlds and traditions were remarkably other than those he scrupulously outlines here as absolutes and the only intellectual positions worthy of being esteemed and pursued.Not surprisingly, one of Said's \\"heroes\\" has been Theodor Weisengrund Adorno, who he calls that \\"forbidding but endlessly fascinating man...for me the dominating intellectual conscience of the middle twentieth century.\\" Though the sensitive, erudite Adorno clearly lived a relatively privileged and mobile existence, Said admires the \\"paradoxical, ironic, mercilessly critical\\" Adorno for \\"hating all systems...with equal distaste.\\" Said's lengthy, unintentionally hilarious description make Adorno sound like a colossal, wailing, self - hating, wildly - projecting infant for whom personal responsibility and basic humility were fundamentally unknown qualities. The role that parental- and power- complexes may have played in Adorno's chronically neurotic existence goes untouched upon. Said seems to be suggesting that Adorno was an intrinsically helpless adult and not at the mercy of callous, inhuman Dame Nature, but of endless rancid social institutions and mercenary political machines. Said clearly has romantic admiration only for those who have nobly suffered in accordance with his own peculiar aesthetic of justifiable misery. Said's general perspective is sadly earthbound, materialistic, and victim - oriented.Said may have faired better had he responsibly addressed his real concern - the Palestinian question - head on, as he has elsewhere, and abandoned the tortuous, if clever, circumnavigations and immature lapses into self indulgence he displays here. Tired readers are likely to come away from Representations Of The Intellectual with the impression that Said has a good mind but a fundamental inability to be honestly self - reflective and hold himself exactingly to the rigorous standards he requires of social institutions everywhere."},{"Title":"Mai Pen Rai -","review":"When someone comes to Thailand and decides, \\"I should write about this place,\\" that's one thing.

If you want some 4.0 insite into the life of a SEAL, then this is the book to read. I am somewhat biased as I had the honor of serving under his command on the Wimbrown 7 back in '88.ENC(SW) \\"Rodge\\" USN(Retired)"},{"Title":"Inside the US Navy Seals","review":"The most important word in the title of this book is \\"inside.\\" That is to say, this book is not written by some journalist or other who is merely writing about personal \\"observations\\" of the SEAL community. Nor is it written by someone who is offering idle speculation from the outside on what he believes the SEALS are all about. Instead, Gary Stubblefield has had a distinguished career as a SEAL himself, and there is no better qualified person to tell their story.During my time in the Navy I had a few acquaintences who were SEALS. I had expected Special Forces types to be very pompous and always looking to start trouble and \\"mix it up\\" with regular sailors in order to validate SEAL superiority. The reality of the matter was quite different. The contact I had with these people surprised me as I found them to be very down-to-earth, soft spoken and not out to toot their own foghorn.Stubblefield brings that same sort of insouciance in the present book. This is not a collection of exagerrated war stories, but rather a detailed explanation of what REALLY happened during sundry covert operations. He tells it like it is, both the glamorous attributes to being a SEAL as well as the not-so-glamorous ones. Stubblefield does not paint himself as any kind of war hero, but by the end of the book the reader cannot help but have an immense appreciation for his career.The author does a very good job of painting a realistic picture of the SEALS; both their strengths as well as their weaknesses. He dispels rumors and myths about the SEALS and concentrates on projecting an accurate representation of what the life of a SEAL is like. Are SEALS one of the most elite fighting forces on the planet? Certainly. Are they invincible military demi-gods? No. Stubblefield presents many fatal examples of instances where higher-ups in the chain-of-command treated SEALs as the latter.This book is highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have an inside glimpse at this prestigious organization. Also, anyone who has a general interest in Special Forces will find plenty in this book worth pondering as well. For anyone who has any intentions of becoming a SEAL himself, this book is a MUST read!"},{"Title":"Inside the US Navy Seals","review":"Gary is one of the times current &quot;operators&quot;.

He stakes his ground early by noting that &quot;political democracy was the medium more than the achievement of the Jacksonian party&quot;. The work recalls astute observers of American society at that time such as Tocqueville, Leggett, Sedgewick and Rantoul. Here through their eyes we become witness to the paradoxical and nuanced nature of the Jacksonian &quot;persuasion&quot; (as opposed to ideology, for example). It is the first time that we are confronted with the notion of fear in American history, in which the Jacksonians view the ineluctability of the American experiment with a degree of circumspection. Meyers' work is also outstanding as a paradigm for understanding the thoughts and ideas of a given epoch: to understand those thinkers as they understood themselves."},{"Title":"THEOLOGICAL DICTIONARY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT: VOLUMES I - X. 10 vols.

In this excellent book Brown discusses the work of eleven artists whose preoccupation with the landscape provoked conversations with Brown that lead to this penetrating and wise interaction of ideas lightly titled WHY DRAW A LANDSCAPE?The artists with whom Brown has a working relationship at the Press include Jane Freilicher, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, April Gornik, Pat Steir, Joan Nelson, Anne Appleby, Edward Ruscha, Robert Bechtle, Tom Marioni, Bryan Hunt, and David Nash. And is ever there were more disparate views of observing and drawing the landscape than this group of artists represents, it has not been the subject of writing. Brown writes with skill and wit and a natural warmth. In responding to the works of these artists and their views of the land, Brown states 'Irony may be on the way out as the darling of the art world avant-garde agenda', and few writers can state such a fact with quiet sensitivity better than Kathan Brown. This book is a fine adjunct to those who elect to investigate representational art and landscape art in particular. Grady Harp, December 05"},{"Title":"Why Draw a Landscape?","review":"This little book packs a BIG punch! Discussion of contemporary landscape art is a pretext for examining Post-Modern, Conceptual, Neo-Expressionist etc. viewpoints and application which Kathan Brown does with both clarity and passion. Brown poses questions such as \\"What is the difference between Modern and Post-Modern art?\\" and \\"How does current philosophical thought inform the art of contemporary practicing artists?\\". Her commentary is insightful as she writes about the nature of art, the creative process and life experiences which are gleaned from her own printmaking experiences and other artist's quotes and work. This is a wonderful little book which is helpful to emerging artists like myself and others who are interested in the direction of art thought and practice during the last half of the 20th century and into the 21st century. This book includes many artist's full color reproductions representative of their most important body of work (paintings, etchings and sculptures) and brief biographical information. Thank You Kathan for your words that cut through the jargon of contemporary art critics and historians and introduce us to some of the most engaging artists of the last forty years."},{"Title":"A Layman's Guide to Protestant Theology","review":"I was introduced to this book by my pastor, who used it as a seminary textbook.

I bought &quot;Flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; in anticipation of a trip to Scotland, and it was perfect for that purpose. Although it provides an excellent history, it seems designed for the visitor; it's equal parts travel and history.This book gives a day-by-day description of the Prince's 5 months in hiding from the British before he was able to escape to France. He trekked hundreds of miles on foot, in disguise (once, famously, as a ladies' maid!), sometimes passing within earshot of the soldiers hunting him. The book is liberally illustrated with modern photographs of the particular glens and mountains Charlie passed by, as well as reproductions of painted portraits, etc. of the main participants.Even better, each part of Charlie's escape is accompanied by a detailed map showing where he was on almost a night-by-night basis. In the appendix there are even driving directions and a list of relevant places for tourists to visit.If you don't know the story behind Charlie's daring escape, you could not start at a better place."},{"Title":"The Flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie","review":"The authors manage to tell the story of Prince Charles Edward Stuart's flight from the disaster that was the Battle of Culloden in vivid detail without including so much detail as to become tedious.

His initial series of comedies (_Lucky Jim_ and its successors in broadly similar mode) had begun bringing in diminishing returns, at least in terms of critical attention and sales. And later, in the 1980s, Amis found a different kind of form with _The Old Devils_ and his last books.But at more or less the mid-point in his career Amis experimented with a series of genre novels. Of this series _The Alteration_ was science fiction (an alternate-worlds story in which the Reformation never happened), _The Riverside Murders_ is more or less in the English murder mystery tradition (that is, there is more interest in the puzzle than in the US crime novel, but at its best the English whodunnit is also more likely to give us human characters rather than groteques). _The Green Man_ is the last and most successful of the series, and is in the horror genre.As a horror story &quot;The Green Man&quot; offers only mild chills, but its other rewards are substantial. It's a portrait of Maurice Allingham, drinker, womaniser and host of The Green Man, an English hotel with a fine table, excellent wine list, and a couple of picturesque ghosts, though with no recent sightings.Maurice is both cynical and observant, yet he misses much of what is important of what goes on around him. The things he misses include sinister stirrings around him that indicate that the supernatural elements around him have not been so much extinct as dormant, and are now reawakening. More importantly he fails to observe almost everything of importance about those who are closest to him, his long(ish) suffering wife, his lonely, resentful teenage daughter, and his son, who has already moved on from him.Though we are invited to see through Allingham's eyes, we are also given a portrait of Allingham, a man who has gone a long way on charm but is finding that trait not enough, any more, to stave off the consequences of various kinds of misbehaviour. With women he finds that they are still prepared to bed him, but they no longer seem to like him much. With his drinking he finds he can still lie to his doctor, but he cannot deny - at least to himself - the danger signs: shakes, mild strokes, visual and auditory hallucinations. And his teenage daughter still resents his absense from her life; but she is coming close to not minding any more.Some critics have missed the strength and trenchancy of Amis' critique of his male narrators. Amis is often accused of misogyny for portrayals such as the women in &quot;The Green Man&quot;, when in fact it is principally the narrator who Amis is mocking, not the women the narrator comments on.This is the book that contains the famous &quot;threesome&quot; scene, in which the two women participants soon lose interest in the male narrator who believes he set up the scene. Maurice tries and fails to attract at least some attention, find a spare limb to involve himself with, and eventually gives up and gets dressed. The scene has been misread from time to time; it is probably not intended as a portrait of what Amis thinks must inevitably happen in a threesome, but rather a comic come-uppance for a character whose extreme selfishness, sexual and otherwise, is well delineated.Both women then leave Maurice for good, showing in doing so considerably more strength or moral dignity than Maurice has yet managed. (There is a redemption, of sorts, towards the end of the book, when his attention is finally focussed, almst too late, on his daughter.) But Amis is, in most of his career (_Jake's Thing_ and _Stanley and the Women_ being exceptions) a more painful critic of male behaviour than of female.Amis' use of the darker English folklore - the &quot;Green Man&quot; and &quot;Thomas Underhill&quot; myths - are also interestingly sinister. And the portrayal of &quot;God&quot; as a slightly camp, terribly urbane young man is one that has been hugely influential - in an unacknowledged way - in popular culture since &quot;The Green Man&quot; appeared.By the way I think it clear that the supernatural events are &quot;real&quot;. Maurice is not given his shakes and hallucinations to indicate that he is an unreliable observer in the manner of Henry James' governess in &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. The contrast is pointed, in fact, with an entertaining parody of James' prose style in the book. It is clear that Maurice does not &quot;see things&quot; in that sense or to quite that extent (in fact his trouble is that he does _not_ see things). Rather, Maurice's shakes, voices and palpitations mean that he will not be believed by his family, and he is forced to deal with things on his own.This is a very fine comic novel, with mild horror and (as often with Amis) a little more depth than it pretends to.Cheers!Laon"},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"Kingsley Amis' sole horror novel, \\"The Green Man,\\" had long been on my list of \\"must read\\" books, for the simple reason that it has been highly recommended by three sources that I trust. British critic David Pringle chose it for inclusion in his overview volume \\"Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels,\\" as did Michael Moorcock in \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books\\" AND Brian Aldiss in \\"Horror: 100 Best Books.\\" As it turns out, all of this praise is not misplaced, and Amis' 1969 novel of modern-day satire and the supernatural is as entertaining as can be. The tale concerns a middle-aged man named Maurice Allington, who owns an inn called The Green Man in rural Hertfordshire, not far from Cambridge. Allington, when we meet him, is being kept busy running his inn, struggling through a floundering second marriage, dealing with his sullen 13-year-old daughter, drinking incredible amounts of scotch every day, and attempting to talk his new mistress into a three-way with him and his wife. As if he doesn't have enough on his plate, the ghost of diabolical necromancer Dr. Thomas Underhill --who used to live in the inn some 300 years before--has been contacting him of late, and the legendary Green Man himself (a sort of lumbering tree monster) has begun to make appearances, too. Those closest to poor Maurice suspect that his stories of ghosts and tiny birds that fly through his hand are a result of the DT's (it really is remarkable how much liquor Maurice drinks in a day), but the reader somehow never doubts that what Maurice sees is objective reality... Mixing social satire, amusing incidents and some good eerie scenes, \\"The Green Man\\" does keep the reader enthralled. Amis, no stranger to the bottle himself, from what I've read, seems to really identify with Allington, and uses him as his mouthpiece to expound eruditely on topics such as food (a hateful, bothersome nuisance), death (he wonders how one cannot be totally obsessed with the idea), sex (he thinks that women's \\"emotional secretiveness\\" is due to the fact that they do not ejaculate) and religion (Maurice's views of the afterlife are radically turned about by what he goes through in this tale). In one startling section of the book, Maurice meets a nice young man in a dark suit who stops Time and who, it is inferred, is none other than God himself, and another fascinating conversation ensues. \\"The Green Man\\" is not an especially frightening book, although some parts (the reading of Underhill's diary; the midnight disinterment of Underhill's grave; Maurice's \\"nighttime\\" vision in broad daylight) are indeed genuinely creepy. This is an extremely literate, extremely British ghost story that functions as both satire and thriller. In another section of the book, Maurice tells us that he thinks all novelists engage in a \\"puny and piffling art,\\" and that fiction is pitifully inadequate to the task it sets itself. But perhaps narrator Maurice should read back the book he has just delivered to us; it is neither puny nor piffling, and succeeds on many levels indeed."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"I saw a movie of &quot;The Green Man&quot; on A&amp;E a few years back, and it didn't make any damn sense (save for the brilliant casting of Albert Finney as Maurice Allington), so I read the book. Wow! It was a treat.Maurice isn't the sort of man I would like, nor do I suspect he would like me, but somehow he works well as a narrator. The story engages on several levels: you spend much time debating (especially after Allington sees &quot;God&quot;) whether we aren't simply privy to the pitiful delusions of a pill and alcohol gulping man on his last legs rather than dealing with the understatedly fiendish Dr. Underhill and his monstrous creation.Who knows, and who cares? Great read."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"An extremely clever well written novel of suspense, The Green Man, is also full of social satire and even some existential metaphysical speculation. The Green Man appears in the ancient religions of the British isles, especially around Druid nature worship, May Day, and the character of Jack of the Greens. Amis takes the usual image of the Green Man, a human character composed of leaves, vines, flowers, twigs. However Amis has this creature become a homicidal monster under the influence of evil, a nice twist on the theme.I am not sure whether I would call the book a book about terror since only once does the presence of the terrifying conglomeration of twigs and leaves, the Green Man, become threatening. Rather, the narrative follows two parallel suspenseful paths. In one narrative path, Maurice, the owner of a country inn, restaurant, and pub is trying to seduce his neighbor's wife and convince her to engage in a three-way sexual encounter while at the same time trying to convince his young second wife, Joyce, to engage in this activity. His marrage to a hard working, devoted, attractive, adoring wife is falling apart due to Maurice's lack of attention and involvement.In the other narrative path, first Maurice's father and then Maurice begin to see apparitions of the evil ghost Dr. Thomas Underhill, or the ghost of Underhill's poor murdered red-haired wife, or hears the breaking twigs and branches as the Green Man stalks the inn looking for unlocked doors. Both of these themes are woven skillfully together to ensure the book is a complete page-turner. We ask ourselves, does Maurice get both women into bed? We also ask, does Maurice figure out the nature of the ghosts that are appearing to him?Amis keeps the reader on our toes since Maurice runs around having sex, taking pills, drinking far too much liquor, investigating the ghosts in his Inn, trying to bury his recently deceased father, and run a customer-oriented service-business. To this add his neglected bored teenaged daughter with whom Maurice never communicates in a genuine manner. Thus we are not sure as to how much of the visions of ghosts are real and how much is produced by the combination of pills and alcohol.We are treated to a clever conversation between Maurice and the Devil on the nature of existence and death, both of which the Devil can only offer sarcastic and pointed observations but few insights. Amis dresses the Devil in the latest grays and blacks, sounding much more like a runway model than the embodiment of evil. We are also treated to Maurice's encounters with an agnostic know-it-all Church of England priest. Amis' descriptions of this priest are almost are priceless as Jane Austen's insightful descriptions of Reverend Collins in Pride and Prejudice, where the priest is a very foolish character. However a priest can perform exorcism, whether he believes in it or not, and a exorcism is eventually needed in this drama.While having sex in the woods, drinking excessively all day, and keeping customers happy in the Inn, Maurice tries to study and track down the secrets around Dr. Thomas Underhill. Solving this mystery gets increasingly dangerous and suspenseful. Despite the alcoholism, Maurice is actually an extremely clever man, which is certainly lucky for him when he tries to outwit the ghost of Dr. Underhill, an apparition that we come to see as increasingly evil and dangerous with each page.This book is highly recommended. It is well crafted and thoughtful and fully entertaining. The suspense is balanced with off-beat witty sarcastic humor which at times made me laugh out loud. I found the humor rather than the terror was the driving force behind the novel, which is a good attribute."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"Maurice Allington -- attractive, alcoholic, and fifty-three -- runs a small inn in the West Country, The Green Man, that is haunted by a most unquiet spirit: Dr Thomas Underhill, a seventeenth-century wizard with a reputation for killing his wife and other enemies by means of the black arts. Host and ghost would seem on the surface to have little in common, except Maurice has a dark side, an interest in sexual mischief and a tendency to use other people to get what he wants. When the heavy-drinking Maurice, who narrates the story, begins to see Dr Underhill and other ghosts about his inn himself, he cannot make his friends or family he is visited by anything other than the DTs; his siutation becomes desperate when he realizes the good dead doctor has a plan in store for him.Thanks in part to a well-cast television adaptation with Albert Finney, Kingsley Amis's amusing little 1969 Gothic has oddly turned out to be one of the best-remembered of his novels (after LUCKY JIM, of course), even though it was mostly an experiment in genre. The ghost story is well done, and Maurice himself proves a very intelligent and convivial companion; still, the novel is less well executed than its elegant size and style might suggest (the scene with Maurice speaking with God seems a real mistake, and none of the other characters seems very well fleshed out). The thoughtfulness of the ghost story is still appreciated, especially since it came from an era when they were not so greatly in fashion. But you can't help wishing Amis had done a bit more with it--it seems (perhaps fittingly?) too insubstantial."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"I think it's fair to say that Amis has fallen out of fashion.This book is out of print and hasn't been reviewed in years.That is a shame.Your'e missing something by not reading Amis.He was not a profound writer.You won't mistake him for Doestoyevsky or Kafka.What he was, was a sharp ,acerbic observer and a very funny one at that.Amis comes across as a writer who kept depression , even , despair at bay with a mixture of humor,detachment and alcohol.It didn't work too well in his life but it's the basis of some of funniest 20th century fiction your'e likely to read.I suspect that most people who read Amis have a favorite novel and it's my guess that it usually is LUCKY JIM.I can understand that because LUCKY JIM is a comic masterpiece,it is one the funniest books ever written.However ,I actually prefer THE GREEN MAN.It's a subtler more mature work.The main character Maurice is actually a pretty awful person but I couldn't help laughing at his predicaments(usually self created).Amis liked genre fiction and in this novel he takes a stab at the supernatural.He does a pretty good job at creating a credibly creepy atmosphere.There really is a ghost out there.Maurice even gets to meet God!Yet the novel does not strive for profoundity or philosophical depth, to its credit.Amis is perfectly content to leave that to others.Thus he avoids the deadening pretension and ersatz seriousness of so many lesser writers.Maurices grand project is to have a threesome wth his wife and another woman and much of the novel focuses on this somewhat absurd quest that goes comically awry.What you get here is an excellently done portrait of the way we live now that throws in a decent ghost story ,some philosophical reflection and a number of laughs.There are very few authors who can carry this off as deftly as Amis."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"This is the first novel I've read by Kingsley Amis and I intend to read more. I decided to begin with this one over Lucky Jim because of its inclusion in Horror: 100 Best Books. It tells the story of Maurice Allington, who owns a very nice inn in the English countryside. It is supposed to be haunted, and Maurice will immediately tell the local legends, but he has never seen anything, until...Now, I don't know how effective this is as a bit of horror literature - by which, I mean it isn't really scary. There is an appearance by a creepy monster but after the appearance of the \\"Young Man,\\" the novel makes such a significant break with reality that there is no real tension anymore.The pleasure in the book comes from the wit of the narrator. He's not really concerned with ghosts - he's mostly working out how to engineer a three-way with his wife and his mistress. The funniest bit comes when he's justifying himself and then breaks the fourth wall and tells the reader off for judging him. Too much of the book is taken up with metaphysical musings and British anti-religiosity is rather boring by now. On the other hand, I was impressed enough with his style to go on to some of his other works."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"Different people expect different things from works of supernatural fiction - some like plenty of bad-tempered fiends and flying gore a la Clive Barker, while others prefer the more ponderous, &quot;what-if-it really-happened&quot; feel of The X Files or the short stories of M.R. James. Amis' novel offers what is to my mind a much more satisfying kind of scare, one which involves a blurring of the lines between outer and inner malignancies - between our fear of the quiet rustlings and creaks that whisper through the walls of our homes, and that of the faint stirrings of even darker forces within our selves. The protagonist of this novel, Maurice Allington, is in many ways an attractive character - gregarious, witty and restless in the presence of fools - but he is also an abominably selfish and morally slovenly human being whose libidinal fantasies about the women in his life are forever in danger of creeping a little too close to the surface. These features of his character recommend him to the attention of an old inhbitant of the little country inn theat he manages - a philosopher, alchemist, and mystic who, in addition to having been dead for over two-hundred years, is in the position to make Maurice an offer that he may not be able to refuse... _The Green Man_ is full of scary scenes - ghostly arrivals, an excorcism, a confrontation with the dreadful, elemental monster of the title, and a truly unforgettable &quot;interview with God&quot; (the Devil? the Grim Reaper? It's hard to tell with the theologically intractable Amis). The climax of the novel is thoroughly satisfying, and reveals Amis to be something of an optimist about human nature, at least to the extent that he believes we are able to recoil from our most truly horrifying desires and shut the door on them before they break through the forest and tear apart our homes."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"I feel curmudgeonly only giving this four stars, it should be four and a half. It fails only by comparison with his very best, for me \`Take a Girl like You', \`The Old Devils' and the brilliant \`One Fat Englishman'.Like \`The After-Death League' this is an exploration into metaphysical realms, but a much more satisfactory one. The earlier book had style but a number of objectives seemed to be competing with each other, whereas this is a splendid Faustian fable which holds together extremely well.It seems like a mid-life attempt to map reality for a man who lived life a full-tilt and had no intention of putting on the brakes but nevertheless needed to check out what his satnav was telling him.I am not a connoisseur of horror or ghost stories but I thought certain scenes in here, as mentioned by other reviewers, are superb. Kingsley is not everyone's idea of a hippy, but it was 1969 and one of the main figures is very reminiscent of the excellent film \`The Wicker Man', tapping in as it does into some proper old English mythology.Delightful, and memorable."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It starts out as some sort of English comedy -- a guy who owns a pub, has a drinking problem, has health problems, has a marriage problem, has a mistress problem, and has children problems, suddenly starts seeing ghosts.Of course no one believes him, since he's probably drunk, under stress, or on medication, and it seems the more he tries to get people to believe him, the worse his predicament gets. But as he comes closer to discovering the origins of the name of his pub, The Green Man, the horror starts to take charge over comedy.The ending is delightful, English, and quite satisfying."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"Kingsley Amis's 'The Green Man' is an interesting mix of horror and satire. Maurice Allington is the alcoholic owner of The Green Man Inn, whose main preoccupation is trying to convince his wife and mistress to have a menage a trois. The Green Man Inn dates back several centuries and is reputed to be haunted, although Maurice himself had never seen anything in his years as owner, until one night he sees a mysterious red headed woman on his stair. This is followed by the sudden death of his father who appeared to have seen something before dying of a stroke. Other strange occurrences follow, but his doctor and family think they are hallucinations brought on by stress and excessive drinking. Unfortunately the story loses a lot of its momentum when God (appearing as a well dressed young man) pays a visit. The scene is clever and funny, but Amis sacrifices all the suspenseful buildup to write a clever piece of satire. More successful is the character of the agnostic local Anglican priest, although I didn't think Amis explored all the possibilities inherent in that character given the nature of the story. Still a very enjoyable read, just keep in mind it's not a straight horror story."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"Some of the best and most entertaining fiction by Kingsley Amis is comparatively little known, and I am pleased to see The Green Man available here and there. It has his usual virtues of offbeat humour, a gift for atmosphere, an engaging show of fogeyishness and some really memorable writing; and it has his occasional traits of implausibility, lapses of concentration and discursiveness, which I sometimes find irritating and sometimes entertaining depending on what mood I am in.This is a distinctly original ghost story. Whether or not Amis found the basic inspiration for his green man in legends, or in The Golden Bough, or in other fiction I have no idea. I can't think of a similar creature in similar literature that I have come across, perhaps simply because there is no similar literature. The thread of the preternatural does not dominate the narrative, which is largely concerned with the interactions between the narrator and his family and acquaintances. The story is told by an alcoholic publican, remarkably lucid and vigorous for the most part, and opinionated and prejudiced in a way that suggests to me that the author had put some of himself into the character. He is the only character in the book who is drawn in the round, but his alcohol-dependency is not investigated in any depth, simply treated as a necessity to the plot. He is bored, grumpy and dissatisfied - familiar enough Amis themes - and predictably in search of sexual, if not precisely emotional, interest outside his rather flat and uninvolving marriage. To me, he is not completely convincing. He is rather grandly detached and above-it-all for someone with such a massive and corrosive problem of his own, but that is not the sort of quibble I would expect to bother Amis.The real reason for the alcoholic theme is that the author is being a bit of an old tease. Allington, the publican, sees some pretty amazing things, and we are supposed to be left wondering to what extent they are objectively real and to what extent drink-induced delusions. For the most part they were real for me, and I believe real from the author's standpoint too, until the latter stages of the book. Here I detect a touch of wheel-slip - I simply think Amis is losing the plot a little, a suspicion confirmed by the way he winds up the narration in a slightly perfunctory manner. It's a fine story for all that. It will certainly appeal to his aficionados in general if they have not yet got around to it, and if you acquire it for a 5-or-6-hour flight or train journey on a caveat lector basis, I shall be disappointed if you are disappointed."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"Amis' writing turns the most wretched characters into sympathetic and comic protagonists. This book is no exception. At its most superficial level, the plot is that of a very silly horror story. The elements of absurdity keep the pace quick, preventing us from consciously dwelling on the book's philosophical undertones. The result is a delightful cross between literary perfection and an episode of Scooby Doo.This book would have made a perfect addition to a time capsule: on a number of levels, it brilliantly reflects the time in which it was written (the late 60's)."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"I tried every avenue to find this book on Kindle or another eBook source. Finally, I bought it second hand and it is truly wonderful. If anyone out there can tell me other authors like Kingsley Amis - erudite, droll, intimate, urbane and British - I wish they would pass them along. He wrote a whole collection of books, and only a few are eBooks. This combines a ghost story, a family saga, an addict's memoir, and all in a very short, terrific book."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"This book was suspenseful and kept me reading till the end (I'm not typically a fan of fiction so that's saying quite a lot). It's a fun, quick read."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"The Green Man was very different from most of the Kingsley Amis books that I have read, but I enjoyed this one all the same. His dark perception of the swing of things added to his sarcastic humor (a little Jim Dixon in there somewhere) made this book a thought provoking intriging story."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"I was introduced to the Green Man by my mother. It was her recomendation that led me to read the book. When I did I was rivited.I have been trying to find the interview that speaks to it, but apparently Kingsley Amis had an encounter with a creature like the one that was dipicted in the book.What did they talk about? How offen was he visited? What does Amis think it was? When you read it I feel that you are reading about a true expierience.When the Young Man appears and time stops, who is this? What is he. Is it death? Is he a messenger? Is it God or the Devil or are God and the Devil one in the same? He gives Morris a Cross, why? \\"He says to Morris you will never be free of me.\\" Is it an expresion of the free will that we have?Morris asks the young man about making life less hard on people, and he says\\" No prospect of that.\\" We can choose to do good or evil.We are responsible for the choises that we make.We are responsable for aquiring the knowlage of the tree that we were forbiden to eat from.God said when we did eat of the tree of knowlage \\"you will be as I am\\" Or is it because we see the experience through Morris's eyes and that we experience his inability to decern due to his prolonged relationship with the bottle.I can tell you from my own expirience with ghosts that their is life after death and that you must be careful, spirits can be good or bad. The novel is superbley written and it is a book that I will read my entire life. I think it is a book that everyone should read. A story of exporation, understanding,true fear, and redemtion."},{"Title":"THE GREEN MAN","review":"This book isn't scary--only slightly amusing. The \\"English-ness\\" of the narrator is often funny & witty, but just as often annoying (I get the feeling that canned laughter at the end of the narrator's countless quips would lend a little force to his attempts at humor). I guess a lot of the point of the book is that very notion of the Englishman as a bottled-up, desperate figure, but that's just not interesting enough to justify this book. The supernatural events of the story mostly struck me as silly and disjointed. I'm sure there are a few interpretational aspects I'm missing (actually, this book doesn't feel worthy of much deep thought), but not enough, I think, to redeem this tale and make it worth the so-positive reviews it has garnered here. Read the _The Haunting of Hill House_ by Shirley Jackson if you want a nuanced, creepy, interesting, psychological haunted house story. After reading the last page of _The Green Man_, I just felt like shrugging, putting the book down, and moving on to something else. Get it from the library, but don't waste your money unless you know you'll like it."},{"Title":"Liu Tsung-y&#252;an and Intellectual Change in T'ang China, 773-819 (Cambridge Studies in Chinese History, Literature and Institutions)","review":"Most people who like to read poetry are probably acquainted with the Chinese T'ang dynasty. This was a period which witnessed the appearance of arguably the best set of poets of China's History: names like Li Po, Tu Fu or Wang Wei which abundantly appear in all anthologies and translations of the Celestial Empire's writings.Beyond its aesthetic fertility, the T'ang period (618-903) saw the political reunification of the country after almost four hundred years of political division and foreign invasion, and the birth of an expansive foreign policy that brought back into the fold the territories of Central Asia and present-day Vietnam that had been part of the Empire during the Han Dynasty. The expansion wasn't, nevertheless, unidirectional and aggressive: Chinese culture was enriched and revitalized with the new arts, music and dance, peoples and customs that flocked from all the new territories and from even beyond, bringing exotic and fascinating products with them (for this, see mr. Schafer's 'The Golden Peaches of Samarkand').But while the empire was being reborn, it wasn't able to eliminate many of the elements that had appeared in the country in the fragmentation period. Among these was a pair of religions: one of the foreign (Buddhism) and one national (Taoism, which before had been a set of philosophical beliefs and alchemical practices, but which under competition with Buddha's followers developed a whole theology and institutional form). All this had boded ill for Confucianism, the old official religion and ideological pillar of Han Dynasty China. It had survived, of course, but in a greatly reduced format, as a series of domestic, institutional and political practices, but subordinated to the two religions we've mentioned.In the middle years of T'ang, and after a series of political crises and literary changes, this situation starts to move. Writers and mandarins start a movement to restore Confucianism to its proper place as the axis of Chinese life (and, by the way, making themselves the centre of its politics too). In writing, we get the ku-wen movement, which promotes a 'return' to old writing. In Theology and Politics, the first seeds of the Neo-Confucian ideas which will flourish in the next dynasty (Sung) and until the end of the Chinese Empire (1911). This intellectual change, as seen and articulated through the life and works of one of its participants: the nobleman, poet, writer and public servant Liu Tsung-y&uuml;an (&#26611;&#23447;&#20803;, or Liu Zongyuan in the pidgin transliterarion) is the topic of the book we're talking about.In this book's pages you'll find the biographical background of Liu, and how it influenced his political, religious, ritual and aesthetic views; his dashing but finally unfortunate political career; his life and experiences in exile in the south of China, and the evolution of his political thought, that progressively gets nearer and nearer to the changing Confucianism of his times, a movement that was lionized by the another exiled writer and mandarin: Han Y&uuml; (&#38867;&#24840;). We learn the things they share and also their differences, which are what make Liu Tsung-y&uuml;an such an interesting thinker: a passionate believer in the obligation of state and public servants towards the people, a (from today's point of view) a materialist and anti-metaphysician who rejected the old Confucian views of a Heaven that takes part in the world to punish the wicked and reward the good. Ideas that have endeared him greatly with some current political and ideological trends, even if they mystify and decontextualize his thought.To conclude: Mr. Jo-Shui Chen's book is an excellent piece of deep and entertaining scholarship, that will help those who are interested in this topic (or even just those who want to learn something and have a good time while doing it)and will allow you to get partially acquainted with one of the most interesting figures of Chinese literature. If there's any defect that can be found in this book, I'd say it is only in the small size and in the absence of more poems and texts of Liu Tsung-y&uuml;an, an author that sadly hasn't been much translated into English (the situation is even worse for another Liu that is the object of much devotion of mine: Liu Y&uuml;-hsi (&#21129;&#31161;&#37675;), but we'll talk about that another day..."},{"Title":"Royal flush,: The story of Minette, (The Golden library)","review":"In this novel Irwin recounts the life of Henrietta Anne (Minette) daughter of Charles I of England, and begins when a young Minette and her mother are in exile in France during England's Civil War. Eventually Charles Stuart regains the crown and Minette marries the younger brother of Louis XIV, Philippe Duke of Orl&eacute;ans - but Philippe's temper, vanity and penchant for *pretty* young men are not conducive to wedded bliss and Minette soon find herself growing closer to Louis. Much beyond this I don't want to say - if you're familiar with Minette's history you know what happens and I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you.This is the first book by Irwin I've read and while I enjoyed her writing, but be warned it is dated (first published in 1932) and best taken in small daily doses and not in one lump read. I found myself a bit lost at times with several of the secondary characters and their multiple names/titles and would have appreciated a who's who reference guide, although you don't find those often in older novels. If you've never read anything on Minette and/or the court of Louis XIV I don't recommend this as a starting point - you'll be tossing it by page 100. However, if you are familiar with the period this is a good novel to give you a closer look at Minette's tale."},{"Title":"Royal flush,: The story of Minette, (The Golden library)","review":"I first read this book when I was a young woman. I have always loved history and historical fiction. I felt that this book gave a very close portrayal of the kind of relationship which could develop between \\"cousins\\" and very closely related persons, especially noble ones.

I want to read it again and own a copy----even a paperback."},{"Title":"The Miracle of Metaphysical Healing","review":"I read many different new age books, and this one ranks among my favorite! I cannot put it down. Another reviewer had said something along the lines of not being particularly interesting reading, and while it's true that it's simple, that's actually one of the reasons it's so appealing! It speaks to everyone at every level. Each technique (which they are all basically the same with changed wording and some add colors) is illustrated in full detail. I've just started using this today for weight loss and already feel less hunger. One woman lost 40 pounds in a month! This is really not a diet book, but a CURE-ALL!Everything is covered in this book. If you are interested in understanding how to effect healing yourself, and are an average Mr/Ms. Anyone, like me, I highly recommend this book!Ms. Monahan covers everything: ulcers, arthritus, sinus problems, mental/emotional problems, alcholism, stuttering, common colds, burns, asthma, attaining more energy, kidney disease, headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, smoking, allergies, gout, menstrual cramps, skin problems, unhappiness, financial problems, and more! I have already cried a few times while reading some of the healing stories in this book. WHat I love is that the healing really starts to work immediately!

She was using the methods to bring about change for her entire family! Having been a student of metaphysical teachings for many years,I was pleased to learn of the success she was having using the methods outlined in this book. After briefly reading some passages, I decided to locate a copy for myself. I have changed the wording of my treatments to keep them positive and included an acknowledgement to the source from which, I believe, all things flow. At one point things were moving so fast, I had to adjust the wording; mostly because I hadn't properly prepared for the fulfillment of my request and the physical changes that were occuring.

These include healing of oneself and others, both physical and mental, solving money and relationship problems, and more. Many examples of healing are given and every chapter ends with the exercise technique to solve that particular problem. Although this book is valuable, I have not found the text to be as engaging or inspiring as, for example, the work of Catherine Ponder or Joseph Murphy. Also, not enough emphasis is put on harnessing the power of the subconscious or on how to overcome resistance from the conscious mind. Having said that, everyone who seriously and consistently practices the eternal truths explained here will find great benefit."},{"Title":"The Miracle of Metaphysical Healing","review":"This book gives a way of contacting your higher self, and then giving commands for it to carry out, such as improving your health and finances.

She is joined by her sister, a painter, for this project. There are some clever ideas and some where you will think, &quot;Are they kidding?&quot; The rooms are gorgeous, but frankly, my children would have reduced them to rubble in a few short weeks. Many of the ideas are adaptable to guest rooms or for incorporation into more practical environments.

It is based on designs with the baby quilt as the central focal point. There are lots of tips on room color and ideas on furniture to use, etc. I think the ideas may be challenging to create for people who don't sew or paint (aren't crafters), but the book is lovely and has a wonderful inspirational value which anyone decorating a nursery should enjoy.

I've had this book a few years and whenever I feel blue and uninspired, I just pick Jennifer's book up and my day is brightened.In addition, Jennifer has designed some awesome fabrics that really give a quilt that quality look. I sometimes lack confidence in my color and blending choices, but this book makes it \\"kid's play\\".EVERY quilt is wonderful (usually not all in a quilt book, maybe 2 or 3 are great and the others so-so). Even if you don't have children it's a nice book to have because, well, someone is usually having a baby, or child's birthday, etc. Some of the quilts are more difficult than others, but the instructions are straight forward. Besides the featured projects the book has lots and lots of quilts as display and inspiration, so no, not all the quilts come with instructions, just the featured quilt projects. But it gives one the opportunity to look at color choices and a similar pattern if you like the quilt used as decor. The bonus is that there are many decorating ideas (for those who need it, like me).Jennifer, you and your sister did a fantastic job.

Well-written and insightful, &quot;Racial Attitudes in America&quot; is also very understandable for the curious observer of race relations. Schuman et al. analyze national survey data from the 1970s to the present in order to understand how the public feels about such important issues as affirmative action and other &quot;race-targeted&quot; policies. Moreover, the authors examine the extent to which prejudice and other negative racial attitudes are still widespread in the United States. Though extremely informative, the book devotes far more attention to examining trends in racial attitudes than to understanding the sources of them. Nonetheless, this book will provide a valuable starting point for any student or researcher interested in understanding the sources of racial attitudes."},{"Title":"I Can Only Imagine: Mercy Me with Jeff Kinley","review":"I have read many books about Christian living, prayer and worship.

The aircraft's POH (pilots operating handbook) does indeed list several performance-oriented facts and figures but these are usually only valid for aircraft at their maximum gross weights! To add insult to injury, high performance flying is not readily intuitive and, in some situations, is outright counter-intuitive.Considering how many accidents occur due to this lack of knowledge, a new approach is needed, an approach which entails generating intelligent data and figures tailored specifically to the pilot's particular aircraft and flying conditions so that one can, as the old aviation adage admonishes, &quot;Fly by the numbers.&quot;Such an approach is outlined in the new book, Performance of Light Aircraft by John T. Lowry, PhD, of Flight Physics. Lowry is based in Montana where, due to the mountains, I suspect every flight needs high performance! The conscientious reader is rewarded with the information required to determine aircraft performance by employing what the author terms &quot;The Bootstrap Approach,&quot; basically a precise, step-by-step process for determining a propeller-driven aircraft's performance data.One actually gets to be a test pilot, as it were, in order to collect and then generate performance numbers for the particular airplane. The most noteworthy aspect of this process is that once these numbers are in place, the pilot can use them over and again and for different altitudes, aircraft weights, and wind conditions! This is truly an excellent book.I do, however, have to point out several things:1. This is a very expensive book, coming in at close to $70. One would have expected a lower price for a soft-bound book or at the very least, an included CD or disk containing software to help in recording and/or generating the above numbers! (Note: While there is a disk of spreadsheet templates available privately from the author, it costs an additional $45.)2. Be prepared to spend some time and effort understanding the theory behind the Bootstrap Approach. If one just wants to get the necessary formulae and plug in numbers, contact the author at jlowry@mcn.net for his other book, essentially a field guide to implementing the Bootstrap method."},{"Title":"Performance of Light Aircraft (AIAA Education Series)","review":"In 'Performance of Light Aircraft,' John Lowry takes on the daunting challenge of quantifying airplane performance and wins! As a physicist, Dr. Lowry visualizes the myriad of variables affecting performance; as a pilot, Dr. Lowry understands the requirement for practical and readily-available information. So no need to be intimidated by complex derivations or strings of formulas--Dr. Lowry is with us, systematically grinding often unwieldy theory down into a user-friendly methodology he calls 'The Bootstrap Approach' (TBA). Along the way, we see TBA applied to an ordinary Cessna 172. We also get a sense of just how incomplete Pilot Operating Handbooks may be. TBA allows pilots not only to fill in the blanks, but also to glean critical information tailored exactly to the specific airplane.Whichever path your aviation career follows--be it as a test pilot, designer/builder, professional pilot, instructor, hobbyist--take 'Performance of Light Aircraft' with you."},{"Title":"SPC for short production runs reference handbook","review":"As a quality professional, I looked far and wide for a comprehensive sourcebook on the subject of measuring process capability.

His plot twists are a bit difficult to grasp outside of a theatre, but still very enjoyable.Chekhov utilizes a realistic writing style. Fantastic and absurd stories where the actors just flailed around on stage and delivered their lines were of little use to him. His plays can be viewed in many different ways. A scene that at one moment can seem tragic, can be comedic if looked at another way. There is no consistant good or evil in a Chekhov piece. He once wrote, &quot;depict life as it actually is. Its aim is truth, unconditional and honest... a man of letters... has to... realize that dung heaps play a very significant role in a landscape and that evil passions are as inherent in life as good ones.&quot; He wanted the emotions that the characters were experiencing to be sensed in the actions of the actors on stage, not in the words that anyone could sit down and read. This makes his work some of the more difficult to perform in theatre today. Only an experienced actor who is able to create a reality of their character is capable of performing a Chekhov play. Chekhov's comedies are often mistaken for tragidies. They are actually perfect examples of high comedy. In a true tragedy, the main characters have some heroic qualities that make their fall devestating to the audience. The characters in Chekhov's plays &quot;The Seagull,&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; have no such qualities. Chekhov also had a very particular way of writing his play. He set out with a purpose. He felt that the writer of the play needed a clearly defined reason to be writing, or else they would find themselves lost with a mediocre piece of work."},{"Title":"Chekhov for the Stage: The Sea Gull, Uncle Vanya, the Three Sisters, the Cherry Orchard","review":"I read an edition that had only two of these plays, so my review is based on two plays only - \\"The Cherry Orchard\\" and \\"The Three Sisters\\". Chekov's trademark is to write about strong and determined women. This is quite a stretch since the plays were written in the very early twentieth century. These plays are superbly crafted, and the drama unfolds like a flower in slow motion photography. His characters in both are also wonderful. It would be a real treat to see even one of these masterpieces performed on the stage. I recommend this author highly to anyone interested in adding plays to their reading repertoire"},{"Title":"A Dangerous Grace","review":"The only problem I had with this book was that it stressed that animals were far inferior to man, a fundamentalist belief that I'm kind of uncomfortable with, because it allows a new land/agriculture ethic to be destroyed. Man should be a good stward of what God has given him. Anyway, What I really liked about Colson's book was that he offered bits and pieces of food for thought. One of my passions is delving into the P.O.V.s of others who might not necessarily share my own. I recommend it, on the basis that the reader will learn something about how Colson presents his God."},{"Title":"The Lonely Planet Boy","review":"This book begins as a slight little story about one young man's obsession with pop and rock. It's very British - it takes place in London, after all - and makes many references to early '80s musical artists that the modern reader might never have even heard of. Plus, the characters don't seem to have much going on other than their musical preferences. But despite that, The Lonely Planet Boy is a pretty entertaining read. Plus, it's very short. Kip Wilson, a shy English youth, discovers rock chanteuse Mina (a combination of the VU's Nico and the lead singer from Missing Persons), writes a glowing review of her for the rock magazine that barely employs him, and soon enough both his writing career and Mina's rock career take off. Kip soon becomes nothing more than a slavish fanboy, obsessed with Mina, even flying to the US out of his own wallet to cover her tour. It is here in America that the first of the book's two shocking incidents takes place; the way Mina shows Kip what she thinks of him was pretty jolting. The end comes rather quickly after this, and the second devastating act takes place in the last pages of the book. These two incidents alone change the entire tone of the novel, which started off as an almost nostalgic look at early '80s pop and music journalism, but ends as a grim reflection on the strange relationship between artist and fan, and how some fans can become slightly obsessed, even fanatical. It isn't the feel-good book of the year, that's for sure, but I got a few chuckles out of it. Of course, I got a bunch of laughs out of Moby-Dick, too, so that's not surprising."},{"Title":"The Windsingers","review":"In the first book of the Windsinger series, Harpy's Flight, Lindholm describes a struggle to cease from mourning, to accept the worthwhileness of life despite the fact of death and loss. In this second book of the series, Lindholm goes on to ask whether, after all, there is nobility in common humanity, or whether we should aspire to graduate, to transform into creatures with longevity and power. The Windsingers are mistresses of the weather and political intrigue. They are as fascinating and scary a women's club as the Bene Gerit or the Aes Sedai in other fantasy worlds. In this book, Ki's lover Vandien attempts to retrieve a sacred relic of the Windsingers. As a reward, his painful and humiliating facial scar will supposedly be healed. Meanwhile Ki unwittingly becomes the agent of the Windsingers' most powerful enemy, the Wizard Dresh. But who can really be trusted? What is the real reward, and what the actual cost of success? This is a great story, with plenty humor, suspense, and good sense. These books should never have gone out of print and I trust a new edition will be published soon. In the meantime, it is well worth its cost on the used book exchange."},{"Title":"The Windsingers","review":"I was fifteen when I found this book and the third part of theWindsinger trilogy on the leftover table of a local bookstore. By aninner impulse I bought them and never regretted it. If I had known beforehand how well written and deeply involving these books were, I probably would have been willing to pay much more than I had...the fate of these books tells us how easily very good novels can be overlooked in the neverending line of average fantasy books they are published along with.As I said in the review to &quot;Harpy's Flight,&quot; Lindholm created one of the most vivid worlds in fantasy writing you'll encounter. She walks on the grate of being able to tell the reader how this world and all its powers work and still leaving it enough of it secrets to keep it out of a sterile light, which would reveal it all. She highly succeeded in that. For example, you will find out that the &quot;Windsingers,&quot; girls and women who form some sort of cult, are able to steer the weather by their singing and can bring misery or wealth to whoever displeases or pleases them. Some is revealed of how they formed and what powers might lie beyond them, but Ki, one of the main characters in the book, won't find out and you aren't either. Ki can only imagine as far as she cares and so can only you.Where character development was still, well, &quot;developing&quot; in Harpy's Flight, it is in very good condition here. Ki is a very strong female lead and equal to Vandien, her partner who travels along with her from time to time. What makes them so deep is that they are not perfect. They encounter sides to themselves and each other they might not like but have to get along with. This development is especially true for Ki in this trilogy, but Vandien gets his share in &quot;Luck of the Wheels.&quot; They are imperfect, sometimes moody, have a couple of bad habits but are good at heart. In other words, they are human and have a personality and you'll hate to part with them.If you manage to get a hold of one of these books you are in for some very enjoyable time.

They'll both be hired by different people and the book with alternatively follow their separate stories, until their final reunion.Ki has to haul crates from Dyal to Bitters, a nearby village, but what seems at first like easy task will turn out delicate and fraught with danger. Indeed, the terms of the contract specify that the boxes must be delivered whole, and their content is extremely precious, not to mention coveted by the Windsingers, a powerful cult of women who can control the weather.For his part, Vandien has accepted a challenge in exchange for the lifting of the disfiguring scar that divides his face since his fight with a Harpy. He has to go to False Harbor during Temple Ebb festival, when the tide is lowest, and recover a legendary chest in the Windsingers' sunken temple. Does the chest really exist, or is Srolan's promise of healing only a false hope?I enjoyed Vandien's side of the story more than Ki's. I found the fisherfolk in False Harbor, especially Janie the village's mobbing target whose grandfather has supposedly seen the chest, much more intriguing than the Windsingers and the strange wizard Dresh, and Vandien's struggle more gripping."},{"Title":"The Windsingers","review":"There are two stories in this one book. Or maybe I should say two threads that, while going in different directions, are both of the same material?Vandien is offered a job he can't refuse. Not because he needs the money but because he is promised something that he truly wants. Or wants removed. You see, he has a scar. Which I am sure you are aware of from the first book. And he is aware of it also. So is everybody else. It is like a veil placed between him and shop keepers, children, traders. They assume a history or a back story when they see it.And he has been told that it can be removed. If he does a special job.Every year, a teamster is selected to get a treasure from the storm tossed sea. A chest in a temple that is revealed once a year by the lowest tide. A temple that use to belong to the Windsingers. Who DON'T seem to wish the chest to be recovered.Is it a game? Is it a sport? Why allow the villagers to hire a teamster at all? What happens if it is recovered?Ki has her own problems. She ends up trying to transfer a cargo that is dangerous and valuable and wanted. Wanted by the Windsingers. A cargo that will cause them both trouble as the two threads, the two stories, crash into each other near the end of the book.How many threads are in this web of danger and complex plotting?

Each one is a gem itself and brings fresh ideas to the topic of Germanic religion.The first essay looks at Indo-European components of Germanic religion and reconsiders the story of the death of Baldr from a comparative method. The analysis is well done and very detailed.The second essay looks at the story of the creation of humans from logs, the scant parallels in other Indo-European traditions, and the internal structure. Particular attention is paid to the role of Lodhurr and his gifts.The third essay looks at divine names from Indo-European and their connection with the sky and with sovereignty.The fourth essay is an overview of Germanic religion. This essay, which occupies nearly half of the monograph, forced me to reconsider some of Dumezil's theories on Germanic concepts of law and sovereignty and in my view adds greatly to the theories.I would highly recommend this monograph to anyone studying Germanic religion."},{"Title":"Essays on Germanic Religion (Journal of Indo-European Studies Monograph Series No. 6)","review":"I honestly liked this monograph from Polome.

Well, this book certainly is giving me that! The beginning is traced very far back in time when tribes roaming over the vast area from present day Europe to China roamed in and out of the present day Russia fought, intermarried to some extent, spoke different dialects, and took on still different identities. This early history introduces many names of peoples, languages, individuals, and places - truly more than I could connect with any continuity. So although the text does not read like a novel, the combination of its organization, chapter and section heading, along with the very complete index make it very useful to me. The book is arranged chronologically only to some degree, but chapters (all about equal length) emphasize different aspects of the society - government, politics, peoples, economics, leaders, foreign relations and wars, comparison of agriculture verses industry, etc. This makes the book the powerful resource I wanted - one I could put aside then come back to when I wanted particulars - usually about a leader, or period. I've yet to read through to the present, Putin's leadership, but have read over enough periods in Russia's history so far to understand where names like Marx, Lenin, Trotskii, and Stalin fit. I'm beginning to understand why the culture of Russia is very different from the US perhaps mostly because of it's vast area, climate differences, subcultures, classes, poverty, and some very cruel difficult periods. No small revelation is the importance that revolution has played - even to the degree that it has been considered inevitable and necessary by many of Russia's leaders. The evolution of the form of government into present day communism is just beginning to become clear as I continue the book."},{"Title":"A History of Russia, the Soviet Union, and Beyond (with InfoTrac)","review":"I originally ordered this book for my Russian History Class.

However, it is more than a book of meditations. It is a book which lays out in simple and inspiring lessons a theology of creativity.Sawyer has insightful comments on the majesty and the grace of a loving God. She leaves us appreciating the imago dei in each of us. She challenges us to go for the gold -- to reach for the highest by taking simple steps.The book is lavish with quotes from literary masters and other luminaries. It is rich with a play on cultural illusions and slogans which reveal a writer who is not only in touch with permanent things but those of our transitory times.Seldom do we see a merger of insight, intelligence, humor, faith, love and the joy of life that we find in this book. Sawyer demonstrates that those who believe in God are not stupid but have tapped into a resource out-of-the-ordinary."},{"Title":"The Art of the Soul: Meditations for the Creative Spirit","review":"What Joy has so uniquely presented has turned my perspective upside down. Her conversational tone draws me in. The freedom she offers to artists using all canvasses is liberating and motivational.She has masterfully combined wit, wisdom and inspiration from a wide range of sources--including her own--with a refreshing spiritual perspective. She gives the pursuit of desire permission and a playground. Her practical suggestions along the way are perfect for anyone doubting his or her true artist self.This is a far cry from some otherwise stuffy, typical books of meditation. I feel Joy has truly tapped the art of my soul as I sit nodding with affirmation and understanding while reading each chapter. She has found a delightfully inspiring way to praise imagination and talent that God has already provided but until now may have gone unnoticed.Anyone second guessing the artist within should read this book for rebirth of their creativity and to stimulate hope in their potential. Joy's reminders of God's masterpiece creations in each of us--and His purpose that we in turn create--are deeply encouraging.Joy seems to have captured what the true art of her own soul is.

Denmark: A Guide to Customs & Etiquette","review":"INTRO: It has been two year now that I read this book, but the time spent doing it was helpful to gauge my expectation level of life and people of Denmark. Morton Strange is helpful is telling its readers the \\"good, bad, and ugly\\" of life in Denmark.AUTHOR: Spent 20 years abroad as a professional, only to come back to Denmark in his 40s and discover Denmark again. His harsh tone permiates the book, and his foreign experiences seem to have affected the way he judges and views Danes, and the danish society.CONTENT: The major topics that would interest anyone making their home in Denmark are well covered in the following chapters:1) First Impressions2) Overview of the Land and History3) People4) Socialising (z)5) Settling In6) Food Inglorious Food7) Enjoying Denmark8) Language and Communication9) Working (and not Working) Life10) DIY DenmarkThese chapters offer some great tips, like forget buying a travel guide to DK just call the various travel offices in DK and request brochures and information for FREE. Or, the author's analyses that 1/2 of DK works and the other half collects benefits. Or, the enlightening chapter on Do-It-Yourself and how important this is in danish life.CONCLUSION: As other reviewers have noted, Morten Strange does have a negative and judgemental bias towards his own countrymen and native land, but there is plenty of positive information and good humor in this 240 page book to be beneficial to anyone who is thinking of settling or growing roots in Denmark. I DO NOT recommend this book for the leisure traveler."},{"Title":"Culture Shock! Denmark: A Guide to Customs & Etiquette","review":"Morten Strange's interpretation of Danish customs and the society as a whole is very interesting. He makes some valid observations, such as pointing out the fact that half of all danes spend their lives working to take care of the other half. If you could only get the working half to realize that their own society has made it far too easy for some to choose not to work. John F. Kennedy's words :&quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country&quot; come to mind when thinking of the many danes who feel they are entitled to a free ride. I and many, many other danes have been fortunate enough to grow up in Danish families that value work and individual accomplishments. I disagree with Morten Strange's opinion of Danish food. It is usually very tasty, and a great deal of preparation goes into fixing a dinner for family and friends, so why shouldn't we sit at the table and enjoy the food, wine and good conversation for hours! A note about the the book binding: I cannot lend this book to a friend,----it literally fell apart as I was reading it. Definitely not Danish quality!!"},{"Title":"Culture Shock!

I would rather read a story book about denamrk. This book only had facts about it but if you really want to know how people are in denmark this would be a good book. This book would also be a really good book it you are doing research on Denmark."},{"Title":"Culture Shock! Denmark: A Guide to Customs & Etiquette","review":"This book is a dream come true for the serious traveler to Denmark who really wants to know about the Danish people, not just their historic sites, architecture and museums. This is not a travel guide, but it is a map of the heart and soul of the people who inhabit the country.Strange teases out all the uniquenesses and eccentricities of his fellow countrymen, and, because he has lived and worked outside of Denmark, is able to compare the Danish culture with others, notably American and British culture.The book is chock full of facts and statistics about Denmark, and, though it is written ostensibly for people who are moving to the country, I found it excellent preparation for my upcoming two-week vacation in Denmark. I feel that I have a headstart now in entering into conversations with people and interpreting their actions and reactions. Even the parts that are specific to those who will live in Denmark are interesting, as they give insight to the way Danes live their everyday life.Lest this book be labeled a &quot;Chamber of Commerce&quot;-style full-length advertisement for Denmark, it is important to point out that Strange is blatantly honest about the shortcomings he sees in his country.Overall, this book is an easy read, with short, digestible chapters. It has convinced me to check out the &quot;Culture Shock&quot; books for all of the countries I will travel to in the future."},{"Title":"Culture Shock! Denmark: A Guide to Customs & Etiquette","review":"I purchased this book prior to moving to Denmark from the US. This was the second Culture Shock book which I purchased and I have been disappointed with both books. Overall, I find the Culture Shock series to present the worse stereotypes of a culture. Some people may find these stereotypes to be true, but I certainly have not experienced all of the difficulties which the author has described. The author is Danish, but has returned to Denmark after living in Asia for a good number of years. You will find the author lamenting about such things as not being able to find someone to wire his stereo for him which he blames on the Danish mind of being self sufficient. I do think that the author does have some valuable insights into the Danish culture, particularly the welfare state. However, overall I found the advice to be discouraging rather than useful and not indicative of what I have experience during my past year and a half in Denmark. I would recommend referencing one of the guide books such as Rough Guide or Lonely Planet instead."},{"Title":"Culture Shock!

I am moving to Denmark soon and marrying a Dane. This book was fabulous! My husband-to-be would TELL me things about Denmark; The Law of Jante, the no-nonsense way they provide service, and the humanitarian attitude for all people, but I didn't really understand it as being universal until reading this book.

I recommend it for anyone planning to travel to Denmark or planning to live there, as I am."},{"Title":"Culture Shock! Denmark: A Guide to Customs & Etiquette","review":"I'm an American who lived in DK for a time and am returning. I thought the book would help because I had some problems previosly adjusting to danish culture. For example, it took me a long time to realize that cultural traits such as no customer service, the lack of polite words in the language itself and the general shyness of people wasn't personal. (i actually hated some things) But this author goes so far as to hate every aspect of danish culture to the point where it becomes a distraction. He hates the people, the weather, the countryside, the government, tax. At the end of the book he leaves the country because he couldn't adjust. So, don't expect this book to help you adjust and don't take the text that seriously. The author has a very skewed, seeming angry perspective of DK (even from my pov as someone with a few grudges against the country...I found myself taking the danish side) It may be helpful still to have a basic overview and it gives some advice on where to look for a job, orgs to contact for help, ect.

I bought it mainly because I'd loved Loose Change, Davidson's earlier best-seller. But once I picked it up, I could not put it down; I lay in bed on a rainy day, totally happy to be in the world Davidson created, and read the whole thing straight through. Not only did I grow to care about these flawed, very real people, but the issues Davidson touches upon were extremely thought-provoking and stayed with me long after I'd finished the book. Deceptively simple, this story has a much greater resonance for the time in which we live. I just came back from a spa that was filled with highly successful, single women, most of whom expressed to me a desire to meet a man. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read, but especially to any woman who's ever been a slave to convention --and found it's gotten her nowhere."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I am a Library Supervisor. I picked this book for my library because of the deceiving reviews and enticing title. I was very disappointed in my selection. The writing is poor. The author notes in her introduction, &quot;To protect the privacy of my children and ex-husbands, I created fictional characters to stand in their stead and speak and act in ways they hadn't. What has resulted is a book that defies categories- a hybrid- and if that sounds like an elaborate dodge, what I can say is that I'm telling you this story in the best and perhaps the only way I can.&quot; Yes, this book defies categories! It is one book I wish I never started! The author is arrogant and selfrighteous She must have also been protecting the privacy of her cat, since she changed it's name in the middle of the book! Do not waste your time or money on this book!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Written as a true story, Sara Davidson portrays a sophisticated and creative woman in her 40's, working as a writer on the \\"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\\" series, a divorcee with kids, who one day meets an illiterate trailer-park young cowboy and falls head over heels in lust.Their relationship seems doomed from the beginning. Mentally, she could be his mother; in intelligence and educations she was centuries ahead of him; she had kids and other people's opinions to consider; she even needed to teach him where all the sexual female organs are. However, this ing&eacute;nue hunk is a quick student and once he gets the important \\"lessons\\" he makes the leap to master and proceeds to virtually \\"show her heaven.\\" Those were very hot and explicit scenes that would not shame any erotica writer!!!There were parts in the book where I wanted to shout at her for behaving as she did in front of her impressionable kids without regard to anything, except the next \\"fix\\" she was going to get in the bedroom. In other parts I felt sorry for her that she had to give her lover up because she had to consider her kids and so many other people. She was torn and I could really feel her torment over this. I think her conflict was very well narrated and explained. Why shouldn't a grown self-sufficient woman choose to have a torrid sexual relationship with the man of her choice? On the other hand, why should her kids suffer because she was in thrall and addicted to her new young and very proficient lover?The end was plausible and balanced, so I didn't feel disappointed. Also, as a longtime fan of the series \\"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\\", I enjoyed reading some of the backstage drama that went on between the lead actors. Maybe I could enjoy the book because it was so far removed from my life (unlike other reviewers who took this story way too personally.) I thought it was an excellent book and I will definitely check Davidson's other books."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"This is one of the most honest, gripping, romantic, sexually compelling and haunting stories I've read about love. It made me hate my marriage and now my husband hates Davidson. Seriously, the message is inspiring: that it's never too late for love, never too late for physical bliss. I especially liked the parts about parenting, and the chaos that erupts when your kids go to war with your new mate."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"This was a book I just could not put down!! Although at times, I felt she was putting Zach down a lot, he always came back!! I feel that it was a great love story between two people who had nothing in commom, but still had the guts to go after who they wanted. I think that this book also portrays men in a very sexy way, if you like the &quot;cowboy way!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Sara Davidson has met her match and he comes from another world. But she is willing to let him into her life and she is wonderfully willing to let us know all the intimate and poignant details of how it does and doesn't work. This is a delicately and warmingly drawn picture of a hard working mother trying to survive in a harsh Hollywood reality who meets up with her true partner, a real cowboy and a really loving man. Without limits she enjoys him and she shows us how to let it loose and take it in. The differences between them are money, culture and power and those things melt thorugh their chemistry and their open expression toward one another. I couldn't put it down because I felt Davidson was having a personal conversation with me that barred no boundaries and wanted to be honest. Can't ask more from an author who is willing to share who they are and how they learn about life."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Sara Davidson's latest is a gem--the perfect antidote to disappointing relationships with overly self-absorbed men. The book is heartwarming, heartfelt and the character of Zack will inspire hope in the hearts of women who have loved the wrong men too much. I simply couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Highly recommended if you want to escape and dream--"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"The only reason I picked up the book was because I read a decent review of it in the N.Y. Times. Frankly, the book didn't thrill me... it lacked depth. I could not warm up to the main character, Sara, a 49-yr. old divorcee with two (somewhat bratty) kids who had a fairly decent career on a tv show set. But it seemed like all she did was complain and feel that she was deserving of more than she had. When she meets Zack, the cowboy/wrangler/artist/free spirit, they begin a relationship. I think Sara's character tried to make it sound deep, but reading this book, I thought she was just recounting how Zack awakened her sexuality. There is nothing wrong with that at all, but there's a gigolo aspect to the relationship. Zack has no money - nada, zip, zilch - and she pays for everything, subsidizes his rent, pays for plane tickets. Hello?!?! Can you say &quot;How much do you charge per hour?!?! This book was tolerable for reading on the subway, or maybe on the beach in the summer... a no brainer, and I don't feel any deeper, or touched or moved by having read it. Maybe I should have waited till it was available in the library."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"My shrink says I should date worldly men since I'm a complex creature. But I've always loved &quot;cowboy&quot; types and this book explains why;....When a girl's had a bad day, a cowboy will just wrap his arms around her 'n make her feel safe.....A CEO doesn't want to hear about it, he's got problems of his own...... but he'll gladly pay for her shrink.I LOVED this book, Sara. It was magical. And knowing."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"She writes for the New York Times; he's never heard of it. Can this couple find true love? A good premise for a light-hearted sitcom -- a version of Notting Hill, in fact -- but not a serious, self-conscious book. This is one of those New Journalism books where the author shares musings that formerly were revealed only in the privacy of the therapist's office. We get detailed accounts of their love-making, of her secret and not-so-secret fears that defy political correctness. Her lover &quot;Zack&quot; doesn't fit with her Hollywood friends and he knows it. In the end he doesn't really try anymore. Long before the end, I began asking, Who cares? The book is an easy read; Davidson is a skilled, experienced writer. But about halfway through I realized there was nothing new here. The real issue, which is briefly dismissed as pre-feminist, is why men are allowed to get involved with unpolished women who have great sex appeal, while women are expected to date and marry upward. A man in Davidson's situation would have fewer hangups about paying to support a woman who was struggling to earn a living as a craftsperson. But we knew that already. We also know that women doctors, lawyers and professors often get involved with blue collar men. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. So what?"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I would not have believed that a book could so completely change my life but this one has. I found it in my local library --just stood frontways on ,under the Travel section !---the only book thus displayed and I just had to read it.Well I read it in two evenings and then I read it again . Ive now decided I have to buy it. I wish the author would right a sequel .Why did it change my life? I had had an affair with ,and then married ,a farmer who was younger than me and not the type of guy I would normally be with for many reasons and this book reaffirmed that Love can cross all barriers if we let it and are not afraid . I was nearly letting us drift apart by seeing only our differences. This book made me see my relationship with different eyes and be thankful for the rich and beautiful life I have.The author is a very honest open woman with a wonderful style . I reccommend you read it with an open heart and mind."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Congratulations Sara!!! You've written the absolute, hands-down WORST book I've ever read!!I don't understand how a book like this could ever get published. Much less obtain any praise from anyone!! The positive reviews must have been from the author and her friends.This book is badly written, pointless, unfocused, and most of all is drop dead boring. I'm just grateful that I only paid 99 cents for it in a used bookstore and the author got nothing from the sale!!!! I fed it to the shredder since it doesn't deserve a place on my book shelf. Seriously!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"My girlfriend bought this and I picked it up out of curiosity, expecting to flip through it and put it right down. But from the first page, I was hooked. I didn't move for the next five hours. It's an amazing story, funny, real, incredibly sexy, and inspiring. It makes you appreciate your partner, if you have one. If you don't, it gives you hope. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"(...) I was very interested in the premise, which has a great deal of romantic potential, and I can understand the attraction between these two, very different people. What bothered me here was the superficiality of Sara, shown in her own words, after all. Is she aware of how her job, her kids, and her own life look mean spirited and flimsy? I am puzzled by the choices that she makes, and also puzzled by Zack's willingness to put up with her world, which very clearly wants nothing to do with him."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Written by one of the writers for the TV show, Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Davidson is a highly intelligent, well-educated lady that meets and falls in love with a cowboy from rural Arizona. Zack, who has knowledge of life on a different level, has grown up in the tradition of the old west. He is a man who works with his hands creating original and authentic bridles from strips of leather, a long lost art form. He has yet to hear of the Holocaust or the New York Times. This unlikely relationship progresses with all the properties of oil mixed with water at times while the underlying current is one of intense sexual attraction and love.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are strong and believable as odd as it might seem. You can't help but love them as they stumble along trying to make it all work. Sara is an incredible mom of two children that play a pivotal part in all of her decisions. She allows us to see her human side and shares her confusion as well as her problem solving capabilities, most of all she has heart. I for one thank her for a story well told. I can't help but wonder what part of the story is fiction. Kelsana 5/22/01"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"&quot;Cowboy&quot; was so compelling that I read it in one day while flying to Phoenix from Michigan. I couldn't put it down. It is truly the love story between two very different individuals. Zak and Sara had so little in common yet connected in such a special way. I found I was cheering for them when things were going well and feeling the pain of their struggles. The book was written from the author's perspective but provided enough of Zak's thoughts that one could see both perspectives clearly. There was fear, desire, acceptance, frustration, and a remarkable insightful thinking that evetually leads to growth. I, too, am in touch with a cowboy in another state. This book helped me to understand the struggles we are facing and to look inside for the answers. I've read &quot;Cowboy&quot; three times and still discover new insights as well as enjoy the humor and real life situations only this combination of unique differences could provide. Thank you, Sara!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Boy, was I disappointed. Maybe because I loved &quot;Loose Change&quot; so much(admittedly, I read and loved it almost 20 years ago), I expected something deep, something insightful - but instead all I got was a shlocky romance novel written by someone with Ivy league credentials(I know that, because she beats us readers over the head with them.) All I could think of when I read this book was how mortified her real-life children must have been when they read sentences like &quot;Zack started pumping for the finish line and I wrapped myself around him as he barreled to the edge and leapt off.&quot; I'm 40 years old and all I can say about a sentence like that is &quot;Gag me with a spoon!&quot;"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I too read an encouraging review of this book and purchased it with great anticipation. As I read it, I got more and more annoyed. I really liked Pam Houston's \\"Cowboy's Are My Weakness\\" (boy, do I like cowboys or what?) and thought it would be similar. Wrong. It read like a Dr. Quinn episode with a lot more sex. Zack was sometimes sexy but mostly creepy, and Sara was annoying and self indulgent. The first rock I pulled on amazon."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"To hear Sara Davidson tell it,she first wrote this book as a novel,only to have her advisers say it was flat as an old pancake .On the advice of marketing experts, it was sauced up,called a memoir, and will no doube become a movie,if not a video series. This is not a book .As Davidson said in her talk at the Los Angeles Times bookfest,it mixes fact and fiction to get sales . As for the cowboy. Davidson introduced him on the Roseanne show . The guy is a grandfather,inarticulate,and says he does not live with Davidson . So what have we got here ? What we have is Madison Avenue salesmanship,turned on at full blast to sell a product.This Davidson production is proof that just as America's newspapers and magazine have been dumbed down to sell folklore to semi-literates, the book business has been dumbed down even more in search of market share . Davidson might say, &quot; So what, its entertainment.&quot; I say that when book publishers merge fact and fiction to sell the product, they are selling damaged goods to an innocent audience.This book should be looked as only as an example of the length to which the media industry will go to make a dollar .Questionable performance by all hands.Davidson will NOT wreite a book on ethics, that's for sure !"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I picked this up at the library and can't wait to exchange it for something else. The premise sounded so appealing; I was eager to read something meaningful that explored Romance at Middle Age, Improbable Matches, Overcoming Obstacles . . . what I got instead was a sense that Sara, like locker room boys, has to affirm her desirability and sexuality by sharing the graphic details with the world. I'm no prude, but as she once told her son, &quot;That's private.&quot; And why does it seem that she is the only one who does any self-examination, hard thinking, adaptation? I so longed for her to tell Zack what HE had to be to &quot;run with her.&quot; He challenges her, but there's not much mention of how SHE challenges HIM. The relationship may be unorthodox, but the only &quot;meat&quot; to it seems to exist in the bedroom. (Pun intended.)"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Roughly the same age as Davidson I have long since come to the conclusion that our generation's greatest talents lie in the areas of drug/alcohol abuse, self-absorption and making money. Not content to leave well enough alone (read her 'Small Change' if you are a real glutton for punishment), Davidson plants herself in the vanguard of yet another state of higher evolution of the species (smart women with younger, ill-educated men). The core myth her work springs from is that humankind made a great epochal leap forward thanks to those kids at UC Berkeley in the 1960's. Giving narcissism a bad name, Davidson winds through more details of this latest spiritual journey to 'true love' than a reasonable person should have to bear. I soon come to admire her hunk Zach, mainly because he doesn't read. More works like this and I won't either. Another interesting (!?) thing about this book is that it is that peculiar and very popular hybrid which is either a non-ficion novel or a fictitious memoir. Dispensing with mere 'facts' in search of loftier 'emotional truths' we have this entire body of literature which seems to want it both ways. This book will sell a gazillion copies because it is a 'true' story. As a novel it would more likely head off to the obscurity it so richly deserves."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Haaving read some writeups about this book, I looked forward to a quick, easy read with an interesting tale. But the author turned out to be such a whiner, I was seriously disappinted. She was too concerned with how her lover looked and acted, what her friends would think, and whether she could continue having the material blessings she'd enjoyed. She didn't seem willing to take him as he was, but wanted to make him into her ideal of a cowboy-toy. He, on the other hand, impressed me as a much more patient, mature character, willing to take things as they are, not as he wanted them to be. Life is too short and I'm sorry I wasted my time and money. Furthermore ... where was her editor? There were so many grammatical errors throughout the narrative that I got the impression that the editor must have been vacationing on Mars."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Loose Change is a never-to-be-forgotten book about the 60's and this is an easily-forgotten guilty pleasure, but a pleasure while reading it. Flimsy but stylish, the bottom line for me was the same as another review - her children must have been mortified. I wish I hadn't been so intrigued when I saw Davidson on a CSPAN panel of writers. Ran right out and bought it. But ... it was pretty entertaining. Very good beach read."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I enjoy reading a well-written modern day romance story and looked forward to this book with anticipation. Disappointingly, it was slow and unsatisfying and never revealed much about the characters. I felt that the &quot;half fiction/half autobiography&quot; sell was cheap. It seemed like an ego-piece for the writer and very boring for the rest of us. If you want a good cowboy love story read &quot;Hank and Chloe&quot; by Joanne Mapson. Now THAT is enjoyable, well-written fiction."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Mary Chapin Carpenter does not sing &quot;Independence Day&quot; - Martina McBride does. She got a bum - not a real cowboy. Being born and raised in the West, this is not your typical cowboy, he's a bum. Makes all the hard working, independent, financially responsible real cowboys look bad."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I find good novels mix fact and fiction. Ask Tom Clancy or John Grisham. Sara mixes a relationship and spices it up enough to keep the interest continual and &quot;hopeful&quot; for the rest of us that dream.... As a cowboy, yes, there are those of us who are well read and romantic. After many hard days, I come home to a beautiful wife of 15 years who calls me a &quot;hopeless romantic&quot;. Keep it going Sara!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I was SO disappointed in this book! I had looked forward to reading it and was very disappointed in the superficial treatment of what could have been a terrific story. I wanted to turn the kids over my knee because they were so spoiled and the woman seemd more concerned about her wardrobe than her lovelife. And even Zach seemed so one-dimensional and predictable and very un-cowboy like. She seemed to enjoy making fun of his lack of education and social skills. I felt no sympathy or liking for any of the characters. Cowboys are amazing people and the possibilities of romance with them are so &quot;interesting&quot; - Ms. Davisdon really left us cowboy lovers with a pretty limp rope! Rosemary Anderson"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Great book! I am in love with a cowboy too...my first passion is horses and that love led me to my cowboy! They are definitely a different breed...never boring, always a free spirit...very passionate...just like their lifestyle! I can't imagine my life with anyone else, and there is nothing more romantic to me than moonlight horse rides!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Sara and Zack could not have been more different unless they came from Mars or Venus. The author, suffering from a small dose of lack of self esteem and and overwhelming dose of spoiled children of divorce, shows us all the glories and warts of true and lasting love. I agree with her -- everyone needs a COWBOY if he is as caring and loving as Zack. The fact is stated that she had attended prestigious universities and he was uneducated; however, he was much more attuned to himself that she was. Speaking of culture shock. Give him credit for tenacity. Most men, or even women, would have skedaddled back to the ranch long before he took his &quot;short hike&quot; to Arizona. Could not put it down once I started. Good luck to both Sara and Zack in the future."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Cowboy is a seemingly simple story of love and human relationships. Sara Davidson writes a wonderful story, half fiction and half memoir. It begins when the nearly 50 year old writer heads to Elko, Nevada for a Cowboy poetry festival. Fate has led 39 year old Zach there, as well. From there, a journey of love and life begins, taking twists and turns from outside factors, as well as inner emotions from the couple. An unlikely pairing of a modern, educated woman and a more old-fashioned, not so educated cowboy who both have things to give and things to teach. This is a very real look at an unlikely encounter with love that will keep you reading all night long. Thank you, Sara Davidson for sharing your story with the world."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I loved this book, because it provoked me (thus, &quot;provocative&quot;) to look at romance in a new way, to see that the hackneyed rules for choosing a mate can be stultifying. I've always had a soft spot for cowboys myself; now if I could just find one! Sara Davidson is a marvelous writer, with a quick wit, a warm heart and an honest mind. A rare combination."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I twice picked this book up in the library but didn't check it out. It sounded like another story of an older woman who has a fling, leaves him, and gains wisdom from the affair--this is NOT that book! Thankfully I did pick it up a third time, check it out, and read it in one sitting. The characters are honest and well drawn, complex and tender. The story was one any single parent can relate to, any woman aging and still vibrant, any person who feels jaded by love. A very compelling story from a good writer. I'm buying my own copy!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Since I am in the midst of a wonderful relationship with my own cowboy right now, I had to read Sara's account of her Zack. It is a passionate reminder that true love can sometimes pass us by because of our preconceived ideas of what true love really entails. Hooray for Sara Davidson for putting down on paper what I am feeling every day of my life right now. Since I realize that it could end at anytime because of our differences, I look forward to each new day and celebrate each day that I can spend with him. My cowboy is 11 years younger, and has awakened the same passions that Zack awakened in Sara. I am reading the book for the third time. Her writing style leaves you spellbound and unable to put the book down until you've read it all."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"This was a good story, a sexy tale, an interesting peek into someone's life. I read it in a 2 hour sitting. The writing was precise, the story was compelling. Putting the notion of &quot;cowboy&quot; aside, what man has never heard of the Holocust? And what woman could put up with a man like that? This book answered these questions and more. Slightly disappointed with the rambling ending, but would recommend this book for a fast, satisfying read."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I was totally intrigued by the basic story, that's why I bought the book. Since I share many of Ms. Davidson's outer circumstances I expected to be carried away with her love story. Unfortunately she bored the hell out of me, not only with bad writing, but also her condescending attitude towards everybody &quot;beneath&quot; her. As an actor I feel insulted, I've been an extra many times, and no, we don't go on talking about a handshake for months. I expect a lot more wisdom from anybody claiming to be so spiritual."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I bought this book for a light easy read - it was. I got kind of frustrated with how typical the main characters were and how predictable the story lines were. Nothing was discussed in depth; not the main characters during sex, conversation, at work, their families, nothing. I felt things were glossed over. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to write about something like this that actually happened to you, still I felt it was kind of flat and predictable. Zack came into Sara's life, they had great sex, he gets her kids to behave, she gets spooked by the relationship's responsibilities, and ultimately goes off to find him after he leaves."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I worked as a cowboy for six years, and Davidson's &quot;cowboy&quot; seems like nothing of the sort, to me. A) I don't think real, working cowboys are all that romantic, as they are usually tired and often somewhat chauvinistic. B) Her fawning over his &quot;rough&quot; character makes me want to vomit. Please, Sara, spare us your mid-life crisis."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I didn't know what this book really was about when I picked - but it was the perfect vacation reading for a 40 something woman."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"Women will read this book for romance but it should be read by men as well so they will know how to do all the special things Zack did for Sara. Not many women have a man touch/caress, sweet talk or bring such pleasure to her and not many men know how to! I didn't read this book to dissect it for grammar or content; anyone who does is missing what Sara was trying to convey. I read it purely for the way these two people responded to each other in a way that many of us crave and never find in a lifetime. I want my own Zack!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I must say I don't understand many of the mean-spirited reviews. I couldn't put this book down. It offered a door into a world I didn't know (the cowboy world and the world of TV writing), as well as a fresh and frisky examination of the nature of love. I thought the prose shimmered off the page, and the characters were indelible. Aces and diamonds to a woman brave enough to buck the tide and follow her heart--and write an insightful, moving book about the process. Forget five stars--this is ten stars!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"After reading Loose Change, which I thought was excellent, I decided to read Cowboy. I could not put it down because I wanted to see what happened next. The way Sara writes is funny, humorous (I like the part where she takes Gabriel to a Nine Inch Nails Concert) and intriguing. I thought it was interesting the way her stereotype about cowboys was challenged and how Zack fit into her structured life. I actually liked him because I could see where he was coming from, and I liked to see her embrace a different kind of love. I also thought the way he wanted to handle her kids' bad behavior was awesome! All in all, Cowboy was fun to read. I hope she writes another book soon!"},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I read this book in an evening (a rarity for me) because I couldn't pull myself away from the personal story. I found Ms. Davidson's writing so honest and vulnerable that I had to see her journey to its end. I was particularly moved by her struggle between her growth as a woman and her responsibilities as a mother. I have since passed the book on to others and they have been just as touched."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"When I began this non-fiction account of a woman writer and her attraction to a cowboy, I felt anxious somehow, and nearly put it down. However, the strong storyline pulled me farther, and soon I became locked into her struggle and didn't want it to end. I realized that my discomfort at first might have been due to the complete honesty with which she dares to reveal her feelings, despite the obvious facts that the relationship will never work. Sara is tough on herself. I wanted to warn her just as her friends did, but on the other hand, I wanted to meet this cowboy myself! Of course, that's the best part--living vicariously without the pain. This book will rope you and tie you down. The characters are intriguing and the style is hard and tight."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I was eager to read the juicy book, as it received fairly decent reviews; so I asked my library to order it. I did read it but ended up skimming most of the last part. I kept thinking that she wrote this book because her show was being canceled and she wanted to continue living her affluent life in Los Angeles. What better than a quick and dirty book! One wonders what her children thought of their involvement in the book. Zack probably didn't mind being exploited because a best seller would assure the continuation of his easy lifestyle."},{"Title":"Cowboy","review":"I liked it. Once again, Ms. Davidson gives a view of a life most of us won't experience. I've always been a fan of her writing, and did enjoy 'Loose Change' more, but I liked 'Cowboy' enough to wish it wouldn't end but glad when 'she' worked out things with family and friends, and to recommend it to others. And if you're a big Dr. Quinn fan, she gives some behind the scenes glimpses of the TV show that are highly interesting. I hope, Sara, that you continue to write in your unique way and I will continue to buy. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"Life-changing...mind-expanding. This book is easy to read, provides clear illustrations, historical and biblical support. It brings out more meaning to Jesus' words and adds universal and true timeless significance to who and what Christians believe Jesus is.This book serves to not only talk about reincarnation but also gives insight on how Christianity should not be a rehashing of the early, third-century, church's select canonical elite's thoughts on Christ and God but rather how an individual's relationship between self and Christ/God is very important and should not be subjugated to the worldly authority of religious political powers.Maybe many of you who are curious about this book are like me when I did not know very much about reincarnation but yet did not reject it totally. The concept began by seeping into my belief system and finally, and fatefully, I came upon a friend's book, scholarly and hard-to-read, on Gnostic Christianity which briefly mentioned that reincarnation was part of early Christians' belief system. I was so intrigued that I sought to ask more questions and then found the title of this very book at amazon.com. It's been two years since I bought this book, and I must say that this book IS IMPORTANT to all Christians who are willing to ask questions and find answers that are not available within mainstream Christianity. After this book, I educated myself further on reincarnation and the beginnings of the Bible and in the process further dissolved my prejudices, arrogance and ignorance. So watch out! This book can very well set you on a profound path of further seeking the meaning of Christ, gaining spiritual enlightenment and renewing your enthusiasm to seek and fulfill your life's purpose in a new light."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"I thought this was going to be a dry, scholarly account of historical facts, but found it to be so readable, I had a hard time putting it down. The book gives the most detailed account I have seen of how and why the idea of reincarnation was systematically eradicated from orthodox Christianity. I have been fascinated by this topic since the age of 18 when I read in a footnote to Paramahansa Yogananda's book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; that reincarnation was banned as heresy by the early church fathers. The idea that church potentates could have excluded something Jesus possibly taught was outrageous to me. I had to piece the puzzle toghether from many different sources, and I am grateful this book has finally pulled most of them together in one volume. At the same time the book gives a lot of teachings that explain many of the questions I had about reincarnation. I think just about anybody who is somewhat open to the idea of reincarnation, whether Christian or not, would find something of interest in this book. For anyone seriously interested in the topic, there are numerous references to other sources."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"I was assigned a research paper for my English class and we were permitted to pick whatever topic we wished. Reincarnation is something that has always fascinated me, and since I am a Christian who believes in reincarnation, I decided to write my paper on reincarnation in early Christianity, the Bible, and its revival in modern society. I needed 15 sources, but this book could stand on its own! Prophet discusses historical justification for reincarnation in Christianity as it relates to Jesus' teachings, the Bible, and the Roman Empire. It discusses the lost years of Jesus, and the possibility of him visiting India, and employing mysticism in his teachings. The practicality of reincarnation as she argues it left me spellbound. I was a believer to begin with, but after reading this, I am even more convinced that reincarnation belongs in Christian theology. Did you know there are approximately 28 MILLION Christians who believe in reincarnation? This is only one of the amazing things you will discover if you read this amazing book! Its food for the mind and it quenches the soul that believes there is more out there than our beloved Christianity is telling us! Trust me, it is amazing!"},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"This is the most interesting and well documented work I have read about the missing link between Reincarnation and Christianity. Besides being informative and entertaining, it also opens your eyes to the history of the manipulation by the Catholic Church, and other Christian denominations, of the true teachings of Christ about life, death and the beyond."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"This is not simply an anthology of interesting of past life stories. It is an expose of how the concept and understanding of reincarnation has been withheld from civilization. How the powers that be (namely the Church and State) knowingly have controlled and supressed Truth for millennia. This was done in the ultimate sense: even genocide, to maintain an iron grip on the minds of those who inhabit this planet. Finally, through books like these Reality is beginning to bleed through. When you wake up to your own incarnations, you begin to wonder what kind of memories you are carrying around just below the surface of outer awareness. Are these brought to consciousness through dreams? Nightmares? Deja vu? Meeting someone you feel you've known all your life? Knowing something without knowing how or why you know it?All our memories, from our first life to this one are stored...guess where? Well, in that other 90% of our brains that we don't use and can't yet access, for a start. But we're getting there, thanks to our persistent searching for this door of self, and Self.It's a landmark book. And as full of documentation as it is, an easy and flowing read."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"I have believed in reincarnation for most of my life and this book and its detailed accounts make it totally clear to me why reincarnation is a missing link and if only more people knew about the concept and would read this account they would see how much more understandable and plausible life would be and how much more added meaning life would hold.This is an indepth account of reincarnation-very little-if any &quot;fluff&quot; involved.Solid reading."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"This was an excellent book with excellent information that clarifies a lot on how the teachings on re-encarnation (tought in hinduism, for example) came to be removed from the orginal teachings in early Christianity.

A most read for anyone who wants to know."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"This is a well written, well documented page turner that I enjoyed very much. The author approaches the subject of the time of Jesus from a completely different slant, and makes a good case that beliefs in reincarnation permeated the population in Jesus' day including some Jewish sects. She certainly convinced me that Jesus was likely to have been surrounded by, and exposed to people who believed in reincarnation. She rightly points out that Jesus never spoke out against it. She spends a lot of time recounting how certain religious sects who taught reincarnation in the 300's were treated by the orthodox church and the Roman Government - tremendous oppression - countless people killed. She circles and circles and circles, but never lands. I personally think Jesus believed in reincarnation because he was a highly enlightened man and reincarnation is the truth. But she never caught him teaching it to anybody, which was disappointing. However, this book is certainly worth reading for nothing else than it's unique historical perspective."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"...

At the time, I was steeped in a Christian belief system that did not allow for open-minded thinking of such things as explained in this book. But, I was searching because I had sadly began to realize that I had been disillusioned by the fear-based dogma of the churches I had been attending.This book opened my eyes and introduced me to new ways of thinking and I have continued to search for truth wherever it exists for me ever since. I appreciate this book because it helped me move forward on my spiritual path and accept other people's beliefs without judgment."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"This is an amazing book. Although I disagree with many things that Mrs. Prophet has said throughout the years, this book provides solid arguments, both logical & biblical to support the idea of reincarnation in Christianity.The information regarding Church Father Origin of Alexandria is specially convincing to me.Mind opening & easy to read, I highly recommend this book to anybody wishing to explore new ideas."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"This book was only effective in forcing me to seek out any other book on the subject. The history she went over I have no problem with. It is everything else that I find quite annoying. She seems to ignore alternatives to how she interperets scripture and what one person says about reincarnation, being born again, life before this current one, etc.She also ignores concepts, themes, and issues that today may shed light on the subject. She doesn't address or let the readers know of any other authority on the subject, which to me, makes me that much more skeptical of her credibility and ability to write on the topic.I feel that I am alone in this and that is fine, each book affects each person differently. I guess I was just looking for more, and the author(s) didn't deliver."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"This book is written in simple language and is engrossing from the first page. Well written and a very good account about the early teachings of Christianity, which was wiped out by the power hungry clergy and monarchy of the times. It is very logical that Christ taught reincarnation and also taught the techniques to achieve oneness with God, by discovering the hidden divinity within each and every one of us. These teachings of Christ must be explored, studied and revived. Every Christian must read this book at least once and then decide for themselves why they should or should not believe in reincarnation and attaining oneness with God within us. Remember that Jesus was to be named Emmanuel which means \\"God with us\\". That could be a clue to the Truth, that God is truly with us because he is inside us."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"If the subjects of reincarnation, pre-existence, (original) sin, karma, divine grace and spiritual ascension interest you, this book is a treasure chest of historical, mystical and theological information on those subjects and others. Wait a minute, some will say, Elizabeth Clare Prophet (ECP) was that eccentric crazy woman who along with her husband Mark founded and developed that Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT) cult whose members dug themselves down into bunkers to survive the atomic cataclysm which never happened. Yes, most would agree that ECP did some irrational and kooky things and her idiosyncratic personality victimized many of her loyal followers. But CUT and Summit University Press, its publishing department, survived and are thriving under new leadership. We may ask why? A good answer would probably be that most of the Prophets' theology wasn't so far off base after all (being deferential to New Age thought and Judeo-Christian and Eastern mysticism). Most of their ideas were theosophically sound and most originated from sane and rational religionists and philosophers from ancient times to modern. The result was a syncretistic amalgam. Perhaps where they went wrong was with their excessive ritualistic decreeing, legalistic authoritarianism and opportunistic appointments of too many quaint ascended (deceased) Masters to be venerated.This book bears a strong imprint of the co-author, ECP's daughter, Erin Prophet. It is a fact that during its compilation ECP was already considerably debilitated by the effects of dementia. The work has been meticulously researched throughout. References take up sixty-three pages of explanations and clarifications. The bibliography is a list sixteen pages long. This book can hardly be accused of being a major tool to make conversions for CUT. There is no attempt at exclusivity or appeals to elevate and legitimatize CUT or its theology. In fact, only in the last of the twenty-five chapters are recommendations made for readers to follow some of CUT's mental and spiritual practices.Regardless of authorship this book can be valued for its scholarship into the subjects I mentioned at the beginning. Quotes and references are plentiful and the historical development of Jewish, Greek, Roman, Christian and Indian thought is outlined and contrasted. It can be a very useful work for open-minded and curious seekers."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"I've just finished reading Elizabeth Prophet's book on reincarnation, which proposes that this is a teaching that's compatible with Christianity. As for myself, given the fact that I find reincarnation the only reasonable explanation for the horrific human hardships and the awesomely great variances in people's opportunities and circumstances, I approached Prophet's book from a positive and supportive stance. Nevertheless, I do regard her efforts to support reincarnation as a faith taught by Jesus of Nazareth and many of his disciples to be a bit disingenuous, or at the least not highly supported by the evidence. Yet, I believe that the author had strong evidence in favor of her contention that the Christian scholar and mystic, Origen, did believe in some form of preexistence of the human soul, or a form of reincarnation. Also, it seems to me that her claims that the Gnostics taught some form of reincarnation has strong credibility. Therefore, I refuse to reject her efforts to find evidence for reincarnation within segments of Christianity, even if mainstream Christianity has powerfully opposed it almost from the establishment of the \\"Christian\\" Church.In spite of some weaknesses in the arguments for a Christian form of reincarnation, I found this book to be highly worthwhile for me to read -- helping to reinforce my belief that the human \\"soul\\" is a sort of entity that has been condemned to this life of hardships, struggles, and sufferings (sometimes referred to as the vale of tears) in order to induce the person to work diligently to transform the soul's character for the better -- from previous lifetimes of rebellion against the power and love of God. This life, then, can be an opportunity to be redeemed -- having the bad \\"karma\\" washed away through diligent efforts at devotion to God and arrive at a perfect harmony with Ultimate Reality (God). Prophet's book helped me to be even more convinced that reincarnation is the only truly viable explanation for the perfect love, holiness, power, and justice of God -- given the horrific tragedies that many human beings are condemned to suffer.I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to make sense of the human dilemmas in conjunction with faith in the power and goodness of God."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"I agree with much of the other feedback from \\"Dallske\\" and there is ALOT of info missing in explaining any true facts. My biggest bug is that she constantly uses the word \\"Probably.\\" To me, that makes it All speculation!"},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"Really enjoyed this one! Ms. Prophet really seems to have done her homework before writing it - the bibliography and notes are quite lengthy and varied.The book starts off a little oddly, but soon shifts over to something more cohesive and even almost scholarly (but not stuffy). I found it to be actually quite a page turner. Some very interesting points are made throughout the book to support Ms. Prophet's thesis that reincarnation was probably a belief held by many early Christians, and Jesus may have even preached on this subject, if only indirectly.I did think that some of Ms. Prophet's logic was a bit weak in spots - especially early on in the book - but she did tie things up pretty well as the book progressed. The ending was perhaps a little less than satisfying, but still appropriate.Even if you don't believe in reincarnation and don't think you ever could, the book makes for interesting reading. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity","review":"Awesome book!! I've had this book for over 10 years, but I thought I'd give it a good review anyway. This book was an answer to a prayer! Elizabeth Clare Prophet was a God-send! I've read lots of books on reincarnation but they didn't give much Biblical or historical evidence. Most Christian books just dismiss it as false. But not too many books talk about both reincarnation and Christianity! It really helped me to understand the Biblical evidence for reincarnation as well as the history of the belief, and the history of the church's rejection of it!

The Christianity bible(King David) is WAY to black and white for me. And the whole concept of reincarnation brings forth a better understanding of what the WHOLE meaning of life is. I claim to be a Christian since I strive to emulate Jesus christ. Christ's teachings and his whole persona has always had an impact on me, especially his shed of blood on the cross, I cry almost every Christmas just thinking about it! I still believe he was that \\"special\\" person, the son of God, or even God in flesh because of all of his special supernatural powers and gifts that he had. I also have a great open mind to the way other religions practice like Kabbalah and Buddism because mediation, in my opinion, is also a missing link in the \\"belief\\" system of christianity. I don't like the fact that they believe it's a form of letting evil spirits come in. So, I love Christ he will always be in my heart, but also accept the way other religions like to practice AND what they believe even though some don't believe he was \\"the son of GOd\\" and believe he was just a teacher.

Joan Aiken, best known for her \\"Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" books, serves up a delightful fantasy/horror/comedy story that is sure to win over any fan of things that go bump in the night.Cockatrices have invaded England. What are cockatrices? It's a general term for various malevolent, nasty, omnivorous beasties that arrived via luggage at an airport (hee!) and soon begin snorking up the unwary inhabitants. In a matter of years, people are hiding from them as they roam through England and lay waste to it. General Grugg-Pennington is given an order: Create an armored train and have a special corps of soldiers to deal with the cockatrices.One of the people who volunteers is the boy Dakin -- Dakin is brought along because he plays the drums, and repetitive loud noises kill some of the cockatrices. Things become substantially more complex when Dakin's cousin Sauna ends up on the train as well. But something evil is massing in the north -- something connected to Sauna and the cockatrices, and something that will do anything to achieve its ends.There are plot holes in this that you could throw a Flying Hammerhead through (why don't the people just leave England? Why can't they use an electronic recording instead of drums?) but somehow it never really matters. It's fun. Just fun. Aiken expertly mixes goofy Brit humor with a grimmer tone (sort of post-apocalypse-lite) in a newer kind of England where green leafy vegetables are a precious rarity and German dogs are imported to fight the Snarks. The flying sharks, the slightly dotty old lady, the pleasant old Brit soldiers, the apartment full of porcelain knickknacks, and so on. The plotting is tight; it gets darker as the book progresses, bringing in such old details as Michael Scott and covens of plotting witches.Dakin is a suitably plucky everyboy, polite and dutiful and thoroughly sympathetic. Sauna is a bit more of a dark horse, as her ancestry and abilities are slowly revealed. The characters around them are less 3-D, but are great fun. There is some violence and creepiness, but nothing too major; this book may, however, scare some younger kids. The scenes with the eerie, almost ghoulish \\"Aunt Flossie\\" and her malicious rat were absolutely horrific.Paper and binding are about average. My only beef? The cover! It's awful! Gris Grimly's drawings are quite good on the inside -- creepy and suitable, kind of a sharp-edged Edward Gorey -- ... In addition, the ending is a bit vague.This is a really fun romp that kids will enjoy, and adults can chuckle over as well."},{"Title":"The Cockatrice Boys","review":"If anybody trusted me with their kids, I would probably read this to them. A fun little jaunt, the kind of story I could relate to/imagine as a child, it can be entertaining for adults, but may be even more enjoyable shared with a little monster who has the beginnings of a sense of humor. Sure, there's a little death and gore, but it's written in such a pleasantly British and accepting way, it works. The population of Britain is virtually decimated by monsters from an unknown source (but they arrive at the airport), so a souped-up battle train of soldiers, dotty British gentleman and a couple of kids go to find and cut off the source of evil. So what if the end doesn't quite make sense? The journey's fun and you just gotta love that British tone that accepts the death of friends and loved ones, but bemoans the loss of good tea. Get it for a little critter and read it yourself."},{"Title":"The Weaker Vessel","review":"This is exactly the kind of women's history book that we need. Fraser's writing style is perfect for her subject, the lives of women in 17th-century England. She covers various aspects of women's lives: Political, domestic, social, professional, spiritual. We meet many remarkable women, such as Rachel, Lady Russell, who fought hard to save her husband William from execution; Catherine Sedley, the witty and strong-minded mistress of James II; Elizabeth Barry, beloved actress. Fraser includes all sorts of trivia without detracting from her main theme, an accomplishment in itself. Will she write more books like this? I hope so."},{"Title":"The Weaker Vessel","review":"I love Antonia Fraser's writing, but this is an extremely hard book to get through.

Not her best."},{"Title":"The Weaker Vessel","review":"A very good book, well written and very interesting.

Women were able to gain custody of their children, marry the man they love and become much more of a customary woman that what had been perceived. Antonia Fraser's historically written book justifies the idea that women truly played a role within the society that was not forfeited.

The book attempts to be both a tutorial and a reference for programmers and administrators. The book consists of four major parts. The first part is the Introduction, which contains chapters on MySQL in general, installation on Unix and Windows, SQL for MySQL, and general Database Administration. This is accomplished in less than eighty pages which makes for brief explanations, limited illustrations, and examples. The second part is the MySQL Administration. This part has chapters on Performance Tuning, Security, and Database Design. The third part is MySQL Programming. The chapters' topics include general database applications, Perl, Python, PHP, C API, Java, and extending MySQL. Part four is the MySQL Reference. SQL syntax for MySQL, MySQL data types, Operators and Functions, MySQL PHP API Reference, C Reference, and Python DB-API are the chapter topics included in this part.The authors do not assume that the reader is knowledgeable about relational databases in general, SQL, or the related topics. For example, the chapter on SQL on MySQL does not just describe the subset of SQL-92 that MySQL supports, but rather it contains a tutorial on the SQL for the commands that MySQL supports. Chapter seven on Database Design contains a tutorial on taking a database to third normal form complete with Entity-Relationship diagrams, unique identifiers and relationships. In part four, the PHP chapter contains a mini-tutorial on PHP and a complete PHP application. While the level of thoroughness is nice in the sense that you do not have to refer to other volumes to comprehend the subject, it makes for some very intense reading because of the size of the book versus the topics covered.Overall, I like the book as a general tool, however there are certain omissions, for example: there is no reference phpMyAdmin or WinMySQLadmin. These tools are very easy to use and helpful in working with MySQL. In addition, the topic of creating InnoDB or BDB tables for transaction support is not addressed. The explanation of granting privileges in MySQL was a little confusing. Some supporting illustrations or diagrams would be well received there. The book is fairly successful in covering its broad topic domain. In conjunction with the MySQL manual, the book should meet most of my needs, but if I were a full time database administrator, I would probably want a dedicated reference book."},{"Title":"Managing and Using MySQL (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is clearly and succinctly written, and provides an excellent introduction to MySQL. It starts with a few pages on the history and philosophy behind MySQL, which is useful if you want to understand the advantages and disadvantages of MySQL relative to other options such as PostgreSQL or Oracle. It then follows with chapters on installation, with specific instructions for Solaris, Linux, and Windows; on MySQL's dialect of SQL (Structured Query Language); and on basic administration tasks such as configuration, startup and shutdown, logging, backup, and recovery. That's really all you need to get a basic database up and running, and it's all in the first 80 pages of the book.Part II of the book covers more advanced administrative tasks, with chapters on performance tuning, security, and database design. This section of the book is weaker than the first section; while there's some useful introductory material on each of these topics, depth is lacking. For example, the discussion of putting a database into second normal form is misleading because it uses a table with only one field as the unique identifier, making it impossible to clearly illustrate the removal to a smaller table of fields that are dependent on only part of a (typically multifield) unique identifier. Also, some of the more advanced MySQL features which might be appropriate for this section are omitted.Part III of the book, entitled &quot;MySQL Programming&quot;, has sections accessing MySQL from Perl, Python, PHP, C, Java. These sections are mostly limited to information specific to MySQL that might not be found in general purpose documentation of these languages. For example, the PHP section documents the relevant function calls, since PHP uses different functions to access MySQL than it does to access, say, ODBC databases, while the Java section focuses on JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver configuration since the JDBC API is database independent.Finally, there is a reference section and a good, complete index.If what you want to do is get a small database up and running in a minimum of time with a minimum of hassle, this is the book for you. If you want more than an introductory level of detail and depth, though, you might look at other books; Leon Atkinson's &quot;Core MySQL&quot;, for example, has more complete coverage, though the writing style is not as clear and direct."},{"Title":"Managing and Using MySQL (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is an excellent reference book for MySQL.

I was hoping to learn from this book some of the language implementations and how to administer on-line databases (backups, benchmarking, security). I found this book to be very lacking. The book provides very little of the language references of SQL, and devotes the majority of the text to function call references for C, Perl/DBI, PHP and Python. (I would think if you were looking for mysql function calls for these languages you would use the specific language reference). If you don't develop front-ends to MySQL in these languages (but still want to &quot;Manage and Use MySQL&quot;) then the bulk of this book is probably useless to you.As for managing MySQL, this text provides very little practical information. Sure it covers the GRANT statements, but doesn't go into much depth. For example, I found very little information about archiving or trying to incorporate some type of pseudo-replication.In general, I notice that my book is still in fairly new condition, and doesn't get used much ... it is just an arm's reach away.

The explanations given here are very brief and the authors often send you elsewhere for more in-depth discussion.

Also, the book is ambiguous on other Fault Tolerance issues. For example, on page 74 the book says to &quot;store the binary logs on the same device as the backups&quot;. Binary logs are generated real-time as incremental updates between the nightly dumps - the book makes no effort to explain how to replicate those logs real-time to a separate server.

But this one is different, and to other fans I say, reader beware. The writing style is wonderful, as always. But whereas I have loved the \\"Englishness\\" of her previous novels, this one seems very American in its over-the-top, sick violence. I was interested to read the review below, where the reviewer refers to a 'change in tone' of this novel, which I definitely agree, and attributes it to a change in the criminal climate in England. That I do not know enough about to agree or disagree. But if so, that's too bad. I found this book so disturbing in the way it seems almost to glorify the sickness of it's crime that I stopped reading it before the end. I don't even know \\"who dun it!\\" And I don't care. I just didn't want to read any further. And sadly, this is probably the end of the line for me with this series by Elizabeth George, as I can't imagine she could turn back on the new direction she has taken in this book."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"The latest in Elizabeth George's Thomas Lynley novels, \\"With No One As Witness\\", delivers a shocker about 3/5 of the way through the book. It's an event that, quite frankly, you will never anticipate, and it's completely unnecessary to the plot, unless Ms George got tired of the way Lynley's life was going and wanted to be able to move him off in another direction. We'll have to see what happens in her next book - if indeed there is a next book.That being said, and that plot twist aside, this is an excellent addition to one of the best British police procedurals being written today. Lynley and his two primary assistants, Barbara Havers and Winston Nkata, have never been more human, more alive - especially considering the subject of this latest entry in the series. George writes her story with great tact, and most of what she says on the subject is implied. Of necessity there are some scenes that may turn your stomach, but these are kept to a minimum and George does not draw out her descriptions of these scenes.Considering the hue and cry that emerged when this book came out, I will anxiously be awaiting news of the next book in this series - although as I said before, I wonder....."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"As a life-long reader,and especially of mysteries, I am rarely, if every, suprised. One of the reasons I enjoy Elizabeth George so very much is that she gives me a well-plotted story, and characters that have become very real, over the years. Most series authors begin to disappoint after the fifth/sixth book. Having said that, I was truely surprised, even shocked at what she did in this novel. How could she! This isn't fair! Now what will happen! And I have to wait a year or more to find out how this event will affect the major characters that I have really grown to care about. Ms George, you certainly never get stale or predictable. Thank you."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"No one can deny that Elizabeth George is a powerful writer. Unfortunately, her writing skills far outpace her ability to consistently turn out good mystery stories. Witness is the third book in a row that is less than good, and her brutal handling of central characters in this one leaves me with no desire to read any more of her novels.In Witness, she turns her lead character Inspector Lynley into a tentative and catastrophically inept \\"un-hero\\" who fails to find the killer and contributes to his wife's death. At the end of the book, justice is not done, evil triumphs, and the characters of the continuing series are devastated by loss.I'm not saying that there's no place for darkness is a mystery novel -- JK Rowling's elegant handling of death in her latest book beautifully demonstrates how sadness and loss can serve a higher purpose.The problem with George is her sledgehammer approach. Blinded by her belief that \\"characters are only interesting in their agony, not their joy\\", she fails to grasp that unrelieved angst is just as unsatisfying to read about as unfettered happiness. The result, in Witness, is a dark depressing book that makes you cry, sure, but also makes you want to drop her and find other authors with a better balance between dark and light.All you furious George fans: check out Donna Leon's Inspector Brunetti series. It has much of the literary grace, brilliant writing, atmosphere and psychological development of George's novels, without her destructive compulsion to break the rules of mystery writing."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Since Playing for the Ashes, every Elizabeth George novel has been longer, more elaborate, and more boring than the last. With No One as Witness is the worst of all. Not only is the book too long and too slow to get off the ground, it offers up a plot line that strains credibility to the breaking point and leads to the inexplicable death of a central and beloved character.In this book, George sheds the \\"cosy\\" murder mystery genre that she does so well and attempts to write a serial killer thriller. Big mistake. She doesn't do a good job, compared to serial killer masters such as Thomas Harris (Hannibal Lechter), who have an eerie ability to get into the skins of the psychologically abnormal. Her serial killer's psychological motives are thinly developed. Worse, after establishing a pattern of killing teenage boys, the killer suddenly aims at [...]. George does not credibly explain his motivation for breaking the pattern, which, we have been trained to believe, is almost impossible for a serial killer.Worse, the chain of events that leads to the heartbreaking murder of [...] are jarringly implausible, given the character of [...] as she has defined it up to now. It wasn't even directly related to the main plot of the novel. I found myself wondering what was on Elizabeth George's mind rather than focusing on the book -and that's a sign of real failure for an author.This book left me feeling depressed and sad over the devastation to the lives of every continuing character in her series - including the Bentley! It offered no resolution, and no sense that justice was ultimately done. Just ugliness and --- what was her word? - grievous loss.A thoroughly unsatisfactory mystery novel."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have enjoyed all of Elizabeth George's well written mysteries and have read them through the years in the order they were published. For what ever reason WITH NO ONE AS A WITNESS took me forever to read and maybe because of this long often interrupted stretch of reading time I had to keep turning back to figure out which of the minor characters was which. On the positive side George's great detectives, Havers and Lynley, get a lot of time, the mystery is compelling to at least near the end and the author certainly pays attention to detail. Yet this is not the \\"pageturner\\" some of her earlier books were. As to the great \\"shock\\" I like some other reviewers found it to be a bit contrived."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I ventured into reading this book with some trepidations, having heard about the controversy of a main character who is killed in the book. I wondered about who it was (fortunately didn't check here before I should have!), and whether it would \\"ruin\\" the read for me.Not for me, it turns out. I felt the pain and loss in the story, how all the characters were affected, and as someone in a field where I deal with such issues, it all felt and read as real to me.By the final page, I was in tears myself, and I'm not usually a crier with books. I'm far more interested now in seeing where this series might go!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George shares with some other mystery writers a need to demonstrate her knowledge of England and its ways, and also a need to prolitarianize the aristocracy. Her cops are deep feeling and sensitive. Over all, the atmosphere is a bit hard to believe. No willing suspension here. The book is over long by three or four hundred pages, mostly due to very long, syrupy excursions into the detectives private lives. This material does little to advance the plot; in fact, it rather reduces one's sympathy for them.This story shares with others of hers that I have read, a complex plot, good character development, good atmosphere and a strong tendency to skip large sections to be able to get on with it. In common with several other writers, British and American, who write \\"English\\" mysteries, the solution is frquently improbable - that is, the killer is selected from several suspects for no obvious reason that can be gleaned from the plot. It also seems to rely on a deus ex machina.Overall, an OK read, but not really in the top catergory. I wonder if this is meant to be the end of the Lynley series, or are we to be presented witha miracle next time?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is a wonderful book by Elizabeth George, and it's just what the legion of Lynley/Havers fans wanted: a richly detailed plot that gives almost all of the regular characters something meaningful to do. I have thought for a long time that Barbara Havers is the best character in mystery fiction -- she carried a book by herself a few years back, and she was fully up to the task -- and this outing is a real treat for Havers fans. Now for the complaint. For reasons I don't understand, the publisher decided to tell us on the book flap that there would be a \\"devastating tragedy\\" in the story. That killed much of my enjoyment of the book; I couldn't stop wondering when the tragedy was going to strike, and that in turn made me impatient where ordinarily I would have been enjoying the deliberate pace of the story as the police investigation moved forward. (What the tragedy is going to be is pretty obvious, but again, that's the fault of the publisher's giveaway. The foreshadowing of the tragedy seems extremely obvious, but that's probably because we know something bad is coming.) I would have given this book five stars had it not been for the publisher's spoiler. If Ms. George agreed to the book flap copy, it was a mistake."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Up to this book I have really enjoyed Elizabeth George's other Lynley and Havers series. But, even though Ms. George as the creator of the series has the right to change what she likes I felt the ending was just to get people to continue reading her next book. The ending wasn't necessary. To have an ending that has nothing to do with the rest of the book seems unnessary and just an attention getter. Ms. George doesn't need this type of ending to keep people reading about her two detectives. I hope she doesn't do this again and I will wait to see reviews of her next books before rushing out and buying it."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"When they talk about a shocking tragedy, they ain't kidding! I never expected THAT!!!This is not a book for first-time George readers. It's too complex, too many subplots, too many long-established relationships, too much personal history involved. Plus the book's horrifying tragedy won't mean much to the new reader.As a die-hard George fan, though, I applaud this effort. It could have been a little more streamlined, but it left me wanting more. She was extremely brave to turn the plot the way she did. NOW what?? I can't wait to find out."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Mindful of one of the earlier reviewers asking that the plot not be disclosed I will only say that the disappointment I felt when I read this book was huge!

Start with the earlier books and work up to this one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I'm glad I didn't read comments about this novel before reading it. Some of the comments would have definitely spoiled my enjoyment of the story. The unexpected plot twists added to the developement of the recurring characters in the series. Their actions make them human and fallible which is one of the reasons that I love the books. It is true that some minor characters could have been totally eliminated without much consequence to the major plot, but some of them did serve their purpose in creating a background of suspense. I would have liked more of an explanation of the motivation of the killer as well as some subtle clues that might have helped me solve the mystery. It's not the best book in the series but it is certainly an important one in terms of character development in the overall series. I can't wait to see what happens to the characters that I've grown to love. The books' strength far exceeds its flaws."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Good grief! What an addition to this sterling if somewhat uneven series. Love most of them, and this is right up there for sheer absorption. When I got to the last 200 pages, I could barely breathe. And the tension was so high, I kept putting the book down, pacing, then running back for more.I too hate plot summaries, especially of mysteries, so I'll just say if you love Havers' predicaments and internal conflicts and long ago fell for Tommy Lynley, you'll just HAVE to read this one. Having known these characters since the first books, I'm shaken and rattled and want to call Elizabeth George rather than wait for the next developments. (No, she doesn't leave the ending unclear like a cruel TV series cliffhanger, but you will be in shock.)Lynley's new boss, Hillier, is at his most frustrating worst, and if you don't want to turn him inside out during this book, well, you're not human. Azhar and his conflicts add to the story, as does his daughter. Deborah and St. James are back in lesser roles, this time while Nkata's role grows somewhat. Everything you love about this series is here, and a heck of a lot more. Batten down the hatches folks, it's going to be a bumpy ride!!!!More more...soon!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"E.George is widely considered one of the masters of the police procedure genre. This is, for practical purposes, the first of her novels that I have read (I remember vaguely another one, some years ago, but forgot all about it). It is solid stuff and she is for sure one of the stars in her profession.The main subject of this novel is a serial killer who targets boys of 12 to 14 years, more often coloured ones. Other themes are police bureaucracy and leadership problems. Plus of course the amazing world of charities looking after endangered youth.Why not 5 stars?First of all, the thing is too big! I wanted to read it on a long flight, and could not finish. Is that a quality criterion? Of course not, except that I think she could have kept it slimmer. The result of the size is that off and on it does get a bit slow...Another reason: while her main characters are all realistic ones (the aristocratic, nice and competent team leader Linley; the competent, but disorganized and socially imbecile Havers; the black sergeant Nkata with the crush for a woman who rejects him and the Brixton Warriors experience; the boss from hell, top cop Hillier), they do not appeal to me, emotionally, on the same level as John Rebus, Arkady Renko, or Aurelio Zen.The plot is suitably complex for such a brick of a book. The interest lies not only in 'detection' (which is of course the mainstay of the genre), but also in apparently thorough knowledge of London's geography and social structure. While EG definitely has a sense of humour, she has the good sense of not trying to be funny.All in all a good experience, and I may repeat it for another long flight. (not the same book, silly; another one of the series of course)"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"As a British mystery and police procedural fan, I've enjoyed watching Acting Superintendent Thomas Lynley and Detective Constable Barbara Havers solve cases in the TV versions of George's books.This is the first of the books I've read (another holiday gift). Books can express so much more than movies can, so I got more out of this book than I probably do out of the shows, even though I like them.The murder of four youths, three of them black or of mixed parentage has everyone on edge. Mix this with Havers messed up life in general and the increased pressure on Lynley in the role of superintendent and you will be busy working out how it will all turn out. The tension builds to a fever pitch until.... Elizabeth George writes well and her ability to keep my eyes riveted to the page never ceased.

So many novels today are mere outlines but George develops all the characters in detail. Perhaps there was one or two references to characters in movies that we were supposed to refer to. Perhaps not. The ending was not very satisfying but neither is life. The touch and feel of London was great. Actually the ending wasn't very good. The villan Hillier got away with everything and our hero was defeated.

I don't think the author did much research on serial killers before she wrote her book: serial killers are notoriously sociopathic, and it's just not believable that one would have an accomplice, like Ms. George's did.Also, I felt like I wandered into the funeral of a total stranger by mistake. The whole end of the book was taken up with the death of a character who wasn't even killed by the serial killer. Her death didn't seem to have much to do with the rest of the story, except to make the obvious point that there is a lot of random violence in the world. Duh.The only good thing I can say about the book is that it caught the intensity of the police hunt well.

With No One As Witness was brilliant. Ms. George has spent years, over a decade, allowing us to get to know the characters as you would get to know a friend. The frailities and strengths of Barbara, Thomas, Simon, Helen, and Deb have made them extraordinarily human.The loss of such a beloved character was dealt with beautifully.

I(and other readers) must separate what we WANT or expect to happen, from where the author chooses to take the story. The last 100 pages of the book had me on the edge of my seat, or in tears; I didn't LIKE what was happening at all, but it moved me on both an intellectual and emotional level.

If you must read it, get it from the library."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This started as a great series featuring Thomas Lynley the aristocrat/detective and his unpolished bulldog of a sergeant, Barbara Havers. Elizabeth George's ability to set mood, describe surroundings, find the subtle clues to behavior and use them as descriptors of even minor characters all give her books more depth. She reinforced my preference for British mysteries (despite the fact that George herself is American). There is usually a lot more to her books than plot.This time she gives the impression that she filled the pages for bulk rather than content. In brief, there is a serial killer which appears to be associated with an effective but dysfunctional charity which Havers distrusts. (How the counselors of the charity are effective social workers is a unexplained mystery.) Havers is convinced there is more than meets the eye while Lynley is more worried about keeping his dreadful chief out of way of the investigation which meanders. Havers career and personal missteps arise from her passionate belief in her own point of view--through all these books, she hasn't learned much. Lynley personally investigates very little, but refuses the help of a profiler (which doesn't sound like the sophisticated detective) and mostly tries to keep his ridiculous chief from interfering in the investigation. It all goes horribly wrong. We lose what we thought was a major continuing character. For series fans, the loss of the character should be a little heartbreaking -- it is not. The death is not even pertinent to the plot of the book. The change is surely convenient for future series development, though.George may have lost interest. The reader has the sense that there is little more to explore in these characters or their behaviors. They suffer (a lot) but never laugh. Even the plot (which is often secondary in Ms. George's books) seems contrived. These seem to be sex crimes but they are not, quite. A clue in the first chapter reveals the killer but is then ignored for many, many pages. Extraneous killers appear from nowhere. The charity's internal problems never rise to red herrings. The action is piled into the last few chapters. Elizabeth George is capable of far better. She is an excellent writer whose first few books remain favorites but she may have exhausted this series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I'm a big fan of Elizabeth George's mysteries.

This novel does not sink into predictability or cliches as some of the other novels do.And all of the favorite characters are featured-Lynley, Havers, Nkata, Deborah, Lady Helen (even Webberly) - plus Barbara's neighbors Azhur and Hadiyah are also included in plot as the clock ticks, and Lynley, Havers, Nkata, Stewart and friends race to find a serial killer of young boys before he claims more lives.As the gang races to seek out the killer, several of the characters must also deal with personal issues (especially toward the end).Any fan of the series must read this installment. I think it will upset some fans, but it is a page turner, constantly suprisinging and sometimes frustrating the readers (You begin to wonder at times why some earlier leads weren't followed up on). Still this is superior to many of the recent installments.Long live Lynley and Havers and the series! I can't wait to see where things go next."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I read many dective/mystery series for various reasons. Elizabeth George I read for the complex detailing of her plots and the slow moving, but believable course of the personal relationships. This was an astounding book with a shocker of an ending, but to keep it believable I am assuming Lynley never goes back to Scotland Yard. In fact, I wonder if this is the final book of the series since everything (for once) is tied up and nothing left unresolved. To wit; Webberly is retiring so the pain of Hillier will never go away; Lynley is shown throughout the book as being more & more disgusted with the crime he sees and his only escape had been his home life; Havers gets her title back; both Havers and Nkata look like they finally are starting on their respective personal relationships; and the most telling, Havers realizes that while she & Lynley were colleagues, they were never friends nor will they be. That puts an end to the stress & growth of them working together. It appears when Lynley turned in his warrant, it was for good and not a spur of the moment decision. I'm guessing that if the series does continue, it will be with the two most interesting people, Havers & Nkata at the yard, with guest appearances of St. James and perhaps Lynley. Lynley will otherwise stay down in Cornwall which would eventually have been his role anyway.Of the 4 major characters from the beginning; Tommy, Helen, Simon and Deborah; none were that interesting on their own. All were badly flawed, but it was the interaction among them that kept them human, interesting and sympathetic. Now that is gone and I don't see how Tommy could be made an interesting character in his own right.The only quibble I have with the writing was the cliche way the shocker came about. It could have been done in a more believable fashion instead of trying to tie it to the case."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This book is very long and it took me a while to get into it. It was a bit slow going at first. I loved other books by Elizabeth George but this was not one of her best and the ending was terribly sad."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"\\"With no one as a witness\\" the whole series takes a turn in more than one sense. The novel itself is a compelling read, leaving the reader looking for more, the characters are very realistic in their acting under tremendous strain. Some reviewers pointed out that Lynley does not act like he used to do before, in other novels. Given the stress, the psychological drain, the events he seems unable to stop it is perfectly natural that he acts not like his usual self. I think Elisabeth did a good job showing the limits of a character.The end, that shocked so many people, is some of the things that deserves 5 stars! Not only is it a brave decision on Elisabeths side to take this turn, but it is also a very deep and psychological moment. When Deborah murmurs \\"This was Belgravia, it was supposed to be safe.\\" The illusions we all harbour are shattered to pieces.I hope Elisabeth doesn't wait too long with a sequel!!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Having been so hard on Ms George's last book, I felt compelled to report that she is back on track with another page turner featuring my favorite characters Lynley and Havers. Although she dropped the requisite hints along the way, the ending had a really twisting turning journey to the identification of the killer. There was another plot twist that left some dangling threads but we will have to wait until the next book.Ms. George always features a social ill that she lends light on during the course of her books. In this case although the reviewer mentions racism, I felt it was more of an expose of throwaway children, who are often lost in the cracks of parents' problems and organizational red tape. This made the group of victims quite sympathetic and the killer even more evil for having preyed upon those who had little defense.I'm happy to report that Ms. George's latest book is one that her fans will enjoy."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"London born Tony nominee and Emmy Award winner Charles Keating gives a polished reading of Elizabeth George's latest spellbinder. An accomplished stage and television actor, Keating is well remembered for his performances with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and on television in Brideshead Revisited and Another World. This compelling police procedural calls for an actor with brisk articulation and the ability to sustain mounting suspense - Keating fulfills this role in spades.In this, her thirteenth novel, George returns Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his erstwhile partner Barbara Havers. In addition to murder, the author also raises some profound and troubling issues which the characters must confront. Thus, we not only have vintage Elizabeth George but a writer at the top of her game.Four adolescent boys have been murdered. Three of them were of mixed parentage, and the third is white. His body is found atop a tomb, obviously a ritualistic killing. Somehow the slaying of four youth are connected, but how?Rumors abound that New Scotland Yard has racist tendencies due to its apparent inability to solve the first three murders. Thus, the case is given to Lynley and his cohorts, all of whom are dealing with personal troubles. As always, this author excels in character depictions, and painting background scenes whether seedy or exclusive.All know that a psychopath is on the loose, but finding him is quite another matter as both Lynley and Havers are distracted by issues of their own and turmoil among the police.As is her wont, George doesn't miss a beat in pacing a story that throbs with excitement, suspense and a spectacular denouement.A superb listen.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I am one of the readers who felt betrayed by the random and violent death of a long-standing major character. People read mysteries, even well-written one with deep character development, for diversion, and it is one of the \\"rules\\" of the genre that tragedies don't befall the main characters. The whole point, psychologically, of the mystery novel, is to help readers distance themselves from death and the pain that surrounds it by transforming it into an interesting intellectual puzzle, a who-done-it. In short, it's \\"escape\\" fiction, and readers use it that way, because we all already have tragic elements in our lives that we'd like some respite from. So to have the real tragedy of life invade the frame of the story, unexpectedly, and against the agreed upon \\"rules\\"--the \\"deal\\" that the author makes with her readers when she writes in a \\"who-done-it\\" genre, and not in a \\"real\\" tragic literary genre--feels random, cruel, and violent.Other reviewers have written that somehow George couldn't bear (or find the skill) to write about a happy marriage. It seems to me that her real issue is with childbearing. Deborah's miscarriages, Helen's sister's post-partum depression, the way so many plots concern murdered children or lost babies... she just can't let any of her characters happily raise a child. This book cheated me out of a satisfying series, and made the series no longer escape fiction. Time to bail."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This author painstakingly created 5 core characters who were five of the most memorable characters in detective fiction. In one stroke of the pen, she has totally obliterated all of it. George is, of course, the one who created these characters, and she certainly owes nothing to the readers, so she can certainly write their histories however she wants. However, as someone who has read all the books in this series, largely because of the relational aspects of these five wonderful characters, I find it very difficult to even conceive of reading another book in this series. In fact, she'd be much better off using this book as the end of this series, which she could certainly do given the ending, and start something new. There was just no excuse for what she did in this book."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"While in all other respects this is as good as any of her novels, I am giving this one star to protest a trend among my former favorite authors. In these times, who wants the depressing endings and tragedy-laden plots that these people keep dishing out? Is there no other way to keep a series interesting? One of this author's best gifts was the creation of multi-faceted, interesting and humorous characters who her readers came to care about. If I wanted to see one of the best of them axed, I could go read Stephen King. The ending was totally unnecessary. I hated it. I am not even interested to see how other characters adapt to it in future novels. I don't care to invest my time in this any more."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I gave this book only 4 stars because having read D.H. Lawrence, I find it impossible to give a 5 star rating easily. That aside, what an engrossing read!Ms. George's characters are real. Havers is a complex woman of keen instinct and tenacity. She's a real bulldog of a detective/constable. She's a whole lot more comfortable thinking than feeling. She is unflinching in the face of danger unless it involves emotional vulnerability. I love that the author handles Havers character so revealingly.Inspector Lynley is even more complex than Havers. He comes from a background of privilege and yet he is drawn to a sordid world of killers and their motivations. His character is revealed through internal dialogue and reflection more than action in this novel.Surprisingly, though this is a mystery novel, there were a few points in which I was tearful in the reading. The book is so engrossing that the experiences of the characters become very personal to the reader.I would unhesitatingly recommend this book to any anglophile and fan of the English mystery genre."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George is the only novelist... well, OK, besides J. K. Rowling... that I buy in hardbound because I can't wait for it to come out in paper. This one is a gem. Her last novel, _A Traitor to Memory_ was something of a departure from the mainstream of her novels. I thought it was sensational, but not everyone agreed. _With No One As Witness_ is not only one of her best novels to date, but is also a return to the style and substance of her earlier novels.It is not important to read her novels in order. This one is not only sensationally good, but is also a good introduction to the whole series. George has an of ensemble of continuing characters, but does not make a point of including everyone of them in every book. This one, however, includes the whole cast: Lynley, Helen, Deborah and Simon St. James, Nkata, and of course, Barbara Havers.I say \\"of course\\" because I happen to be a Barbara Havers fan and am always a little disappointed in the novels where she makes only a cameo role. So I'm pleased that she plays an important role here.I have accused Elizabeth George of being cruel to Barbara Havers and subjecting her to more than her fair share of unkind vicissitudes of fate. In this novel, however, fate is reasonably kind to Havers. I can't say much more about what happens to these characters without spoiling the plot. So let me go on to trivia.I love George's handling of the British atmosphere, while occasionally wondering whether she overdoes it. I have a theory that the word \\"secateurs\\" appears in every one of her novels. In this one, the secateurs duly make their appearance on p. 144.I think I've caught her in a mistake! On page 446, she \\"Tatlises... admitted Lynley and Havers to the room... it was a dismal enough chamber... dingy curtains covered the single transom window.\\" I believe \\"transom\\" in this sense is an Americanism and that the ordinary British term is \\"fanlight.\\"Did I notice a hommage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories on p. 475? Barbara Havers discovers that an apartment dweller's obnoxious dog Pearl, who barks at everyone and everything, did not bark at midnight on the night of a crime, at a time when other residents thought they heard \\"a cry of some sort.\\" The Sherlock Holmes story \\"Silver Blaze\\" contains the famous exchange \\"Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?\\" \\"To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.\\" \\"The dog did nothing in the night-time.\\" \\"That was the curious incident,\\" remarked Sherlock Holmes. Pearl's failure to bark at midnight is a curious incident, with a similar explanation.Come to think of it, \\"Pearl\\" is also the name of the fictional (late) dog owned by Robert Parker's fictional detective Spenser, so perhaps we are getting two hommages for the price of one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George has ventured into new and exciting territory with the publication of WITH NO ONE AS WITNESS, her latest Thomas Lynley police procedural. This time Lynley is Acting Superintendent due to the attempted murder of Superintendent Malcolm Webberly, his immediate super, who is slowly recovering from his almost fatal injuries. In this role Lynley is confined to an office and must operate under the thumb of Acting Commissioner Sir David Hillier, a megalomaniac who manages to alienate everyone with whom he comes in contact, especially Barbara Havers, who he demoted to Constable. Hillier barely tolerates Lynley and uses every sly ploy he can concoct to undermine him; in a spiteful move he promotes Winston Nkata to Sergeant. \\"The assistant commissioner's style of command generally existed on the border between Machiavellian and despotic, and rational individuals gave the man a very wide berth.\\"The story begins in Hillier's office when he calls the team together to inform them that over the past three months four young boys have been kidnapped, tortured, sexually molested, and brutally murdered. \\"The table ... held four sets of photographs. In them four bodies lay ... arranged on their backs, with their hands folded high on their chests in the manner of effigies on tombs.\\" Hillier refers to them as A, B, C and D, because they are unnamed and not identified. Unfortunately, too much time passed before anyone realized that all of the murders are related and a serial killer is preying on male adolescents. His MO is to dump the bodies, one at a time, far from their usual \\"patch\\" and in different police precincts.Hillier is a political animal and understands that the press will savage New Scotland Yard, and him especially, for not connecting and reporting these atrocious crimes. He has some devious plans to present to the group. But the ever-outspoken Barbara Havers \\"raised her head ... 'Institutionalized racism. That's what they are going to claim ... no one across London --- in any of the stations involved, right? --- even twigged there's a serial killer at work. No one got around to comparing notes. This kid [she raises the photograph of a black youth] might've been reported missing in Peckham. Maybe in Kilburn. Or anywhere. But his body wasn't dumped where he lived and disappeared from, was it, so the rozzers on his home patch called him a runaway, left it at that, and never matched him up to a murder that got reported in another station's patch. Cheap murders, hardly worth investigating, all because of their race. That's what they're going to call the first three when the story gets out. The tabloids, television and radio news, the whole flaming lot.'\\"But in his unctuous way AC Hillier smugly replies that all is in hand, and like a carefully rehearsed scene, Winston Nkata walks into the meeting room. The AC welcomes him as if he really liked or cared about the newly named Sergeant. What Hillier is going to do is attempt to turn the lack of coverage back onto the press. He is planning to use Nkata as a token black officer at every press conference he can arrange. \\"With one parent from Jamaica and the other from the Ivory Coast, Nkata was decidedly, handsomely, and suitably black.\\" He also is nobody's fool and understands what Hillier is doing and calls him on it. Nkata may play along for the sake of the investigation of the murders of black children, but he will determine when and how.WITH NO ONE AT WITNESS is one of the few books wherein George puts us in the minds of almost all of the series's characters. We learn much about Lynley and how he is adjusting to married life and the pregnancy of his wife, Helen. She is his center. She is his rock. He adores her beyond imagination and the feeling is mutual. We learn more about Barbara Havers and her needs as a woman. She is on an informal probation because she has to learn to obey orders rather than go off into her own plan to solve crimes. Winston Nkata is drawn more fully. His compassion and street smarts come together when he tries to protect a young teenager who he has come to love. Lynley's lifelong friends, Simon St. James and his wife Deborah, are limned with a careful brush that gives readers more confirmation of their raw feelings in times of catastrophe, and their empathy is right on the surface along with their deep devotion to Lynley and Helen.Away from the Yard is an outreach organization called Colossus. Ulrike Ellis is the director of this place for troubled kids. First they are put through an assessment period, which is more or less an exercise in developing trust; then they have a personal challenge; next is the trip that they plan as a group; and finally when they finish this intake routine they are invited to partake of the many classes Colossus offers.On their first visit to Colossus, Lynley and Havers get the skivvy from Jack Veness, the receptionist. He tells them, \\"Trouble is, kids can't wait for the payoff, can they? They want the result but not the process that leads to the result.\\" In this case the process is a commitment --- from learning to read to learning computer basics --- with the hopeful result of the youth developing a sense of themselves and a belief that they have a future beyond the streets. But the two savvy detectives sense foulness at Colossus and keep the entire enterprise high on their radar.Readers learn a great deal about Ulrike Ellis, the teachers of Colossus, and the boys who frequent it; they all play major roles in the plot. Is Colossus where the killer observes and then picks his victims? Or is Colossus really the sanctuary it purports to be? And what about the staff? They clearly are a strange group of people. Ulrike has an agenda that can only cause trouble for herself and for her charges. The secrets harbored in the hearts of these people are dangerous and pitiless, and their actions resonate like a disease throughout the community.WITH NO ONE AS WITNESS is a long, complicated, and extraordinarily courageous book, and an intellectual challenge. Themes and sub-themes crisscross throughout the rich narrative. Elizabeth George pushes the envelope as each event unfolds. She offers a palette of shadows and light that will keep readers on the edge of their seats. With her usual aplomb the author transcends the expectations of genre readers and provokes them to think about relationships, love, death, evil, hate, hate crimes, racism, classism, and family. Fans will be shocked at the twists and turns the plot takes. New readers will be motivated to examine her entire body of work --- which is stellar.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"She's back! I've never actually lost faith in Elizabeth George, but her last few books have been a vague mixture of disappointments...nothing specifically wrong, but nothing truly memorable. Well, she's shaken that off and this book will leave you with no sense of ennui, I guarantee you. A good friend and fellow George reader called me just as I was about to start \\"With No One As Witness\\", having just finished it herself, and asked me to call her as soon as I had read it. Now I know why. I can't say more without giving away one or more of the myriad plot twists, but I can say that Elizabeth George writes here with an energy and wit that we haven't seen in years. I suspect the topics herein are very close to her heart and that always makes for better reading. It is also a little eerie that she presages in this book some of the more sensational recent headlines - this book was written long before them. Deborah and Simon don't have large roles here but their presence is pivotal and Lynley and Helen are still a well-conceived couple. George has inched their relationship along through this entire series of books and this book takes them one step further into impending parenthood. But it is Havers I love, with all of her intelligence, complicated self-love/loathing, and her seeming missteps that guide so many of George's plot lines. This is an unforgettable book with a breathtaking pathos that has been missing in many modern thrillers. You'll either love it or hate it, but you won't forget it."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Sorry to be the first one to write a negative review of this book, but I found it to be riddled with the cliches of serial killer novels (oh, no, the killer's going to escalate!) and not up to the standards of earlier entries in this series. As for the \\"shocking\\" plot twist, regular readers of this series should see it coming a mile away, since it's the only logical progression in a series that's become increasingly stale. The true enjoyment of the series has always been Lynley and Havers investigating a murder while exploring a certain milieu (i.e. university, public school, publishing) and its peculiarities. Recent books in the series have spent too much time on Havers, her annoying demotion, and her involvement with her neighbors and Lynley's domestic bliss with Helen and this book is no exception. In fact, there is hardly any interaction between Lynley and Havers in this book because Lynley spends most of his time dealing with idiotic bureaucrats while Havers alternately whines about her demotion or her relationship with her neighbors, which is much worse than the whining she used to do over her senile mother. After the excruciatingly boring \\"A Place of Hiding\\" and this predictable mess, I'm afraid Ms. George is no longer on my must-buy list. In fact, I'll probably just reread \\"Well-Schooled in Murder\\" or \\"In the Presence of the Enemy.\\""},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I'm still not quite sure that I believe what happened at the end of With No One as Evidence. I had no idea it was coming, so it was a complete shock to me. That being said, though, I can see why George did what she did and see how she is setting things up for her next books. When you read this book have your hankies ready. The ending is a real tearjerker.Nevertheless, it is an excellent book. The mystery element of a serial killer who is targeting young boys in London is riveting enough, but when you add in the interference of Sir David Hillier with the investigation, and the personal details about Havers, Nkata and Lynley, you have a book that is impossible to put down. The fact that the end is so wrenching is a tribute to how well George has written the characters and how much we've come to love them over the years."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"WITH NO ONE AS WITNESS is really like two books in one, a crime story and Detective Inspector Lynley's personal story. The crime story, which involved the serial killing of \\"at-risk\\" adolescent boys, was not really a compelling narrative. I usually love Elizabeth George books, but it dragged in many parts and the first half of the book seemed like a bit of a chore to read. What really saved this book was Thomas Lynley's personal story. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say it involved quite a shock. The second half of the book picked up tremendously. Series readers will get the full emotional effect of the events. Elizabeth George is an excellent author, and I hope next time the crime around which the crime revolves will the more engaging.First half of book: 3 starsSecond half of book: 5 stars"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Of the many mistakes Elizabeth George made in With No One as Witness, the one that seems worst in the long run is her treatment of her detective Thomas Lynley. She has always drawn him as a man of great features and great flaws - and that was good, because it made him seem like a real person of character and depth. But in this most recent novel, she sets up a situation - his wife's murder - in which Lynley ultimately appears as incompetent and pathetic. He is negligent in protecting his wife, he doesn't catch the criminal, his car gets trashed, he quits his job. I'm left with a squeamish reluctance to read anything further about the life of this non-hero and the remaining cast members, all of whom (except possibly Simon St. James) are more or less failures at life. A telltale phrase in the book - \\"It was all because of his hubris\\" -- hints at George's ill-chosen agenda for Lynley. She seems to be trying to metamorphosize her detective into a tragic figure in the Shakespearean sense - brought low by his own pride. This former high-school English teacher is trying, unsuccessfully, to do something in a mystery story that is best done in another kind of book. If she needs to stretch as a writer beyond mystery stories, then she should have the honesty to do that, instead of trying to torture her plots (and her characters, and her readers) into another direction."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George already wrote this book. It was called \\"Well Schooled in Murder,\\" and had the same premise (biracial youngster is molested, tortured and finally murdered), although a distinctly different setting. It made more of an effort to get inside the suspects' heads and portray them as if not downright sympathetic characters, than certainly less repulsive than the ones in this book. \\"Well Schooled\\" was also shorter, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I'm all for curling up with a massive tome, as long as the author takes pains to make me care about the plot and the characters.I, too, was dismayed at her decision to kill off a long running major character, but she as the author has the final say. What I objected to was how random the death was, that it apparently had no bearing on the main case, and I also thought it should have been placed anywhere except near the very end. Because we've known the character from the start, her death eclipsed the intrigue of solving the case.And, minor point I know, but I could not quite believe that Barbara's neighbor would leave his eight-year-old daughter alone to babysit herself. Wasn't this the same child who was kidnapped and flung overboard into the sea a few books ago? Unless the man's supposed to be a sociopath, this strains credibility."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Undoubtedly Elizabeth George is a clever and enjoyable writer. I have read all ofher books the instant that I could get my hands on them---even in hardcover. However, a friend gave the shocker away to me about this one, and I have given the book away unread.

I'm tired of the darkness..."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Like many other hardcore Elizabeth George fans, I was positively thrilled when I had my copy of With No One As Witness in my eager hands. After the very disapointing A Place of Hiding, I was extremely thrilled to pick up again on the stories of Lynley, Havers and Nkata. However, from the very beginning of the novel, I sensed something a bit \\"off\\" in comparison with her other mysteries. The story was not nearly as gripping (it took me a full 100 pages to feel really interested in the book, which is unheard of for me) and for some reason the characters seemed dry and uninspired. Eventually, the novel caught my interest, but I agree with other reviewers that the serial killer plot does not fully develop and deepen as her other mysteries have. In fact, I actually solved the mystery before Lynley/Havers et al managed to do so, which was disapoinging because I never felt that \\"oh my god\\" moment of surprise and revelation when the killer is revealed.I also agree with other reviewers that the killing of a major character was a *HUGE* mistake on George's part and reveals her own weakness as a writer. I still cannot fathom why she chose to do so in such a cruel, meaningless fashion. It's extremely disapointing, to say the least, not to mention heartbreaking.That being said, I still plan on purchasing and reading George's next novel (if, in fact, there is one.) I'm interested to know *why* she killed off the character and what it means for the series, and I do want to know where she's planning on taking Havers/Lynley et al. as the series progresses. It seems that many previous Elizabeth George fans are claiming they will not read any of her further novels, but I think this is just a reactionary response by a fan base that feels betrayed. I'm still holding out hope that she will redeem herself in some way by lifting the characters out of the hopelessness and malaise she has placed them in."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I am assuming you know the general plot. We have our hero, Lynley, et al., fighting a dreadful serial killer (but what serial killer isn't dreadful?) while he must do a solo battle with higher-ups who wish to use the investigation politically. His team has been augmented with others, given the enormity of the case, and he must get some truly strong personalities to work together. On the home front, he and Helen are expecting their first child.Havers, our regular heroine, is at odds with the Muslim neighbors (father and daughter) she has become involved with, making her more edgy than usual.The backdrop is the \\"new London\\" of recent crime novels, a place riven with sexual depravity, the last vestiges of class warfare and the crimes naturally spawned by poverty and ignorance. Most of this last drama is played out in the tale of Sgt. Nkata, a succesful black detective uneasy in the predominantly white Met, and that of a successful but greatly troubled social-services agency with strong, but unintentional, links to the crimes being investigated. This ain't Miss Marple.A nice table of fixins', indeed. But, as others have noted, George proceeds as if she were paid by the word in her laborious attention to detail. Most characters are potrayed at great length and depth, as if by a shrink. Her characters often \\"plod,\\" but this time I felt as if I were doing the plodding as I pushed through the book's 600+ pages.About half-way through, an almost unimaginable tragedy occurrs, and serves to ooze into every main character's actions (except those of the killer), stalling the book's action even more.I usually race through the last quarter of such a book but, even though I had ample time, it took three days for me to finish that much of the book. I kept falling asleep. I was worn out by all of the story's travails and misery, and the work I had to do to keep up with the investigation and the characters.I hope George continues the series, as that is uncertain at the close of the book. If the high drama was merely a way to take Lynley in a new direction, I don't think a twist this upsetting, or this dramatic, was necessary. We've seen him change before without such drastic punishment."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I'm not going to spoil it for anyone...suffice it to say that this book is a shocker but a depressing one.

The PROBLEM is that when you read a series of books, you get to like the characters and when terrible things happen to them, it tends to put you off. That's how I felt with this book.

I AM ADDITIONALLY DISSAPOINTED TO READ THAT HELEN IS KILLED IN THIS BOOK. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"In this novel, Elizabeth George shatters the quintet of main characters that has given strength and interest to her long running detective series. By killing off Helen Clyde (surely this is no longer a spoiler) she seems decided to make either the perpetually aggrieved Barbara Havers or the dreary Simon/Deborah couple the centerpiece of any future books - even though earlier books that didn't feaure Lynley have sold dramatically less well. It looks like her absorption with \\"growing as an author\\" has caused her to badly misjudge why people bought her books. Witness ended on a dark and dreary note that only bodes ill for future books. I recommend that George fans start looking for another favorite author."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Ms. George's books have usually kept me reading to the very end unable to put the book down until finished. I found this book plodding, repetetive and I had to force myself to finish it. Barbara Havers was still the one bright and interesting character, but the rest were just boring. While the end was sad and depressing, Lynley's character needs more depth and color and this might take it in that direction. I hate giving an Elizabeth George book 2 stars because I have had so much enjoyment from the previous ones, but this one became tiresome."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Some of this book's negative reviews, even outraged ones, have fascinated me. I too have read all of George's police procedurals. I favor British works in this genre and must remind myself that George is American. Regardless of a book's length, I am usually sad when it ends. For me it is like saying \\"so long\\" to a good friend who has stopped by for a visit and I don't know when she will be back.I just learned that Elizabeth George returns later this Spring. I called my daughter who is 17, away at school, and also an avid George fan. My daughter will certainly welcome her back.My five stars is not only for George. It is for this particular book, a weighty and complex novel that just happens to be a mystery but crosses into the designated genre of literature.Finally, a reminder: George is not dead, only one of her characters."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"My god this book was a page turner until the collapse at the end.. do I care about these characters.. NO!! This is the first EG book Ive read so I dont care who dies, who does what, who is shacking up with who. All I cared about was interesting conclusion to the who-dunnit mystery that kept me reading till the end. How much of a let down is this story!!? HUGE!!!!! After endless diversions and red-herrings that kept me guessing about who the killer may be, the killer turns out to be totally not interesting and furthermore, we have no insight into why or what caused this person to kill other than some lame-@ss attempt to blame it on his dead father? Who knows. This is a really bad book that is so well written for 3/4ths of it, it will suck you in then leave you wondering why you kept reading it. Supposedly, there was some shocking conclusion that would leave you emotionally spent. I couldnt figure out what it was. I finished this thing and said to myself \\"that was it?!!?\\" WTF!!?! Hats off to EG because she suckered me into this mess. Last book I'll ever read by her."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I really hate to say this but it's that time, the dreaded hour when a MAJOR character hits the dust. In this case it's the mildly annoying, flittering socialite wife of star Lynley. If Helen is lucky she will be rewarded with an afterlife filled with servants, boutiques, chic cafes and parties every night of the week.I liked the book and to tell the truth, I get so obsorbed in the story I hardly notice the inordinate length. Plus, my favorite character, Havers, was back in mid-season form - she is the greatest!!! One can almost feel the approaching doom as George masterfully applies her incredible literary technique, drawing the reader into the couple's newly discovered happiness and all the dreams of the future. The story blithely continues, building a sunny optimism (VERY similar to the Bond and Tracey and their short lived bliss)and yet in the background there is a storm approaching and the reader just knows something bad is awaiting and when it does - POW! It's a stunner but to tell the truth, Helen was always my least favorite character. In fact, she never seemed \\"real\\" like the other four members of this merry little band.My only gripe is that George could have saved the baby by keeping Helen on life support. Think of all the soliloquies we'd hear from the Inspector, the beautiful women he would have to sorrowfully disclose his beloved's silent state. Sure Helen would be brain dead but that's beside the point. She will have given her one true love a son (it had to be a son). Think of the plot possibilities that open as Lyndley goes all domestic on us. On the other hand, we can now follow the inspector as he searches and finds love in (I guarantee) all the wrong places before settling down with his new one and only. My grade: B+"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Without giving away the plot to this, I will just say that it looks like Lynley will not be returning for another book, judging by what happens to him in this one. And I for one applaud that. I never knew what George found so fascinating about Lynley. The one interesting thing about him is that he is an earl working in the police. Since this sort of thing would be pretty much unheard of in the UK, you'd have thought she'd make much more of this. I have not read every book in the series, but you'd imagine his colleagues would tease him mercilessly about being a toff, make fun of his accent etc. But they don't. George's characterisation of Lynley has always been poor. So he is good looking and likes to dominate women and has some flakey beauty as a wife? So what? How is that interesting? It's not like George can't do good characters. For example, the character of Havers is infinitely fascinating.Still, all this aside, a brilliant plot from Ms George here, with lots of twists, red herrings and heaps of intrigue. I wonder if she will start a new series soon? Note to Ms George: please keep Havers in your new series. I am dying for Havers to find romance. By God she deserves it."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've not read any of this series prior to reading this book, so it was hard to get really involved with the characters. As an American, it was also hard to follow some of the dialect, since it is written in \\"British\\" (and the author made a few mistakes, such as having one of her characters refer to something in inches). I kept imagining the British accent, and that slowed me down. Bad guy was pretty easy to guess, although there were a few twists I didn't see coming. Not sure if I'll pick up any more of this series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Her best in years (let's just forget those last two, shall we?)I got such a laugh reading the comments from readers who are INCENSED at the \\"alteration\\" of one of the core characters. It's FICTION, folks, and Ms George gets to write her plots and characters any way she sees fit! I just hope she is taking all of this \\"huff\\" as a compliment. It's her skill in writing evocative and interesting characters that is causing all the ado.I hope this isn't the last Lynley novel.

The novel is set in 21st century London dealing with a series of young impoverished boys who have been brutally murdered by a serial killer on the loose.The book is dark and there is little humor in its endless pages. The Lynley-Havers novels are now being featured on PBS's\\"Mystery\\" series and George's readership is vast.The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong!!!!!!!!I am currently reding a Dickens three decker called \\"Bleak House\\" but dear Boz could hold your interest with his characters and intricate plotting. George cannot!George is an American who writes like a Brit but she needs to learn to edit or have someone edit her books! There are countless pages dealing with the inner politics going on atScotland Yards. Much could have been improved with concisenessin writing. One doesn't want to spend this much time on a detective \\"thriller.\\" Many pages are flat, dull and the readerlongs to find out what will happen so the hefty volume can beplaced on the heaving shelf!I have read every Elizabeth George novel and consider her a fine writer but she does need to add more action, more humor and fewer characters if her next book is to do better.So-So George!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is the last book written by George that I will buy. I bought, read and enjoyed all her earlier titles. Her choice for whom to kill off and the effects on Lynley and Havers indicate to me that she is trying to end/kill off the series. Otherwise, why would she make such a cruel decision? Her rightful choices as a writer for this title prompt me to use my rightful choice as reader to write her off."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"In this, her thirteenth novel, George returns Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his erstwhile partner Barbara Havers. In addition to murder, the author also raises some profound and troubling issues which the characters must confront. Thus, we not only have vintage Elizabeth George but a writer at the top of her game.Four adolescent boys have been murdered. Three of them were of mixed parentage, and the third is white. His body is found atop a tomb, obviously a ritualistic killing. Somehow the slaying of four youth are connected, but how?Rumors abound that New Scotland Yard has racist tendencies due to its apparent inability to solve the first three murders. Thus, the case is given to Lynley and his cohorts, all of whom are dealing with personal troubles. As always, this author excels in character depictions, and painting background scenes whether seedy or exclusive.All know that a psychopath is on the loose, but finding him is quite another matter as both Lynley and Havers are distracted by issues of their own and turmoil among the police.As is her wont, George doesn't miss a beat in pacing a story that throbs with excitement, suspense and a spectacular denouement.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"What a talented writer! My book club originally turned me on to this series. I have gone back and read some of the older ones and now this new one.Kept me guessing and trying to figure it all out. A very good mystery (although a bit gruesome).

Why spoil things for other people too if you did not like the book?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"As with most readers, I have favorite authors that I count on for delivering a consistent reading experience. An Elizabeth George book is an automatic buy because I expect to find her usual exquisite writing, tight plotting, and realistic dialogue that reflect her fine ear for word choice and flow.And so I began her latest with no more concern than whether I should return my lucky first edition, which was scratched during shipment, for a more perfect book that would not be a first edition; and a concern that I might not enjoy the book with the television series' views of the characters replacing my imagination's picturing. The TV images of Lynley and Havers were adequate, I thought, but Helen was a disaster; and there was such a hole where Deborah and St. James should have been.As I read, I found that the detailing and tracking of the serial killer were satisfactorily handled and Nkata was becoming clearer as a better person. The plot was threatening to dissolve into typical racial PC, but was being saved by George's way with detail and phrasing. It looked as if the book were headed for a 4-star rating, but I had survived the too, too sophistication of the Deborah-Lynley-St.James relationships and the shilly-shallying over Helen, and...WHAM BAM!I sat still for a long time holding the book when I finished.THANK YOU, MA'AM, for reminding me of the power of a great writer. Oh, yes, I'll keep the first edition. P.S.: I can't do without Havers."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I didn't find the length of this book a problem. If a book is good--the longer the better I always say! I'm not a fan of dark mysteries, but read the first Lynley book years ago and was charmed enough by the characters to read all the books as they were published. I was not disappointed by this book, in fact, I think it's one of the best Lynley books.I've always found Helen to be a weak and dull character from another century. If there are to be future books in this series I will be interested to see if Inspector Lynley disappears and Barbara's and Nkata's characters become the focus. How Barbara will manage without Lynley's protection will be interesting to see. As much as I like her I find her bullheadedness and jumping to conclusions very annoying sometimes.All in all a terrific book. I hope there are sequels."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"If someone had described this plot of this book to me in advance, I would have been lukewarm about reading it (but still would have since I can't miss any Lynley/Havers novels). This may be my favorite Lynley novel to date, despite the darkness. I really enjoyed the focus on the human side of the characters. Can't wait to see what happens next."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've read all of the Lynley/Havers novels and this one isn't the best of the bunch but it's much better than the last two - mainly because my favorite character (Barbara Havers) is featured prominently. Lynley is a little too perfect to relate to but Barbara is wonderfully flawed and totally believable. This one is a bit too long and some plot elements are hard to believe but other than that, it's well written (as are the others) and has a nice suspenseful mystery (not to mention a completely unexpected ending). My two favorites are \\"In the Presence of the Enemy\\" and \\"Deception on his Mind.\\""},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have been a fan of George for years, and was hugely disappointed when reading \\"With no one as witness\\". The whole serial killer thing (code name for Self, symbolism, thinking of Himself with capital letters, profiling etc) have been done god knows how many times before - and so much better! It was just plain embarrassing to read Georges description of Fu's mind.The plot was not very believable either. Serial killers, copy cats AND random killings, and an incredibly boring and illogical investigaton.The main characters seemed a bit... out of character (shallow, boring, depressing) and the rest of the staff, like miss Ulrika - well, I just didn't care, whereas normally, I find one of Georges strenghts that she makes you curious about the involved persons. You care about them, even when they are suspects."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Having gobbled up every Inspector Lynley mystery since I was introduced to them last year, I awaited Elizabeth George's new book eagerly. Little did I know it would pack such an emotional wallop! I second the remarks of a previous reviewer who thanked George for having the \\"courage\\" to throw her readers a mighty curve ball. She's certainly shaken things up. Where our beloved Lynley, Havers, and the other characters go from here is anyone's guess. What better way to breath new life into a mystery series? No one who is a fan of these stories should miss reading this one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George is an asteroid. She appeared in the crime-novel firmament, with complex plots, interesting characters and a great dynamic between her detective duo, Lynley and Havers. All too soon, her efforts have plummeted to earth, leaving a foul-smelling crater. After subjecting us to an entire novel about the excruciatingly-annoying Deborah, she now serves up an overlong bag of wind featuring paper-thin characters, ludicrous plot twists and a stale serial-killer motif. After slogging through the first 500 pages, bored, I was rewarded by stupefying gyrations of plot that reminded me more of John Irving, one of my least favorite writers, than of the solid crime novelists I generally patronize. Warning: I'm about to give away part of the (stupid) plot. Making the Yard's psychological profiler a pedophile killer, who randomly imitated the serial killer, was pathetic. As was randomly killing Helen and her unborn fetus -- in a GANG SHOOTING in Lynley's ritzy London neighborhood? Oh, please.Judging from the back cover of the book, Ms. George has spent considerable money eliminating all signs of humanity from her face. I'm afraid the plastic surgeons slipped and cut out her muse, as well."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I appreciate Ms. Plummer's book review, because the purpose of these customer reviews on Amazon is to help people decide whether they want to buy a book or not.I was glad to learn before buying the book about the death she mentions. I have been reading the books mainly because I'm interested in the evolution of their love story, and her review definitely helped me decide not to buy the book.I think that in this particular case revealing the ending is justified. I noticed in reading the reviews that several other people also said that they would have appreciated a heads-up about the end of the book. When a book features gratuitous violence and desolation or the death of a favorite character, like this book does, I think it's useful for it to be signalled, much like they signal PG 13 etc. on movies. I think that it's particularly important to send up a flag when this is not the kind of book you expect from the author.When people are warned in advance, they can make an informed decision about whether they want to spend time and money on that kind of fiction. And that, after all, is the point of these reader reviews."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"If you are trying to get around London, this is your book. Take out all the directions from place to place, and this isa good book. I can't understand why her editors allow this.What is wrong with saying that Lynley got into his Bentley and drove north through the streets of London? Who cares where he turned left and what one way alleys he had to go through? Thesestreet directions add nothing to the novel, and make one feel that the author is trying to counter some long ago criticism she received for having some street names wrong!! Very distracting!!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"When the naked body of a dead young boy is found mutilated and artfully arranged on top of a tomb, it opens up a whole can of worms for the Metropolitan Police Force of London, for it turns out that this is just the latest in a string of similar murders. The thing is that the previous victims had been either black or of mixed race and had been written off as gang related killings. This latest victim, however, is white and is inviting a whole lot of interest. Hoping to contain the accusations of racism and callousness, AC Hillier appoints acting Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley to the case, assigning him newly promoted Detective Winston Nkata (window dressing in Hiller's mind for the public as Nkata is off Jamaican background) and allowing Lynley to keep fiery Detective Constable Barbara Havers on the team. Everyone quickly realises that they have a serial killer on their hands; and as they race to discover how many prior victims there were and identify them, and to try to establish a pattern of sorts that would give them a clue as to the killer's modus operandi, Lynley also has to contend with Hiller's need to direct the investigation and his desire that Lynley and his team cooperate with the newspapers. As the killings continue to mount, and as the police officers race to get a result, things take an unexpected and explosive turn, one that perhaps neither Lynley nor Havers will ever recover from..With \\"With No One as Witness\\" Elizabeth George is once again in top form. I was terribly disappointed with \\"A Place of Hiding,\\" and began to wonder if the Lynely-Havers mysteries would ever go back to becoming the compelling, dark reads that they once were. But this new Lynely-Havers installment reminded me of the old days, where I would devour each new installment in one go, relishing how both Lynely and Havers, using different points of reference would complement each other in order to solve the mystery at hand. Well crafted, and obviously meticulously researched (for example how the author effortlessly fleshes out the many grueling aspects of how a police investigation is conducted was truly awe-inspiring), this was definitely a labour of love. There was only one small detraction to \\"With No One as Witness\\" and that it was that the first half the novel was rather slow and heavy going. Fortunately Elizabeth George intersperses the slow moving initial police investigation with the chapters in which we are privy to the serial killers thoughts and movements. Chillingly and suspensefully describing how he stalks his young victims, and how he captures them (will the killer grab his victim without any problems, or will the victim escape at the last possible moment?), Ms George ably and competently conveys that \\"edge-of-your-seat\\" feeling. Also well done was the manner in which she conveys just how stressed out acting Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley is becoming as he faces pressure from his superior (AC Hiller) to get a result quickly and to do things his way. As I noted before the pace does pick up about halfway through, and that coupled with the small plot twist should keep any mystery reader happily engrossed to the very end. And while some readers may be dismayed at the shocking turn the book takes, this only added to the pathos and promise of even darker installments to follow. All in all, \\"With No One as Witness\\" was an absorbing and compelling read that should not be missed."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Reading this novel reminds me of how I felt watching Michael Jordan play baseball. I respected the emotions that were driving him, and he did an OK job at it, but I just wanted him to get it out of his system already and go back to basketball, which he played like no one else on earth. Like an angel.In With No One as Witness, Elizabeth George inflicts on us her restlessness with the world she so brilliantly created over the past 17 years. Instead of her gorgeously-plotted and intimate tales of normal people driven to murder, she strikes out into the territory of serial killers. It's a mistake.In the past, she's developed villains who linger in our memory for the richness of their characters and the awful logic that drives them to commit murder. But for the grace of God, any of us might be Robin Payne (In the Presence of the Enemy) or Sarah Gordon (For the Sake of Elena).In this book, she provides a serial killer, whose character verges on a parody of serial killers; a host of secondary characters who's motives are perplexing; and an inattention to versimilitude that is highly annoying and most unlike George. Oh, and she also stuffs the book with weighty themes including racism, child pornography, and the evils of tabliod journalism.But my real beef with this novel isn't that she branches off into an area that she handles less well: any author of a long-running series is bound to run out of ideas sometimes. And there's a long and honorable tradition of authors of one genre flexing their creative muscles in another area \\" think of beloved crime writer P.D. James and her foray into science fiction (The Children of Men). But P.D. James was smart: when she wanted to branch out, she let her main series take a rest and created a whole different cast of characters for her attempt at science fiction.My real beef is that, unlike James, George is trying her hand at serial killing within the context of her long-running series, and the real victim seems to be the series itself. In the last chapters she kills off an essential character (but not by the serial killer) in a way that is so implausible that I'm left feeling that she wrote this book on a Bad Plot Day.If you want to read about serial killers, find an author who's better at portraying this kind of evil. If you want to keep reading about the continuing growth of Tommy, Helen, Simon, Deborah, and Barbara, cross your fingers that this was just an unfortunate experiment for this formerly fine author.Come back, Elizabeth. We love you."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Books in the 'Inspector Lyley' series have been a source of reading pleasure since I happened on one by accident, enjoyed it so much that I have searched out and bought a copy of each of the books in the series, and have read each of them several times over. For me, the characters in the series lend as much as do the plots of each of them. I liked that in some of them, Barbara was featured and in others, Simon and Deborah; we also became more acquainted with the facets of Helen. The plots were excellent and well-crafted.Therefore, I was so looking forward to WNOAW that I pre-ordered a copy of the publishers. I wish that I had waited. The day my copy arrived, March 15 as scheduled, was the day that I read a review; of course, it would be one with 'spoilers'. It is a good mystery, which certainly took a lot of time, thought and effort.However, the book as a whole is not cohesive. There are so many things going on in so many directions with so many plots, sub-plots, 'red herrings' that it was slow going to read. And, then the 'tragedy' -- it almost seemed that the author had so many words that had to be used and she came up with this as a solution. It has only a slight connection to some issues.However, I think there surely had to be another, better solution if she wanted the series to go in another direction!!!I would have rated the book as a 5, but must give it a 3, for the, to me, outrageous way of the tragedy."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I was beyond thrilled when Elizabeth George's newest hit the racks. I consumed the others in the series. Her latest is fast-paced and very interesting. But after a surprising and unwelcome plot-twist 3/4 of the way through, I really had a hard time finishing it. Overall, it was depressing. Who wants to see your heroes bleeding thru the last page?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have read all of Elizabeth George's mysteries and one book of her short stories. When I first discovered her, I was delighted to find that she is still relatively young and likely has many long years of writing ahead. It was like learning that my favorite foods would be on the table for the rest of my life.What I liked especially about the first book of hers was that it was complex and messy. There were details of the lives of everyone involved that were not necessarily related in any way to the detection of a murderer. And even the murder investigation itself did not end neatly, with everything wrapped up. We know from real life that this is more often how it is than not. In each subsequent book the complexities build and expand, sometimes with exquisite slowness.The mysteries develop her main characters, Scotland Yard detectives Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers, as well as their coworkers, friends, and the main suspects. Through the span of George's books, Lynley and Havers have grown and changed. The changes in each book are significant, and in this one perhaps most of all.George lives in two worlds: Huntington Beach, California and London, England. She is an American Anglophile. Her mysteries are set in London, and it appears that she spends every waking minute there soaking it up. Every page she writes is saturated with references purely English, including spelling, customs, food, buildings and places, and especially English slang. To my mind, she tries too hard. On the other hand, P.D. James, an English mystery writer whose characters also frequent London, doesn't feel called upon to demonstrate her familiarity with England on page after page, which is clearly the privilege of having been born to it. If I hadn't known that George is not English I think I would still have suspected it. One advantage of George's insistence on accuracy in her portrayal of London is that she presents the city to us on a platter, and it isn't hard to enjoy every piece on it.And finally I come down to it, to this particular book. Those who are George fans don't need anyone telling them to buy this book. Those who have not read any others might. Thus I say, yes, buy it. It's a lot of book at the price, and it will absorb you as few others can.In this hefty novel we find Thomas Lynley and his new wife, Helen, expecting a baby. And we find the recently-demoted socially-inept Barbara Havers (see previous books for the cause) coping with her new status and with her fondness for her next-door neighbors. Acting Superintendent Lynley (because his chief, Superintendent Webberly, is recovering from a murder attempt - again see previous novels in the series) is forced to work directly under the politically motivated Assistant Commissioner Hillier while leading a team of thirty-plus investigators in solving a series of murders of young adolescent boys. The strains of having Hillier trample on his authority, forcing Lynley to take on an \\"embedded journalist\\", among other insults, wear deeply upon Lynley, eating away bit by bit at his original motivation for joining Scotland Yard.What happens to Lynley during the course of this book alters him forever. What happens to Havers may seem like less but ultimately may mean even more to her future. I wait impatiently for the next..."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have read every one of Elizabeth George's Lynley series, so it was with anticipation that I sat down to read her latest. Before I had read many pages, I found myself getting bored. By the time I was halfway through the book, I gave up on it and read the last 40-50 pages, which are harrowing but, to me, a disappointment. I felt that killing off a major character -- or two characters, as the case was -- is a quick and dirty way of keeping the series going. Come on -- how often does something like that happen in real life? The thing I have liked about George's previous novels is that they had a ring of truth -- that this is the way life really is. Now that she's joined the serial killer bandwagon like almost every other mystery writer, I think she has lost her unique voice. The jury's still out on whether I will read her next book."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I really did LOVE this series- bought them in hardcover, which I never do for other books. I thought the last one was weak, but I was even more extremely disappointed with this one. Part of what made George fabulous was the insight into all her characters- the detectives, the victims, the killers. She was great at creating the little details, the shades of gray, of helping us understand how these people got to where they were. Not anymore. Now we have random killings, no understanding of the killer, no insight into our beloved friends and their situations. Is she inflicting agony on the characters (and us) because she's running out of plots? Has she forgotten how to build a good plot? I'm not sure why this series has changed, but I do know it's not worth it anymore."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"While I enjoy reading Ms. George's books, at times I've lost patience with the seemingly endless existential angst of the main characters. Constant ruminations on the emotional aspect of St. James' disability, Helen and Lynley's boringly circuitous path to marriage, the reader's forced participation in the minutiae of Deborah's constant ruminations on her infertility.............only Barbara Haver's coping with life and loneliness in her inimitable but realistic way saves us from disliking the other characters who cope so elegantly with their problems. Has anyone else noticed that Havers is the only one who is authentically unattractive?With that said, this armchair quarterback always enjoys the deft writing of Elizabeth George. Her books are great sit-down- and-procrastinate-everything-else reads. Even though she sometimes drags, I'm willing to read those passages in order to enjoy the rest of the book.I did enjoy this book. I think it was much better than last year's. I don't like the serial killer idea, as someone else has pointed out. I tend to think that writers get lazy when they exploit things like crazy religious nuts or serial killers. I've always thought that one of the main characters was a two-dimensional character and the tragedy in the book didn't affect me as much as Haver's tears at the end. Therefore, I hope we don't have two or three more books in which a different main character grapples endlessly with another round of angst/anquish. I hope Ms. George moves on in an efficient but interesting way."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"The epitaph for this book (\\"Look into the abyss and it will look into you\\") sets the tone for this sprawling, nihilistic and deeply disappointing novel.Readers loyal to George for her precisely plotted tales of ordinary people caught in situations where murder is the only option will be disappointed by her foray into the world of serial killing. The killer - comically named Fu - doesn't ring true as a psychopath. And while George nicely captures the terrible stress that Lynley and crew are under while trying to catch him, her portrayal of Lynley's nasty boss Hillier is unconvincing. And this, from the writer who used to be one of the very best portrayers of psychological depth in her characters. In books such as Missing Joseph, for example, we come to really understand why Juliet Spence becomes a murderer. That's what gave the richness and staying power to George's earlier works. In With No One as Witness, we just don't get why people are acting the way they do. And we don't even care.I'm a reader who adored George for the ongoing story of her quintet of core characters - Tommy, Helen, Barabara, Simon, and Deborah. In Witness, George turns on them with a destructive frenzy that will surely stand as one of the most ill-considered plot evolutions of modern fiction. She kills off a character essential to the balance of her series in the most pointless, tear-jerking, and bleak manner imaginable. At the end of the book I could only throw my hands into the air and wonder what on earth George was thinking of.I only hope that in the whole body of George's work, Witness turns out to be an unfortunate detour. I hope that she's now exorcised whatever demons drove her to write this utterly bleak novel, and that she will find her center again in the Lynley novels-with all her essential characters alive and growing.The only thing that makes me happy about this book is that it was passed on to me by a disgusted seat mate on a long-distance flight. I'm glad I didn't have to buy it and risk her publisher misinterpreting my purchase as a sign of approval."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Others have summed up the plot in their reviews, so I will leave the details to them. Overall, I did not find this an enjoyable book.For myself, I didn't enjoy the constant troubles between Lynley and Hillier. I wanted more of a true mystery novel that focused on the facts of the case with less of the distractions EG added to this story. I had no problem with the basics of the serial killer plot or the search for the killer. But, the concentration of the book should have been more on the main storyline. Of course, some personal asides and personalities are necessary, but there was too much here.I was truly disgusted by the finale of the story regarding Helen. How totally unnecessary and what a terrible thing to inflict on the readers. If Elizabeth George did not want to write any futher Lynley/Havers books, there were much better, kinder, sensible ways to stop doing so than to end this book as she did. I sincerely hope that there are no Lynley stories after this one. I do not care to read about his state of mind any further. This current book was bad enough.Some reviews mention that EG was very brave and courageous to write the ending she did. I disagree. I feel it was a real slap in the face to her readers and was a totally unnecessary painful thing to inflict on us. I thought she went overboard writing about Deborah's miscarriages in past books. It was an area that did not have a lot of impact on the stories. She did write in past books about Lynley's pursuit of Helen and her initial reluctance to marry him. Finally that was taken care of and the novels went on. To end it like this is needlessly cruel to everyone."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"After a disappointingA Place of Hiding, Elizabeth George goes back to the basics, bringing back Havers and taking the series to the next level. George has always distinguished her novels by creating a product that is distinctly different from the typical police procedural. The differentiating factor is that she spends a considerable amount of time telling us about the personal lives of the characters. As a result, you will get much more enjoyment from reading this series in order, so if you are new to George's work, I recommend that you go back to the beginning:A Great Deliverance. For those that have been following this series, fasten your seat belts, because not only are you going to get a story with a devious serial killer that is hard to catch, but also on where there will be some important developments in the lives of the main characters.Four boys have been murdered, but it was not until recently that the police and the Scotland Yard realized that there is a serial killer out there. The situation can be best described as a public relations nightmare, since only the last victim is white, and there are likely to be some accusations about this, probably justified. The good news is that all of our beloved characters make an appearance in this novel, Lynley, Havers, St. James, Nkata and even Havers' neighbors and Nkata's object of desire.I liked the way in which George provides the story with several layers, transforming it in a mesmerizing read. For example, the pressure by the press on the Scotland Yard generates serious problems between Superintendent Lynley and his superior. There is also the issue of the previous demotion of Havers and now the promotion of one of her friends, trying to assuage the fire of public opinion. The relationship between Havers and Azhar, Nkata and his romantic pursue of Yasmine, and Lynley and Helen's soon-to-be-born son are other important storylines.The writing is superb, and that is the only reason why George can write a 700+ page novel without us losing interest at any point. One of the things I enjoyed the most was the omniscient narrator that allowed us a look into the killer's mind, allowing for a better understanding of his motives. Finally, there is the big surprise towards the end, which some people may not like, but I think that sometimes it is necessary to shake things up a little. Ultimately, this is one of the best books in the series, and I am already looking forward to what comes next."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have never written a book review before but feel compelled to warn potential readers -- especially those familiar with earlier books by Elizabeth George -- how disapointing this book is. First of all, her serial killer plot is weak, weak, weak. She never convincingly describes the killer's motivations, or makes him truly scary. (If you want serial killers, go to Ruth Rendall or thomas Harris for a real thrill.) Second, her killing off of Helen was a bad decision that will, in my opinion, permanently weaken -- or kill off -- the series. The contrast she set up between the growing love of the Lynley couple provided an absolutely necessary counterweight to the darkness of her plots. How odd that she didn't understand that. And what a cop-out to have Helen killed by some random person. I'd have given this book 0 stars if possible, and I'll never spend money on a George novel again."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"As another reviewer noted, this book is too long by at least 200 pages, but most loyal readers wouldn't mind that.What loyal readers will mind is that the author deals with a major supporting character in an unexpected, cruel and random way that winds up being completely unjustified by the rest of the plot. I've read this series from the beginning, but I won't be reading the next one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"The Inspector Lynley series is one of my favorites and in this particular novel author Elizabeth George makes a major turn in direction, giving us a plot that features a serial killer (not the usual George fare) and a 'simple twist of fate' that changes Lynley's life forever.There are other less dramatic, but important, shifts as well. Barbara Havers, Lynley's partner and one of my favorite female cop characters, appears to be coming out of her brittle shell, courtesy of a little Muslim girl who lives next door. This is a big deal for Havers, who keeps to herself and often alienates others with her outspoken and impatient behavior.It remains to be seen how these big alterations in story trajectory will impact future novels, which is why I am awarding this book four stars instead of my usual five for a Lynley novel. I am reading this series in the order it was written, so I don't yet know how this all turns out, even though the follow up novel to this one has already been published.One of the features of this series that I am especially attracted to is its backdrop of English class consciousness that George deftly weaves throughout the story. Everything these characters do is influenced by the traditional English class system, with Lynley's inherited, aristocratic title (he's an earl) providing a trigger for social commentary. As an American, I never really appreciated the oppressiveness of rigid categories of social class that are incredibly durable, even in a modern democratic state such as the UK. It's easy to gloss over these differences or even to romanticize the ladies and lords of high society when your own experience in the US is far removed from the feelings of inferiority that a class system perpetuates. I very much like the fact that George exposes them and raises questions about merit versus entitlement in a nation that purports to value social justice.This is not to imply that the US and other western democracies are superior to the UK in terms of entitlement or equity. We have our own aristocracy, after all, and in some ways they are less deserving than the blue bloods of Britain. Why should the privileges accorded to NBA players, business tycoons of questionable ethics or the stars of romantic comedies be considered any less odious than those bestowed at birth to the British upper class?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is a hefty tome, but I got through it pretty quick. A much better read, I thought, than \\"For the Sake of Elena,\\" the one other novel by Elizabeth George I have read so far. I prefer \\"cozy\\" British mysteries, in general, but \\"With No One is Witness\\" did not get too grisly for my taste.The denouement for the personal side of the story did threaten to overshadow the serial murder theme, and I have to say my favorite parts in the whole book involved Havers, and not really the mystery side so much. Her relationship with her ethnic neighbors, especially the daughter, was very believable. Another issue I had was with the dialect, especially Nkata's, which proved distracting. I was raised in the UK since two years old, and Brits do not use the words \\"suss\\" and \\"twig\\" ALL THE TIME. Still giving it 4 stars because this writer has loads of talent and obviously did exhaustive research for this book."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Once again Elizabeth George has taken a crime story that has so many twists and turns that you almost forget what you are really reading is the lives of the five main characters and how they grow and change through time. George is able to explore the complex world of human relationships with care, compassion and realism. That we come to know the characters and may even miss them between books is certainly a sign that George writes about the human condition. Yes, the crime puzzle is excellent, but it would be just another worn out formula detective novel without the human relationships. What happens to Helen forced me to put the book down several times before I could pick it up again and yet I understood why this had to happen. Like Sheri Tepper, George takes a writing genre and forces us to look at ourselves and our humanity and ask the tough questions about both. Reading George's books with friends, particularly close friends, is a way to enhance the George experience even more -- but it's still pretty good alone. I look forward to the next George novel, as I always do."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is definately one of the best books E. George has written. Suspenseful and articulate. It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. This was one of the \\"I Couldn't Put It Down\\" books. Again, very interesting threads of different stories woven together, some of which left you wondering how they all fit ... or wonder if perhaps they simply were interesting, but wouldn't fit. Ultimately, it all ties together, like a good detective novel, and rather like some crime noir, it isn't always neat.It is appealing that the major characters seem human, with flaws that aren't just more stereotypes. Winston Nkata develops more depth, especially with the racially charged crime-story. And, again, both Lynley and Havers continue to flourish as well-considered and sympathetic characters.I wouldn't recommend starting to read George's work here. Yes, you can read and enjoy this without having read the rest of her opus, but I think you would enjoy it more, having read at least one or two others first."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Curious that Elizabeth George would consider herself unequal to the challenge of writing about a happy marriage. In earlier works, she fearlessly took on subjects, such as the Pakistani experience in the UK, that are manifestly much father away from what she knows; or, as in A Place of Hiding, took the highly risky approach of leaving her main character out of the story at all. Yet her courage failed her before the creative challenge of writing well about happiness, and she took the low road of simply killing off Lynley's wife. The result is a short-term storm of interest (the publicity around the plot was enormous) bought at the price of a permanent loss of the interest, the vital balance of light against darkness, that held the series together. With No One as Witness was depressing, disappointing, and perplexing; and the outlook forfuture books from this author is unappetizing."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I just completed \\"With No One As Witness\\" yesterday and have very mixed feelings about it. Meticulously written and detailed, it was very meaty and had a lot of interesting twists and turns. From reading multiple reviews, it seems that a lot of people have a difficult time maintaining interest if a bookis more than a couple of hundred pages. I'm very disappointed with those reviewers who seem to feel it is their privilege to reveal the ending. To spoil others' reading of a favorite author's latest offering is totally unacceptable no matter how you felt about it.It's going to be hard for me to forget this book. I may not be able to continue reading this series. However, Elizabeth George is a very effective writer, and I'm going to have to give her the benefit of the doubt. I just wish she had chosen a different means of moving her characters on in their complex lives."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've enjoyed the development of Elizabeth George's skills as a crime novelist--each of her books has been more complex and intricate than the last, both in the language she uses and the twists and turns of the plot. This entry was no different, although in contrast to many of her previous works, I picked out the killer early on.I won't go into details of the plot--suffice to say that for the first time, Lynley and Havers face a serial killer and must use all their resources to solve the case. Winston Nkata, a favourite character of mine, plays a prominent role, as does the issue of race and race relations in Britain.There is one thing that marrs this otherwise enthralling novel--the unnecessary death of a main character. Killing this character didn't move me, it annoyed me. It felt like a stunt and left me cold for the rest of the novel. She didn't need to do it, it was cruel and frankly mean to both the other characters (yes, they're made up, we all know that!) and the reader who has been following this 'family' of characters for so many years.My first guess was that she wanted to end the series; frankly, there isn't really anywhere to go with it after this entry."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George's latest novel, \\"With No One as Witness,\\" features two of my favorite characters in British police procedurals, Detective Inspector Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Lynley and Barbara Havers. Lynley and Havers were partners in earlier books, but Havers has been demoted to Detective Constable and Tommy, who is Acting Superintendent at New Scotland Yard, is now her boss. Lynley and Havers are, on the surface, polar opposites. Tommy is charming, handsome, wealthy, and aristocratic. Although she is a kind and caring person, Barbara comes across as crude, stubborn, and tactless. She chain smokes, dresses in a slovenly manner, and drives an old rattletrap that threatens to break down constantly. However, Barbara and Tommy are alike in one important area. They are both dedicated professionals who care passionately about bringing criminals to justice.This time around, Barbara and Tommy have their work cut out for them. A cunning psychopath has been murdering and mutilating adolescent boys, and there are no witnesses and little evidence to help the police with their inquiries. Lynley is in charge of the investigation, and he has a hard time reining in Barbara Havers. She has an unerring instinct for the chase, and she would much rather go off on her own than follow orders. Worse than Barbara's independent streak is the behavior of Tommy's boss, Assistant Commissioner Hillier. The AC is so sensitive to outside pressure that he sacrifices the integrity of the investigation to gain political points and favorable media coverage. Tommy would gladly throttle Hillier if he could.Elizabeth George's strength is in her characters, particularly Lynley and Havers. George skillfully describes the agonizing lot of homicide detectives, who are under constant stress. They are exposed to the most horrifying aspects of humanity, and the grisly crime scenes that they observe are nightmare-inducing. To make matters worse, the public and the media expect the police to solve high-profile cases quickly. However, as George ably demonstrates, not all cases lend themselves to easy solutions. A detective's job is often tedious, time-consuming, and extremely frustrating. Every lead, no matter how small, must be investigated, and most turn out to be of little or no value. In this lengthy book, Havers and her colleagues put in countless hours examining every clue and interviewing dozens of people, many more than once.George does a fine job of humanizing her detectives and giving us insight into their private lives. Tommy's blissful marriage to Helen is marred by a minor family disagreement. Barbara's involvement with her neighbors, the exuberant and irrepressible eight-year-old Hadiyyah Azhar and her father, Taymullah, bring her both satisfaction and grief. Winston Nkata, who has been promoted to Detective Sergeant because of racial reasons, is angry to be paraded before the public as a token black detective. George effectively shows how a job in law enforcement sometimes damages or destroys personal relationships.The author is less successful in her depiction of a serial killer who is straight out of central casting. He is a ritualistic psychopath who was abused as a child and hears voices in his head berating him as worthless. This plot has been used too many times before. Another flaw is the over-the-top ending that is marred by several far-fetched developments. Still, I admire George's handling of an extremely complex and multi-faceted police investigation, and I always enjoy spending time with Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"What has gone wrong with Elizabeth George? For years, she delivered one stunning novel after another. From A Great Deliverance through Playing for the Ashes, each was characterized by brilliant plotting, rich atmosphere, deep psychological development, and, most especially, an engrossing evolution of her core characters.Then, starting a few books ago, George seemed to become lost in her vision of herself as an artist. Recent interviews hinted at her great admiration for John Fowler, and his capacity to \\"never write the same kind of novel twice.\\" She began setting more and more extreme goals for herself, such as writing about the Pakistani experience in the UK, or writing two novels within one. She seems to have lost sight of what's appealing about her work -- though she hasn't lost her focus on her career (which in the acknowledgements of Witness, she refers to, obnoxiously, in capital letters, as in \\"Thanks to [my literary agent] the man behind the Career\\").The result of this unhappy evolution is With No One as Witness , as deeply disappointing mystery novel as I've ever read. The book, which seems to be about a serial killer - or is it about random violence? It's hard to tell, finally -- has a confusing and overly-complex plot, and is completely thrown off balance by the murder of Helen Clyde, which murder has no relation to the rest of the book. A minor but inexplicable irritant is its huge number of proofreading and factual errors.This former high school English teacher should either honestly abandon the mystery genre, which she seems to find too confining, and consacrete herself to \\"loftier\\" novels, or reconnect with the vision that brought her success in her earlier career."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George is second to none as a writer. This is a beautifully-written and moving mystery. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I love Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley series but I often feel her books are longer than necessary. Occasionally characters are added but there is no follow through & I end up wondering why they were introduced at all - this book was not guilty of that crime. I actually read 'What Came Before He Shot Her' before 'With No One As Witness'(not purposely). However, I'm glad I did. I don't believe I could have survived her absolutely senseless death otherwise (senseless regarding who shot her not that George killed this character). Helen has always been my favorite character - she rounded out Tommy perfectly.The last few chapters were beautifully written (I thought some of George's best). She did a wonderful job pulling in the family members and subtly reminding us of their history(anyone who hasn't read other Lynley novels will not have this connection so PLEASE start the series from the beginning). I had to remind myself a few hours after I finished this book that Lynley & Havers are fictional characters and they weren't off somewhere in deep depression (although Barbara was receiving comfort, FINALLY!!!)- a sure sign of an excellent series.Two more items: 1)Is poor Denton going to fly back from his wonderful vacation in NY to find out about Helen??? Someone should have called him! 2) If only Helen had parked the Bentley and Deborah had been on the doorstep. Not sure I would have shed many tears there - she's awfully boring."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have just finished one of the best mysteries I've read. Ever. It took me almost all of February, granted, but as I closed the cover twenty minutes ago I felt as much satisfaction as having finished a quintessential slice of chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and a bit of raspberry sorbet on the side: perfection.The book is swirling around in my brain with these threads teasing out:the plot is intricately woven with no possibility of guessing the outcome before its arrival...the characters are perfectly drawn: from their physical appearance to their emotional upheavals, I feel as if I've met them and understand them...the phrasing, the vocabulary, makes me rest completely in the author's care. No word is out of place, or unnecessarily implanted; no word makes me gag at its awkwardness within the sentence...the setting is so accurate, so well drawn, I'm amazed that Elizabeth is from Ohio and not London itself."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is an excellent entry in the Inspector Lynley series, full of interesting and surprising twists, with a gripping story. Ms. George, as usual, deals with very deep currents of human psychology and is quite thoughtful about the society she depicts. The book, however, it is a bit verbose for this reader's taste, which is why it garners only four starts. But then, again, sometimes there is nothing better than sitting down with a long book one knows one will enjoy."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Gripping plot, superbly written, convincing character development.Lynley and Havers of New Scotland Yard have been my favorite crime solving team since the beginning. I was happy to see that they're back together, and that Lynley has gotten his head back in the game and out of wedded bliss and the angst of private life. Although I enjoy learning about the characters' backgrounds, and thus making them more likable and realistic, George may take this a tad too far in my mind.Office politics and the recuperation from previous accidents nearly obliterate the serial murder investigation of young London boys. As always, everyone is a suspect, and George holds nothing back in describing the degenerate side of London, and leaves the reader gaping at the conclusion."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is Elizabeth George's most compelling story yet.I've read all of George's Lynley-Havers mysteries.

BUT.The real story is about Lynley and his partner, Havers, and their relationships with others. \\"What came before he shot her\\" must be included in this discussion. Unfortunately, I read the latter first, which made \\"with no one as witness\\" all the more painful (and \\"what came before he shot her\\" is a tour de force, depressing - yes, but extremely compelling story that proves Ms. George is a Novelist in the best sense of the word.).No matter what Ms. George decides to do with this series in the future, I'll be there.

This latest Lynley/Havers is no exception. And like most of the earlier books in this series, it has a VERY serious subtext. In the case of \\"With No One As Witness,\\" what lies beneath the detective work is the fully fleshed-out investigation of the plight of just-barely-adolescent boys from impoverished backgrounds, with parents (those who are in evidence at all) who are often detrimental; with all manner of adults preying on them; with banding together in gangs for self-preservation; not to forget, of course, the attempts (Colossus) to bring some order, some education to these blighted lives. As shocking as the end-of-the-book shooting is, it is all of a piece with the thesis of this novel, and it is certainly no surprise that George's follow-up book is a prequel to this horror, an investigation of the young killer.Very thought-provoking book, well crafted. A stunner."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"As you would expect from author Elizabeth George the characters are so well drawn that the reader can easily visualize each one.

It could take place anywhere not just in and around it's setting of the suburbs of London.Once again Ms.George captures the reader from page one. While the Inspecter Lynley series on PBS may have fleshed out the main/regular characters those of us who have been reading her books for years have their own ideas and she serves us well in With No One as Witness."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"\\"With No One as Witness\\" is one of the finest of Elizabeth George's Havers/Lynley series. It's long, of course, and written as if the reader had all the time in the world to let the book fall in her lap while she stares off into space, thinking about racial prejudice, cosmic injustices, poverty, social inequality, and sexual perversion. It meanders through the plot, pausing to look at perversions and personalities. It examines its heroes: an ill-kept and socially inept police-woman, a black man who fights to retain his dignity and self-respect, and Lynley--who in his desire to save them all, wrong-headedly jeopardizes his own life and that of the innocent people he loves. In the end, the reader must indeed reread the world's newspapers and evaluate the hysteria of the current Schiavo debates in the light of the shocking angst at the end of this novel. \\"With No One as Witness\\"? Indeed, we are all witnesses--this novel is a commentary on our world. I recommend it, and encourage readers to allow time for pondering its many insights."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"In this dark novel Elizabeth George explores emotional pain and demonstrates what happens when society allows some children to become \\"throwaways\\" - unparented, unloved kids with no real home but the streets.George gives her readers multiple plot lines, red herrings, and suspects in this tale of a vicious serial killer who targets juvenile delinquents. Descriptions of painstaking police work are interwoven with George's real interest - her characters' inner lives and their personal relationships. The protagonist, Detective Superintendent Lynley, is married to a perfect woman but works for a meddling, incompetent superior who hinders the investigation. Lynley's assistant Havers has no love life and suffers the torments of loneliness and emptiness. As for the murder victims, their acquaintances include a host of people who have either failed to protect them or actually exploited them. Any of these may be the killer whom the cops might catch if they can get past the politics of Scotland Yard.If the book has a flaw, it's in the way a shocking twist in the plot is resolved through a highly unlikely coincidence. This unsatisfying ending mars an otherwise entertaining read."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George is found of saying she writes literary mysteries, and she does, but this book, although very good, is not one of her best. For one, Michael Connelly had set the standard for a serial killer mystery with his phenomenal \\"The Poet\\", so the plot, at least too me, was a bit predictable. Also, the book is too long, and therefore tiresome in some parts. However, George excels in bringing her characters to life, and she had managed to surprise a jaded mystery reader.

But in this extremely disappointing (and enormous) latest novel her major characters are unrecognisable, the plot is confusing, the numerous red herrings are irritating and the d&eacute;nouement most unsatisfactory. The rather 'Harry Potterish' surprise death of a major character was actually a relief, given how irritatingly George had written the character in this book - something I had not felt in the earlier books. George made the character just too good to live and there was nowhere to go in future books - sadly, the death engendered no real emotion as a result. On the credit side, some of the minor characters were well done - the Benton family were super, almost Dickensian in the little descriptive touches, as were some of the characters in the markets, and I really liked Winnie's development. But the book was far too long. I ended up skimming the last third to get to the ultimately unsatisfactory ending. Why are so many books so VERY long nowadays - whatever happened to good editing? Big does not equal better - sharper characterisation and snappier plot development is much preferable."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"First off, let me say shame on you to the people who gave away the ending in their reviews. You are supposed to give your thoughts on the book which you can do without ruining it for everyone. I have read/enjoyed all of E. George's Havers/Lynley series but found her last few to be sub-par. Maybe it's because I never cared for Deborah's character and the last book was full of her. Like just about everyone else, I enjoy Barbara Havers the most. Her relationship with Lynley, both personal as well as professional, continues to be intriguing. This book includes more of her relationship with her neighbor Azhar and his daughter. Nkita's character becomes a major player and he is also very interesting. If the series continues, I would imagine these two will become the major players. Be warned, the author includes information on pedophiles that can be difficult to read. In all of Ms. George's books, she takes playful shots at the United States and it's inhabitants. Remember the American dentist with his brilliantly white teeth? In this book I thought her remarks weren't so playful and suggested an anti-American undercurrent. Maybe that's to be expected in these times. All in all, a very well written and thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"the horrible ending!!

It was the usual page-turner, can't put down novel."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"While Ms. George delivers an intriguing tale about a serial killer of young boys populated by our regular cast of characters of Lynley, Havers, Nkata, Simon and Deborah, she left this reader feeling betrayed when she killed off Lynley's wife Helen and their unborn child. Clearly this was an author manipulation to keep Lynley isolated and conflicted, but in the process, she's lost this long-time reader of the series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Spoilers:Although the book itself was terrific as always, and lot's of Barbara which works for me, the author's decision to kill off a main character at the very end is unforgivable... A character who was so very special.. Most readers I have talked to agree...We are the consumers and have some say...She wrote me and said: \\" I must be a good writer to have upset you so\\" Well that is true, but it is also selfish and arrogant to think that what your readers want is irrelevant...if you are a writer who is obviously writing for financial gain... I mean in terms of literature these books are far from it... Then she writes the next book ( by the way, it's not even a Lynley /Havers book, but sells it as such) with this wannabe Steinbeck flavor about the sorry sad life of the killer and how it was society that let him down... Bull.. If you want to write about social injustices, then don't be a serial detective writer.. killing off people who matter to your readers and then justifying it by acting like your some Tolstoy does not work for me... and I am not alone....Get back to reality George..We never asked for this.."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I finshished this book last night and felt emotionally drained. Goes to show what a good writer Ms. George is and how much one comes to care for her characters. But I didn't pick up the book to be laid low - just wanted another Elizabeth George detective novel with real characters and a great plot. My least favorite of the series (although I tend to skip the books that don't feature Barbara or Lynley prominently)."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George has done it again with a fabulous mystery. As usual, her characterizations are strong -- her likable characters have flaws just like all real people.

The character development was superb as was the development of the locale ambience. But this book is just the opposite: skimpy character development relying on cliches.

Ms. George is a genius! And this one, in addition, is a terribly sad one; although the crimes are solved and the matter reconciled, there is no happy resolution to the horrendous murders committed for no apparent reason, other than some sort of maniacal obsession. This gives the novel added depth, as it points out all too terribly well the senselessness of crimes of this nature. Highly recommended.On another note, I wonder if Ms. George got the name Thomas Lynley from the 18th-century English composer of that name."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George's Barbara Havers is wonderful as a sidekick to Inspector Lynley, but I loved seeing her take a starring role in this novel."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Having never read an Elizabeth George novel before & not being familiar with the characters I had no idea what to expect. The 627 pages seemed daunting especially for a mystery/suspense novel. How could it hold my interest to the end? Well, it did. The characters were so well developed with the right amount of baggage & foibles to make them interesting. I was further impressed with the fact that Ms. George is an American writing a mystery series set in London with British characters. Why she would put herself through such a headache to get the locations right not to mention the language, accents & all, is beyond me. Nevertheless, somehow she was able to be \`spot on' on all counts. Detailed with terrific twists & turns, kept me guessing right up until the end & I thoroughly enjoyed the ride."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"If you enjoy mystery books, Elizabeth George,writes a gripping mystery with twists and turns set in England.

While this is a long running series, this is my first book to read. While the book sometimes points toward events in the past, I did not feel I had missed essential points, but instead was encouraged to read the volumes which has come before. This book about a serial killer of adolescent boys has a great deal of grit to it and definitely is not a cozy. I think the closest comparison I can make as to others authors may be Louise Penny with a great deal more grit and nastiness in both language and subject matter. I find both of them to be excellent writers, however. And just as I enjoy Penny's forays into French phrases, I also enjoyed George's British phraseology. I found this to be a 4.5 star offering only because it starts a little slow."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Another great book by Elizabeth George.

The book provides an intellectual challenge, its 600 pages or more is a kaleidoscope of complicated themes and sub-themes crisscrossed with a rich narrative that keeps us on the edge of our seat while tracking the numerous players that pop in an out of the storyline.In this novel we follow the procedures that Scotland Yard Detectives employ on the trail of a serial killer who targets young boys in London and displays their bodies in a gruesome manner. Commissioner Hillier realises he has a serial killer when a fourth victim, a white teen, surfaces with similar wounds to three other non- white victims, he also realises he has to stay ahead of media hype and diffuse any accusations of racial preference by promoting officer Nkate a black man) to Detective Sergeant. The commissioner wants full control, puppets on a string style, Nkate handling the general public side and he is pressuring Lynley to work closely with a respected profiler and a in your face reporter. Thomas Lynley is at odds with these orders and the friction between them quickly builds' Where there is friction Barbara Havers' name always surfaces. She is still under scrutiny since her demotion but once more her style of working against the grain will bring success to the case.Meanwhile on another thread, on Lynley's home front a tragedy awaits that will alter his life for ever'..Although overall the storyline moves at a slow pace I was immediately engaged in this drama that is far darker, more sombre and definitely more tragic than any of the previous endeavours in Lynley's career. I can't wait to see what happens next, my library is a little behind in this series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George reunites Havers and Lynley with a recently promoted Winston Nkata to delve into multiple murders by a serial killer.

No stop, erudite entertainment at its best."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Author George really hits one out of the ballpark in this novel, quite possibly the best in the Lynley/Havers series. In addition to writing an enthralling mystery, George managed to make me care about these familiar characters in a whole new way. The book was deliciously long, and I couldn't wait to gobble up a few more pages every time I had a spare moment over the past two weeks: stoplights became a pleasure!

According to articles in the morning paper, many fans are terribly disappointed in this book because Ms. George kills off one of the major characters.One of the worst days of my life was when Patricia Cornwell (another author I have followed from the beginning) killed off one of the major characters in her Point of Origin. But I gave her another chance, continued with the next few books and voila - a miracle occurred - it was all a ruse.So, let's give the gal another chance -- don't abandon her wonderful plots and characters for this seeming betrayal of her public.

I know this can be a blessing and a curse to review readers.That said, I found the book absorbing...despite its length, I was hardly able to put it down. Ms. George paints the scene beautifully, and her characters are richly multidimensional, bringing the reader into their heads and hearts to see the world through their eyes. I found the plot to be nicely done, with lots of delicious twists. One of my problems with the book was understanding some of the Brittish slang used. I was surprised to find a bodice-ripper-style sex scene in a crime/mystery book, but it was not jarringly out of place in the plot. Finally, there was a large amount of Brittish-style cussing that would not be appropriate for younger readers. Actually, the whole theme of the serial killings and the side-crimes that are discovered along the way would not be suitable for young readers ... this is definitely a novel for adults."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have long been a fan of Elizabeth George and her Lynley and Havers mysteries. My sister got me started on this great series, and I in turn got my mother going on it. These books are truly wonderful, but this one is something else! We still have the finely drawn characters, and the stormy friendship that is between the two main characters. We also get to spend a lot of time with Barbara Havers, and this is a good thing! She has always been my favourite character - her with her bad clothes, chopped up hair and brilliant mind. We also have the wonderful great plot, and the exploration into the psychic mind of a serial killer that only Ms. George can do. But we also have a truly poignant, sad and shocking tale. The crimes in the book are sad - a number of adolescent boys are found dead and artfully placed around London. Lynley and his team have their work cut out for them trying to find this sick, but intelligent murderer. While searching throughout the streets, byroads and organizations in London, a totally devastating tragedy occurs to one of the team (I won't say who, so that those who read my review, will not have the story spoiled for them). Havers, Lynley and Nkata solve the case, but at what a cost! Will there now be more Lynley and Havers mysteries? After the ending in this book, it's hard to determine how Ms. George will continue. But continue she must! I cannot imagine life without a new Lynley-Havers mystery to look forward to."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I am a huge Elizabeth George fan and have read all of her Thomas Lynley/Barbara Havers novels. She is at the very top of her game in With No One as a Witness. I was thrilled to see the return of Havers and Lynley, as the lack of their apperance in her last novel, A Place of Hiding, was very disappointing. The book was a true mystery in every sense of the word and I had a difficult time putting it to rest! This work was intriguing and kept one's imagination flowing. It has many twists' and turns along the way. The major twist was the ending and I had a very difficult time telling myself \\"it's only a novel!\\" I can usually guess the ending, but I didn't have a clue as to the shocking end of her story. I suppose that is what makes her much a great writer!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I was astonished, as many other reviews seem to be.

I have been reading Elizabeth George's books ever since my mom introduced me to Playing for the Ashes years ago. Ever since then, I have read them all, and this book is my favorite so far.Out of all the books in the series, this one seems to be the most comprenhesive of her characters. Lynley is back, this time stepping in as temporary Superintendent. Havers is back ~~ demoted to constable, while Nakta Winston is promoted to Sergeant. This time, they're on the tail of a serial killer and at the same time, Lynley is dealing with Hillier, his boss, who wants to drag the media into the investigation. As the investigation heats up as more dead bodies turn up all over London, the heat on Scotland Yard becomes even more intense ~~ and this book is full of surprises and twists and turns.This time, the characters are portrayed more thoroughly than before. Lynley shows his private side more in this book ~~ where he is celebrating his marriage to Helen and their upcoming birth of their son. Havers is still the sarcastic person she always has been ~~ but you can see the sensitive person she tries to hide from the public throughout this book. Winston is more of a new character introduced in the last book ~~ and he shows his private thoughts throughout the book. There are other characters also involved with the investigation ~~ as well as the mind of the serial killer manifested throughout the book.Out of all the books in the Lynley series, this one is the most intense. This one builds up the suspension till its shocking conclusion ~~ and it has definitely taken me for a surprise. It was the last thing I ever expected to read ~~ but while shocking, it does make for good reading.While some of the reviewers complain about the grammarical errors in this book ~~ I didn't care. The storyline was enough for me to keep reading. The descriptions of the places were not drawn out ~~ I felt that it was designed to keep the reader's interest in the book and to keep pace with the build-up of the suspense. I just have to say, this is one of the best suspense novels I have read in quite a while now.If you are new to Elizabeth George's books, you may want to start wtih this one and if it intrigues you, then you can go back to start with the first one of the series. If you are an Elizabeth George's fan ~~ you will not be disappointed in this one. I know that I wasn't.4-3-05"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I love Elizabeth George's novels...all of them. I have never read one that I didn't love, and this one is no different. She kept me guessing all the way to the end. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the death of Helen Lynley. I have read every single one of the Lynley novels, so I have followed the story of these main characters and feel like I know them. I feel like I too lost something when Helen died, and I'm wondering what the future will hold for the other characters, especially Thomas. Or perhaps there won't be any more novels after the follow-up to this one. That would be truly be sad. All in all a great read."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've been an Elizabeth George fan for years, primarily because she creates real characters in believable situations. I've enjoyed some novels more than others but have found each of them interesting and George's writing always compelling. With this latest Lynley-Havers book, she has done herself proud. This is the best novel she's written.Some readers might not like the outcome of this book--some might be overjoyed, depending on whom you like--but the novel reflects the aspects of George's writing that I enjoy the most: the honest depiction of the randomness of life and the fact that the universe is not worried about playing fair. Like all of us, George's characters have to deal with events over which they have no control and suffer setbacks and tragedies that they don't deserve.The final scene in the novel is one of the most moving that she's ever written. The first chapter of a book makes you want to read the rest of the book; the last chapter makes you want to read the next book. I can't wait."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Well, I guess maybe she didn't really go anywhere but this matter, the serial killing of London's \\"youth at risk\\" certainly reminds me of the earlier George novels which, (this may seem to be a minority view) seemed a little less focused in recent years.One other point. As one reviewer pointed out, there are several reviews hereinafter that \\"give away\\" some of the discoveries that would stun us if we stumbled upon them in chronological INTENDED order in the text. They're spoilers. Like the earlier reader, this doesn't upset me so much in movies but it does irritate me in books. I know. Don't read the reviews. But still, who wants to know how it ends? So that's my general caveat.Anyhow, on many trips to London I have been struck that socially, there is some considerable difference between us and them or more specifically, between the UK and the US. It reminds me of flying over Europe and thinking how many different language are spoken over a few hundred miles, (although not so much now) different currencies, an imbalanced love or hatred for the United States, and like all the other countries, England and the U.K. generally is a foreign nation as well. I think that we forget that because the UK speaks OUR language (hidden joke here), they're just like us. I think the lyric \\"ain't necessarily so\\" fits.So the racism that Ms. George writes about may be old hat to us but from a social upheaval perspective, may be a little 'newer' to the Brits. This in no way infers that we are more advanced in our social turmoil. We've just seen some of these religion, race, gender, sexual preference issues, in some cases earlier. So when AC Hillier's (what a sod he is!) uses Winston to be a poster child for \\"see, no racism here, we're all good mates\\" you will, like Winston, find this particularly grating but by the same token, if you're reading this in America you will be familiar with it.The thing I like about the Lynley-Havers stories is how well Ms. George depicts those things, intolerance, racism, resentment, lust, greed, sloth . . . . blimey, it's like the wanker's in a sodden 12-step meetin'!This is a remarkable story of police work and the intricacies of the proceduural, the dead ends, the missed turns, and the tragedies within it all.Highly recommended for the George fans and good homicide detecting readers. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Being an avid fan of Elizabeth George, I do not look at the reviews of her books until I am finished with the book. I don't want anyone else's opinion to interfere with my enjoyment of her writing. It is very interesting to see the the diversity of opinions about WITH NO ONE AS WITNESS. Ms. George is an incredible writer. She weaves a complex plot, lives of the characters, and the essence of London into her stories. I feel as if I actually know her characters. Life is a crap shoot and this book tells it like it is. Maybe it is a little over the top for some people's taste, but being the victim of a crime in which a 12-year-old shot and killed a member of my family with a 22, I can vouch for the fact that is does happen. I recommend starting with the first book in the series. You will come to know and love and understand her characters. And look forward to the next one to come out!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Having read all Ms. George's mysteries, I must say that thislatest is the most powerful, the blackest, and the best one ofthe bunch!

I think she is not only one of the finest mystery authors out there but also one of the finest authors, period. This book is certainly no exception and while one of its plot twists was ruined for me by my reading a Time review of her novel after this one before reading this one, it really didn't lessen the impact. Whenever I read one of her books, I find myself devouring the pages ravenously, completely caught up in the world she has created. What I find so endlessly fascinating about her books is that she not only writes from the perspective of the detectives on the case--Havers, Havers, Havers, I can never get enough of your character!--she also writes from the perspective of the crime's perpetrator. Thus, she delves into the darkness and depravity of those who commit unspeakable crimes."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I started out thinking this book was too long and laborious (could have stood a bit less description of London districts and one or two fewer suspects) but ended up rationing myself for three days because I simply couldn't bear it to end.One of the highlights is a short love scene, very moving, yet without a single word that could offend anyone. But the piece de resistance is an extraordinarily wrenching physical and emotional crisis. I've never experienced such empathy with and sympathy for a character. It's still reverberating, 11 days later.Elizabeth George is an intelligent, thoughtful, educated writer; there are a few spelling and punctuation errors, but they can be laid at the doorstep of her editor or proofreader.At the end, she leaves us with another compelling mystery: How will she keep Inspector Lynley going in the next book?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"The \\"Inspector Lynley Mysteries\\" on video was my introduction to Elizabeth George. Usually the book is better than the movie it's based on, or in this case TV show, but the Lynley stories may be an exception. Having seen about a dozen episodes, most of them based on the novels, and now having read about a half dozen of the books, I find I like the videos better.With No One As Witness was the first George novel I read, and it is one of her best. It's an excellent mystery that keeps you going down the wrong path right up to the end. Unfortunately, I didn't really find the reason for the murders very plausible, but it's difficult to discuss that without giving away the ending. In any case, as with much series fiction, you don't care as much about the main plot as about what's going on with the regular characters.In fact, I find I'm becoming less and less interested in the aristocratic characters in this series and only want to know what's going on with Havers and her neighbors Azhar and Hadiyyah. Elizabeth George seems much too attached to Lynley and the St. Jameses. They have no faults at all, they are calm, polite, smart, and have unblemished skin, all of which makes them quite dull. Barbara Havers on the other hand, is full of quirks and faults and George seems not to like her very much. This makes Havers an entirely fascinating character and when she isn't in the scene, I skim very quickly to get to the next scene with her in it.Even though these novels tend to be rather long for mysteries, some 600+ pages each, the producers of the video series have pared most of them down to 90 minutes each without losing too much of the plot. The subplots that involve the major series characters have veered away from those of the books, which leaves plenty of surprises for those of us who are catching up with the written series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Once again, Elizabeth George has turned her back on the kind of mystery that made her reputation and produced a novel that is too long, overburdened by subplots, and curously riddled by factual errors. This time, she attempts a psychopathic serial killer novel, but falls far short of the level set by masters such as Ruth Rendell or James Patterson. The killer is neither creepy nor sympathetic, and is not even responsible for the most crucial death in the book. After three mediocre books, George seems unable to turn out another mystery like the early ones that were so highly acclaimed. It seems that this author, who fearlessly takes on subjects (such as the Pakistani experience in Britain) utterly removed from her realm of experience, was undone by the challenge of writing about a happily married Lynley."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I began reading the Lynley-Havers novels in a rather odd fashion: from the middle books backward to the first and then on to each new release from that point on. (The really great part about discovering an author that you love is that you don't have to sit around and wait for the \\"next\\" release!) Discovering the characters in that manner was interesting, as going in reverse allowed me to see just how far Ms. George had brought their personalities. The developement of the relationships, the intergration of their lives was fascinating. Sometimes it would seem to me that her characters weren't making much progress for themselves - then I would have to remind myself that I was reading the series backwards!Ms. George's lastest novel has me intrigued. I, too, was surprised at the road she chose to take with her players, but, I think we will be rewarded in the future with a richness in her novels to come as a result of her choice. It seems to me that the course of action she chose to take shows a tremendous amount of courage on the part of the author. Keepping all of her characters in tact would have been the easy way. Now, she must take them, and us, on a new journey. I can't wait for it to begin!At the end of it, I'm just glad that Havers didn't \\"take the bullet\\". I would really have hated to have lost her!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"In with No One as Witness, Elizabeth George sadly demonstrates that she doesn't have the talent to sustain a long serial novel. Long-running serials require the ability to move core characters forward in a measured and plausible way. Despite her deep talent as a writer, she has been unable to do this with her core characters. She has been unable to move the story line for Simon and Deborah beyond their inability to have children, or that of Barbara Havers beyond the chip on her shoulder and her sartorial carelessness. In Winston Nkata, she is presenting a weaker version of the Tommy Lynley character. And as for Tonny and Helen...her imagination completely failed. With this pair, George created perhaps the most attractive fictional mystery series couple since Peter and Harriet Wimsey - and then lost her skill, her courage, or her imagination. Killing off Helen was such a cheap shot, really. It provided a highly emotional and attention-getting way to avoid the daunting challenge of how to describe happy relationships in an interesting manner. Clearly, George is unable to do that, just as she is apparently unable to come up with anything new to provide interest around her other key characters. In her early novels, it looked as if George was on the way to being in the same league as Ruth Rendall or PD James. But I think not."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I too am extremely disappointed that George took what I believe to be the lazy writer's way out... could she not imagine Thomas and Helen as parents? And I thoroughly agree with those reviewers who have said that she has failed completely in advancing her characters - I loved the earlier books with each character (well, except Deborah) growing, changing, developing: flawed, but human. And the more I think about it the angrier I get at George for this whole book: the stupid twist with the profiler, the fact that Helen's murder wasn't connected in any way to the case at hand, Winston's obsession with \\"Yas,\\" Barbara's continuing \\"dumpiness\\", and above all, the ending. Barbara and Thomas were friends, and the way she wrapped Barbara's disappointment in Thomas's silence about his decision to turn off the life support as simply a class difference \\"woven before either of them were born\\" was just infuriating - she could have explained it as having to tell his family first, or she could have had him tell her the truth! I think she just wanted the book to end, and chose this way to do it.

I was delighted to find that Barbara Havers was back as an important part of the story. I mourned the death of a character I had come to care about, but that's what great books, like life, are all about. Sometimes bad things happen to good people.I enjoyed every moment of reading this book, as I have with most of Ms. George's Inspector Lynley mysteries. I thought this book put her back at the top of her game."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I find it difficult to believe that dedicated fans of Elizabeth George could be satisfied with her latest effort. Since her first book, I have eagerly looked forward to the next and even though I felt that she cheated us with With No One As Witness, I will most likely give her one more try, if or when she continues. Most true fans have likely already read this book and formed their own conclusions. To those of you new to Elizabeth George, my best advise is to start from the beginning. Her books are captivating and satisfing (except for the last one where she took a cheap shot which I can only guess was to shock us and make sure we were still awake)."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Some readers' opinions seem to be that she has a grasp of the deep psychology of Lindley etal, i think she has sunk in to gratuitous tragedy. Tragedy for its own sake which lends nothing to this story or to the next ones, or is she planning to end this series? I have read all of her books up until now even when they don't start before page 300, because i like how she paints landscapes, atmosprhere, character etc. but this is the last book of hers i will read. How can she bring them back from the the ton of bricks she has buried them under?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I found this a roller coaster ride and am frankly surprised (to say the least) at it's low rating by others. My frustration is that she only writes about one book every year and a half and I'm dying to know where she is going to go with this - if anywhere. I did not find it overly complex (This from someone who has to write down Ludlum characters as they appear in his later books in order to keep them straight). I found it an extremely moving book and would recommend to anyone who likes her works."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've waited breathlessly for each book of this series to be published. I've been disappointed with a several which focus on minor characters like class-fixated, boring Barbara Havers. George's best books in this series have \\"starred\\" the Lyndleys and their best friends, of whom I am most fond. Strong plots, interesting relationships, and intelligence characterize these books, particularly the early ones.This book is the worst of the series. Serial killers have been SO overdone, and George doesn't do them as well as other authors. Maybe George is simply tired of the characters. The ending shocked and revolted me. What a dirty trick on George's faithful readers.I will never buy or read another book in this series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"A few comments:1. I hated the last George book focused only on the obnoxiously whiny St. James wife. It felt like George had lost her way.2. This book is much better, and I was thinking throughout that I was thoroughly enjoying Havers and Lynley again. Good job, George.3. Except for the part in which George delves into the serial killer's mind. It felt amateurish, and I was bored with it. After a while, when there was a section of a few pages with the killer's thoughts, I just skipped them.4. Fellow reviewers--It's really rude and selfish in review after review to keep revealing the plot twist at the end. If you didn't like it, that's fine. Discuss it all you want, but camoflauge the identity of the character. You're ruining it for others, and it's plain that you know how rude it is. Knock it off."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"First, I must say I have been an enthusiastic reader of Elizabeth George. I was really looking forward to another of her books.But, this is her weakest. There are far too many sub-plots in far too much detail. Where in blazes were the editors when they got this manuscript??? It is undisciplined - as though every idea and detail had merit. Several people have said the book is about 200 pages too long. I agree.I also am not a big fan of serial killer plots but if the writing is good and the characters well developed, I can deal with it. Nonetheless, I have told people who do not like serial killer mysteries but who like Elizabeth George to skip about the first 400 pages. You won't miss much. The only reason to read the rest of it is to see what happens to main George figures. But truthfully, they are dealt with in a much more shallow fashion than before. I suspect that the author so exhausted herself with the serial killer and sub-plots that there was not much room left for the main characters, except for Havers who is given just enough room to become positively annoying.I will read George's next book, but I have to say I will approach it with some suspicion."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I hated this book. I have enjoyed the Inspector Lynley books in the past, but this was just too much. Too violent, too depressing, too negative, nothing of redeeming value. The serial killings were too graphic and disgusting and the plot had no subtlety. You knew where the plot was leading well before it got there. This book was so disappointing. When I finished reading it I felt compelled to throw it in the trash. I have never had a reaction like this to a book before. I also felt compelled to write a review to warn other people not to read this book unless they have ready access to antidepressants."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I bought this book because I loved the books Elizabeth George has written before.What a mistake! This book reads as if she's tired of all her characters and wanted to smash their lives to bits, which she effectively does by killing off an essential and beloved character in a way that's unconnected to the rest of the plot but that punches a hole in her cast.What's wrong with Elizabeth George? The book feels like a wanton act of destruction. Surely this master plotter could have come up with a better way to get the Lynleys offstage. Boo to you, Ms. George."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I discovered Elizabeth George's Lynley / Havers series years ago in an English bookstore in the south of France during a long vacation. I gathered up every book she had published to date and inhaled them. Since then, I've read each of the series as they've been published. \\"With No One As Witness\\" is one of her very best -- shocking, gripping, and not long enough for me."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George never fails to fulfil the expectations. I've followed the adventures of Inspector Lynley and co. for years now and this book was as much as a page-turner as its predecessors.This time Lynley and Havers investigate a series of murders in London which seem to have a racist background. As the murders escalate, they both work frantically to try and catch the killer as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the tale of their own personal lives keeps unfolding as in all previous books and, as it often happens, becomes influenced by work-related episodes.The end of this book is the beginning of Ms. George's next one. It will leave the reader flabbergasted. I certainly was!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This has got to be the most intense book of the Lynley-Havers series. Not so sure I felt comfortable with the ending, though. One thing missing, which was a blessing, George didn't focus upon those two difficult women (Deb and Helen) and their issues with their men. I have become very annoyed and impatient over the prevailing theme of \\"pander unto me\\" in her prior books per the the two love interests, Deb and Helen. George presents both gals as very vain, immature, and often PMS'y! I do think that George has dumbed both of them down in last few books, particularly Helen (Deb was never the sharpest knife in the drawer). Barbara (Havers) is more the \\"real\\" woman in this series of great mysteries. Glad to see that Barbara got more stage presence in this latest, greatest Lynley-Havers mystery."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"You can accuse this book of being overly complex. You can even accuse it of being unduly implausible in a lot of respects. Still, it survives these flaws and ends up being one of my best mystery reads for the last month, purely on the strength of George as a writer.In this book, Havers is still out of favor and doesn't seem to want to help anyone trying to help her win her position back. She and Lynley find themselves faced with a serial killer whose activities threaten to drag the name of the police through the mud. Ultimately, they discover that the man threatens even more than that...I found that the pages flew by, and I'll be eager to see where George takes the characters from here. Recommended."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This book was a frustrating read for me. I miss the way Mrs. Geeorge wrote her first 4-5 Lynley books. I had a hard time staying focused in the middle and the plots were conveniently tidied up in the end without making much sense. I was so happy to get this book for Christmas but I was so frustrated after reading it. Die hard George fans will be happy with how things play out for Havers. Come on, Mrs. George, get back to rocking our literary world!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I devoured this book, taking very little breaks to get right to the end. I usually think that serial killer stories are over-rated, just toying with our fears in an odd psychobabble way. But this book really took a good look at it, and had a refreshing perspective on the hyped \\"profiler\\" type of investigations that are so rife on the TV scene. As for the interplay between Havers and Lynley, and other characters in the book, I wasn't disappointed. Winston Nkata's storyline was a good progression as well. I found the tension building at just the right pace. I really liked the colorful descriptions of Camden Town and other bits of London. George really knows how to move along a plot, keep all the balls in the air, and provide great characters and locale. A great read, tightly written, no-nonsense, and very funny at times! While the material is dark, she writes with such a humane and respectful way that it wasn't very depressing to me."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Praise the deity. Elizabeth George gives us a novel in which we need not remember 18, 534 details about the geography and socio-history of quirky coastal acres to follow the narrative. Back in London (with a couple of cheats - sadly, The Kings Head and Eight Bells hasn't been a pub in years) George has the time and attention to turn to character development.Having followed George's characters from the beginning of her career, I think the best thing about this novel is the introduction of Winston Nkata as something more than a line-drawing. We get enough of Nkata's back-story and views to establish him as yet another viable player on George's stage. Even as she fills in the Nkata outline, George moves the two main characters, Lynley and Havers, along in a believable and - from a feminist point of view - positive direction. There's nothing so simple as Havens and Lynley trading perspectives here, but Tommy does find himself in a number of conflicts that were formerly the domain of Havers alone. Yes, people are weeping at the end of the novel, but the weeping is as individual as it is universal, so we can see in each character's response a believable evolution of emotion.For those of you who fear yet another 600 pages of Deborah St James feeling sorry for herself, rejoice! She barely shows up here, and when she does, Deborah seems miraculously able to think of the feelings of someone beside herself. However briefly.The crimes on which the investigation focuses are the work of a serial killer. But this is not a book about a serial killer; it's a book about a cast of characters who've been together for over a decade. For a reader coming to Elizabeth George for the first time, there's enough history to follow the action, but not so much that long-time readers need to skim pages. The London locations are important, but George reigns in her tendency to pad pages with researched details and finds a balance here that's been lacking from the last several books. Instead, George produces a number of vividly sketched characters as murder suspects and also-rans. Her introduction of journalism into the mix of forensic and personal tensions at New Scotland Yard raises timely issues and adds yet another layer to the variously posed question of what constitutes a well-lived life.And yes, it is a brave ending, but I'll leave the specifics to your reading. People who \\"out\\" plots on Amazon.dot belong in circle 9.5 of Dante's _Inferno_."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've read all of the books in this series, but had grown very impatient with the neuroses of the characters & their disfunctional relationships and the overblown & tedious descriptions of almost everything they encounter. I had moved on to Denise Mina (wonderful) and didn't plan to buy this latest, but I'm glad a friend talked me into it.For once, the length didn't annoy me to distraction (though George still needs a real editor in my view). My hope now is that losing Helen gets us out of the emotional hothouse. If the next book has Lynley taking over Deborah's role as the weepy head hair shirt, I'm gone, but if the plot keeps center stage & the remaining four don't have relationships with anyone else who drips egg yolk all over their fronts, I'll be back."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I'm a reader who buys books by author rather than by title. Elizabeth George was one writer whose books I'd automatically purchase, but after reading With No One as Witness, I've taken her off my list. She is too bleak for me.What I liked most about her books was the psychological evolution of her five core characters. In Tommy, Helen, Barbara, Simon and Deborah, she created an amazingly elegant and balanced interplay of characters and provided great insights into the workings of the human heart. The three women were a perfect foil for each other: Helen's grace and cool thoughtfulness offset Barbara's bitterness and Deborah's uncontrolled passion. The evolving love story of Helen and Tommy was an effective counterpoint to the general darkness of George's stories, and the author seemed to understand that to be most effective darkness must be balanced with light.George seems to have lost that vision. In With No One as Witness, she kills off Helen Clyde, and in doing so damages the lives of her characters and destroys the most compelling element of her series.George seems to be withdrawing more and more into the position that \\"life is ugly and things turn out the worst possible way,\\" but I won't be around to read what damage she inflicts on her remaining cast."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I can't believe I actually was looking forward to reading this book. I loved Elizabeth George. I read every one of her novels, painstakingly (at times) getting to know everyone, feeling excited that Tommy and Helen would have a child, adding a new dimension to the relationships. But no, let's not let our characters be happy, for crying out loud. Let's KILL the pregnant one and end it with Havers crying. How depressing and how utterly disappointing. I can't even say as I miss Helen--I am still trying to understand why she was killed off. ??? Not a fan, I'm afraid. Just not a fan."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have been a long-time fan of Elizabeth George, but this book is a sad ending for the Lynley legacy. Although I believe Barbara Havers is the heart of George's novels, I think there could have been a more graceful way to chronicle the winding down of Lynley's career. After enduring Helen and Thomas's ups and downs before their marriage, I was appalled at this monstrous ending. As tiresome as their relationship was, it hardly deserved this tragedy.As other reviewers have noted, the mystery was secondary in this novel. It was hard to keep track of it with all the problems at headquarters.I hope EG doesn't abandon Havers and Nkata. They are the most interesting characters in her long series. They can easily carry the series on their own."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have been reading the Lynley/Havers novels since the release of Missing Joseph, and can truly say that among the 4000+ books I own, the entire series is in the top 100 of those I would save if my house was on fire. If you haven't read them, start now.The writing in the newest installment is beautifully crafted as always, with excellent characterizations which allow one to read this book without having read the others, although I highly recommend doing so if time and money allow. The characters are truly the centerpieces of the books, and accompanying them in their evolution throughout the series is a pleasure no reader should miss. With No One As Witness is an absorbing portrayal of a police team's hunt for a serial killer, and the pressure and strain brought about by the search upon the main characters. This is so skillfully done that one does indeed feel that pressure and strain, and so when the tragedy alluded to in the book jacket occurs, the blow is such that longtime (and even new) readers may find themselves unable to absorb what has happened - much like the characters.The only reason I didn't rate this five stars was due to some shortcomings in terms of punctuation, which occasionally disturbed the narrative flow. However, this should definitely not stop you from picking up the work - any of it - of one of the finest writers of the day."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Another great entry in this series. Lynley, Havers and Winston Nkata are in fine form, and the serial killer plotline is a nice change of pace. The ending is courageous and simply devastating. Where does she go from here?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Although like all Elizabeth Georges the book is quite long, when I had to put it down for a while to go to work, I couldn't wait to get back to the book. I thought she was in top form. The theme of the book is quite serious (violence and youth, both against youth and by youth against society). As one character in the book points out, England hasn't been \\"safe\\" for decades, and yet we like to think that street violence is an American phenomenon.The plot involves a serial killer who may be connected in some way to a not-for-profit organization that works with London youth who are what used to be called \\"juvenile delinquents.\\" The usual E. George characters are involved in trying to track down this killer, particularly Lynley, Havers, and Nkata, who are leading up the investigation. Their job is made more difficult by a new supervisor -- anyone who has had a terrible boss will sympathize with Lynley -- who is determined to manipulate the press and go behind Lynley's back in making decisions involving the investigation. The serial killer's victims are young adolescents, many of whom are mixed race.Havers plays a prominent role in this book, and part of the reason I enjoyed the book so much is that she's a probably my favorite George character. We have a number of scenes of her with her next door neighbors. Lynley alternates between trying to protect Havers and being exasperated himself with her for being too independent -- not a team player. I can identify with that!The aspect of the book that has upset so many E. George fans -- I won't say too much because it could be a spoiler -- was, I think, necessary in driving home the point of the book and making the reader emotionally experience the effects of violence in our society. I was saddened but not particularly angry with George for this plotting decision -- on the contrary, I think it was a good literary decision, even if it is difficult for the reader. My criticism has to do with the length of the book. I really think it could have been tightened up a little, and she could have lost 50 pages and had a better book. Some paragraphs exploring the emotions of the characters just went on too long. As someone once commented, novels these days seem to be more about emotions than plot. I could have done with a bit less soul-searching and a tighter plotline.The ending (last 50 pages) was amazing -- kept you on the edge of your seat, and really a perfect conclusion to this harrowing story of violence in our society. All told, a five star book! And a great improvement over her previous book..."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Seems you either love this book or hate it. I loved it: loved the length, loved the descriptions of various parts of London, loved the whiplash plot twists, cheered the critical spotlight on father-failure and the hypocrisy--even societal suicide--of Political Correctness. Even the fact that I was pretty sure I'd spotted the killer early on didn't slow down my page-turning.I'm not upset by the loss of a major player. I think the surpassingly sad way it happened might be the book's keenest insight into the increasingly random heartlessness of today's violent crime. I also think it opens up new possibilities for characters I find much more interesting and likable. The only thing that's ever tried my patience with E. George's books has been the everlasting emotional turmoil of certain persons who shall remain nameless, and maybe things will start looking up a bit.I'd like to see good people like Lynley, St. James, Nkata, and irresistible Barbara Havers have a few breaks. Unremitting sorrow can become as exhausting as the unmitigated misanthropy that for years put me off Ruth Rendell, whose early books seldom contained even one character I liked or cared a bean what happened to.Really good read, and my interest in the series has gone up several notches."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"What a horrible ending!!! But to say I was surprised would be wrong, because there were foreshadowings of it all through the book. Couldn't you just tell that there was something off? I got an inkling about half way through, and as I became more and more convinced of it, I looked on the last couple of pages and my suspicions were confirmed and I just put the book away. I have a toddler and am sleep-deprived, and I don't need any help in being emotional. This disturbed me for days! I read books to escape, not to sink into a pit of despair and clutch my child to me. Thanks Eliz, but why in the *#($ couldn't you have let Tommy be happy for once, REALLY. Hasn't he had enough bad things happen to him? Would it have been that difficult to just let him have something? You've tortured me with their emotional difficulties (the one where she's helping her sister out and they have the discussion about losing yourself in marriage...I needed a translator), but was this really the answer?I'll have to have someone read the next one first and let me know if it's going to send me to the psych ward before I read it. If I want to be disturbed by a book, I'll read a Ruth Rendell, thank you very much. At least hers don't wear you to the bone with over-analyzed descriptions of emotions and try to explain the British class system to you at the same time. ~sigh~"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"About 4 weeks ago, I had a mini-stroke and had a very hard time focusing on what I read in the days immediately following my release from the hospital. Once my focus was tighter, and my emotions less wiggy, I looked at the stack of books I'd picked up to keep me occupied and intellectually stimulated as I recuperated and read them, fairly quickly, one by one. Ms. George's book was the last in the stack.Her work generally requires more of me, brainwise, than other writers', so I wanted to be able to give it the attention it deserved and also wanted to be able to savor it.This novel has to be my favorite so far. I've always liked the Havers/Lynley duo, but I hadn't really connected with Nkata before this, in spite of previous exposure to the character. This time, I found myself enjoying his role in the action and in the emotional and psychological development of characters.I most enjoyed the connection between Havers and Lynley here. Lynley, of course, feels he must spend much of his time buffering for Havers, protecting her or otherwise trying to compensate for her bull-in-a-china-shop approach to her job. This says a lot about Lynley, probably much that he would not like to admit. But throughout the book, that connection between the two cops is strong and well-developed. I enjoyed the emotional bond between them, and I truly enjoyed \\"seeing\\" Barbara Havers try to balance her emotional needs, deal with her sensitivity, something she really does not want to admit to herself or anyone else.I won't ruin the book by revealing plot twists. I will only say that Lynley is put through the wringer in this book, and his responses help develop his character in unexpected ways.Finally, in keeping with what I've already said, I find this book so interesting and rewarding because it really develops the characters' emotional connections and helps the reader see those characters more clearly."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"After being disappointed with \\"I Richard\\" and \\"A Place ofHiding,\\" I wasn't planning to read this, until a friend described it as \\"devastating\\" and refused to say anything else about it. I read the book on a day that I would be spending in airports and didn't have anything better to do. Right from the start, I was glad to see Havers still on the road to professional self-immolation (will she ever learn to keep her mouth shut?) and still wish Lynley would be a little less circumspect (he's as political an animal as the despicable Hallier but just doesn't show it). It was easy to tell who was going to \\"get it,\\" but George's writing, especially when describing the central event of the novel, has never been more tighter or more heartbreaking."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have read all of Elizabeth George's Lynley and Havers books and was somewhat disappointed in the last two books (not up to her usual brilliant combination of police procedural and character devopment). But when I read With No One as Witness, I realized that she had created her masterpiece in this amazing series!I could not put the book down. It took me three days to complete not only because of its length (627 pages) but because of its emotional impact. I gasped, cried, and sometimes laughed, and came to know and love the various characters better (Lynley, Havers, Nkata, Helen, Simon and Deborah St. James), as well as the many members of Lynley's and Helen's families. I will not ruin the plot by giving away the the details of the tragedy that occurs in this book but warn you that it will be devasting to all long fans of this series.The plot is excellently developed: four young teen age boys have been horribly murdered and when the police realize they have a serial killer on their hands, Lynley is assigned the job of finding the killer. He faces both organizational complications of handling a huge investigation as well as dealing with the monstrous Assistant Commissioner David Hillier who tries to micromanage the investigation for political purposes. The cast of possible suspects will dazzle readers and the shock ending will blow you away.Run and buy this book immediately! But make sure that you read the book in private and that you have your handkerchief nearby!Bravo, Elizabeth George!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I do not feel this book is one of Elizabeth George's best Lynley books, but certainly an improvement over \\"A Place of Hiding,\\" which hardly seemed like it belonged in the series. I was not disappointed by the \\"sad\\" ending as I thought that particular plot line really had no where to go anyway. It did leave me looking forward to the next book in the series, to see what might be ahead for Lynley and Havers.

Again, not her best, but things are looking up!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"My first E. George book was \\"For the sake of Elena\\". Immediately, I gobbled up all the previous releases and have continued to do so with new releases.SPOILER ALERT!!! I am puzzled by those reviewers who feel \\"Betrayed and Manipulated\\" by the death of Helen. She has always been \\"window dressing\\" to me, in regards to the Lynley/Havers books. How fascinating can a woman whose greatest conflict in life seems to be what christening outfit will her baby wear or should she really wear the too high healed boots when it kills her feet? I won't miss her and I don't believe the series will suffer in her absence.Having said that, I am greatly pleased that I was able to get to know Winston better, and to see that Barbara hasn't become a mere characterization either, which I worried about in previous novel."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George is a prolific writer. Her series featuring Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner, Barbara Havers has been made into a television series. It was for this reason that I read her latest in the Lynley-Havers series. It is certainly the best so far. This is a long book, but it never gets bogged down. Lynley and Havers, along with newly promoted Detective Sargeant Winston Nkata, investigate a serial killer who kills and mutilates adolescent boys. Nkata deals with a reluctant love interest, Havers with a deepening friendship with her neighbor, and Lynley with a family tragedy while pursuing this high profile murder case. George has woven this all together into a moving, beautifully written story."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I am beginning to think that Elizabeth George is one of today's finest mystery writers and With No One as Witness does nothing to disabuse me of that notion. As always, in addition to a well plotted mystery, she has her usual well-developed characters and pushes the boundaries of race and class in British society.In this book, Acting Chief inspector Thomas Lynley and his wife, Helen are looking forward to the birth of their first child, while at the same time a particularly viscious serial killer is operating in London-- one who kidnaps and kills young boys. The case is politically tense because the murders were essentially ignored until the first white victim is found-- all of the previous victims had been black so no one had put together the fact that young boys were being killed in a similar fashion.In addition to the political nature of the case, Lynley has to deal with the AC, David Hillier, who is a real idiot and who insists on doing stupid things like embedding a reporter in on the investigation and forcing Detective Sergeant NKata to sit in on daily press briefings to show that Scotland Yard is ethnically diverse.Detective Constable Havers is back in fine form-- still demoted to Constable but determined to slog through and solve the case in her own indomitable way.Without giving anything away, let me say that the ending of the book was a complete shock and was absolutely heartbreaking. I had to go back and read the last few chapters again to make sure I had gotten it all, and I cried myself to sleep after reading it, feeling as devastated as the characters in the book at the turn of events.I know that some have criticized George for the ending, but I admire her courage in doing what she did. She doesn't just write mysteries, she writes carefully crafted novels that examine various aspects of society. Yes, the book has a sad ending, but it mirrors true life events, which don't always end happily either."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"George is back. After \\"A place of hiding\\", which was -in my opinion- really slow, bleak, and boring, this book is a whole different kettle of fish. It is very long, but mostly that did not disturb me, although I was a bit bored by the parts in which one important character -not a usual one- was featured directly. I did not find it too complicated, although it is true the the readers are not given enough elements to figure out the ending by themselves.As a standalone read it would be good, even though some minor things really depend on having read what happened before, because they are not explained here. But I don't think that this would detract from enjoying this novel.My appreciation of the book had been somewhat spoiled by the fact that some of the reviews of the hardback version gave away too much of the plot (and I really wish reviewers would not do that), but this was still a very good read, which significantly deprived me of sleep over a weekend. I am looking forward to the next book in the series with renewed enthusiasm..."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've been an avid reader of all of Elizabeth George mysteries. I had an inkling of what was going to happen at the end of this book from sneak-peeking at the reviews, but nevertheless was devastated. Those who loved following the personal lives of Lynley, Helen, Deborah, & Simon, like I did, would undoubtedly feel heartbroken at the end. I wonder why Ms. George felt the need to do that to a central character to the series, if she felt that the characater had nowhere to go. The mystery part of the book was fine, & I would have given it 5 stars, but the end was just so heartbreaking that I'm giving it a 3. As heartbreaking as the book was, it really says something about Ms. George's ability as a writer to make readers feel such a deep sense of sadness about the ending. She really is a great writer. I, however, don't know if I will be able to re-read the old books in the series anymore, as I often have while waiting for the new releases."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Unlike PD James, Ruth Rendall, or Donna Leon, who also write long-running detective serials, Elizabeth George seems to be unable to sustain the quality of her Thomas Lynley series. In With No One as Witness she switches from her typical intimate family murder to a poorly-constructed serial killer tale. And, in a bizarre plot twist that strains credibility past the breaking point, she breaks up her extremely endearing group of long-running characters. The Thomas Lynley - Helen Clyde subplot has been the best and perhaps the most widely-followed continuing side story in mystery fiction since Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Why she ended it by killing off Helen smacks of creative breakdown to me; it's very disappointing that she could not have come up with any other way to create new dramatic conflict in her series. I can't recommend this book, nor, by anticipation, any of its sequels. What a disappointment."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George pushes, unsuccessfully, into the serial killer genre with this novel. Or rather, she throws together a serial killer novel and a police procedural. It's really not her area of strength as a writer, and the resulting book lacks both the creepiness of a good serial killer book and the solid plotting that was the hallmark of some of her earlier books. Killing off Helen Clyde was a serious mistake that will have long-term repercussions in this series. By suggesting that the death is somehow Lynley's fault (because of his \\"hubris\\") she emasculates her hero; and will discover, in future books, that she has destroyed what kept readers coming back to her. Whatever personal demons drove her to write this book, her editor should have shoved this one in a drawer."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"With No One as Witness is one of the worst examples of lazy writing to come along in years. In it, George uses the crutch of coincidence -- being in the wrong place at the wrong time -- to bring about the murder of one of her permanent cast members. Some readers praise her \\"courage\\" in killing off Helen Clyde, but I disagree; I think it's the cop out of an author who's kept writing long past her ability to generate meaningful evolution in the lives of her characters. For a book so long waited for, it was a major disappointment."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Committed fans of Elizabeth George will find great pleasure in her latest novel, With No One As Witness. The familiar characters are there: Thomas Lynley,Barbara Havers, Winston Nkata. We have come to know and enjoy these people and have watched their development over the years. It's very nice to be back with them again. George's writing continues to be excellent. There are deep and penetrating studies of character. There is a very interesting and potentially controversial plot twist in this novel. Those who enjoy British mystery novels will enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"The tragic demise of a main character was disappointing to say the least. This type of fiction and its dark sides are fine, but all endings should be satisfactory."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This may give away the ending, so don't read it if you don't want to know:I have read all of George's books, and this one started out to be among the best. From the liner notes I knew something bad was going to happen, but I never expected it to be something so egregious and especially unjustified by the plot of the book. If the main protagonist had committed the crime, that would have made sense. For it to be so random made it meaningless. After following Lynley and Helen's relationship for so long, watching it develop, to have it end like this was cruel.The book was good; the way she handled the ending was terrible. I'm sure I will continue to read her stories because of Havers and Nkata, as others have said, but I am sadly disappointed."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"As another reviewer wrote, I will not discuss the plot bombshell, except to say that I was a sniveling wreck by the time I finished the book, with wads of tissues at my side. And I simply could not stop thinking about it, despite telling myself over and over that it was ridiculous to get so upset about a piece of fiction. All the characters are in great form. I was a bit annoyed by all the red herrings - reminded me of Christie a bit. I love the London locations and Lynley and Havers just keep getting better and better. Since seeing the PBS series, tho, I have a hard time reconciling the print Havers with the film one. One caveat - don't start reading Eliz. George with this one. Go back to the beginning and really get to know these wonderful characters."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Over-complicated??? It's a murder mystery, for Pete's sake. It's SUPPOSED to be complicated! But I suppose if you're used to the likes of the formulaic Sue Grafton, Elizabeth's George's intricate plotting and thoughtful characterization could be off-putting and over taxing.George ranks as the reigning Queen of Crime, in my mind. And it must be galling to our British brethren that an American has invaded their ground and done them one better. She's infinitely more readable than the overly dense P.D. James, without sacrificing one whit of thought-provoking content. Her characters live, breathe, eat, drink, love and hate like your next-door neighbors, working their way into your heart. I adore Barbara Havers--though she reminds me way too much of my own more unattractive traits--and she provides a great dose of realism among the posh and sophisticated set, who, despite their aristrocratic roots, still come across as believable.I read this book in two days flat: one of those up until 2 am because I couldn't put it down kind of reads. It holds up well to her other books, even raising the ante with its shocker ending. I'm so dying to find out what happens, I imagine I won't even wait for the paperback with the next one, but will buy it in hardback as soon as it appears."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I share the opinion of many other readers of With No One as Witness: George should have stuck to full tapestry murder mysteries, which she does well; instead of attempting a psycho serial killer novel, which she did badly. Very badly indeed. Oh, and it's definitely cheating to kill off a main serial character, especially when the killing has no relation to the rest of the plot. It suggests that the writer lacks the imagination or the energy to keep the character spinning. That's probably why so many reviewers have said this book felt \\"tired\\" and \\"sloppy\\". Again, I agree. George should stay off the literary scene till she gets her energy back."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"In this book Elizabeth George acquaints the reader with the processes of tracking a serial killer who is at once ordinary and yet diabolical. The coordination of resources and man power to finally get the killer is detailed and organized. Many leads of followed, but he final result depends, again, on Barbara Havers unique insights and observations. Here ability to connect pieces of information leads to the rescue of Inspector Lynley himself."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is a gripping tale and difficult to put down. I am so happy the book is about 900 pages long ---it is like having a double helping of my favorite dessert."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I discovered Elizabeth George when she only had two books in print. I've read each one as it has come out, and have enjoyed all of them.One of the things I have always loved about this series is the continuing back story on all of the characters. They have grown and changed over the years that I've read the books. The books are both about the mysteries and about the people trying to solve the mysteries.It is possible that this is a pivotal book and that the direction of any future stories is going to move to characters that were more minor in the past. I've decided that is OK."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This addition to the excellent Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers series deals fairly convincingly with pedophelia and sexually-motivated serial killings. This is not intended as a spoiler, but fans should note that this is a very sad story for some of the favorite characters in the series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George has created true characters with the Lynley series. You care about these New Scotland Yard police and you want to know how they are developing - professionally and personally. George does a great job of making them real. Lynley, Havers, Nkata... all great characters following a serial killer in London. You'll read it as fast as you can to not only see who did it but how the \\"regulars\\" solve it."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I found this to be the darkest of all her books. Of course that has a lot to do with the subject matter of a serial killer. But it also pertains to the ending, which is devastating. Lynley must make a heartbreaking decision. The decision he makes is totally in character, which is to Ms. George's credit. The book is very long although it reads very quickly. I think some of the detail on the minor characters could have been eliminated, especially Ulrike. We know way too much about her sex life. However, like all her books, it is beautifully written. Because London is my favorite city I enjoy all the detail but I understand how it could get to be too much for some and detract from the mystery plot. Havers, however, continues to be her irascible self and that is what drives the plot along for me. I wonder if Ms.George is going to finish the series with this book because of the ending. We'll have to see. Do read the book though. It is dark and compelling just like life."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George is one of those writers who don't overproduce, and therefore keep writing great books. This one impressed me not just because of the storyline, but especially because of the care with which different characters are followed throughout the story. The ending is breathtakingly sad."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"After \\"A Place of Hiding\\", I thought it was the end of the road for me with Elizabeth George. A dismal book, \\"A Place of Hiding\\" needed an on-target redemptive effort for me to try again with the author. In \\"With No One as Witness\\", I am relieved to say that the author has produced a sterling effort. As a reader in England, I know I probably look too hard for those little slip-ups that can irritate and destroy the pace of a carefully crafted story set in the UK but written by an American author. There were few in this book. Aside from a gripping murder mystery about a serial killer, George has managed to give a very revealing portrait of modern London and Britain. She demonstrates an excellent grasp of the failures of the welfare system, social services, probation system, an increasingly weak and bloody-minded judiciary hampered by European human rights legislation, the effects of immigration and the soul-destroying effect of political correctness that is currently wreaking havoc with the Metropolitan Police senior management in London and the UK generally. I think it was her well drawn background of today's London that made this book such a gripping read for me. As a platform for a serial killer at large, it was superb. Well done; I'm looking forward to this one being made into another BBC drama!!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Ever since I picked up my first Elizabeth George book, I've been hooked. So far, she's never failed to disappoint me. Each of her novels can be read on their own, without needing to read the first novel in the series. If you miss one of the books in the series, it's not a problem as she gets you up to speed with what's happening in the character's lives without rehashing every detail.The ending. . .well, I won't say too much about it, but I think it was a great lead in to the next book and it will be interesting to see how the characters adjust."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Puting the merits of the actual mystery aside, I agree with E. T. Sprenkle's review of this book. It is not that either of us believes every character in every book must have a happy ending. In real life, some people and families seem to be haunted by tragedy, but fiction is just that: fiction. In a series of stories with the same characters, tragedy, if not handled with a deft hand, can quickly descend from pathos to bathos and becomes merely a tiresome parody of the real thing. A good example of someone who writes this kind of phony misery is Ken Bruen. By the time I finished my one and only attempt to read one of his mysteries I was actually laughing, especially at the ending which, of course, had to be horrific. He had attempted to portray a grim gritty reality but had succumbed to wretched excess. Even master mystery writer P. D. James has now allowed her hero a measure of happiness, but some authors seem to operate under the assumption that to show their protagonists as having some contentment in life would be somehow unrealistic. They should engrave in their hearts (or at least hang beside their word processors) Jane Austen's description of the fate of Willoughby, the villain in \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\" Austen wrote \\"His wife was not always out of humor, nor his home always uncomfortable!\\" She knew that even the most craven among us have moments of happiness. Elizabeth George must keep in mind that the people who follow her series do so because they are interested in her characters. If those characters are not to be allowed to develop some sort of life (or if they are blatantly killed off to allow one of the heros a new love interest in each new book) then the readers will eventually go elsewhere."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Just finished the book. It's brilliant. The plot of the last 80 pages is magnificent, and it also hurts. Really badly, as one gets to know and like the main characters while reading the many inspector Lynley mysteries.While I am a happy customer of Amazon since 1999, this is the first time I write a review. The reason to do so is to counter some reviews below, the ones that think all characters are to lead a happy life and become a whole person. The plot twist of this book shows Georges ultimate ability to create real people in her books. And nasty things happen in real live. It is the ultimate George for me."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I read the reviews in Amazon.com before I read the book, so I knew a surprise death was coming. But I didn't know who it would be. I have read every one of Elizabeth George's wonderful novels, and I believe for the Lindley series to progress, she did the right thing, sad as it was. This is a fabulous book, rich in the seamy detail of present-day London. I love it that Ms. George brought back so many of the characters which have appeared in this series previously -- even Denton, who she says is in NY for a holiday. For a book of nearly 800 pages, this was a very fast and satisfying read!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"HEY PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T YET READ THE BOOK: DON'T READ THE REVIEWS! MOST SPOIL IT!That said, many of the reviews posted here seem to be from people who are not familiar with, or not fans of, Elizabeth George--for example, the gentleman who complains of the pages devoted to the personal lives of the characters. However, the intricacy of those lives is a key element of George's storytelling strength. George's mysteries are as much character-driven as plot-driven, so those who need an altercation or murder on every page need not bother to read them. That said, this particular installment of her characters' lives is clearly one of her most important, devastating and unexpected. Those who have vowed to stop reading her because she has broken their hearts should consider that this mystery will clearly be continued in the next installment. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is the first time George has set up the murder mystery in advance for the next book. There's no way this story line is over. I not only devoured every page of this one but can hardly wait for the new book to see the continuation of the mystery.I refrain from commenting on the reviewer who is \\"currently reding a Dickens three decker called 'Bleak House,'\\" to which he feels this Elizabeth George mystery compares unfavorably. In what universe are these two books comparable?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Having read almost all of the series, this was an automatic pick-up when it came out. I will agree it is a little (about 100 pages) too long - she could have left out most of the Ulrike pieces. However, with that aside this was a GREAT book in the series. Yes, there is a death of a regular character - I don't really want to say main character because if we really think about it how much \\"time\\" did the character ever get - - they just seemed like a little arm candy thrown in. They may have been removed because possibly the author did not know where to go with them.Some people disliked the ending. Nope, the actual ending brought TEARS to my eyes and I actually loved the actual ending. And I'm talking about the ending with Barbara ... it is about time something happened with that and I thought it was beautiful. Winston received a little more time and I was satisfied where they left him. As to how the Lynley piece ended, I'm sure after a short hiatus he will bounce back.We aren't reading romance novels here, the subject matter may be a little tough and life will be more portrayed as life. All in all this was a great addition to the series, I was not disappointed and I don't think I wasted my time on the 772 pages."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"There are some (but few) contemporary writers who can wallow in excess verbiage and pull it off - Reginald Hill is one. Elizabeth George is a prime example of one who cannot. If you are going to take what otherwise would be a ten word sentence and add a another 5, 10 or 15 words just for the fun of it, they had better serve a purpose.Elizabeth George almost always adds endlessly thoughtless, pointless, redundant words to every sentence, and unless she is being paid by the quantity rather than the quality of her writing, she is just wasting a lot of paper that could better be used in its original form as trees.With No One As Witness is at the very most, a 300-page story (and that is very generous) hidden in almost 800 pages of absolutely useless typing. More people can type than can write, and Elizabeth George is nothing but a very tedious typist. There might be some valid reason for this kind of writing for very young readers, but for reasonably intelligent adults this book is an affront to everything that makes good writing pleasant."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I am very disappointed with this latest book by Elizabeth George.As a big fan of hers I expected better than this.The book is overlong,confusing and the ending was a big shock and made no sense whatever.Killing off one of her major caricatures was a big mistake and I cannot see where she will go from here with future books in the Lynley series.Maybe that is what she has in mind.No more Detective Inspector Lynley books."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Just a heads-up for those reading the reviews: some of them contain spoilers about a major plot twist in the book. I personally don't mind a spoiler--in fact, I look for them!--but for those who like to be surprised, be careful about reading these reviews."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"It's one thing to cry at a movie or while reading a book. It's another to cry because the author or director set you up to feel really sad. Throughout the first half of George's latest novel, we observe a different side of Lynley, one where he is fully accepting of his married status and his future as a father. (In novels past, he has been ambivalent.) We witness his unquestionable devotion for Helen as he seems to fall in love with her all over again. We are privy to his thoughts of love for his wife and unborn child and to some intimate sex scenes. But alas, we were being manipulated - we were led through this whole experience just to be hugely let down by the twisted death of wife Helen. Cheap shot, Ms. George.If the author included the death of a prized character to reflect real life, she should not have so obviously changed Lynley's feelings toward her. Instead being consistent with the Lynley character, the questioning Lynley are gone, and we are pushed to fall in love with his falling in love.I will continue to read the Lynley (now Havers?) series because George's novels are like heroin. But I am disappointed with the melodrama and manipulation of this one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This book was, as other reviewers have said, a real page turner. It was a great plot and gripping story. I would have rated it five stars had it not been for the shocking and unwarranted ending. The author's last two books were below her normal standards, and as I recall, were not all that well received by her fans. I almost feel like George is getting back at her fans by showing us she is the one in control. The way she ended this book is not going to sit well with fans of the Lynley/Havers novels. It puts me in mind of Kathy Bates and James Caan in the movie \\"Misery\\"."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I just finished the novel, but I will not give away any spoilers. With No One as Witness features Inspector Lynley and Detective Sergeant, now Constable, Havers. The story follows Lynley and Havers, along with fellow officer Winston Nkata, as they track a serial killer through London.Elizabeth George's writing and pace are impeccable. The story is so engrossing that I carried the book with me wherever I went just for the off chance I might get to read a few pages. Truly, this is the best book I have read by Elizabeth George yet (and I have read and do recommend all of her novels). If you have not yet read a novel by Elizabeth George, this is a fine place to start. An excellent read."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I give up on Elizabeth George. She has killed Helen for no good reason. Elizabeth George has joined a line of authors I will no longer read because they have found it necessary to dispose of a key character for no good reason other than shock value, or to take another character in a new direction. That is lazy writing if you ask me."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This book has been discussed enough with over 170 reviews, and certainly the sheer volume of reviews is an indicator of how provoking parts of the story are. I won't get into details, but I have to say I found the story tiresome and very disappointing. Yes, a major character is killed, and in a very brutal and undeserving manner, but in all honesty it wasn't so much the death that disappointed me for I am tired of all the characters in the book and I am tired of George's refusal to let any of her characters lead happy, comfortable lives, which is a shame as she has managed to create very real, very believable characters.Someone else mentioned that the series may be reaching its sell-by date, and there's truth to it. Although this volume wasn't as long and tedious as several of George's earlier novels, one doesn't get a sense that any of the characters are going anywhere, to a better place, a better life, a better relationship, especially now that perhaps the most sympathetic and innocent recurring character has been killed. I haven't see any progress in character development since George is clearly unwilling to give them a happy life. We've had 13 novels of misery with only the hints of future happiness, and now even that has been taken away. A good mystery novel gives the reader a sense of satisfaction at the end, whether it is because justice has been triumphed, the killer arrested and sent to jail, or a main character gets what he/she has long desired for~anything to make sustaining the drama of the mystery worth it, but in this volume George spectacularly fails.Will I read future EG mysteries? It is hard to say, because only a handful of other authors approach the intelligence of George's language and writing skills. But, as I wrote earlier, I am tired of her characters and the author's inability to let them progress into a better persons."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I agree with other reviewers, so many characters got a little confusing but I liked her development of Nkata...Lynley's character got lost, I was just so disappointed in the death...That just seemed unnecessary and scares me to think that Lynley will not be in future books.

Let Hillier die of a heart attack or, I guess something more intriguing for writing purposes like being gored by a wild boar or something...and bring Lynley back!

I take issue with those who criticize this book as a misstep in \\"the series.\\" The book is just plain, great writing. It would be great if she had never written another book.

While the murder plot (s) were slightly flawed, not coming together neatly at the end as she usually manages to do, and slightly contrived, the shocking ending didn't really surprise me and I accepted as an intregal part of the results of the decision to embed a reporter, and the resulting publicity. (...)It is inconceivable to me that EG has no master plan for these meticulously developed characters, to whom she is clearly invested, to unfold in the years to come. I have faith in EG's ability to continue with the high standards for which she is known. The readers of these books anxiously anticipate each and every volume! Why on earth would such a successful author toss that aside? It will be woven obviously without dear Helen and WITH the unbearable scars that have been thrust upon the entire cast of characters Angst has been a standard in the series, even though we have not seen an event so shocking to date, I have faith that Ms. George will manage to continue to intrigue us, as well as entertain.

The \\"shocker\\" that the jacket promised was, indeed, shocking. I was SURE all would work out in the end, but it didn't, and that was even more shocking. I believe the \\"mind of the serial killer\\" thing has been done (very well) by at least one real British writer and there wasn't really a need to do it again. However, she did do a pretty good job of it. Alas, the horrible, silly, stupid phrase, \\"At the end of the day,\\" repeated at least 10 times (I lost count) was intrusive and aggravating.

Her serial killer is unconvincing, bordering on silly at times; and her decision to kill off a core character pretty much ends my interest in the future of her characters. I'm left wondering why she, or her editor, didn't have the sense to carry on her writing experiments outside the Lynley series.

Given the storyline descriptions of previous novels, this book is probably characteristic of the series so George is off my list -- so many authors, so little time!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Just when I thought this was a long wait, in strolls my favorite twosome and third(lover/wife) favorite again to astound, excite, puzzle, and delight the audience of fans, and even beginning with this book-- would anyone not go immediately back and read the other? Of course! Because of this wonderful English-writing author, and I mean wonderful, as I have read them all including the US variety which she stands as a beacon in the darkness. Thomas and Barbara will never change, and thus, their constancy is the defining factor in every new mystery. Indeed, this is what keeps bringing us back, over and over and over again.

There are killings. Initially the pattern was not seen. There were all the hallmarks of ritual present for the investigators to see. Lynley is deputed by Hillier to set up an investigative group. He is working, among other things, to have Havers restored to rank. He is given Detective Sergeant Winston Nkata to present a multi-cultural image for the press. Kimmo Thorne is positively identified as one of the victims.A profiler is added to the team by Sir David Hillier. Lynley finds that he must stand up for his command or be second-guessed and under-cut all the way. His wife Helen is expecting a baby. His friends Simon and Deborah St.James enter into the plot, too.Barbara Havers has never worked on a series of homicides before and is beginning to feel the stress of it. The criminal events are happening all over the metropolitan map. Apparently the killer sends a block-lettered missive to Lynley whose name has appeared in the newspaper accounts.It seems that two or more of the boy victims were involved with a London organization seeking to reform misdirected youths. The investigators focus on that organization. Simon determines that the culprit probably uses a stun gun to subdue the boys. Lady Helen has the sense to see that only Tommy is in comfortable enough circumstances to run interference with Hillier and preserve the integrity of the investigation. Unlike the others, Tommy is able to place his job on the line.The characters Lynley and Havers and all of their friends and associates are portrayed amply and interestingly in this title. Unfortunately there is a suspicion that inside people in some fashion corrupt and jeopardize the investigation and other people's lives and security for their own peculiar ends. Finally, solutions to the case tumble forth and Havers is restored to rank.I will not disclose a heartbreaking strand of the plot, evidently causing concern to many of the author's loyal readers, in order to preserve the surprises for the reader."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I loved this book.

Don't miss this....it really leaves you wishing for more....more...right now!J.L."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"To paraphrase a popular show, \\"How does she do that?\\" By \\"that\\" I mean spinn intricate, intelligent, edgy tales with characters that evolve and capture the imagination? This is prose taken to a higher plane, one in which every decision, plot twist or description is another cog in the grand scheme of things. The subjects are depressing - pedophilia and murder - and for the first time a serial killer is introduced. This is not some cheap slash tale but instead a piercing, almost scathing, look at modern England, the results of living without rules or fathers, the state of race relation and the sterility of British society.The author excells in \\"natural\\" - as opposed to scripted - conversation. The plot is one of subtle layers, boxes in boxes, a tour de force that intertweaves individuals, relationships and the story into a complex web. She follows a pattern established in earlier books - the main crime serves as the device for revelation of other deep, dark secrets. Her treatment of the lost children of modern society is one of the best - sympathy mixed with hard-headed analysis of consequences.Lynley is his usual emoting self, St. James and Deborah make cameo appearances and Helen...well, let's say that she will not be forgotten. My favorite, Havers, doggedly persists in bucking Scotland Yard even as she battles her own inner demons. The scene with the Bentley not only was perfect but plausible. Each character in the book is presented with all their problems, secrets and hopes.Her portrayal of the pedophiles is judicious, even-handed as we learn that their present was set far in the past through the same abuse they now display. This is far too complex a novel to decipher in a few paragraphs. Needless to say, if you have read an Elizabeth George novel before, this will be your \\"cup of tea\\"."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Wonderful book, but the plot twist was SO SAD. Why did she have to do that?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"When an adolescent boy is found murdered in ritualistic fashion and left on a tomb, New Scotland Yard quickly looks for similar crimes, as the killing bears the hallmarks of a serial killer. They find other victims--several, in fact. Yet no one has paid much attention until now, and some say it's because the other victims were not white.With charges of racism threatening, New Scotland Yard scrambles to quickly solve the killing. Acting Superintendent Thomas Lynley and Detective Constable Barbara Havers lead the charge. Unfortunately, their efforts are hampered at every step by Assistant Commissioner David Hilliar, who is far more concerned about the department saving face than in the efficient solution to the hideous string of crimes. First Hilliar forces an unwanted profiler into their midst, then a tabloid reporter.Author Elizabeth George has an uncanny ability to crawl inside a character's head. She uses many, many points of view and as always weaves the various investigators' personal lives into their professional ones, and never once does the reader become confused because the characters are so strongly, realistically drawn. As always, contemporary London is so well drawn that I feel as if I could go there tomorrow and feel perfectly at home.As investigators gather the clues and draw closer, the tension rises to almost unbearable levels, with the conclusion of the mystery suitably dramatic and unexpected.The one thing that kept me from giving this book an unreserved five stars is that it's sad. Not just sad because adolescent boys are being murdered, but sad because of all the things going on in the characters' personal lives--things that go terribly wrong and can never be right again. Lives shattered, utterly ruined. Because the people are so real to me, I grieve right along with them, and I will feel sad every time I think of this book for a long time to come."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I think that Ms. George was pretty brave in killing off one of the series' main characters, and to be honest I thought it was great that THAT particular character was killed: she was always the shallowest, least interesting character in the series (in my opinion). I prefer Havers, Simon and his wife, and even Thomas Lynley . . . they all have flaws and yet seem real, whereas the \\"departed\\" struck me as a caricature of a snooty English upper-class type who can barely make herself a cup of tea. I applaud Ms. George for getting rid of this \\"dead weight\\" in the series."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This is, I think, Elizabeth George's most brilliant book. For me, it was the fulfillment of promises made in her first four Thomas Lynley books (A Great deliverance, Payment in Blood, Well-Schooled in Murder and A Suitable Vengeance). I am, however, still in total shock at the ending. Aside from tons of twists and turns, and a page turner in every sense---aside from that, I hadn't realized just how attached I had become to the cast of characters. Their victories are mine, their tragedies...mine too. The unspeakable grief, the taut suspense, the enormous sense of love and loss, the too human condition so sensitively, so brutally presented as only Ms. George can...all I can say, and you'll just have to read the book to understand, it's a good thing Barbara Havers had the last scene in the book. Without it I would have broken lamps, mirrors and possibly my Pug's serenity by throwing the book, all her damn books, across the room. And I've got all of them to throw. Instead, I just burst into tears, sobs really, and gently placed my book on the shelf with all the others. My partner said despite the fact I've nearly ruined it for her when I let out a yell (she called it a whimper)and said \\"No! She can't do that!\\"---despite that semi-spoiler posing as emotional breakdown, she will read the book. The upshot of her comments was that a novelist who can evoke such intense emotional response from a reader has just written a fabulous book. Having read it, I agree. I'll wipe my tears now...and hope I can write as good a book some day. And I eagerly await Elizabeth George's next one. With No One As Witness has left this reader needing cake or cookies or maybe pudding...and yet, I'm just not in the mood for any of it. What a brilliant writer George is. Oh, I said that, didn't I? Sod all, as Barb would say. Just buy the book."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"When Elizabeth George is at the top of her game, her books are a pleasure to read and I always come away feeling not only entertained but also enriched by the experience. She expands my vision, my view of the world and of the amazing varities of people - good, bad and in-between. Her insight is amazing and I always look forward to reading her books, even when she isn't at her best.Happily, this book is among her best. In fact, I think it IS her best yet because:1. It features Dectective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner Barbara Havers, two of my favorite characters created by George.2. The plot is thoroughly engaging, dealing with serial murders as well as possible racism and George's increasing skills as a writer are evident from the first page to the last. Within a page, I was riveted.3. Solid and surprising twists and turns, including a tragedy in the police force itself.4. An ending that will leave you spellbound, if not stunned.5.

However, I was profoundly disappointed by the cheap, over-the-top drama of the ending. It takes real talent to sustain characters over time in ways true to their own increasing complexity, and I felt she choked at the tough part. It wasn't the loss of the character I minded so much (although I did love Helen), but the whole scenario relied on exaggerated soap-opera twists, like the way first-year creative writing students end a story when it's due the next day. I felt embarrassed to be reading it, like I was suddenly caught up in a Lifetime channel movie, and embarrassed to be wrenched by the loss. How much tragedy does an earl have to endure in his life until the author feels it's okay to write about an earl?

Especially one who has more talent in her smallest toenail that I possess in my whole body.However, as much as I liked this fine novel I was troubled when my willing suspension of disbelief was shattered twice.First, I just didn't believe that the police would embed a journalist into a crime investigation with no control over what came of it. Bush didn't do it in Iraq and I can't see the Yard doing it either.The huge, huge stretch I couldn't make though was the belief that when Lynley receives a call from the killer threatening his wife (convenient he happens to be at his desk taking calls - but I can live with that) all he does is phone her shopping companion to say \`do keep an eye out for her' without even saying why!Don't let either of my \\"troubles\\" deter you from buying this book.

I have been an avid reader since \\"A Great Deliverance\\" and I can honestly say Ms. George got me on this one......I hate reviews that sums up the plot of the book, so I will skip that. What I will say is the plot twist in this book turns the entire series on its ear, and literally left me with my jaw open.BRAVO Ms. George.....What you did was brave, and necessary to shift the series in a different direction. Lynley/Havers fans, trust me on this...You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I would never call Elizabeth George's mysteries \\"fluff\\". Most reviewers here are fans; all know that her plots won't let you go, and that she can create a living, breathing, intriguing character in a paragraph--and she does, even for someone who will be gone in a page, never to be seen again.She's also written a brilliant book on writing, one that's been of enormous help to me. Anyone who's at all interested in her process and her craft should read it.That said, I'll be giving all the Lynley/Havers books to the book sale this spring. I can't imagine I'll ever want to read them again. In the past few years, they've begun to read like brilliantly written, well-crafted episodes of NYPD Blue, with every character, like Sipowitz, standing in for Job. What more could happen to these people? Apparently, anything. Tired of your detective? Fine, push him off a cliff. But if he's already been pushed off six buildings and the back of an airplane, don't expect it to be believable.I started out by saying that I don't consider these mysteries fluff, but the fact remains that I don't read them expecting to come away disheartened and depressed. I consider it a betrayal to, as it were, force that on me. If you pick up Wuthering Heights, you know what you're getting in for. A series novel in the mystery genre, however intense? I don't think that's the place for tragedy.Instead of feeling satisfied and wishing there was more to read, I'm angry, and unhappy. I admit it took a lot of skill to bring me to that point, but if that's how she chooses to use her skill, then I can choose not to read.I'd return the book if I thought they'd take it back."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I thought that George was back in top form with her latest mystery, \\"With No One As Witness,\\" until right before the end when...well, I guess you know already that a major character dies. (A minor major character, as far as I'm concerned, and not the one I would have picked, but that's just me.) Don't get me wrong. I have absolutely nothing against killing off a character. I think it can invigorate a series -- and God knows this one needed invigorating. But the thing that really suprised -- and annoyed -- me is that George seemed to do the dirty deed to deflect us from the fact that she had no interesting or twisty way to wrap up the actual case that takes up almost the entire book. When the killer is revealed, he/she turns out to be one of the four or five people Lynley and Havers have suspected all along. So, where's the payoff? OK, you think, it's that person as opposed to one of the others. So what? It's a remarkably weak, perfunctory denouement. And one that certainly can't compete with the vicious, distasteful, undignified death George has in store for...whomever. (I'm certainly not going to tell.) Ultimately, with such a disappointing ending, I can hardly recommend this as one of George's best."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"George has written another intelligent mystery, with a shocking twist I won't spoil for you.After finishing \\"With No One As Witness\\", however, I wondered why none of the other reviewers mentioned the mood of the book, since it was so striking.There is a atmosphere of decay that hovers over George's England like one of the famous London fogs of decades ago. She writes about a Britain adrift in a moral swamp.I was so interested I did a little research. Interpol now puts crime in the UK at 50% higher than in the US. Your chances of being mugged in London are six times higher than in New York. In today's Britain, the illegitimacy rate is over 40%, religion is scorned, and binge drinking and random violence are the new hallmarks of the young.At one point in the novel, one of George's characters cries that \\"This can't be happening here.\\"George's point seems to be that it bloody well is happening in England."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I was so happy that \\"With No One as Witness\\" Elizabeth George returned to Lynely-Havers. I really did not like \\"A Place of Hiding.\\" I will not recap the story as it has been done enough already. The following is a spoiler alert to those who have not yet read the book: the ending was unacceptable. How many books did us as readers have to wade through regarding the relationship between Thomas and Helen? They were not yet married a year and what the point was, well, it is beyond me. Sort of like the jump the shark epidsode in Happy Days. Desperation on the part of George? I think, though, that this is the end of line for Havers and Thomas. After all, the story ends with Barbara not only getting her rank back but also in the arms, while in a comforting manner, with her neighbor, who we all know she likes. Thomas will head back to the family pile. He formally left the Yard and prepared Barbara to work without him. So poor rich handsome Thomas ends up alone and Barbara, poor and homely, ends up better off than him. Which is what I am guessing George's point was - see, money and looks can not bring you happiness. But there were other faults in this rather long story. There is no way that in the middle of a serial murder investigation anyone, no matter how inept, would bring in the press to do what Hiller did. Makes no sense!! And Hiller's extreme dislike towards Thomas was almost psycho. He did everthing to get under his skin but as to Thomas's reasons for staying on, I can not figure. When Thomas gets a call from the killer who mentions his pretty wife and what does he do? Ah, he tells silly self-centered Deborah to make sure Helen is not alone cause, well, someone with the flu might be around...I mean, how intelligent is this? No way that would not have been taken serious with Helen receiving 24/7 protection. Then Thomas makes a connection (we think) betwen Hil and Stewart but the story goes no where with possible information. The books ends with the 12 year old being charged with Helen's death but we know it was through the work fo Fu so...Helen is also a victim of his, yes?? But everyone keeps mentioning they are not related but we know they are. On the note of Barbara, enough with the silly T-shirts and red high tops (so 80's anyway). Okay we get the point she is unattractive, poorly dressed, not exactly in shape. Her hair is cut badly, her teeth need fixing. Why make her endlessly unappealing physically? It is not as if I expected Helen to do a make-over with Barbara, but a better hair cut, fix your teeth and get an iron would not have been out of line. She is a walking disaster but while that was once upon a time had charm now, well, everyone eventually takes stock of him or herself and tries to better themselves. AS I said, I think this is the end of the line for this author and this great duo. Where can they go with Tommy not working for the yard?"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"The tragic end of \\"With No One As Witness\\" seems to have upset many of Elizabeth George's fans. Personally it increases my respect for a writer I already considered among the best in the genre.A serial killer is preying on young boys. The identity of some of the victims and the ritualistic aspect of the murders puts Scotland Yard on the defensive and Assistant Commissioner Sir David Hillier launches a public relations campaign to stifle charges of racism. Hillier's efforts soon put him and Acting Superintendent Thomas Lynley in conflict.From then on it's a page-turner with Lynley and his team, particularly the redoubtable Barbara Havers and recently promoted Winston Nkata, working feverishly to halt the string of killings which seem to be connected with at-risk youths participating in a social services charity called Colussus. There are twists and shocks galore and a bevy of sub-plots developing the humanity of Lynley, whose wife is carrying their first child; Havers, concerned about a young neighbor girl, and Nkata, seeking a relationship with a woman he hurt in a previous novel. This is a long book, but well worth the ride.Sure, I was saddened by the conclusion--can't say more about the ending without spoiling it for those who haven't already read it. But, I think it demonstrates the depth of her work, the quality that brings her novels so close to reality and make Lynley, Havers and other characters so plausible we feel we know them personally.No one can be bored by her graceful prose, psychological insight and complex plotting.I can hardly wait for her next book, which is due out in October and is a sequel to this one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I have to agree with the readers that label as gratuitous tragedy George's killing off of one of the main characters in this particular entry in the Lynley/Havers mystery series. I might've even condoned a bit of gratuitous tragedy had it only been the unbearably annoying Deborah St. James who got the ax. I don't know about you all, but I want to spew every time Mrs. St. James whines, cries, or pouts, which is every time she makes an appearance in any of the George novels. I have to wonder if George set out to create the most annoying character on Earth.That aside, the twist with the Yard's profiler was down right asinine, something out of a day-time soap. It was a cheap gimmick. Insert mandatory plot twist here.This novel in one word was a disappointment."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I am very disappointed by the ending in this book and very disillusioned with Ms. George for it. I have been reading this series since 1988. Surely she could have come up with a less troublesome ending than she did for this, the 13th (and I guess unlucky) installment in an otherwise great series.Even if she keeps writing the series, I am not sure that I will EVER read her again. I feel betrayed - like I lost a good friend."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This intellectually and morally unsatisfying narrative hits a new low for George. The serial killer is poorly drawn, the murder of Lynley's wife is unrelated to the plot, and justice is not done. Like many other readers, I got the impression that George has simply run out of ideas of what to do with her cast and chose the most cliched way out of her dilemma. How odd. How awful."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I am a HUGE Elizabeth George fan. I have read all her books. But this one made me mad. I thought the possible suspects given to us were transparent, and that the ending was \\"deus ex machina.\\" But most of all, I hated what she did with two of the continuing characters. I genuinely like her main characters and consider her psychological mining into their beings to be a part of her books' appeal. Perhaps she is bored with them. Or knew no other way to grow these characters. I was saddened and maddened by the ending. I feel cheated. I will not buy her next book until I've read a good deal of the beginning. Ms. George is going to have to win me back."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Ms. George might have written her best novel -- keeping me huddled under a red flannel quilt, bathed in soft yellow lamplight well past midnight, three nights running. I've never been much of a \\"mystery\\" reader, however, when I discovered her series, I read the first ten titles in three months. I loved the weaving of personal lives through the various novels -- never completing a thread in any one book. Oh, the crimes were good, but I continued to read in order to peek into Barbara's trials and Lynley's love life, Helen's delicious quips, Deborah's passionate changes and St. James's learning curves. Even characters on the edges, like Winston Nkata, D.I. Stewart, Azhar and even Hadiyyah , are three dimensional -- with personal quirks, ups, downs, and usually intelligent, even wry, senses of humor.So, I just finished With No One As Witness and I can't sleep even though I snapped off the light and listened to the pattering rain. From the first inkling of the crimes, my mind had swirled with possibilities and guesses through the twists and turns of the mystery's maze. Ms. George's attention to detail--personalities, places, policework -- turns every scene into a visual feast. Then, GASP, I couldn't believe how deftly Ms. George entwined today's sensational headline topics with her character's moral confrontation, and dare I say, courageous resolution. Isn't it difficult to cry when reading a book? And it hasn't happened too often with me. I am wiping tears and wondering what will happen next to all my friends in Ms. George's world. Even with a heavy heart, I cannot wait."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Elizabeth George started out with what must have seemed like a great idea, which was writing novels around a stable of interconnected characters: a police inspector, his constable and his girlfriend and a foresic expert and his photographer wife, each of whom could be the focus of a particular book. This would keep you from getting bored with anyone, would allow the relationships of the characters to evolve over time, and would allow juxtaposition of different characters with crimes that would illuminate their personalities. So, for instance, Deborah, the childless wife of the forensics expert, could get upset by kidnappings of children, adding extra poignancy. Or Barbara Havers, the ungainly constable with a chip on her shoulder, could interact with other social outsiders.In theory, this was a good idea for a professional genre writer, but the problem turned out to be that George was too talented, and her framework began to hold her down rather than free her. Her main character, Thomas Lynley, the earl-turned-policeman in love with the madcap countess, is such a tired cliche that there was almost nowhere interesting to go with him from the first book onward. He's a direct descendant of Lord Peter Wimsey but 50 years too late to be relevant, and his madcap Lady Helen, with her dressing gowns and marabou-trimmed slippers, is tiresome. The only character with a breath of life in her is Sargeant Havers, who is sloppy and lonely, with a senile mother and money problems. As the novels progressed, Havers had a bigger and bigger role because she was simply more interesting than any of the other characters. But George was stuck with her original characters and her own success.Yet despite the main characters, her novels were topical and moving. She excelled in her descriptions of the victims of crime. They suffered from torn-from-the-headlines problems of modern-day England: racism, hopelessness among unemployed young, tabloid journalism, and so on. You wanted to read them even if it meant having to deal with bland Simon St. James and weepy Deborah.Her latest book, however, is about a *serial killer*. This means not one victim, but as many as can be crammed into one book. Therefore, you don't get the anticipated background and atmosphere, and this eliminates George's main strength. Worse, since all fictional serial-killers are alike, you have to spend yet *more* time with a guy who hears voices and rants on and on about his omnipotence. There's nothing original one can do with this kind of madman, and he's fatal to the book; you don't *care* who he turns out to be, you just want him to get arrested as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the book is endlessly long, trying to have someone eviscerated in every picturesque corner of London, giving each character a few chapters and a few soap-opera problems, throwing in an entire picturesque marketplace of red herrings. It simply isn't one of Elizabeth George's best.I hate to say it, but she needs to jettison this whole series and start over. She's too good a writer to be hobbled in this way."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Overall, I have to say that With No One as Witness is a pretty satisfying read but I do have a few complaints. First of all, the book is entirely too long - 627 pages! I appreciate the fully developed characters but enough is enough. The best place for editing, in my opinion, would be the plodding aspects of the inner strife within the police department. Boring beyond belief and it brings the narrative to a screeching halt every time. And we know by now that the author loves the English colloquially but it seems that she throws it in every chance she gets and it seems contrived.Aside from these quibbles, if you can stick with it, this is, at times, a very good read with suspenseful sequences, a very vile serial killer and a daring plot development that is extremely sad. I just have one challenge to Ms. George - can you write a novel that is under 400 pages???"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"I've run out of patience with Elizabeth George.

I was especially disappointed with A Place of Hiding, which did not feature Inspector Lyley, but was looking forward to the next book in which, George promomised, \\"all her cast would be back.\\" They are -- but all their lives are destroyed through Helen's pointless death. I'm not looking for mindless happy endings, but I expect a certain rigor and plausibility in my mystery novels. If I want my main characters killed just because they're \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time,\\" I'll read John Irving. thumbs down to this book."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Highly recommended!With No One as Witness is one of the most memorable of the Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers novels. If you haven't read this book yet, you have a great treat ahead of you. The book uses its over 600 page length well to deliver a deliciously complex plot in a detailed police procedural with lots of great forensics, action, suspense and interesting character developments.As the book opens, a teenager who favors Boy George makeup and impersonating famous female singers heads out to meet with \\"friends.\\" By the next morning, Kimmo Thorne has become a murder statistic, the victim of a strange mutilation that seems like the work of an unusually deranged mind. Clearly, this could be a serial killer at work . . . and the police begin to realize that three other young men have experienced a similar fate. But no one has taken their deaths seriously . . . they're just \\"throwaway boys\\" of black or mixed race parentage.Anticipating a public relations firestorm tied to charges of racism in not investigating the earlier murders very well, the ultimately annoying Assistant Commissioner David Hillier focuses on managing press relations . . . even while he hampers the actual investigation with his \\"directions.\\" While Acting Superintendent Lynley and Detective Constable Havers gnash their teeth in extreme frustration, Hillier pushes them to the brink of rebellion. Newly promoted Detective Sergeant Winston Nkata finds himself the token black in Hillier's playbook and doesn't appreciate this abuse of his identity, but usually manages to bite his tongue.Throughout the story, the narration alternates among Lynley, Havers, Nkata, the serial killer and Ulrike Ellis, the head of a nonprofit agency for boys in trouble with the law. That makes the story more interesting by changing perspectives and varying the pacing.Each of the major characters has the usual problems to deal with. Lynley's wife is expecting their first child and the in-laws are in an uproar about which christening garments to use. Havers is still smarting from her demotion, her car barely runs and she's annoyed with a neighbor who's too protective of his daughter. Nkata continues to be attracted to an unsuitable woman who spurns him while worrying about her son. The serial killer wants attention and is annoyed at how slow the police are to catch on. Ellis is losing her self-control with a married man, and her job is collapsing around her. Those touches humanized what is otherwise a very grim and dark tale.As the investigation begins, the killer finds himself needing to kill again and again. That puts further pressure on the police to stop the potential rampage. How will it end? Badly, of course.Police procedurals about stopping serial killers can be the most rewarding part of the genre if the author keeps the reader off balance about the who, what and why of the next step in the story. Ms. George does a commendable job of keeping the killer's identity shrouded until quite late in the book. Her misdirection is excellent and unforced. Yet she lets us in on the mind of the killer in a rewarding way that sets up the contest of hunted versus hunters very well. This is the best mystery I have read about a serial killer in many years.I especially liked the way that breakthrough clues seemed to be about to unravel the killer's identity, but would actually turn into plot complications instead. These turns in the story were delicious in their ironies.The book's main drawback is that the story involves the most disgusting types of sexual child abuse. If you have a weak stomach for that particular form of perversion, this story will thoroughly disgust you.The book also achieves true pathos with a heart-rending tragedy during the investigation that will move all readers to sadness.I seldom stay up past 1 a.m. to finish a book, but With No One as Witness kept me going last night until 2:17 with this one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Although Elizabeth George has received some criticism for the turn this book takes (and I won't reveal), she never fails to amaze with the complexity and flesh-and-blood realness of her characters. The fast pace and twisting plot here will keep you reading way past your bedtime, while the depth and evolution of her characters and their relationships will make you feel like you know and love them yourself. Yes, there is sadness here, but you may shed a tear or two for the warmth, tenderness and loyalty shown in these characters' lives as well as the tragedies they endure. I have read eight of Elizabeth George's books, and this is the best one I have read to date. I'm so glad I haven't read them all yet!"},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"The murder mystery itself was not that exciting but I really enjoyed the character development of Lynley, Havers and Nkata. The tragedy in Lynley's personal life was disheartening but perhaps life will improve in the future. I'm not sure why George put that twist in - it was a surprise to me. I recommend the book and can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"This was the first George novel I ever purchased-quickly read it and then proceeded to read the series again from beginning to end.The novel was well done. The police solving of the case and the red herrings they encountered can account for the almost 800 pages. The soap opera aspects all leading up to the denouncement for the title series character were often distracting to the main action. The character written out was,perhaps, the biggest \\"symbol\\" of the past -of what English life was- and what appeals to most Anglophiles. The story,itself, is out of today's headlines in modern day London and England and probably most\\"first world\\" cities and countries -some have mentioned the atmosphere of the novel.George continues to explore the \\"seamier\\" sides of life and crime. The serial killer and the story reminded me a great deal of another novel in a different time and place with a similar theme-The Alienist by Caleb Carr. Having said that Carr is far more descriptive and graphic. Her next novel from reports minimally uses any of her recurring characters and is basically a parallel story. It appears this was a kind of compromise so that WNOAW was not longer than it turned out. From a recent interview a least one of her characters, Lynley, will return in mystery set in Cornwall-the seat of his earldom- where at the end of this novel he returns.George began her series with a \\"shocking social ill\\" murder and her lastest goes in that direction. The eleven novels in between has dealt with those aspects in various degrees.The death of the recurring character for any one who reads this kind of fiction probably is not as horrifying as it appears it was for some readers. I personally never found the character with her general incompetence,sartorial obsession and massive indecisiveness all that charming. Initally George wrote her \\"stronger\\" and potentially interesting than what she eventually evolved to be in this last novel. By this novel through the development of the courtship and marriage the character had more or less been gutted and became a domestic distractive reflection for the main detective character. Her evolution was backward.Not the finest of the George series but not the worst either. What happens now in the series will be interesting to see. It almost appears we may see more separate storyline novels with the old gang not what it use to be."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"As an avid Elizabeth George Lynley/Havers series reader, this book is one of the better in the series from the crime/mystery perspective, although to agree with another of the reviewers, you would not start with this book, but go back to the earlier releases.But after I finished, my only thought is that the next novel in this series is either going to make or break it. In the same vein as PD James, Ruth Rendell, Reginald Hill, Stephen Booth, Ian Rankin, etc. you read these books for the mysteries themselves, but also because you have come to care for the characters.In this series, I now find some of the characterization just annoying, as the reviewer 'Nina' mentioned, Elizabeth George is to a certain extent confined by the original characters she created and in some ways the death of one of the characters in this book may mean that this has been realised. Although I was not expecting it and was extremely saddened at the end of this book.For myself, I loathe Deborah St James, who just comes across to me as just the most miserable, self absorbed female I have ever had the misfortune to read about and if I'm honest, in recent books, I just glance over the bits where she appears and 'A Place of Hiding' was just torture. In turn Simon St James, who I have a lot of sympathy and respect for, just annoys me because he puts up with her.Barbara Havers is superb as are Lynley and Helen, but the author needs to be careful that Havers does not become a caricature. I realise she's slothful in her personal habits, but in this book, I felt that it was pushed to an disrespectful level in places.This is not really a review, but the comments of a reader who has loved most of the books in this series, but it is getting to the stage where I have serious reservations about some of the main characters and for others not happy with the way they are now being written.Time will tell."},{"Title":"With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)","review":"Please, reviewers, dont ruin a major story development for the rest of us. Please consider that a lot of people come to these reviews BEFORE they read the book, and when you reveal the fate of a major character, you really take away from the full reading enjoyment of others. Telling me the book is great is of small value when you ruin a major plotline.That said, this is a worthy companion to the previous Elizabeth George novels. I shed a tear or two at the end, which is unusual to say the least. This is an engrossing, educational read and right up there with George's best."},{"Title":"The Italian Woman","review":"This is the second book in Plaidy's trilogy about Catherine Medici. In it, Medici's love and ambitions for her children as well as her quest for revenge against those who had humiliated her for so long forms the skeleton of the story. Her husband is dead and Catherine is Queen Regent. Her son Francis, now King of France and husband of Mary Queen of Scots, is sickly. Catherine yearns for her second son, Henry, to gain the throne.Passion, intrigue and murder -- what else would one expect from the infamous Borgias of Rome? Plaidy's style is entertaining and literate. She weaves history into stories with intricate plots. Characters who were once real people strut upon the literary stage expressing their feelings and frustrations, loves and hates. The reader experiences sights and sounds of a world long past, with voices of people who may or may not have spoken as Plaidy reports.It really doesn't matter how much is fiction and how much is fact. The book is fine, mesmerizing reading.Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)"},{"Title":"The Italian Woman","review":"The Italian WomanThe Italian Woman, by Jean Plaidy.This book is the second of Plaidy's trio of books about Catherine de Medici. It also works as a stand-alone work, however.In general, I thoroughly enjoy Jean Plaidy's books, so I was a little surprised that this one didn't really capture me and pull me in. In the first place, I found it highly annoying that the first part of the book focused nearly exclusively on someone whose relationship to Catherine de Medici went completely unmentioned. It was quite some time before I figured out who the woman was and why she might be important in a story about Catherine de Medici. Also, I found this book a bit tedious after a while -- the scheming of the two factions became repetitive, and there was simply not enough variety to keep my imagination fully engaged.On the other hand, for someone who is familiar with the Catherine de Medici story and that period of French history, this is a nice addition to other versions of Catherine's life. There is nothing particularly objectionable about the writing, but at the same time the story is a little lacking in energy and momentum.Over all, not a bad read, but not a real page-turner either. 3 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Italian Woman","review":"This is another interesting story told by Jean Plaidy about Catherine De Medici. As always Ms Plaidy delivers on a story well told and thought out. It is almost like she was actually there.Catherine De Medici is an enigmatic character in history who is understood by very few.I have alway wonder what was her relationship like with Mary Stuart among other historical figures in her life.I highly recommend this read."},{"Title":"The Italian Woman","review":"I know Jean Plaidy is considered a doyenne of historical fiction, thanks to her immaculate research and attention to detail. And I hate when a historical novel gets the facts wrong. But historical accuracy alone does not a gripping novel make. I felt that Plaidy forgot the cardinal rule of good writing: Show, don't tell. Instead we got lots and lots of telling--in sometimes clunky syntax to boot. The end result was that I felt I'd learned a lot about Catherine de Medici, her children and her court, but my senses and emotions were never involved."},{"Title":"The Italian Woman","review":"A superb novel, one of my favourite book I have ever read. Jean Plaidy is able to convert history into an interesting book which people can get absorbed in without a problem. Its an easy book to read with treachery, murder and romance. It has a wide range of vocabulary and I have learnt many new words from reading this book. I recommmend this book for anyone over 14 years old."},{"Title":"DOCTOR (Dr) SYN","review":"\\"Doctor Syn\\" is the seventh and last in chronological sequence, although it was the first book written, of Russell Thorndike's seven highly entertaining novels about the Reverend Doctor Syn, the apparently harmless vicar of Dymchurch in Kent who led a secret life as a pirate and smuggler.The full series is:1)Doctor Syn on the High Seas(the vicar who became a pirate)2)Doctor Syn Returns(the pirate who became a vicar)3)The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn(the scarecrow who became a hero)4) THE COURAGEOUS EXPLOITS OF DOCTOR SYN(the captain who became a threat)5)The Amazing Quest of Doctor Syn(the legacy which became a liability)6)The Shadow of Doctor Syn(the smuggler who became a legend)7) Doctor Syn(The marsh that became a mystery)The Nightriders are the most successful smuggling gang in Kent. Their mysterious leader, a masked figure known only as \\"The Scarecrow\\" has outwitted every customs officer or other opponent who ever tried to catch him. There are even rumours that he might be a ghost.Certainly nobody could imagine that their mysterious leader \\"The Scarecrow\\" could possibly be the mild-mannered vicar of Dymchurch, Dr Syn. Yet there appears to be some connection between the harmless clergyman and the notorious pirate, Captain Clegg, who had been hanged many years before ..."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Fallen Standard-Bearer","review":"Confessions of a Fallen Standard-Bearer is a beautiful book. The story involves two families, that of Yakov Zinger and Pyotr Yevdokimov. The story is told in the form of a memoir of their youth written by Pyotr's son Alyosha to Yakov's son Arkady. The story unfolds slowly.On the surface the memoirs invoke memories of the children's summers in their village. They were young pioneers filled (apparently) with a belief in the inevitable victory of socialism. As the name of this novel implies they were the standard-bearers of socialist youth marching towards the \`radiant horizon'. However, flowing beneath the beautiful words evoking their idyllic summers is the undertone of tragedy that envelops each of the families' pasts. Those tragedies are slowly and inexorably revealed. Pyotr, a sniper operating behind German lines during the Second World War lost both limbs at the hands of an \\"unfortunate artillery mistake' by his own troops. Yakov survived a German prison camp in Poland by surrounding himself with a mountain of dead and frozen bodies. Their wives tragic pasts are also slowly revealed. One survived the siege of Leningrad and witnessed unspeakable horrors in the process. The other lost her parents to Stalin's purges and spent her youth in an orphanage for children of those purges.As these stories are revealed the boys' otherwise inexplicable actions leading up to their confrontation with their Pioneer group leaders becomes slightly more understandable. I cannot convey the beauty of this book in adequate terms. Its power lies in the contrast between the beauty and power of Makine's writing about village life through the eyes of innocent children and the stark but unexpressed horror that percolates through the lives of these two families. This unstated horror serves as the thematic counterpoint to the rather unremarkable events that form the core of the narrative. This was a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Fallen Standard-Bearer","review":"Andre Makine, who fled the Soviet Union in 1987 when he was thirty has been compared to Nabokov, Pasternak, and Proust. The author is a gifted story-teller with &quot;Confessions&quot; filled with skillfully-woven vignettes that provide a bitter-sweet view of Russian life. The book revolves around two friends and virtual brothers, Arkady and Alyosha, young pioneers in Stalin's postwar world. &quot;Confessions&quot; tells of the lives of their two families, those of Yakov Zinger - Arkady's father, and Pyotr Yevdokimov, father to Alyosha. There is adventure in Pyotr's skill as a sniper behind German lines in World War II, horror in the story of Svetlana, the &quot;merry spinster&quot; amidst survival during the Siege. There are magical scenes of Russian life and a most enjoyable vignette that revolved around the arrival of propaganda cinema presenting &quot;The Threat of Atomic War&quot;, tirades against the &quot;filthy American swine&quot; and the bombing of Hiroshima and the exhortation from Russian authorities to build shelters. There is humor with Arkady on the drums and Alyosha on the trumpet bleating their protest against the apparitchik visitors from the Party but more singing out in the name of their Courtyard of families and friends, singing &quot;in the name of the silence of our mothers&quot;. Alyosha is a fallen standard-bearer. Makine structures the book with Alyosha as narrator addressing his remembrances of their families' lives to his friend. In the end, Makine imparts a heaviness of heart with disillusionment with the Soviet dreams of Great Victory and a feeling of emptiness that the West (neither of Paris, nor of the States) has not been able to fill."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Fallen Standard-Bearer","review":"Alyosha's narrative to his long lost friend is a short but beautiful story about coming of age in harsh conditions and how friendships can massively effect more than just the immediate friends. While almost all people go through stages of their life when they wake up and see that the organizations they are a part of have ideals that conflict with reality, I was glad to see that this theme didn't weigh the story down where the whole book became a bitter diatribe against the system.I wish this book could have been longer. It felt like it was almost a summary, a tasty nibble of a great book. It was a nice read anyway."},{"Title":"Too Precious to Die","review":"This book is about how one family dealt with the death of a child and the strength and comfort they received during the experience through God.

There are few unnecessary words. The smooth flow effortlessly carries the reader along.Phillips can turn a phrase with the best of them. He writes, \\"It was a time of the year when the earth seemed fresh and alive and full of hope, and when you just couldn't help thinking that no matter what happened, somehow everything was going to turn out all right.\\"The realism gives a glimpse of life through the eyes of a runaway slave. The cruelty and hardships that Jake Patterson experience as a boy leave him with deep-seated anger and resentment. He blames his father for leaving when in reality his dad was deliberately sold to separate Jake's family. After his mother dies from an attack by a drunken white man, Jake flees out of fear that someone will find out about a terrible secret that he carries. It's one that haunts him on his journey to reconnect with his father and find himself.Jake begins to soften when he experiences the kindness of others. He learns that not all white people are oppressors. Along the way he meets two young women, one white and one black, who struggle to keep a plantation going. The black woman, a former slave, takes up the narrative half way through the book. This is a classic coming of age story in the post-Civil War south.It's also the first book in the Carolina Cousins series, which is related to the popular Shenandoah series.Occasional reflections are especially rewarding. One character offers an observation on an overlooked response to hardship. \\"Anger's not a pretty thing. It makes people miserable inside. Then there's other folks that get sad and discouraged at all the hardships that come in their lives. Maybe they don't get angry, but they go around being sad and miserable and letting people know it. They want people to feel sorry for them, and that's not too pretty to see either.\\"Another section includes an insight on what it means to be a man. \\"Most men go through life trying to prove how brave and tough they are. But a real man is one with courage to face what's inside where no one else sees. Growing into a man with that kind of courage is a hard thing. But it's the only way to be a whole man.\\"Phillips has honed his writing skills to near perfection. He is at the top of his craft, which is why I enjoyed this as much as any of the books that he has written. It's a light, pleasurable read."},{"Title":"A Perilous Proposal (Carolina Cousins #1)","review":"During the Civil War slave child Jake detests his yoke and though young shows open signs of rebellion against his master in spite of the warnings from his father. Jake's anger explodes when his dad vanishes as he assumes foul play. Out pf control, he kills a white drifter who he caught molesting his mother. Knowing that in the Confederacy, no black can get justice when a white is involved, Jake runs away.Confederate soldiers capture Jake, but he escapes and joins the Union army. There he meets a kind mentor, Micah, a black soldier, who counseled the lad to let his anger go. Holding a grudge, he deserts the army heading to North Carolina where he is shocked to meet up with his father and a young black woman Mayme who he falls in love with. Even in this southern state Jake goes out of his way to alienate whites who burn crosses on their lawn.Using the Civil War as a backdrop, Michael Phillips provides a rousing exciting inspirational tale that makes a strong case that racism destroys everyone even the innocent. Jake is a fabulous protagonist struggling with devastating blows to his heart. He knows he must forgive his father for deserting his mother and him, but finds it difficult to do so in spite of the encouragement of several women including Mayme to let it go so that he can move on.

The first section of the book (about a hundred pages) provides the most comprehensive argument for the independence of the Gospel of Thomas from the canonical Four Gospels in a form accessible to the general reader. With this, Patterson refutes the claim that the Gospel of Thomas is a worthless second century Gnostic epitome that just put together a mish-mash of biblical quotes. Instead, Patterson argues, the Gospel of Thomas represents an autonomous tradition about Jesus, confirmatory and complementary of the synoptic tradition. The second part of the book deals with the setting of the Gospel of Thomas, which Patterson portrays as itinerant radicalism in Syria in the second half of the first century. The final chapter concerns the importance of the Gospel of Thomas for the historical Jesus. Patterson maintains that the Gospel of Thomas provides fresh evidence against the apocalyptic portrait of Jesus, because the Gospel of Thomas does not have any of the end-time speculation found in the synoptic Gospels. I recommend this book highly to any student of early Christianity."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas and Jesus (Foundations & Facets Reference)","review":"This book was written by a professor and proves for me that the Gospel of Thomas was a separate tradition and not a gnostic corruption of the biblical gospels. Patterson goes into the linguistics of the Coptic Gospel of Thomas and the Greek biblical Gospels to show that Thomas stands alone in its own tradition.This book was intended more for the highly educated with Coptic and Greek interwoven with the text at the beginning of the book. I can read Koine Greek and I had a difficult time reading and understanding the first half of the book due to the Coptic. You are are curious about the Gospel of Thomas this book will educate you.

Singer, author of \\"Mother Flies Hurricanes\\") An enlightening, engaging account of many of the early women pioneers in aviation, and of the contributions that women pilots made to the war effort in WWII. The women of Britain's Air Transport Auxiliary are featured, but the American WASPs get only a very brief mention in the chapter bio on Jacqueline Cochran. My favorite chapter is \\"Those Good Old Crazy Days in America,\\" which features many pre-Earhart aviatrixes such as Harriet Quimby and her friend Matilde Moisant. One of them lost her life in a freak aerial accident; the other cheated death in spectacular fashion. Then there are the intrepid Stinson sisters, who with their mother founded Stinson Aviation Company. (A Stinson Reliant plays a key role in \\"Mother Flies Hurricanes.\\") The women barnstormers (the origin of that word is explained in this book) are a real kick! Two ex-waitresses entertained crowds with their aerial antics; another woman, Mabel Cody, was famous for her signature stunt, the \\"Iron Jaw Spin.\\" Women of the Air also features other women barnstormers and wingwalkers, whose stunts would probably reduce the average male to a quivering mass of terror at the prospect (proving that you don't need to be a guy to have balls!) For sheer audaciousness, no one can touch The Hon. Mrs. Victor Bruce (Mary to her friends) who in 1930 embarked on a round-the-world journey from her native England just a few weeks after getting her flying license! Not totally aerial, though; she wisely went by ship across the Atlantic and Pacific. Still, she did have adventures galore: abduction by an amorous Armenian, a forced landing in the Middle East which resulted in a rather unpleasant episode with a cross-dressing desert tribesman, an embarrassing incident in San Diego in which she mistook a military review for a reception in her honor, and lots, lots more (proving that you don't need to be American to be wild and crazy!) Did she finally get back to dear old England? Read this book and find out! For more recommendations on books about women pilots and about the women of Britain's Air Transport Auxiliary, visit the motherflieshurricanes.com website."},{"Title":"Women of the Air","review":"The author is from England and more information is given about foreign pilots. While women from the United States are included in this book, others who had places in aviation history are covered. Included are: Amy Johnson(England), Nancy Bird (Australia), Jean Batten (New Zealand), Beryl Markham (Africa), Hanna Reitsch (Germany), Pauline Gower (England), Jacqueline Auriol (France), and Sheila Scott (England). From the U.S.: The Stinson Sisters, Amelia Earhart, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and Jacqueline Cochran. Early aviation (1783 - 1930)is covered. I like reading about the achievements of women aviators outside the USA."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"This was an enjoyable enough mystery. It began well, but did drag at parts in the second half. I liked Lupica's Wild Pitch (for adults)and Travel Team (for kids) much more. It seemed that Lupica was trying to appeal to both audiences with this book, and did okay with both, but this was not a home run (or I should say a 3 point swish). I would most recommend this to teen readers who are in between kid and adult reads."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"I want to start out by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Lupica's other works, but this one is not one I would ever recomend to anyone. The story is well written and has his signature style, humor, and plot twists; but was way too disturbing for my tastes. If you want this story watch an episode of Oz. If you want a really good read stick to the Peter Finely or Jack Molloy series."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Lupica's book ended up being a page-turner, but it sure didn't start out that way. The author's weird syntax and writing style - as if he was trying to reinvent grammar and punctuation rules - take a lot of getting used to, especially considering how ordinary the events in the book are.By the time I was used to the writing style, and didn't have to keep rereading sentences to see if they made sense, I was already past page 75. Some readers might very well have given up on the story by then, and I don't know anybody who would blame them.This was Lupica's first foray into Harlan Coben territory. He has his pinky toe on the property line, but needs to work on getting his whole foot there."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Lupica writes lean and mean! No 19th century adverbs, like \\"he said coldly\\" \\"she said anxiously\\" that mess up so many other novels.Lupica should teach writing techniques to others who cant write dialogue without \\"explaining it\\" to readers with purple prose nonsense like \\" she tittered/ grimaced/scowled angrily\\". Nope, this author does not insult your intelligence.It is \\" he said/ she said\\" and it sets the tone for a sharp and crackling novel that features some of the snappiest dialogue in recent fiction. We learn everything through the eyes of characters, and Lupica keeps his point of view constant. We are inside the head of only one person in each scene. Brilliant technique.The plot has been reviewed by many others and I won't repeat what has been said before. I just want to acknowledge an author who writes without patronizing intrusions and without endless irritating adverbs and double adjectives and who never talks down to his readers buy \\"telling\\" us what we can figure out by ourselves!"},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"At first, I thought this was going to be a preachy politically correct sermon on hazing. Then I thought it to be a yarn promoting wonderful journalism (Lupica's main career). However, soon into the book, I realized that this was a darn good mystery/thriller. Coben's jacket blurb was not an empty compliment.There is the hazing component and the journalist hero, but the digging by the journalist and the student reporter who idealizes him is captivating.The setting is a rich Long Island town that is enraptured by its basketball team. This year, though, it is even more centered around its team than usual. A ghetto star of NBA caliber has joined the hometown's star player to produce a team ESPN is aching to televise. When the team manager ends up dead, the drama begins. The high school reporter gets wind that the death has something to do with the team and he enlists the big time journalist who has quit and returned to his hometown.The journalist begins to suspect hazing, even though there is no real evidence to support the suspicion (a weakness of the book which led to the thought early that this book would preach).The young and the old begin to unravel the mystery as they are threatened and more players on the team are hurt or threatened as well.This is a well-told tale. The plot twists and turns and the good guys are ot always right, which always adds to their credibility. This was a highly enjoyable book that avoided sermonizing and just told the gruesome tale."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Lupica is at the very least consistent. He is consistently bad.Story lacked depth and intrique to keep a reader interested. Recommend if you having trouble with a sleep disorder."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Lupica has nailed the sports thriller, dead on. In this case, high school basketball and murder in what seems like a full-court press from beginning to end. It's nice to know that in an age of mystery-solving cats, amateur-sleuth vampires, and crime-happy psychics (why does it always take them a whole book to figure it out? If they were really psychics, wouldn't it be solved on Page One?) that there's a writer with a fresh style, good grasp of language and a fairly familiar rubric that we needn't suspend our disbelief for too long. Lupica is worth the investment. He shoots, he scores."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Lupica delivers again! This time with a little different style than he normally uses, not as much comedy in this one as there in his others. But still, a great book and one of my favorites of Lupica. Suspenseful, greaty storyline, he kept me guessing so much i could not put the book down. Literally. Read it in one day because everytime i would say \\"ok after this chapter i'll take a break\\" he would end a chapter with a phrase that makes you just keep going. Great writing style, very basic...but thats whats great about it. Read this book, you will have a great time trying to figure out the mystery, i know i did! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Lupica delivers another gem with his newest novel \\"Too Far\\". The characters are well developed and seem to come right out of your own town. This is a story with twists that you won't see coming, and characters that will keep you turning page after page.Few writers today have the wit and sharp writing style that Mike Lupica has mastered in his books and columns. This is probably his most underrated venture yet. Teens and Parents that loved \\"Travel Team\\" should read \\"Too Far\\" to see both ends of the spectrum, how teams can be a magical experience, but can also be a harrowing trip. This thriller shouldn't be put off. Go buy it today."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"In TOO FAR veteran sportswriter Mike Lupica has written a thriller from a moral high ground, a plea for tolerance and against sadistic hazing. In the wake of the notorious Mepham High School football scandal, this book comes as a wake up call. It would be fair to say that actually this novel is nothing more than the Mepham case with the names changed and the athletic action switched from the gridiron to the hoops; it's pretty transparent that way. Well, Upton Sinclair wasn't subtle either. Nor is any man on a crusade against sodomy.Old school print journalist Ben Mitchell gets interested in the death of a high school basketball player on Long Island, whose body has floated ashore. With the help of student reporter Sam Perry, Ben quickly maps out the lay of the land in a perverted, though very starry, b-ball organization. Its pecking order is maintained by a strict system of threats and balances, and a pivotal part of team control lies in systemic anal rape of fellow teammates. In one genuinely creepy scene, the boy reporter is lured to a desolate park in the woods where he is assaulted and sat on, his pants and shorts removed. From behind a broomstick, its handle coated in mineral ice to improve lubrication, enters his rectum as he squirms and cries, just an inch, that's all, enough to show him who's in control. When he agrees to lay off his investigation, his attackers laugh sadistically and promise him that if he doesn't obey their threats to the letter, that broomstick gets shoved in all the way.It's no idle threat. They've already made their will known by using a basketball summer camp as a rape staging area, pressing a pinecone up the ass of one outnumbered boy, whispering to him \\"You like to be close to nature, don't you?\\" The trouble is that this campaign of intimidation can continue indefinitely, since each raped boy would (literally) rather die than have his assault reported, for fear that other boys would say he enjoyed it. Sam is taunted with the nickname, \\"Broomstick Boy.\\" Others try suicide.Lupica links this isolated case to a nationwide system of sexual abuse among teammates, citing dozens of real life cases. He suggests provocatively that such abuse is built-in to teams with multiple \\"stars,\\" since such teams have a radical instability that implodes on itself. Shag and Kobe, he says, dislike each other, because on any team there can be only \\"one f--ing man.\\" These codes of masculinity may seem outdated, but to the guard with blood dripping out his butt, staining the radiant white of his uniform shorts, it's no laughing matter."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. It is about a high school sportswriter named Sam Perry who is covering the South Fork basketball team who are nationally recognized as a state competitor, but when he hears about the basketball team's manager getting murdered he goes to find Ben Mitchell from the town who has been writing for ESPN for help on the story. Ben and Sam dig in to the story to find any help he can get about the murder. They ask the players and coaches, and anyone else who can give them the needed information. They eventually find out it was a member of the basketball team. This book was kind of predictable from kind of the beginning, so for the whole book you kind of know who it is going to be."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"The basic concept of Lupica's latest is a strong, i.e., hazing and murder in a small town. However, Lupica's execution of the plot is fairly slow-moving and predictable, and his characters are devloped with little depth. They are one-dimensional at best, making it difficult for me to care much about what happened to them. Given the blurbs from two authors I like a lot (Harlan Coben and Robert Parker), I had high expectations for Too Far and had moved it to the top of my \\"to-be-read\\" list. As you can see, though, from my comments above, my disappoint in this book is obvious and I will not be rushing out any time soon to read another book by Lupica. Do yourself a favor and skip this book."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"This book is good in a way because it does show how team hazing can be tragic; however, as far as reading enjoyment goes, I'd skip this one. It's about a reporter who digs to find out what really happened to the high school's basketball team's manager in spite of getting a big run around by the whole team. It really shows a dark side to school sports.Karen Arlettaz Zemek, Author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\""},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"The cover blurbs mentioned \\"plot twists\\", \\"mystery\\", and \\"suspense\\". In fact, it's very linear and (spoiler alert?) everything happens EXACTLY as you think it will. I kept waiting for the twists but they never came. I like books about athletes, athletic team dynamics, and youth sports issues, so this looked appealing. Not a bad read, but pretty ho-hum."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Mike Lupica has once again solidified his position as the premier author of our time in sports related books. Too Far is a long overdue wake-up call for the parents of all high school and college atheletes. Hazing in sports has been shoved under the carpet for too long and Lupica is to be applauded for bringing it to the surface in a captivating format. Too Far is a thrilling ride that leaves the reader emotionally charged!"},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"In Mike Lupica's latest novel, \\"Too Far,\\" we are presented with an interesting concept: the exploration of team pushed to and beyond the limit. The idea of participating on a team is very real to us, as we've all done so before, and we all know what it's like. Lupica's story takes the idea of competition to the extreme, and in the process, loses a base of reality. It would have been a much wiser decision on Lupica's part to explore a high school team plagued with realistic problems that the layperson could relate to. The rampant sensationalism and melodrama that characterize \\"Too Far\\" prevent Lupica from doing justice to a good concept. Finally, Lupica is unable to keep his writing strong throughout. Witticisms are disseminated throughout large sections of uninteresting prose and poorly done dialouge. On the whole, one would expect more out of Lupica; this is sub-standard work."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Mike Lupica writes a mean sports novel. His latest, Too Far, is no exception...A \\"retired\\" sportswriter, Ben Mitchell, is trying to figure out what he wants to do after quitting his job over someone killing himself over a story. While he's killing time in the small town he came from, a high school reporter, Sam Perry, introduces himself and asks for advice on how to proceed on a story where he has information no one else has. The manager of the small town high school basketball team has turned up dead from a beating. It looks to be related somehow to a hazing incident during a team camp. When another player on the team and friend of Perry also shows \\"injuries\\" that might be part of the hazing, things start heating up. Mitchell starts coaching Perry on how to handle the story, but soon it evolves into an effort to keep Perry, his mom, and himself from getting severely beaten or even killed. Since the team is arguably the best high school team in the country, no one wants to rock the boat or expose anything that might be wrong. Mitchell and Perry have to decide how important it is to tell the story and uncover the truth, no matter how unsavory it might be...This is not a novel for the squeamish. Lupica deals with the issue of hazing, or team initiation events that go far beyond playful pranks. In this case, sexual abuse is the problem, and the kids who were abused have to live with what happened as well as knowing that everyone else knows what happened. Add the pressure and threats to keep it quiet, and you start to understand the anguish involved on the part of the kids. You also come to understand the pressures involved by a reporter when they have to choose between the easy path of ignoring a story (sometimes for their own safety) or the harder route of exposing the truth regardless of the personal cost. Lupica does a great job in telling a well-written story with real issues faced in today's society.If you're not easily offended by difficult subjects, this is an excellent read..."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"It wasn't predictable as other mysteries can be. Great book, good read. It isn't at the top of my favorites list, though."},{"Title":"Too Far","review":"Considering this is Lupica's first suspense/mystery novel, I thought it was pretty good. Picked it up on a bargain rack for 99 cents and couldn't put it down. I say it's worth the money. As for all of these people saying this isn't real life and that he should write about real life situations and problems, they have obviously never been on a team because hazing is real, and sometimes it does go this far."},{"Title":"Twelve Tales of Murder (Oxford Twelves)","review":"Jack Adrian's anthology of murder stories in the Oxford Twelves series is an agreeably fiendish collection supplying enough chills and thrills to last through many a dark and stormy night. As usual, the anthologists in this series comb through the 19th and early 20th centuries for their wares and the authors represented are both famous and obscure. The gruesomeness of the murder methods in &quot;An Illustration of Modern Science&quot; (1896) would meet with the approval of Hannibal Lecter himself, and Conan Doyle would be hard pressed to conjure up a more sinister portrait of London than the one we see in &quot;Fogbound&quot; (1903). As for the disquieting &quot;Portrait of a Murderer&quot; (1942), it leaves the reader with a completely new perspective on the meaning of fatherly love.

The pair has been in a state of suspended animation for fifteen hundred years. Changes in the earth's features as well as monstrously mutated \\"humans\\" make it clear they have little hope of survival. The pair organize their resources to face the savage alternatives about them and the closeness created by their mutual interdependency inevitably kindles romance between Allan and Beatrice.In Book Two, Beyond the Great Oblivion, Allan and Beatrice begin to discover the nature of the catastrophe that has split the Earth open.

Just his luck, Allan is a master engineer and can make explosives, build bridges, fly bi-planes, etc. Beatrice is the gorgeous, spunky blond along for the ride (she even gets kidnapped by a giant gorilla at one point!).In the first part the discussion is of what happened, and how they will save themselves and rebuild civilization (but in a utopian manner without private wealth). In the second they find a bi-plane, that Allan can make run on alcohol and begin the search for other survivors. They encounter a great rent in the earth (west of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi) which they are unable to fly across. They end up in the Abyss and meet up with a tribe of white haired albinos who still speak a type of English (the are called Meruccans...some one call Mr.Spock).In the third book, Allan marries Beatrice (they finally have sex after two years running around half-naked) and with the people of the Abyss set off to build a new civilization on the surface. Yes they run into a few problems along the way (mostly a tribe of semi-human flesh eaters), but Allan is always able to work things out, with Beatrice by his side. (He calls her 'little girl' and she calls him 'boy'.) The story actually ends with the two of them much older, sitting on their porch watching the sun go down!If you don't keep in mind that this was written before every bad sci-fi movie/book you have seen/read; it's an amazing accomplishment, though a little juvenile.

Beyond the Great Oblivion3, The AfterglowWritten by George Allan England (1877-1937), an American writer and explorer, the story introduces us to Allan Stern and Beatrice Kendrick who have miraculously survived an Earth-destroying cataclysm by going into suspended animation at the same time, in the same office, and waking up a millennium later at the exact same time for no definite reason ever explained.They then wander through the rest of the story having incredible adventures to rival the pulps of the classic age, express their love for each other (for pages and pages and pages), have more incredible adventures they survive by the skin of their teeth, express their love for each other for many more pages, express their disdain for religion and capitalism, face death square in the chops, express more of their love for each other, express how the new world they are going to rebuild will be a socialist paradise, fight to the death with a monster or two, express their love for each other, and ... well, you get the picture.Along the way we learn that concrete and steel are eternal, that 1,000-year-old food in the tin still tastes good, that Allan can rebuild a pre-WWI plane from deer hides, that fur coats stored carefully for a millennium can still be worn, that people can go into suspended animation and wake up with the clothes rotting off their bodies without any harm to themselves (or even feeling hungry), that a ten-century-old bullet can still fire without any problem, that air pressure does not change to any serious degree if you go to the bottom of a canyon that is well over 50 miles deep, and did I mention that concrete will outlast the heat death of the universe?And along the way, you'll probably read that Allan and Beatrice are rather fond of each other.And saints preserve us, but writing this review, I just realized that the author and the main character share the same name which means this story is a type of Mary Sue tale!Regardless, if you like pulp adventures with lots of action and high body counts, then you have just found paradise.Just don't analyze the tale too closely."},{"Title":"Darkness and dawn","review":"Other reviewers have offered a preview of the storyline of this interesting book here, so I will not revisit their efforts.Suffice to say that this is certainly an interesting trilogy, written well before sci-fi was something that we all are fascinated with, but alas it has dated badly, and I think that many people will find its apparent racism somewhat confronting.However, our hero is indeed heroic, and the heroine appropriately feisty and chaste, and their efforts to survive and establish a new society in the devestation of the old one are somewhat entertaining.It isn't great post apocolypse fiction, but it is certainly interesting as an example of an early attempt at this genre."},{"Title":"Darkness and dawn","review":"by George Allan England - a trilogy written around 1912 & the first of its kind, a science fiction, futuristic story of survival.

The book offers new way of developing web projects. The mode of operation is based on the famous methodology called &quot;Extreme Programming&quot; (XP). Until publication of this book, all of the non-compilation books on XP have come from those who were involved in its birth. This publication is the first title from the &quot;second generation&quot; of XP practitioners.This book is self-essential. However, if you would like to know more about economic and spiritual aspects of XP, digest the &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; by Kent Beck. Another valuable resource is &quot;Testing Extreme Programming&quot; by Lisa Crispin &amp; Tip House. It exhibits valuable web testing strategies.While the authors mostly rely on XP manifesto, they have adjusted the methodology to best fit their own needs. For example, they offer so-called zero-iteration, which sets up the framework, but have no business value to the customer. The parents of XP discourage this approach in &quot;Extreme Programming Installed&quot; by Ron Jeffries, Ann Anderson and Chet Hendrickson. Who are right? You decide."},{"Title":"Extreme Programming for Web Projects","review":"To get straight to the point, I was disappointed with this book. The book opens with great promise on how XP is going to change our world and revolutionize programming projects for the web. However, Wallace, Raggett, and Aufgang end up trying to bite off more than they could chew in a 150-page book.First, the authors assume you already know a great deal about extreme programming, which I did not prior to picking up this book. To their credit, they do refer you to Kent Beck's Extreme Programming Explored, recommending you to peruse it before reading their book. Unfortunately, this reference occurs in the Preface, and could easily be missed by readers who go straight to Chapter 1. Without this background, it's not hard to get lost - for example, the authors refer to CRC's without explaining what the acronym is or what it means - I had to check the index; indeed, CRC's are discussed (albeit briefly) much later in the book.Not to say that there aren't positives - I enjoyed Part II, the discussion of how to integrate XP practices into a development shop. But, the authors just do not go into enough detail, and leave me wanting more. You feel that this book could have either been a 20-page paper or a 500-page book, but not something in between. A 20-page paper would have simply highlighted the differences between XP development for non-web projects versus web projects. A 500-page book would have gone into detail on a number of concepts discussed in this book. But, this slimmer volume goes in between these two choices, and ends up not really doing an adequate job of either highlighting the differences or going into a good amount of detail about XP practices.Part III, a discussion of XML, was an awkward insertion into the text. The book goes from general management discussion to highly technical without warning, and you ask yourself within a few pages, \\"What the heck just happened here?\\" One minute they're talking about the importance of comfy chairs, and the next they're discussing recursive nested structures. It left my head spinning, and I'm not a technical wallflower. It almost seems like the authors had a 120-page book, thought it was too slim, and had to stuff an extra 30 pages in somehow.This book whetted my appetite, and I'm now interested in learning more. Maybe I'll take the authors' advice and read Kent Beck's book to get the detailed information I'm looking for, but did not get from Extreme Programming for Web Projects."},{"Title":"Extreme Programming for Web Projects","review":"I didn't get a lot out of the first half of this book. Part one tries to look at the basic principles and practices of XP from the perspective of a web team. Some of the material was a rehash of that found in other, better XP books such as the original, Extreme Programming Explained, by Kent Beck, or Extreme Programming Installed. The material that was new was not all that informative and I found that I disagreed with some of it.Part two had some painful parts as well, but the whole thing started to turn around for me in chapter 8 which discusses the graphic design process from the perspective of XP core values. This chapter is excellent and worth the price of the book, although I wish it was longer. I gladly would have bought an entire book which the same premise as chapter 8. It would have been nice to see a more explicit breakdown of XP core values as they relate to the graphic design process.Part three of the book discusses XML and XSLT as an alternative to classic web page architecture that allows for greater seperation of concerns and thus facilitates test-driven development. This is all well and good, but there are other good books on the subject, and there are an awful lot of alternatives approaches available (As a J2EE developer Apache Struts and Apache Cocoon both come to mind.) This section also could have been expanded into an entire book twice the size of this one which talked more explicitly about core XP values and practices and how XML/XSLT facilitated them. It would also be nice to see a comparison of one or more alternatives such as Apache Struts and/or .NET.The fourth and final section of the book discusses XP practices and how these can be adjusted to a web project. Again, I didn't get an awful lot out of this. It was not clear that the deviation from standard XP practice was necessarily an improvement or that it was caused by the inherent nature of web projects so much as the inexperience of the development team relative to XP."},{"Title":"Extreme Programming for Web Projects","review":"I would recommend this book for anyone who is NEW to XP and is starting a web project. The authors do a good job of explaining the XP process in the context of web development, but you should always start with the &quot;white&quot; book, _Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change_ by Beck.However, as an experienced XPer, I did not find anything new in this book from an XP point of view and a lot of the tweaks to XP that the authors discuss, we also did on my XP web development project."},{"Title":"Extreme Programming for Web Projects","review":"This book's premise is an interesting one: Does XP work for web projects, and if so then how does one go about implementing it? The authors are up front about the first question in the opening to Chapter 1: \\"Sort of\\" they say. The book's entire content struck me as a continuation of that statement.The book attempts to be a bit too general in many aspects: there's a lot of high-level coverage of XP tenets without much utility specific to web development. The general coverage of XP is nice, but you'll find better content in other works; however, the authors didn't intend for this to be a seminal work on XP anyway, so that's not a big issue.Several sections do provide good information specific to XP in web development, such as Chapter 8 (Graphics Design) and its emphasis on how to wrap customers in to the process early. Another example would be the discussion in Chapter 11 (Planning) on how the \\"customer\\" in web development differs a bit from what XP usually considers a \\"customer.\\"There's also a lot of good discussion at a high level on how the use of XML vice static HTML as data can greatly benefit the development process. There are good overviews of XML in general, XSLT from 30,000 feet, and a nice blurb on how the Tidy tool can help you keep out of trouble.The downside of this book is that too often it stretches too far to make the connection between XP and web development. It's not detailed enough as a reference for implementing XP practices, and it doesn't do a good enough job of tying web development into XP for those looking to solve that problem.The book is concise and well-written, but that doesn't make up for its fundamental weaknesses."},{"Title":"Extreme Programming for Web Projects","review":"XP for Web Projects is a very good configuration the XP approach for web site and web application development.

It shows a human hand and a hairy simian hand with a peanut between them; it isn't clear who is the giver and who is the receiver. The theme of this book is the ways in which we share the planet with other animal species and the things we have in common with each other. The cover photo shows a woman wearing a leopard coat, walking past a leopard in its cage. Photos of horses and dogs at work, a hog drinking beer, a squirrel eating matzoh and other animals going about their ordinary daily lives remind us of the ways in which we identify with and influence each other. What is particularly appealing about this book is the spontaneity and unpretentiousness of these photos which take us all over the world, from various locations in the United States to Europe and Africa. This book will delight anyone who has had a warm or interesting or unusual contact with an animal, and who hasn't?"},{"Title":"Animals","review":"An amazing and thought-provoking book! The simple title belies the depth of meaning of these photographs and the way they are arranged. When all is said and done, Art Shay will likely go down as an American icon, and works such as this will be the reason. You will surely find yourself wondering time and again, &quot;How did he get that shot?!&quot; Shay is not only a master of his equipment, but seems to have also mastered the art of being the fly on the wall that we all wish we could be at times.You owe it to yourself to go through this book at least three times. I suggest that you initially not read any of the notes, but dive right into the viewing. During your first perusal, it's probably best to look at each picture singly, absorbing the essence of each according to what it has to offer to you. As you turn the pages during your second viewing, notice how the two photographs facing you each time you turn a page relate to each other in some way - be it theme, animal type, photo structure...it's up to you to see it. (I apologize for giving this aspect away to those who would have noticed it on their own, but I saw no mention of it anywhere in the notes, and felt it too important a feature to allow to go unmentioned.)Now, before and during your third trip through the book, turn to Art Shay's notes at the front of the book, which tell the stories behind the photos. See if you aren't moved even further as you turn each page. Personally, after reading Shay's description of the animal control officer removing a cancer-ridden lady's only pet, I get teary-eyed every time I view that picture. Other pages now cause me to smile or laugh every time I turn to them.Animals indeed! Yes, this book has lots of pictures of animals, but once you jump on board you'll find yourself on the roller coaster ride of emotions that comes with being fully alive.Tickets, please!"},{"Title":"Social Capital (Key Ideas)","review":"This book was a nice overview of the field of work done over the past century around Social Capital.

They concluded that they should run away from Susannah's uncle's farm. Susannah has just been orphaned after her parent's death that occured up in Vermont. But there is a catch, it isn't so easy as it sounds. This takes place during the slavery times. The girls cut their hair and steal some old cloths that were once Susannah's cousin's cloths. They then packed all of their belongings and headed north. They have to overcome many of the challenges on their way and many dangers. They gain friends and enemies and have to run away from slavery. Susannah was from up north and when she was suddenly orphaned her only relative was her uncle. So she was brought down by her uncle to his farm in Virginia. Susannah never had a slave and her uncle's farm had many slaves. Susannah had her personnal slave, which was Bethlehem, and she tried to befriend her many times. She then persuaded Bethlehem to learn to read and write. Only Bethlehem knew that that was against the law and therefore Susannah had to persuade her. Over months Susannah kept it in her mind that she was going to runaway somtime soon but she never knew when that time was.Susannah and Bethlehem didn't want to be classified by race or color. Susannah knew it was wrong and she wanted to run away up to her home, Vermont. On the day of Susannah's run away, she told Bethlehem that this was the day and that was when Bethlehem surprised Susannah by telling her that she was going to go with her, no matter what. But there was a secret kept between them. Bethlehem wanted to go to Canada which is what she pointed to when Susannah showed Bethlehem where Vermont was.

The author really made all the events that dealt with discrimination. Also the belief that Susannah had for the black slave was so beautiful and that shows that some people really do care. I have not really read any books that really went along with this story but in the future will be filled with more of these types of books. The way that people were treated in the past and still today just makes the biggest different in the people that are here today. People to this day don't realize that all people have feelings and do care. The way blacks and slaves were treated in the past is just the biggest mess. &quot;How can the slaves make a living if the whites just give then the bare minute?&quot; asked Susannah.

They are running awayfrom a southern plantation. Susannah is an orphan who is trying to run back to Vermont whereshe used to live. Bethlehem is a slave who is trying to run to Canada to be free.They both made it to their destinations, and both are talking to Mary about their run away.The main character in this book is Susannah. Susannah is the main character becausein the story she was being strong and powerful. To me, I really think she was a good run awaythe way she was acting like a boy. When she got that big cut on her hand, she did notreally act like a girl. She was also a nice girl because she taught Bethlehem how to read.The main character, Susannah has a problem. The problem is Bethlehem and Susannah trying tonot get caught while they are running away. They are also trying to stay together and not get madat each other and break apart. This was the kind of problem that if you didn't have good friendship,you would probably would get in trouble by the people who they ran away from .To the problems, Susannah had a good friendship with Bethlehem. They had a couple of arguements, butdid not split up. They did not get caught, although they did see people who helped them out. Also, in theirarguements, they really didn't get mad, they settled it and then went onwith their runaway.

Alternating between 1855 (when Slavery was grimly legal) and the &quot;present&quot; of 1896, STEAL AWAY presents readers with a literary device known shared narratives, so that each girl very has the opportunity to give a first-person account of their flight from Virginia to the their new life up North. Both their modern counterparts, Mary and Free, are captivated, as elderly women whom they love and respect recount the details of this 40-year-old odyssey; the girls share their writing-down task, as they marvel at the pages--the seal of their lifelong devotion. Will two strange girls be able to bond, by the mere act of the retelling, for it was both a physical and an emotional journey to find freedom and Home?Thirteen-year-old Susannah is suddenly orphaned and forced to leave the family farm in Vermont, with all its precious memories of her parents, the boy next door, and her carefree existence. She must travel by train (an ordeal in itself) down to a new world, in Virginia, to the farm of her Reverend uncle, who firmly believes in the insitution of slavery. But Susannah will never fit into this genteel Southern society; she does not even know how to treat or address her own personal slave!Longing to put plantation life and its immoral abuse of dark-skinned human beings behind her forever, spunky Susannah resolves to run away and sneak back to the only home she has ever known. But she needs the help of more worldy-wise Bethlehem, to prepare for this dangerous enterprise. Suddenly circumstances force both girls to depart together, with a minimum of preparation. Beth longs for Canada--a place on a map where there is no slavery. Would she truly be safe in free Vermont? Susannah has also broken the law, for she taught Beth to read, and now is helping a slave escape from its rightful owner.Can two young teenage girls disappear without a trace, even disguised as boys? Will there be anyone to trust on this perilous undertaking? What do they know of the Undeground Railroad? Their relationship undergoes many transformations, as Susannah becomes increasingly dependent on her pessimistic companion for survival. Yet Bethlehem dreads the unspoken but inevitable fork in the road--where each one must choose which path leads to her true Home in a hostile world. A gripping tale which will captivate readers of all ages with its raw emotions and mutual coming of age; it offers implications for today's racial relations and should have won some Newbery award!"},{"Title":"Steal Away to Freedom","review":"The book was written well, but in a confusing format. Mary is writing down a story from her grandmother's childhood, with help from a girl named Free. The book however starts with a message from Mary to Free written later when they had grown up. This letter, and the one at the end as well, confused me and threw me off.The story being told is, as I said, about Mary's Grandmother. She was born in Vermont in a time before slavery was abolished. This is the story of how when her parents died she was sent to live in Virginia with her slave owning, preacher uncle. The fact that a preacher owns slaves confuses her because she has grown up in Vermont, and she is further set off balance by being given a slave named Bethlehem. They decide to run away, and throughout their travels you can't tell if they are friends or people who are determined that the other is a burden on them.For better historical fiction I suggest Ann Rinaldi"},{"Title":"Steal Away to Freedom","review":"This book was boring and swithes between years, which confused me, and wasnt very entertaining.

I believe the writer would have been more effective if she had followed the story's narrative in 1855 and then progressed until 1896.Sometimes, simple storytelling could be just as effective without using writer's devices like flashbacks. The book is aimed for young readers. Even though I'm not young, I was confused by how the book unfolded.

One thing I did like about this book is the way it started out it was one of the best parts of the book, it was very exciting and suspenseful. Although I liked the book pretty well it had some bad points, like it really moved way to fast and never stayed on one subject long enough so that you knew what it was talking about it was very confusing. At the end of the book it was really confusing because it mentioned characters that it hadn't mentioned since the beginning of the book so I didn't know exactly what it was talking about and I had to keep looking back. I have read books that are much better than this one but I have also read many books that are much worse. So that means that I think this book is pretty good. I also think that this book is mostly for older people to read because it is very in depth and very historic, most kids weren't alive in those days so they can't relate to it and sometimes what makes a book good is when you can relate to it. So grown ups can relate to it better if they were alive in those times but kids can't relate at all because they weren't alive."},{"Title":"Steal Away to Freedom","review":"The flight of Bethlehem and Susannah is unlike any other runaway story you have ever read. Though both are running to &quot;freedom&quot; together, the white orphan is not realy freed until 40 years after the black slave. Friendship and betrayal are closely examined in the story set in 1855 and 1896."},{"Title":"Steal Away to Freedom","review":"Steal Away is about two girls, Bethlehem and Susannah, that have bonded over a couple of months. They concluded that they should run away from Susannah's uncle's farm. Susannah has just been orphaned after her parent's death that occured up in Vermont. But there is a catch, it isn't so easy as it sounds. This takes place during the slavery times. The girls cut their hair and steal some old cloths that were once Susannah's cousin's cloths. They then packed all of their belongings and headed north. They have to overcome many of the challenges on their way and many dangers. They gain friends and enemies and have to run away from slavery.Susannah was from up north and when she was suddenly orphaned her only relative was her uncle. So she was brought down by her uncle to his farm in Virginia. Susannah never had a slave and her uncle's farm had many slaves. Susannah had her personnal slave, which was Bethlehem, and she tried to befriend her many times. She then persuaded Bethlehem to learn to read and write. Only Bethlehem knew that that was against the law and therefore Susannah had to persuade her. Over months Susannah kept it in her mind that she was going to runaway somtime soon but she never knew when that time was.Susannah and Bethlehem didn't want to be classified by race or color. Susannah knew it was wrong and she wanted to run away up to her home, Vermont. On the day of Susannah's run away, she told Bethlehem that this was the day and that was when Bethlehem surprised Susannah by telling her that she was going to go with her, no matter what. But there was a secret kept between them. Bethlehem wanted to go to Canada which is what she pointed to when Susannah showed Bethlehem where Vermont was.This story is definitely worth reading just to find out the personal lives of two very unique children with a very large dream. I definitely recommend this book to anyone out there and it should be read by many students and teachers alike. This story should only be read by older children though because it is confusing in the ways that it was written and all of the different points of view."},{"Title":"Travels with Pegasus - a microlight journey across West Africa","review":"I enjoy reading about the many and varied forms of travel, so an account of an African adventure by microlight was intriguing.

My only complaint is that Kouri didn't include interviews he's done with other people -- I recall one in which he interviewed Mark Fuhrman for Chief of Police Magazine. Why didn't he include that one instead of the Liddy or North pieces? As a police commander, I applaud Kouri's efforts to present an unbiased view of cops, crime, justice and even race relations (no one had the nerve to give Professor Wilbanks the attention his studies deserve -- Jim Kouri did)."},{"Title":"Crime Talk","review":"Kouri, whom I'm familiar with thanks to the editors at Police Times and The Narc Officer, has written a nice, succinct book that's perfect for a busy guy like me.

Lewis' reputation as a critic of medieval and renaissance literature; in the original, medieval, sense, it was the \\"piece\\" that marked his transition from Apprentice to Master. It was first published in 1936, and has been reprinted many times. (I have 1960s copies of Oxford's 1958 \\"Galaxy Book\\" paperback edition; the cover of the recent Oxford Paperback is a great improvement.) As originally written, it covered the development of allegorical narrative from late classical antiquity to the Elizabethan poet Spenser's \\"Faerie Queene,\\" with particular attention to the \\"Allegorical Love Poems of the Middle Ages\\" (the working title).Unhappily for the book's long-term reputation, Lewis was persuaded to add to the planned text an earlier summary of modern theories of \\"courtly love\\" in medieval life and literature. Lewis himself noted that this theoretical construction did not quite fit the texts he analyzed in detail, and the whole approach is now regarded as at best problematic, and by many as simply wrong. Since Lewis presented the material with unusual clarity and wit, however, he has come to be treated as an authoritative source on \\"Courtly Love\\" theory by some, and attacked as such by others.The rest of the book, being based on original studies of primary sources, retains much of its value. Later textual studies and shifts in crticial theory have only slightly diminished its value, and his discussions of such now-obscure writers as Martianus Capella remain among the most inviting of introductions. Lewis' treatment of \\"The Romance of the Rose\\" is still illuminating (and the point of departure for many recent re-considerations). His chapter on \\"The Faerie Queene\\" is regarded by some competent scholars as the foundation of modern study of the unfinished epic.Although Lewis never looses sight of the entertainment value of many of the works he discusses (and some of them never had any), he is concerned to show that they addressed real problems of human behavior and emotions, and their presentation in narratives. Norman Cantor (not, on the whole, a great admirer) reports from first-hand experience that the book helped make the study of medieval romances respectable in academic circles. My own reading of the secondary literature (pre- and post-Lewis) brought me to a similar conclusion.It is probably of interest to note that, according to Lewis himself, the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" did NOT arise from his studies of allegory, and that their allegorical implications arose spontaneously in his mind. One has to wonder whether he would have written \\"The Allegory of Love\\" differently after, rather than before, those experiences.Serious students of English literature, and medieval literature in general, will find \\"The Allegory of Love\\" more than worth their time. So will those who simply enjoy reading Arthurian literature, and several other types of story. For many who are familiar only with Lewis the fantasist, or Lewis the Christian apologist, it will open new perspectives."},{"Title":"The allegory of love;: A study in medieval tradition,","review":"\\"The Allegory of Love\\" is an academic work that, among other things, traces the concept of love in literature, particularly the concept of courtly love in medieval literature. In the \\"Encyclopdia Britannica,\\" it is listed before all the other works of Lewis as \\"his finest scholarly work.\\" This shows the book's importance in making Lewis a respected literary critic.The main point of the first part of the book is that the concept of love changed in the literature of France in the eleventh century and has influenced the arts up to our day. Many years later, however, in \\"The Four Loves,\\" Lewis admits that he had treated the concept of love too much like a literary phenomenon and failed to see that many characteristics of erotic love which he had attributed to eleventh-century France are in fact characteristics that lie in the very nature of erotic love (e.g., the tendency to make love into a god who sanctions any crime committed in its name).Having said this, \\"The Allegory of Love\\" is still a great academic work that delights as much as it instructs - a milestone in the Lewis Canon."},{"Title":"The allegory of love;: A study in medieval tradition,","review":"While most associate Mr. Lewis with an assortment of tomes of otherworld fantasias (Narnia, Lion, Witch and Wardrobe, etc) or contemporary crisis, Allegory of Love is a very well written and scholarly study of medieval period (he once wrote that while the Renaissance was always a personlized venture for scholars, the dark ages belonged to boyhood), replete with references to not only incubala but extensive Greek, mystics, and Shakepeariana. It's nearly in the stylization and tradition of Fraser's &quot;Golden Bough&quot; with the precision of someone devoted to writing on, say, Milton or Donne. I hadn't really expected as fine and as much from this, but found without reservation it to be one of the hundred (perhaps fifty) best books I've ever read. Strongly recommend"},{"Title":"The allegory of love;: A study in medieval tradition,","review":"Lewis's volume in the _Oxford History of English Literature_ series (\\"OHEL\\", as he called it) is still in print, while _The Allegory of Love_ (AoL) is not. Therefore, there might be some shoppers who have read the former and are wondering whether they should read the latter. This review is for those shoppers.In short, if you liked OHEL, I think you will probably like AoL. Some specifics:1) Lewis began working on AoL when he was in his 20s, and _Collected Letters_, vol. 1, reveals a mindset in the young Lewis less appealing than that which would later help to make him beloved by his readers. Does this mindset mar AoL? No, not at all. Lewis was approaching 40 when AoL was published, and in it his voice is essentially indistinguishable from that of the later Lewis.2) I haven't yet read _Boxen_, but I'm guessing that it gives ample evidence that Lewis's writing style developed substantially over time. Is AoL an early enough work that it exposes the rough edges in Lewis's prose? No, it is not.3) While both OHEL and AoL are written for literature scholars, I found OHEL to be reasonably accessible and AoL even more so.4) AoL is far more focused and coherent than OHEL, making for a more pleasurable read.5) AoL was for Lewis a labor of love--no pun intended--while there was a reason he gave OHEL its nickname.For me, OHEL was a 5-star work. If it also was for you, I think you'll give AoL 5 stars, too."},{"Title":"The allegory of love;: A study in medieval tradition,","review":"A difficult book to rank as it was not written for the general reader (like myself). Erudite? Absolutely. Witty? In parts. Sustainable interest? Here is where the student of allegory and medieval romantic tradition would probably rate the book a 10, while the laymen will rank it a 3. I compromised with a rating of 6. Definitely worth a look for literary scholars interested in this field of study or Lewis devotees interested in perusing his academic work."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"and Saw a Beast Rise up Out of the Sea.This apocalyptic vision from the book of Revelations is a fitting introduction to Karel Capek's dystopian masterpiece, War With the Newts. Capek described in an interview how the idea for War With The Newts came to him and serves as a good synopsis of the book:\\"I had written the sentence, 'You mustn't think that the evolution that gave rise to us was the only evolutionary possibility on this planet. . . . that cultural developments could be shaped through the mediation of another animal species. If the biological conditions were favorable, some civilization not inferior to our own could arise in the depths of the sea. . . . Would it do the same stupid things mankind has done? Would it invite the same historical calamities? What would we say if some animal other than man declared that its education and its numbers gave it the sole right to occupy the entire world and hold sway over all creation?\\" Out of this thought process War With the Newts Was Born.The plot is straightforward. The master of a tramp steamer, Captain van Toch, comes across a rather curious breed of newts in an isolated lagoon near Sumatra. He discovers that they are intelligent and capable of communication. They lack, however, the ability to open easily oysters for food because of their short arms. He takes a knife and shows them how to use it. Next thing you know they have used his knife to open thousands of oysters, enough to provide the newts with food and the Captain with a large supply of pearls. Captain van Toch takes groups of newts and plants them in lagoons across the coastlines and lagoons of Asia. They are extraordinarily industrious. Before long newts become a worldwide rage. Every nation in the world uses newts to perform Herculean tasks of underwater and coastal development. The newts do not demand salaries. They merely ask for heavy equipment and munitions to facilitate these underwater projects. In short order the manufacture and supply of arms and equipment for newts becomes the single most important part of the world's economy.Despite some increasingly violent skirmishes between newts and man no nation is willing to cease providing weapons to the newts. Before long the newts revolt, led by the Great Salamander (an apparent parody of Hitler), and announce that they will start destroying the earth, continent by continent in order to provide more coastline for the growing newt population. Despite this threat the nations of the earth continue to provide arms to the newts. The resultant battle is over quickly. Mountains are leveled, continents are turned into a series of islands and what is left of man finds its way to the Alps, or Rocky Mountains, or Himalayas.As the story concludes, the author engages in a dialogue with himself and asks himself whether this is the end of man. After a great deal of soul searching he responds that perhaps the newts will take on all of the characteristics of the human race and find a way to destroy themselves. When that day occurs, perhaps humanity will recover what it gave away so readily.War With the Newts is a fascinating book on many levels. The idea that the story is premised on the notion of concurrent evolutionary trends predates much landmark work that has been done since the book was written. It is also important to note that War With the Newts was written in 1936. The Nazis had obtained full control of Germany, Mussolini's fascists ruled Italy, and Stalin's purges were in full swing. Capek was devoted to the new Czech Republic and was an ardent proponent of the ideals of democracy. By 1936 the rest of Europe had already taken many strides down the road to appeasement. Capek's pessimistic vision of the fate of humanity is well grounded in contemporary events. War With the Newts may be viewed as much as a parable of contemporary events as a foretelling of a dark future. Finally, Capek is an excellent writer. His prose is full of wit and wry diversions. His chapter on the mating habits of the newts struck me as a classic parody of the human mating habits of his contemporary Aldous Huxley in Brave New World.The following excerpt from a poem written by Capek after the bombing of the town of Badajoz during the Spanish Civil War serves as a fitting summation of the world view that permeates War With the Newts.When this century collapses, dead at last,and its sleep within the dark tomb has begun,come, look down upon us, world, file pastand be ashamed of what our age has done.Inscribe our stone, that everyone may seewhat this dead era valued most and best:science, progress, work, technologyand death - but death we prized above the rest.Almost seventy years after its publication the message of War With the Newts still resonates.Capek's War With the Newts is a wonderful, thought provoking book."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Though perhaps best known for coining the word \\"robot\\" in his wonderful play R.U.R., Capek also wrote a number of stories and novels. Of his novels, War With the Newts is probably the best known. And with good reason. It is an excellent story.Flirting with the apocalyptic tradition in science fiction, this novel tells the story of the discovery of large, intelligent sea creatures off a small island \\"west of Sumatra.\\" Initially curiosities, their intelligence makes them excellent workers for underwater projects for humans. Unfortunately for humans, these creatures are in fact quite smart enough and, over the course of a few years, develop to the point where they can challenge people for the domination of the earth. Which they do quite effectively.Written in a number of styles--journalistic and scientific in addition to straightforward prose that switches points of view--it is very engaging. Granted, the prose is a little more formal as befits a novel written in the 1930's and the translator has kept that formal feeling but I am quite fond of this style. And Capek's perceptive examination of the politics of this period in his tale of newts and man is impressive.Capek is often thought of as a science fiction writer but, as is the case with many writers of this genre, his appeal is much wider. Otherwise, why would his novels and plays still be read nearly 80 years later. Anyone with a taste for good, intellectual writing would enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Of all the science-fiction books I read in my teenage years, this is the one that stimulated my mind the most, and the one I've re-read most often. It's the story of a discovery of another intelligent species, not in space but on an island lost in the Pacific. The new species are man-sized newts, with language and smart enough to acquire H. sapiens technology quickly. Eventually the newts and humans go to war, and that's all the plot I'll give you.I loved to watch newts when I was a kid. In California especially, there are several species with interesting life-styles. Taricha torosa is a pretty brown and red newt with pebbly skin. It lives most of the year on land, but returns en masse to water to mate. It's a graceful, gentle, slow-moving creature with remarkably human \\"hands\\" and large eyes. That's the newt I imagine as the prototype for Capek's man-sized newt. T.torosa is also deadly poisonous... if you eat it. There's an evolutionary battle occurring in California right now! The newts' chief predator is the garter snake; snakes have been evolving tolerance for the newt's poison, which would kill the hugest other predator. In turn, the newts have been evolving ever stronger toxins. Recently, a population of snakes was discovered, in an isolated eco-zone, which has evolved better resistance and thus has gained the advantage in the endless evolutionary race.In any case, reading Capek's book, I felt much like a traitor to my species. In every way, justice seemed to be on the newts' side. Obviously Capek has intuited what might well be the scenario of the future, when H. sapiens encounters another intelligence in the galaxy. Let's hope that species has evolved farther ethically than we humans have."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"This is the worst edition of Capek's War with the Newts I've ever seen. Other editions I've seen are full of interesting illustrations and fake 'newspaper clipping' images to help heighten and convey different aspects of the plot. Not that this is at all necessary as it's a great book on it's own - but if you're putting \\"illustrated edition\\" on the cover of the book and only including one or two very poorly executed images, well, all I can think to say is shame on you. Add to this the fact that I counted nearly one copy error per page of the book, and all I can say is don't waste your money on this edition, and in fact, stay away from any titles published by 'the echo library' altogether."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"War with the Newts is an excellent example of the work of Karel Capek, one of the Czech Republic's most beloved authors. In many ways, the book reads like a traditional sci-fi novel, telling of the rise of a species of giant lizards and its eventual conflict with mankind. However, several things set it apart from the rest of its genre.For one thing, though there are four or five notable characters in the book, you never really see any of them for more than about four chapters. The main players in the novel are not individual people but countries; much of the book is written from a global perspective, in terms of the reactions of countries, societies, and the whole world as they are introduced to the newts.The book is also notable for its humor. The dry, subtle gibes give the work a similar feel to the novels of British author Terry Pratchett. The comedy comes not only from the tone of the writing style itself, but also in the form of the characters (both individual and regional), whose slightly ridiculous portrayal makes them seem quite human indeed, just like any one of us.The book is not merely for sci-fi enthusiasts. The reactions to the newts - human, economic, political, and otherwise - are chillingly familiar. In them we see accurate reflections of current and past social climates. This novel is equally valuable from a sociological perspective, or even as an insight into human nature itself. In this grim view of the future, we see our own past and present."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Captain Van Toch finds a bay which is home to a giant salanmander which he soon comes to realize is a very smart salanmander. He ends up training them to hunt for pearls, in return giving them knives to fight off their ancient enemy - the sharks. After he dies the world ends up taking over and exploiting them. These 'Newts' are trained to work underwater, carrying out projects to increase the landmass, clean harbours and build aircraft islands. Soon the military is training them to fight, the schools are training them to read and write, and the newts are also being taught about God, freedoms, history and other subjects that slowly change them to being equal to mankind in every field of science and knowledge.What happens when MANKIND is the Newts' new enemy?Is this a warning about exploiting the workers? Or a warning against mankind losing what makes us human? Or maybe a warning against relaying on machines too much? Or is it a warning about how man fights man? No matter what the warning IS it IS also a GOOD SCIENCE FICTION book. If you like Wells you will like Capek. Also lots of humor."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"I randomly found this book on Amazon one day, and decided I had to have it. When it arrived, however, I found myself slightly taken aback by the endless stream of footnotes throughout the book - not to mention the sections in another language altogether! And yet from the first page I was hooked - simply from a plot point of view, the story is engrossing all the way through. I found myself mysteriously endeared to the newts and dying to read each section. Capek is a brilliant writer - I find it hard to believe in many parts that it is a translated work. It's incredibly funny in parts and can definitely be very tongue-in-cheek. Capek also holds nothing back when it comes to mocking mankind - as a former scientist, I found his depiction of scientists particularly amusing, but he really lets out an endless stream of satire with no group spared. Germans, lawyers, the British, Hollywood, Big Business, capitalists - they all take a turn. I think if I knew more about world events in the 1930s I would have gotten more out of the book, but I think anyone with a good sense of humor would enjoy this book. Parts of it are written with a very academic tone, but it's quick moving and satirical enough to read through."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Literally fabulous, this novel belongs in the tradition of Jonathan Swift and his yahoos, as well as in its contemporary's Orwell and \\"Animal Farm\\". It is a wild dystopia where, as always, human folly and ambition produce a catastrophe. The main note of the book is an excellent black humor, a permanent mockery which spares no one: Capitalism, science, academy, journalism, Hollywood, nationalistic identities, but above all Totalitarianism, already present in human history when Capek wrote in the 1930's.Captain Van Toch, a merchant of whatever in Indonesia, discovers one day a species of newts (tritons-salamanders) whom he trains to fish for pearls. They are intelligent and gentle creatures, dispossessed of individuality, whose females reproduce with no sexual intercourse (like has been recently discovered about dragons of Komodo). Van Toch reveals his discovery to his fellow Czech, the millionaire entrepreneur Bondy, with whose help he launches his pearl business in a grand scale. Newts are transplanted to numerous litorals throughout the world, and soon the \\"Salamander Syndicate\\" finds out that newts are useful for many purposes, like building dams, repairing ships inside the water, and other industrial tasks. Newts reproduce by the billions and soon there are more of them than humans. Also very soon, politically correct groups appear, demanding a decent treatment as well as education and health for the poor things. Until one day, the humanized newts rebell against us. Several incidents start building up a World War after which humans are relegated to mountain tops and all the world becomes a giant artificial litoral where newts live and prosper. At the end, Capek can only guess that some day newts will become so human that they will develop national identities, rivalries, and war between themselves.Profoundly disturbing, funny, and cynical, this novel is composed of tales, scientific reports, philosophical essays, press clippings and other literary devices. Now that we seem to be eager to play with genetics and artificial intelligence, it wouldn't be bad if leaders of the world read this jewel of intuition and anticipation and reflected about science, technology and business. Besides, they would have much fun. Totally recommended."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Capek's question, asked around 1935, is a simple one: what if we found someone new to enslave?He envisions the perfect servant: some dark wog, identifiably sub-human, who lives to work, and who can never supplant our [Western] culture...And who better to take it from us. The story drags early on, but it builds up a clear notion of the Newts as a legitimate citizens of Nation Earth. Capek spends some time recapitulating the slaughter, love, and other complexities that bring the Newts from jungle obscurity to world prominence - reminiscent of Ebola and AIDS emerging from other jungles not so long after.He the brings the Newts up into his 20th century. The satirist's mind became satyric at the point, eager to prick the fulsome expanse of German nationalism or to penetrate the legs crossed over America's internal outsiders, Black Americans. Capek allows apologists of many different nationalisms in many ways, but they all show up wanting.Simple, hard-working, and certain, the Newts prevail. The author struggles, in a self-conscious final chapter, over a happy ending. He finally fails, and we are left to wonder about Newtworld.It's satire and commentary, but also science-oriented SF. Suppose these beings became available? What then? Capek's answers are very true, but very ugly.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"War with the Newts is a good book not only for its intellectual value but also for enjoyment. The plot is interesting and easily captivating. In an age where exploitation in its many forms (politically, racially, environmentally, etc.) is still prevalent, the books stands as a strong satire to the possible, if not far off, consequences of society's actions. As the satire builds and the newts gain control, the book becomes more interesting, especially in a realistic sense with its constant explanatory footnotes and articles from such established periodicals as National Geographic. The final chapter is noteworthy, as Capek reveals his consciousness of the reader and his/her possible reactions to the brief (some would say sudden) ending. An easy and entertaining read, War with the Newts is defintely worth reading. (Personal note: About time, Mr. Rutstein.)"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"I can't imagine why this satirical novel is not more well known; it is among the best of the best.The on-line bookseller compared this novel with 1984 and Brave New World, but Capek's book is nothing like those in tone, although they also depict a future world where things go seriously wrong. Those other guys were deadly serious as they pointed out disturbing trends in their world. Capek is funny, satiric, and often over-the-top farcical as he points out the foibles of many different nations, including his own, Czechoslovakia in 1936. He is much more in the vein of Swift in Gulliver's Travels and of Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse 5.The \\"story\\" goes like this: A sea captain discovers a colony of intelligent newts on an isolated island who are about the size of 10-year-old boys and who walk upright and are seemingly intelligent. He arms them with knives to defend themselves against sharks, teaches them to talk, and persuades them to find oysters containing pearls. Gradually the news of these seemingly willing workers seeps out, and a giant syndicate is formed to sell the newts to various countries for work in dredging their bays and enlarging their lands. A new industry emerges: machines and devices to help the newts in their tasks. Then the idea comes up to arm the newts with explosives to defend the sea coasts against foreign aggressors. It's a newt arms race!The newts multiply dramatically because they are finally able to defend themselves against all their natural enemies. In fact, they find they need more \\"living room,\\" more shallow water, because that is their natural habitat. The solution? Demolish continents to make more shallow water. And so the war begins.In the process of this story, Capek manages to ridicule many nations. For example: About America, he reports that newts are lynched, because young women report they have been raped by them. About Germany, he says that that nation claims their newts are racially superior to the newts of other nations. About Czechoslovakia (his own country), he depicts the people as complacent, because they do not consider themselves in danger, since they have no sea coast. (Remember this was all written just before Hitler started his campaign for leibinstrom (living room) in World War II.)Capek's target of satire is not communism, fascism, or democracy. His target is blind nationalism, complacency, and greed, pure greed for more profits. That's why this satire is still relevant today."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"There were no illustrations and the font was too small to read comfortably.
