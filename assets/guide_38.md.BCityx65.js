I was hoping for a book that took a cold eye on past speculations of futurology, and dissects them. It'd be interesting to see how Alvin Toffler stands up with time, or some debunking of predictions of business trends. Instead, we get a series of rambling essays taking a few factoids and random observations, on which Margolis drones on for pages and pages. He fails to coherently state his point or argue for it, instead going off on unrelated tangents. This book really needed serious editing. The section on the environment was just woeful. I'm not sure whether Margolis has a scientific or technical education. He totally fails to even address the science behind environmental concerns. He instead indulges in what can only be called arm-waving dismissals of &quot;catastrophism&quot;. Unfortunately, there is such a thing as environmental science, and it is insufficient to dismiss the concerns raised by it based on political ideology, as Margolis does. There will one day be a good book written on futurology and trend prediction, hopefully taking a good laugh at the bad predictions, analyzing those that were correct. It would also explore the psychological dimensions of futurology - is it just projecting of dreams and fears onto the future, the same as we slant our view of the past? Based on this analysis, we could make and judge predictions better. Unfortunately, this book isn't that book."},{"Title":"Brief History of Tomorrow","review":"That is the question of much of mankind. Jonathan Margolis starts out by finding out what past people thought the future would be like, if they got it right or wrong and WHY they got it right or wrong. After looking at the works of authors, such as H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, Jules Verne and Edward Bellamy, plus scientists, professors and specialists he dives into what people believe now. Chapter after chapter deals with global warming, ice ages, pollution, advanced medicine, genetic engineering, the internet, robots, e-commerce, smart kitchens, cloning, politics, space travel, flying cars, airships, teleportation, time travel AND aliens.Then he lists his own ideas about future trends, some of which seem bland, others seem to be very reasonable, and some seem weird. For example, he suggests global warming might just fade away (which it might), 'Real' or 'Natural' will always be valued over 'virtual' (and I'm sure it will cost more), that aircars would be dangerous within the city streetscape(true), and that we don't have to worry about things like asteroid impacts (just because he figures it will happen to a part of the Earth that nobody cares about).But the whole book is about the fact that futurology can be bland, reasonable and weird all at the same time. Don't take him seriously, but enjoy the book. Great for science fiction fans or want-to-be authors of science fiction!Go airships!"},{"Title":"Brief History of Tomorrow","review":"Margolis' wit, insight and opinion may present a challenge to more than a few readers but, for my money, this book is an entertaining and thought-provoking journey from statistics and observation to logical and wise speculation.

This book, while very nice, pretty much made me depressed - almost all of the renovations were too large scale for what I was looking to do and seems to focus more on dramatic upgrades such as whole additions, entire floor plan changes, and overall high-budget changes. If you are seeking design ideas for larger-scale cape upgrades, then this book would no doubt be a great resource, but if you are seeking smaller scale ideas for how others have redesigned certain cape-sized rooms, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Capes: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling and Building New","review":"Jane Gitlin's book is a pleasure to read -- again and again.

We have a 1950's Cape Cod home. And anyone who has one knows, they can be very difficult to add on to without looking like you have a \\"moron room\\" - add a little more on, add a little more on. This book was filled with absolutely beautiful photos and gave me several ideas that we will utilize when we begin our work this summer.I appreciated that we were able to view some of the pages before purchase.

The text explains in layman's terms what makes a house a \\"Cape\\" and the essential architectural elements to consider when making changes. The photos and text cover a couple of dozen Cape homes that have been updated. The possibilities for renovations are endless, yet the book presents these in a manner that allows the reader to visualize projects ranging from small to large. Both indoor and outdoor updates are addressed. While not an architectural guide, this book is a good starting point for a Cape owner with expansion or renovation plans in mind."},{"Title":"Capes: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling and Building New","review":"I truly enjoy this book. It starts with a basic history of Capes and then goes on to options that owners have done in updating them. NOTE: some of the changes are MASSIVE, some not so, but either way I enjoyed seeing them. I am mainly looking for smaller homes, additions, renovations, ect. and this book came through there too. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in home ideas and seeing before and after pics."},{"Title":"Capes: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling and Building New","review":"Both a decorating and an architectural design book, Updating Classic American Capes is a handy reference and idea guide for anyone looking to make changes to an existing cape cod style house. The author shows before-and-after floor plans that illustrate common layout problems and how they can be eliminated. It's easy to apply changes people in this book have made to one's own situation. Issues common to capes--lack of light upstairs, headroom, square footage--are addressed with various solutions, ranging from working within the existing confines of the structure to turning a cape into a colonial, gambrel, etc.Wait...a colonial isn't a cape, you say! No, the title is Updating..., and sometimes the solution to a lack of space is to expand upward. A few of the houses in the book are expanded into full two-stories; some retain the look of a cape through clever use of gables and dormers, while others are completely transformed.But there are plenty of examples of remodels that preserve or even improve the sense of \\"historic old cape\\" within the universal House shape. (Yes, the triangle-atop-a-rectangle is how children of almost every culture draw a house.) As a remodeler, I fold over the corners of pages that will be of particular value to me for future reference. Generally, I'll have ten or so such corners in a useful book. In my copy of this book, about half of them are folded.Once you've made structural changes to your cape, you can use this book for the decorating process. It covers the various historical periods of the cape and shows how those styles can be adapted to one's own home.This is a great picture book, and you don't really need to read any of the text to enjoy the photos in here--but the book is well-written and informative, too. All around, a wonderful book for would-be/will-be remodelers and Coffee Table Book aficionados alike."},{"Title":"Capes: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling and Building New","review":"I am about to buy a cape and thought this book might give me some ideas to consider for renovations in the 5-10 year plan.

The physicalscientist, like me, accepts the Fourier inversion formulaand the convolution theorem, but the mathematician wants toshow under exactly what conditions these wonderful formulasactually work, when they break down and how far can they bepushed. This is the ground covered. While Champeney neverproves a theorem, (you can always look up the proof in thereferences) he is careful to explain what is going on, whateverything means, and the purpose of the theorem inexpanding the scope of previous results, or in therestrictions it imposes on what may seem like inuitivegeneralizations. He almost always gives examples, which isa great help in understanding.After a clear introduction to Lebesgue integration and thekey role it plays in the theory, the chapters progress byenlarging the class of functions that can be legitimatelyFourier transformed, making the necessary adjustments tothe way in which the transform must be defined anddiscussing how answer must be intrepreted. Theapplicablitity of the convolution formula and the rule fortransforming products of function and differentiating aredealt with as the function spaces grow bigger.One of the best things about the book is the fact that itdiscusses rigorous treatments of both the classicalanayltic theory in function spaces like Lp, and ofdistribution theory (which encompasses objects like deltafunctions). Every other book I have encountered on Fouriertheory seems to written by authors who only know part ofthe story, and they behave as though the other approachessimply don't exist! For example Tichmarsh, and Dym andMckean never mention generalized functions, while Lighthillgives no clue about classical theory. The discussion ofthe relationship between these apparently disconnectedbranches of the subject is in my opinion one of its mostvaluable assets.I have a minor gripe. Following a tradition among snootyrigorous mathematicians, Champeney refuses to draw a singlediagram in the whole book. Not even the cover provides auseful illustration of anything within. Knowing mostnonmathematicians would like the help provided by apicture, he sometimes resorts to a verbal description likethis: \\"a tall narrow hump just to the left of the originwith a similar negative hump just to the right.\\" Thiscomplete reliance on words in a subject with so much visualappeal seems to me to be perverse. Despite this complaintI recomend the book wholeheartedlyfor the scientist who would like to get the gist of therigorous mathematical theory behind some familiartheoretical tools."},{"Title":"A Handbook of Fourier Theorems","review":"This is a book of revelation even for someone who has seen and read a number of texts on Fourier transforms. It is a brilliant example of a very deep understanding of the problems encountered by practitioners like physicists, engineers and probably others and of the typical questions such people would be asking about the machinery and traps of Fourier transforms. Already the introduction is a quintessence of a kind I have never seen in any book on the subject. The author would point out the problems and subtleties in a very comprehensible and impartial way, unlike typical &quot;rigorous&quot; expositions of which there are only too many.This is an extremely helpful and informative creation. I am deeply convinced that its contents must precede any further acquaintance or exposition of the theory of Fourier transforms. He who goes through the material carefully will be rewarded and, my feeling is, will most probably be an expert in the field one day, and especially so if one studies the text at an early stage of one's entering the subject. The book is clearly for non-mathematicians which is not to say that they would not profit from it in many ways. The achievement of the author is simply admirable."},{"Title":"Greenhouse construction and heating, (U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

He admits Moses Avalon is a fake name (supposedly his real name is Josh melville). When we talked he spent the conversation trying to get me to go to a seminar-a seminar designed for lawyers although Moses has no law background. rumor is that he was never a great producer and created the personna of moses avalon to make money by selling his book. Kind of a sinner turned saint to enlighten innocent artists. It's worked. He is without a doubt a great self-promoter. I've read the book and there is some good info but other books have the similar info (what they won't tell you about the music business is a great book).However, I have a real problem with this man turning himself into a fictional character, misrepresenting himself all to make a buck. I asked him why he changed his name. His reply was that he couldn't legally use the wrong-doers exact names without getting himself sued. So I said why was it so important to name names. he said he thought it was important to make sure they were exposed. hmmmmm. so to damage the careers of a few people, he decided to discard his whole identity. That didn't set well at all with me.Also I have a problem with his negative comments regarding CD Baby. I am not friends with Derek Sivers, but I've heard him speak and met him a few times. This guy works his butt off and has opened more doors for independent artists than anyone else in the music business.I am not saying 'moses avalon' doesn't have any information to give because he has been around the business and is very smart. However I do doubt his credentials and wonder at the extremes of his behavior. But there are real producers who have written books/articles with actual credentials.

With an easy structure and accessible style Moses Avalon's book is a revelation in which facts talk and theory has been all but eliminated"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Record Producer, 2 Ed: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business","review":"An inside look from a qualified person is something that really matters to someone who wants to get the best information available and this book presents all of this in a structured and very user friendly form. Intuitive descriptions ,examples and real life situations form a good base to start with but you don't see the complete picture. A book that shows you the complete picture with legal details is \\"Music Business & Entertainment Law Contracts for Indie Recording Artist, Labels, Songwriters, Composers, Producers, Managers and All Others in the Record Industry.

It describes royaties to artist and how you may not see them. Scams pulled on bands.Items that should be in your contracts. How record companies rip you off. Examples on how songs are stolen. How producers hide money for themselves. Independent labels, Majors and Distribution both Major and Indie. Moses Avalon takes you from the first steps through the entire music industry process and tells you how much money you will have at the end(theorectically). This book is the one you should buy before all others."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Record Producer, 2 Ed: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business","review":"You dont have to be aiming at a future record deal to be interested in such a book. Even as an avid music fan you will find information and inside knowledge here that will enlighten you in the mysterious and more often than not wicked ways the music industry works.It's a great eye-opener then, one that will obviously be more useful to musicians who are either looking forward to getting a deal or were not satisfied in their initial one. Written by a producer with years-long experience in the business, it provides crucial info on what to be careful about concerning:-contracts and the various angles one should be careful in order to avoid a bad deal (a story often read about concerning groups or solo artists).-differences in signings between majors and indie labels. An in-depth analysis on the difference between an indie label and a major.-an explanation on the finances of such deals.-copyright and sampling analysis.The above are just headlines of course, as each chapter is very comprehensive and covers to a very adequate degree the subject it deals with. Written in simple language so that all the legal mumbo-jumbo becomes understandable for the layman, and with a healthy dose of humour and cynicism to drive the various points home, it's a great book to go through. Categorised according to subject for easy and simple reference.\\"Confessions of a Record Producer\\" demolishes a lot of myths about the music business and reshapes certain false sources of ill-gotten optimism that new musicians nurture and which lead them into well-documented traps. What in fact is introduced here first and foremost is hardcore realism. Without that element anyone entering in negotiations with the music industry is a sheep among wolves."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Record Producer, 2 Ed: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business","review":"This book takes you through almost every aspect of the music industry. He tells you of scams of entertainment lawyers to dirty tricks by the big labels. At the same time he opens your eyes to just how successful you have to be to make money of your recordings (more than you think). A must read for people even considering a career in the music industry. All this is done with a sense of humor and language you can understand. Complete with real life examples. Great book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Record Producer, 2 Ed: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business","review":"Before reading this book I was very anxious to enter the music world as a producer, having a slight idea of what I needed to do to accomplish that goal. Well, I realize that I did not even know the difference between a Label, a record company and a distributor and the role each plays in getting a record to the shelves of Sam Goody or HMV at your local mall. Moses breaks down every aspect of the Music Biz, from writer, to artist, to producer, to session musician and even explains how each gets paid! He Even explains why you see so many logos on the back of every record you buy. It is an effort of many people and many different companies in direct collaboration with each other.This is very valuable information for anyone in the Music Biz. I feel that I am better prepared now than I was 4 days ago..the time it took me to read this book I simply could not put down once I started reading.Mr. Avalon explains all the \\"Industry Jargon\\" in plain simple english anyone with at least a high school level education can understand.The best part of the book is how he even breaks down the \\"dirty\\" scams that everyone tries to impose on an artists/producer or writer.I Pity the fool who signs a contract with a major record label for 3 Million dollars and 5 albums w/o reading this book. They will, like TLC, file for bankruptcy after selling 11 million records..find out why..."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Record Producer, 2 Ed: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business","review":"When I picked up this book I expected another boring book from some out of touch \\"has been\\" trying to make a buck. Instead I found a book full of insight. Half way through the book I was blown away with the amount of knowledge (and I still had half a book to go).Fact: the music business is full of weasels. They feed on the excitement of new (naive) artists, get them to sign a poor contract, and milk them dry. Well this book shows you the business from many including the artist, producer, label, and lawyers side (and more).From assembling your team of managers, lawyers, producers, to payola and kickbacks, to copyrights, publishing royalties, sneaking lawyers tricks Moses covers everything in great detail. Typically when a book is this thorough there are parts that you end up skipping as it doesn't apply, but Moses insights of the \\"squeezing\\", back stabbing, and shenanigans kept me glued to every page.If you are thinking that life would be great if you could just get signed to a major label, you REALLY need to read this. Moses shows you how you can sell 1,000,000 records and still owe money (if you're not careful). He shows you every detail, and then brings it home by breaking down in a table format (making it easy to see exactly where the money goes). The section titled \\"A Major Label Deal is like having a Credit Card at 66% was extremely eye opening.OK, anybody can throw number on a page. So who is Moses Avalon? It turns out he has worked with Warner Brothers, Atlantic, and BMG. He has worked Grammy wining artists (he has worked on 5 platinum recordings). He is also a composer who has had his compositions used in commercials, and award winning independent films.If you are someone looking for management, or getting airplay now and on the verge of breaking, READ THIS BOOK.

I was so impressed by this, his first book that I contacted him as a consultant on a producer/artist agreement I was negotiating (I am a producer). My goal was to come up with something that was actually fair to both parties and Moses got us to that point quickly. His suggestions were works of innovation that surprised and satisfied everyone.I also attended his 2-day seminar which dissects recording contracts. Here he dispelled the many misconceptions I had about record companies and their contracts AND he helped me to understand what is really being said in these contracts (and it's scary!).He is not a lawyer, but one of the most insightful men I've met. Lawyers pay HIM for his advice. He REALLY understands contracts and explain things in a manner no one else seems to be able to do - it must be a sixth sense.. Highly recommended reading. Both his books should be permanent reference books for anyone in the music business. Besides, they're fun reads, unlike most other &quot;how-to&quot; music-biz books."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Record Producer, 2 Ed: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business","review":"This is my new favorite book on the music business, and I've read a lot of them! It went straight to the top of my required reading list for anyone interested in a music business career. This book tells you what the other books won't. This is not a &quot;how to&quot; guide to music business success, but it will tell you what to watch out for, and makes you reconsider if going after the elusive Major Label Record Deal is really worth it or not. It breaks down the numbers of a typical recording deal in terms that everyone can understand and shows you how you most likely will never see ANY record sales royalties from a major label deal as a new artist. This book prepares you so that you won't get taken advantage of by anyone in the music business."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Record Producer, 2 Ed: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business","review":"Every one could write rave reviews about this book, and you still wouldn't be sure. I bought the book in 2000, on the advice of some panelists at a music conference. The plain talk translations were amazing. He explained some of the horror stories you hear (I always wondered how platinum artists could be bankrupt, now I know). Shortly afterward, I picked up Secrets of Negotiating a Record Contract. Both books are excellent. Go to a book store or a library; flip through the book yourself. You will be hooked. You'll have to have your own copy. It's the best investment you could make in your music career.

It covers the topics that are important for people to know like publishing. It arms the reader with the knowledge that gives you the power of confidence when dealing with the business side of the music business. I can see why the lawyer left a less than favorable review. The book gives away some of their secrets and and makes you aware of some of their behaviors that manipulate deals in your favor and not. I can see why the lawyer would take issue. Too bad. The author calls it as he sees it.

He gives it to you straight! I have read a lot of other music industry books, but this book is highly recommended and worth the money, no hands down! This is definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Art Fundamentals: Theory and Practice","review":"This book is really boring. Unfortunately, I must read it. Since it is not an enjoyable read, it could at least be a little shorter. The information is not presented in as efficient or condensed of a form as it could be.On a personal level, I don't like this book because it has a bias in favor of abstract and nonobjective art. Barnett Newman, Covenant, 1949 is pictured in the book. It is a red background with one vertical black stripe and one vertical yellow stripe. The book calls this type of art, \\"extremely large scale, unified color fields of personally conceived shapes or signs concerned primarily with provoking sensations of ritual, human tragedy, mythology and the like.\\" Really? Cuz I call it a waste of paint. I mean come on...the \\"painting\\" is a canvas painted one color with two vertical stripes. It doesn't \\"provoke\\" anything in me except disgust that anyone would call that art. I have a shirt with vertical stripes on it. You know what that shirt represents? Wait for it: Yeah, it is a shirt with damned vertical stripes, that is it. No more, no less--not a deep reference to human tragedy and the like. Sometimes these poser artistes really need to get over themselves.Have you ever watched a movie where some pompous, overly coiffed ivory tower types walk through an art gallery eating finger food and looking at complete garbage called \\"art\\" while discussing the deep meaning and artistic qualities of the garbage they are looking at? And you look at the art and think, the five year old next door could have produced that. Well, those hoity-toity, artsy-fartsy types are the authors of this book.If you are like them, the book may be more to your liking. I personally do not like most abstract and nonobjective art. The book is full of snide snips to the effect that if you fail to appreciate abstract art, then you aren't apparently a deep thinker or your sense of art is shallow. Here's a few examples.\\"When an observer's expectation is of literal work, the intended content of the artist is often misinterpreted.\\" In other words, if you fail to appreciate some garbage that could have been painted by an eight year old, then it is necessarily your fault because you just were incapable of understanding the \\"art.\\"\\"Artists who are more concerned with responses than with commonplace perceptions are legitimately called conceptual because they are idea-oriented and thus more creative.\\" Oh, so if you paint something real, then you didn't have an idea in your head but if you paint nothing recognizable, then you had some amazing idea in your head. Uh, who says? In other words, if someone throws paint at a canvas with an idea in their head, then they are more creative than somebody who attempts to paint something recognizable. Uh, yeah. Whatever."},{"Title":"Art Fundamentals: Theory and Practice","review":"Im an art major and i got this for my design class. Its a pretty good book...i keep it around for reference."},{"Title":"Art Fundamentals: Theory and Practice","review":"Offered here for less than my school charged for used. It didn't come new, but close enough to it. The pictures look great, and it is very informative."},{"Title":"Art Fundamentals: Theory and Practice","review":"As Always, I am very glad that I ordered my books from Amazon instead of at the Bookstore at school Saved a ton of money and got a great book."},{"Title":"Art Fundamentals: Theory and Practice","review":"I have not seen the book, which I gather is loaded with color reproductions of art. However, I was asked by a friend to evaluate the CD-ROM that (apparently) comes with the book. I am not entirely clear on the exact relationship of the CD or how it is supposed to complement the book, but I will confine my comments to the CD 'as if' it were a stand-alone product.The CD is deeply flawed in two key aspects: presentation and content. First, I am a professional multimedia designer who has designed an educational CD, as well as a fine artist who has worked in several media (ceramics, photography, painting), and taught digital design at the university level.My initial impression of the content, including the text and silly little exercises, is that this product could be aimed at elementary school level instruction, and for that matter would be an extremely poor substitute for a scribbler pad and box of crayons coupled with some common-sense discussion of various, basic design elements. However as I read through the &quot;Self-evaluation&quot; section I realized that at least some of the vocabulary employed is really addressed to university-level literacy. If you are going to have students engage in digital manipulations, don't waste their time with these superficially clever exercises (rotating and scaling little lozenges, and filling them with colors and patterns in a tiny window). Give them the real thing! Even a basic freeware paint program has much more to offer.The presentation itself is cold, clinical and utterly lacking in interesting visual dimension or texture -- a catastrophic failing in a publication purporting to teach &quot;Art Fundamentals&quot;. Gimmicky rollover effects and slide transitions recall the worst of Flash eye-candy, and corporate Power Point sales pitches.But there's more -- the excessive text is so badly presented that it is functionally illegible, considering the quantities the poor viewer is being asked to read. Pray that it merely duplicates the copy in the hard copy book, and there it is at least conventionally legible. A section of stitlted and programmatic exercises recall those matchbook covers for correspondance art instruction. Blech.Finally I will comment on a series of video clips that explain various fine art media and techniques. The video quality is reasonably good, however the visuals are utterly boring, and the voice-over narration an excruciating, amateur, flat, monotone. Most of the artwork selected as examples during arbitrary, 'slide show' sequences is at best mediocre. What a crime to convey boredom and indifference about visual creativity in a textbook for foundation art students!I'm very sorry to say that I find nothing to recommend about the CD that comes with this &quot;best seller&quot;, because that is a reflection of the very sad state of visual literacy in North America. I am not tempted in the least to look at the textbook it comes with."},{"Title":"Art Fundamentals: Theory and Practice","review":"This book was better than described, great condition and excellent price.

Regardless of the discipline, or even the level, the concepts and explanations are absolutely invaluable for translating what so many people (even veterans) assume is subjective quality into objective rational analysis of why a creative visual work may succeed or fail. Having absorbed the material in this book, my verbal critiques of student work have gained clarity and effectiveness. The same is true for the students who study the material - they too become excellent critics.Highly recommended for teachers and students of all levels in art and design (advanced high school, and all college levels)."},{"Title":"Art Fundamentals: Theory and Practice","review":"I'm a college student with no background in art, so when I found out I had to take Design I as a prerequisite to an introductory photography class, I was a little nervous.

All of them are easy to read and extremely informative, best of all, it's full of pictures! Each page has almost a minimum of two images, making understanding and grasping the content extremely easy and enjoyable.I loved the chapter Content & Style, as it delved into the art schools, explaining each school, the artists, the paintings etcThe book also has a cd that has info on colour, texture, line..

The photos are all in color and there are many of them.This book is a great introduction, but it is a wealth of information. The reading is easy and doesn't bore me.

The writing is logical, down to earth and seems fresh and exciting after years of reading very old reference books on the subject. It seems that they did not have a ton of money for the copyrights of noteworthy images from artists so they seem to have settled for lesser-known works by large artists. Some of this is interesting while some of it is frustrating. I believe that they have the ugliest Helen Frankenthaler painting I've ever seen printed in the book.

Michael Zaransky is clearly a serious investor/operator in the student housing sector, and openly shares his experience and perspectives. He doesn't predict or guarantee overnight wealth nor an easy path to accomplish instant success as some no-brainer exercise. As he tells us, it requires up-front analysis, discipline, and involving professionals in the process.What Zaransky does provide are objective statistics and trends from reputable third parties, along with solid guidelines to make the investing process a prudent one. Using this info and approach, he patiently and with proper due diligence, evaluates each deal on all its merits. He also advocates walking away when the deal doesn't meet the established criteria.I have been an active player in the student housing market for 30-plus years and found his book to be practical and on the money.

This overview, however, is very general, and you will soon find out that what he describes in one paragraph could easily fill a whole book. At least it puts you on notice, which is the most important thing. I also would have liked a more detailed explanation as to his underwriting process, but I understand that he can't give away all of his secrets.

It requires work, dedication, money, and knowledge.The author argues that the future for student housing is bright. As more students of the Echo Generation are entering college, higher learning institutions do not keep up with the demand for housing, and therefore, rents and cash flow are likely to go up as demand must meet supply.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

Karal, I think, learns something from all of this; to cherish life and the living. This book left readers on a high note, saying at the end that the Dhorisha Plains had become lush and beautiful, but leaves you with one downer. That is, the injuries that inflicted Karal and Firesong. I, for one, could almost predict that something was going to happen to Firesong, since Ms. Lackey doesn't usually go with the cliches and make her characters perfect. But that Karal became blind was a complete surprise. I only thought that the chapters ran a bit long, but overall, it was very good."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"By the end of the second book in this trilogy, the characters Karal and Tremayne had charmed me. I loved the way they both progressed through the first two books. Lackey did a wonderful job of showing how each character responded to challenges and how each grew more honorable, even though they were on opposite sides. So I very much looked forward to seeing how these two characters triumphed in book 3.It felt like Lackey had lost interest while writing this book. Perhaps its because she populated the novel with so many characters she had extensively explored in other books and even series. Yet even the newer characters of Karal and Tremayne seemed to be mere cameos. By cameos, I don't mean that they played minor parts. Rather, they were presented as characters that had already completed their story arcs and were present only to complete the plot lines set up in previous books. Little character development occured in either of them.I'm not one to skim past paragraphs that don't interest me. I don't want to miss important plot developments. In this book, I found myself skimming past a great deal more than paragraphs.Lackey has a knack for giving you such rich detail that you don't notice that pages have gone by with no action or dialogue. But the pages of detail in this book was both excessive and repetitive. Much of what she described had been spelled out in book 2. Generally speaking, the final book in a series excellerates its action, because all the plot lines strung through out the preceeding books are being tied up.Still, I cared about the Karal and Tremayne characters enough to read to the end. Instead of feeling regret that I reached the end of the series, though, I felt only relief."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Mercedes Lackey is a good story teller but after reading the last of the herald mage series and the queens own this story was very predictable. Disaster! Miraculous solution! World saved. It shouldnt have been a 3 book series"},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I found this story by Mercedes Lackey gripping and fun to read. All of the characters are likeable, though Firesong was pretty annoying at times. I loved it."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"After reading trilogies such as the Mage Winds and the Last Herald Mage, this latest one sunk. The characters are too familiar, and the action is almost predictable. There is a moral lesson for those involved such as Firesong and Karal, but the ending stunk. I've read better Lackey novels then this."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Yes i did say boring. I say this for one reason only; i've read the other books.

There is little action until the very last chapter, where it gets very tense and, near the very end, very emotional. Pay no attention to the people who gave this book series a '2'. They don't know what they're talking about. Let me just say this to them... &quot;If you didn't like the first or second book... then why read the whole trilogy?! Just so you can give it a nasty review. I think that's just plain stupid.&quot; Anyway... this book series has little action, but it still hooks you through each chapter. The characters are really detailed and very likeable. Every one of the: to the good guys like: Karal An'Desha, Firesong And to the bad guys like Melles, and Emporer Charliss. All are very much likeable to read and get to know. Lackey writes very well written, well thought of fantasy books. Maybe not as good as Terry Brooks-or maybe just as good- but Mercedes enthralls the reader none-the-less. I look forward to reading more books by this talented author; the next of which I'm reading is the Mage-Winds trilogy, which happens before these books, and even has some characters from these books in them. I look forward to another good trilogy there, too. So if you are a fantasy fan, give a Mercedes Lackey book a try, you might be surprised how much you like it."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I'm sorry to say I have to agree with those reviewers who didn't like this book. I'm a fan of Valdemar and especially the \\"Arrows\\" Trilogy and \\"By the Sword,\\" but this book was a disappointment. I was bored by the effort of trying to keep track of (and care about) a dozen or more \\"main\\" characters, and I found much of the plot to be predictable and lacking suspense. Sadly, it's a letdown, given how much I enjoyed some of the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"The flame of my passion for Valdemaran books was quenched by this series. The series started off quite well, but as it progressed, there seemed to be less and less of what I regard as Ms. Lackey's style. I thought we were going to see a heterosexual male come out as a pretty cool guy - not entirely unheard of in Ms. Lackey's books, but not standard fare by any means.I liked much of the story of the books except the way Gen. Tremane was portrayed. It seemed to me that alot of effort was put into Tremane in the first book and to a smaller degree the second book and then he was just abandoned. He grew in the first book, but by the third book, all of that growth was thrown away as if it had never happened. This also highlights the vast difference between the first book and the third book where in the first book all of the events were necessary and tied together well whereas in the third book everything was just kind of thrown into a salad bowl and not tied together very well.just kinda disappointed I guess. Ms. Lackey wrote some of the first great fiction I ever read."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Totally a satisfying coclusion to the storm series. I'd recomend this trilogy to everyone who asks me. the realistic feelings of the characters make you drawn into the story immiedatly. It's a book you can't leave on the shelf or in the bookstore it's too good. Though I definetly do not consider myself Mercedes Lackey's greatest fan I have read alot of he books so try to trust me. and to try out the storm series. but make sure you read the other series first, start with the black gryphon and continue on the timeline.

Karal was not a very interesting character and niether was An'desha. The only part of this book I really enjoyed was the parts about Darkwind, Elspeth and Treman. Treman was a great character and the book would have been better if it was all about him. The romance between Karal and Naomi was silly. They were so shy around each other and it was very boring. This trilogy probably could have been condenced into one book and been much better."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"WO!!! How did she manage to ruin the characters from previous books? I thought that this would be another thrilling book like the rest of her books, but I was shocked at the fact that I did not enjoy this series.Darkwind and Elspeth, for example, were completely different, as were many of her other previously enjoyed characters. I also didn't like the characters. They were flawless and totally unrelatable. So overall, Iwas utterly dissappointed at this particular series. Read the other series' before this one. It doesn't get good untill the very end."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"These novels are sappy gunk with irritating stereotypes of homosexuals as eternally forlorn victims of unrequited love that lust for nothing but nice clothes. Add in the pervasive use of sappy, apostrophe laden froo-froo fantasy words and you get a series of novels that are monumentally obnoxious. Somewhere in these books is the nugget of a good story, but Lackey's blown her chance with this series. Her earlier work was much better. This series and the &quot;Gryphon&quot; series are fairly disposable."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I just had to throw my two cents in when I saw this book had four stars. I got it when it first came out in hard cover, because I couldn't stand the wait. Absolute waste of money and time. The whole storm series was not very good, but this one did it. This one stopped me buying her books."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. I couldn't put it down. I happen to be a hopeless romantic, and the interaction between Natoli and Karal made for a very touching side story. I liked the ending and for those of you who have read it you'll know when i say that Altra is wonderfully faithful to Karal. If you haven't read this, read it! You need to read the first two before this but they are all excellent books. In fact, I think this is the best of her Valdemar series. If anyone wants to talk about Lackey or Anne McCaffrey or Star Trek, please email me. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I will agree that the story starts of with a weak and predictable plot; however, it does pick up the pace towards the end. At first I did not like this book once I was done with it...But I read it again one month later, and started to like it. While this book is not a &quot;filler book,&quot; it does leave you with that impression the first few times. The story ending is somewhat unresolved, i.e. the Empire, the Alliance, and the new laws of magic, but if she follows her pattern, they will be filled in at a later date/book. The latest book, Owlflight, does deal with some of the new laws of magic, but not all aspects are dealt with. I have read every book in the series at least seven times each, so I can say this is not one of the best! Her latest books may leave the reader unsatisfied with the characters, but after a while they grow into the story and fit in. This book could have done with a bit less dialogue dealing with trivialities, but the basic ideas and style that makes her other books so enjoyable are there--just buried under several things that might turn off newcommers or dedicated fans in the series.Newcommers should start with The Last Herald Mage series, then read it chronologically. Read the Gryphon books as the second to last completed trillogy, though before this trillogy so you can get a better understanding of the plot developments. Overall, this is a good book, mabey not the best of the series, but it does fill in the gaps nicely with a thorough, mostly entertaining, plot with few holes."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I loved this book. Many people said there were too many characters and plots that didn't tie in together. Were they reading the same book? Every single part of this story, the history of the first cataclism, to the tower, Grand Duke/King Tremane's ascension to the Hardornean throne which brings Iftel into the open and gives our heroes ideas of how to protect the land, even the Emperor of the East and his plot to destroy everything plays a part. I don't want to give it away but if you know the books...this one ties it all together!! We find out history and learn the why's of things. Without all the plotlines and character development we wouldn't understand how our heroes succeed at their near impossible task! Loved it!"},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I have been reading Misty's books for about 10 years now, starting with The Last Herald-Mage series. Since I finished that trilogy, I have purchased every Mercedes Lackey/Valdemar book I can get my hands on. I am eagerly awaiting Take A Thief, the story of Skif pre-Cymry (his Companion), as well as the Valdemar Companion. Anyways, I liked this series. I have read many reviews complaining about Lackey's evil-just-for-the-heck-of-it bad guys. Take a look at Tremane. At first, you want to hate him, because he's from the Eastern Empire. But as we get to know him, it turns out he's not such a bad guy. When he finally took some responsibility (I don't want to spoil the book), I found myself liking him.As for new Valdemar books, I would like to see a book on the founding and King Valdemar himself. I would also like to see what happens with Selenay's twins, Kris and Lyra. Who becomes Chosen first, who becomes Heir, etc. (Are you reading this, Ms. Lackey?) Getting away from Valdemar itself, I wouldn't mind reading about some of Need's earlier bearers.Anyways, I like Lackey's books.

This author exhibits an amazing talent for uncovering & thinking through the smallest details of a civilization; how it survives a battle or mage-storm, how the crops are handled, the benefits of certain kinds of trade, how an army settles down in a town for a long, hard winter. Her views on this are frankly amazing (and a similar approach was seen in her \\"Take a Thief\\"); but it is handled in such detail that it stops the action dead, and takes up far too much of the story. (She's thought every detail through so far, that I think the U.S. government ought to put her on-staff, to help address disaster relief after events like Katrina!)The drawback to this book, like many of her others, is that the characters TALK TOO MUCH. And too often, the reader is robbed of WITNESSING action scenes (like the Iftel Gryphons' attack on the rebel township), in favor of having everybody and his brother TALK ENDLESSLY about it afterwards. (Beginning this section of the story, I had a bet with myself that she'd do that --and she did. Very frustrating.) The reader spends far too much time, in this book, cooped up in Urtho's tower-tunnels, claustrophobically listening to the characters TALK to each other.Dear Author: A picture (so to speak) is worth a thousand WORDS. Let the readers witness important events, and make up their own minds. I do not need you (in the guise of favored protagonists) EXPLAINING every blessed thing to me, so I will agree with YOUR \\"take\\" on everything. There is always the feeling that this writer's afraid that the reader somehow won't GET IT.Oh -- and, as always, there ought to be a Glossary of Terms or something, included in every one of these books. (What the heck is a chirra? Did I miss the single line, in some early chapter, that may have defined this?) See the books of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series; while I am not especially enamored, they at least have pages of term-definitions in every book. The reader, coming across an unfamiliar italicized vampire-specific word, can just flip forward or back, and proceed onward with a clear understanding."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Storm Breaking quite nicely rounds out the Mage Storm series.It answers a lot of questions that have been lingeringthroughout many of the Valdemar books. It also does what theprevious Wind Series did not do: it is an actual conclusionto this particular 3-book series. While there are still manyopen questions to be answered and some rather interestingpossible storylines, it does not leave you hanging (andfeeling rather cheated) like the final book in the Wind series,Winds of Fury, did. The cataclysm is over.The characters who have been present in the previous two books(Elspeth, Darkwind, Firesong, Karal, An'desha, Grand DukeTremaine, et al) are there. You also get to meet twocharacters frequently discussed, but never met: the EmperorCharlis, a marvelously twisted character, and Tremaine'smain rival for the Empire's Throne, Melles, a very practical,if rather chilling, man.And what I considered two of the high points of the book, thegryphons in the far north of Valdemar and the question ofIftel are finally explained. The answer sent me running backto the Black Gryphon to see if I had missed something: so farit doesn't look like I did.This story is somewhat darker than the previous two books inthis series, nor does not it move at as fast a pace as thefirst two did. This is a book that resolves the problemsthat arose in the previous two books. The book is eminentlyreadable and satisfying.While there are still many unanswered questions concerningthis time line in Valdemar, I hope that Ms. Lackey will doa book about the founding of Valdemar before she goes anyfurther. There are so many little tidbits dropped surroundingBaron Valdemar and the flight of his people, but the realreason that they fled the Empire is never given, just arather vague comment about the abuse of power by BaronValdemar's overlord.Of course, I have noticed that Ms. Lackey does books aboutValdemar in the order in which they are needed to furtherflesh out the Valdemar story, and to provide information thatwill be needed in the next set of books or stories.I look forward with a great deal of anticipation to the nextValdemar book, whatever it may be."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series provides one of the cornerstones of my reading history. After discovering her when quite young, I still follow new additions to the series - nearly twenty years later! I read and re-read these books over and over again throughout my youth, but I haven't re-read this series in its entirety in a long time - and never as an adult. There are some new books added to the series since the last time I read them, so this re-reading project is pretty exciting for me since it will include these new volumes, and will be in a new order. These books really just remind me of being young, reading them in the back seat of the car on family road trips... I think I was in 4th or 5th grade when I first started reading them, and they've always been a pleasure to re-read - and I am sure this will continue to be the case! The Valdemar series is broken up into (for the most part) separate trilogies. In my re-reading project, I am going to try to read them chronologically - not by publication date, but by their timeline within the series.This final book of the Mage Storm trilogy is truly a bittersweet conclusion. It is a (mostly) happy ending for all and a lot of fun to read, but it's hard to believe that it is truly over... I read this in more or less one sitting - bathroom breaks for the puppy were about my only distraction. And though I knew how all the sadness was going to settle around the characters, I continue to hold onto the hope that some day Lackey will pick up her pen and address those left in the immediate aftermath of this book... Unfortunately, the remaining books in the series do not follow this trilogy as closely as the other few trilogies flow together. I do seem to recall that Firesong makes a cameo appearance in the \\"Owl\\" trilogy that follows this, but from what I otherwise remember about that trilogy, is little beyond my intense disappointment. But, I suppose that re-reading them could change my initial opinion - especially since I do not think I have ever re-read them! And at least, after finishing those, I have the brand new Collegium mini-series to look forward to! But someday, I would love to read a real continuation from this book!!"},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I actually liked this book the best of the three. The only part I didn't like were the passages about what was going on in the empire. Who cares? My favorite parts of the book were actually the ones about Tremane and his ascension. I liked his character a lot and I loved how the change was made in him from the first two books."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I love Storm Warning (5 stars) but feel let down by Storm Rising (3.5 stars) and Storm Breaking (3.5 stars). Main reason being I like my story to concentrate on just one or the maximum 3 characters, which is the case in Storm Warning. Lackey's shift to other characters in the Empire who have their own long long stories to tell in the last 2 books just put me off. Maybe she is trying to build a sense of anticipation and climax but I find myself frustrated and just wish to skip the pages detailing the Empire characters. I wish she has just continued to concentrate on Karal (a lovely character), An'desha and Firesong. However I must compliment her on the last part of Storm Breaking which features three of my favorite persons in the Last Herald Mage Series. This series could have been better but it is still an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Karal, our young hero, is probably my second favourite character in the Valdermar world, and whilst Storm Breaking isn't the most epic or memorable in the Valdermar series, it does provide a nice showcase for Karal. Unfortunately as with many of the later Valdermar books (particularly the Winds trilogy), Lackey seems to want to bring in too many elements which detract from the main storyline. I don't see why we need to be in Hardorn or the Empire - Karal and An'desha are set up to be the main characters in the Storm series so why continually revisit older characters? Its a nicety for fans but it is truly ruining the flow of the story-telling at times. If you're a first time buyer - I would suggest that you do not buy this book - you definitely need to know the Valdermar world very well to keep up with the numerous recurring characters making an appearance. Try the Arrows series or the Last Herald Mage books. If you're a fan, then this is a must buy (although it helps if you have read the other two in the Storm series!!)."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Can't say enough about this writers work.

Since I had read the book before I was able to figure out what everything meant but newcomers may have a more troublesome time and we shouldn't have to!

I have to say, though, I liked the first book in this series, the second was passable, but slogging through the third is quite tedious.

I thought this book greatly written just like all the other Valdemaran books."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Okay, a lot of people are going to disagree with me on this, but I thought the ending for this book was excellent. It wasn't one of those cliche endings where everything turns out all right or everyone dies. I like to see variety in what I read, and as I read more and more, I find it less and less. (And for God's sake! I'm only 15!) I have been engulfed in Misty's Velgarth novels for quite some time, and after every time I read this, it seems as if this is the end of the \\"golden years\\" of Velgarth. I like that because it makes it seem as if everything is closed in, although there is another trilogy that follows this trilogy.The other two books in the Storms trilogy may have seemed dull and a lot of talk unless you are an avid reader of Valdemar,(not for me personally) but this chronicle really tops it off well. Although, yes, there is the cliche of the climax towards the end of the book, that is the way that it had to be. What else would Misty talk about after the plot and storyline of three books passed over?To give a synopsis of what is going on before the book: Karal and his \\"crew\\" are in Dhorisha Plains to find Urtho's \\"weapon against the mage storms.\\" Duke Tremane is in Hardorn mucking around, and the entire country of Valdemar is afraid and confused. In this final volume, all questions will be answered, and the ending will definitely give readers something to think about.I enjoyed this novel, and as learned person towards Velgarth, I absolutely recommend that anyone who reads the Storms at LEAST read the Mage Wars. I hope that all readers enjoy this page turner as much as I did and will for many years to come."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"Karal, Sun Priest of Karse, along with the help of Firesong, An'desha, Altra, and Florian, has managed to temporarily block the Mage Storms from damaging the Alliance nations.

Karal and his friends must search for a way to counteract the final devastating Storm, the echo of the great Cataclysm that transformed their world thousands of years ago...Meanwhile, Elspeth and Darkwind have been sent as envoys to Tremane in Hardorn to negotiate the terms of the Alliance. As they help Tremane prepare Hardorn for the worst, a surprising and mysterious ally comes to their aid...&quot;Storm Breaking&quot; is the final book in Mercedes Lackey's Mage Storms Trilogy. I enjoyed reading it, but it was definitely the weakest book in the trilogy.The characters, as always, were wonderful. Karal was his usual thoughtful self, and it was very nice to see Firesong in a much more rational light. Tremane continues to grow into an increasingly likable man. I was delighted to see a reappearance of three characters from previous books, who I won't mention here for fear of spoilage.I also liked the alternating perspectives. The narrative focusing on Melles and the Eastern Empire was surprisingly interesting, despite all of the politicking. The Elspeth/Darkwind narrative was a little slow at times but in the end *very* rewarding. The Karal narrative was by far the most compelling, but that is mostly because I liked the characters involved there the best. Lackey's rapid alternation of narrative towards the end of the book, especially in the last chapter, was extremely effective. The reader knew what was happening in each location, and was driven to keep reading when there were mini-cliffhangers.My major complaint about this book is not the climax itself (although it is nearly identical to the endings of the first two books in the trilogy), but the way the conclusion is presented. The climax is everything it should be, but I feel that it comes too close to the end of the book. All the loose ends are neatly wrapped up, but there is a definite lack of denouement (ten pages' worth), especially considering that this is the final volume in a trilogy.Bottom Line: A solid read with likable, well developed characters.

The passages--the REALLY LONG passages--detailing Imperial politics and Melles' intricate plotting were so tedious; I was tempted to skip past them.

And why were they persecuted by the Karsites?During his stay, and especially after the death of hismentor, Karal began to see with his own eyes that the thingshe had believed in all his life...just weren't true.The Companions were not demons and the Heralds were notcotrollers of denoms.The storms growing worse brought people from all overthe planet together, allowing Karal to see how everyonebelieved differently and taught Karal there is more thanenough room for different faiths.The question is will Karal (or anyone) survive the stormsto teach everybody else what he has learned?"},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I have been a fan of Lackey's since I first read Arrow's of the Queen, but I have to admitt that I was disappointed when I read Storm Breaking and the other two books in the trilogy. The underlying story of the mage storms was interesting but the developement was weak. In each of the books Karal is used a a mage channel to prevent desaster. I could see it happening once, possibly even twice, but not all three times. Lackey even brought back Vanyel and Stephen for this book and basicly did nothing with them in the end. Overall I can say I will probibly never read Lackey's new books with any regularity. She keeps recycling characters by putting new names on them and using them again and again. Sorry Lackey I used to love you but not any more."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"I have been the owner of this series for over 10 years and it was only just recently that I got around to reading it. Normally I would read a series like this in about 1-2 weeks, but it took me a tedious 2 months to finally complete this trilogy because it is a very poorly written fantasy.The characters themselves were nice enough characters, but horribly bland. Karal, the main character, was boring and really didn't do much of anything except the last 30 pages of each book. He was a sweet character and liked by everyone, even those who first disliked him end up liking him. He is the perfect person to have as a friend but he is a horrible person to have as a hero and main character. Karal seemed to have no flaws which makes for no excitement or tension and creates a boring read. I found myself uninterested in all the characters except for Tremane and Altra. I found myself disappointed when Tremane was looked over in favor of Darkwind and Elspeth in Storm Breaking.The plot itself is what really caused me to rate this book/series as 1 star instead of anything higher. The series itself could of easily been a stand-alone read instead of the tedious 3 books it turned out to be. The whole plot of the story is that the Mage Storms that originated from the cataclysm of the Mage Wars is coming back in a mirror copy of the original storms, and the characters are scrambling to try and stop it. The storms are causing many problems such as the transplanting of foreign pieces of land, strange creatures being created, and magic being disrupted. Each book is full of the characters explaining what the storms are and thinking about how to stop them, with Karal expertly recording each discussion. At the end of each book they protect the land, but only temporarily. By the third book I wouldn't of been surprised if they once more protected the land, but only temporarily. The only parts I found remotely enjoyable dealt with Tremane, but sadly they were far and few between. In the final book, Storm Breaking, Lackey introduces Melles who is made the new heir to the Empire. Melles played absolutely no point to furthering the plot and did nothing but cause me to count down the pages until the parts dealing with him were over(then I would continue counting down the overall book pages). Even at the end of the book Melles played almost no part to the plot. The ending could easily of been written successfully without including all the previous sections that did deal with Melles. I almost feel like Lackey added him to make her book more than 200 pages long.Overall I was really disappointed in this series and have decided never to read one of Lackey's books again. This is the 4th series I've read by her and I have only liked 1 book out of the 11 books I have read. I prefer more intelligent fantasy series and would never suggest this to anyone, even Lackey fans."},{"Title":"Storm Breaking (The Mage Storms, Book 3)","review":"With this book (and this series, really), Lackey stretched the credibility of her world too far. She hasn't quite reached the depths that Anne McCaffery's late Pern novels have, but she's coming close. One of the strengths of her earlier Velgarth series was that the characters appeared in one trilogy, and then in future series appeared as minor characters, sticking strictly to the sidelines. Already at the end of the Mage Winds trilogy Elspeth, Darkwind, and Firesong were reaching the end of their usefulness as &quot;save the world&quot; characters -- the ensemble ending that broke the mage storms felt like an utterly contrived reunion show.Fortunately, Lackey has since moved on to fleshing out backstories for some of the more peripheral characters and stories taking place elsewhere in the world. She's created a compelling and complex fantasy world that gives her plenty of room to write in: falling in love with individual characters and not letting them go weakens that world."},{"Title":"Medical Flora","review":"This particular edition, though planned, doesnt seem to have ever actually gotten published.

They essentially admit as much in the afterword.The stories in this collection are mostly strong, but none of them really light up the place like some in the earlier collection, \\"Absolutely Brilliant in Chrome\\".I recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in supporting new voices in SF, but if you just want a quick thrill, read the first two books instead."},{"Title":"All The Rage This Year: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (Phobos Award S.)

I actually liked this better than Empire of Dreams, which was itself a good book.

I gave her volumes 1 through 6 for her birthday, and her mom tells me that she is just blazing through each book, because she loves them so much.It warmed my heart to give her these books, as I remember reading them when I was her age. I used to borrow one book a week from the local public library in the 1970s. Nancy Drew was always a great read.I think that we establish a great connection with our children when we share with them something that we also loved as kids. It's a joy for all involved.In my opinion, you can't go wrong. These books are classics, and by encouraging young ones to read them, you help the children in your life to foster a great habit of reading--one that remains with them through their entire life. I think books of this nature also help to make them better critical thinkers and better writers."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"These series of Nancy Drew mystery stories by Applewood Books are reproductions of the original editions circa 1930s. Starting from 1959, the Nancy Drew stories were revised and updated, so original writing and formatting went out of print. Nancy's hair as evidenced on the cover is a rich ginger color, in a period-authentic bob (as are her best friends' hairstyles). Apart from the original cover, the book is bound in a striking light blue cover with the silhouette of the famous girl detective embossed on the cover (as are the title and author's name).In addition, what makes these books collector-worthy in my opinion (and I am an ardent fan of Nancy Drew and have been collecting various editions of the stories) is the original black and white illustrations by Russell H. Tandy. In \\"The Sign of the Twisted Candles\\" (originally published in 1933), there are four of such illustrations, in glorious detail. There is also an introduction by Carolyn G. Hart. The pages of this edition are on quality card stock, which accounts for the higher price of these volumes (in comparison to the newer editions). I found these editions in a used bookstore (in mint condition) and was able to get a good price for them.

I love the old fashioned clothing, sayings and settings much more than the yellow spine books of today that are so condensed they read all the same. The old style books are written with quality in mind and evoke a different period in our American history."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"Nancy Drew is like Betty Crocker or Paul Bunyon, a famous American who never really existed. But to girls who read these books, Nancy Drew is as real as a best friend.I know many people complain that syndicated series like Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys and The Three Investigators are of little literary merit because they are ghost-written. This is not strictly true for Nancy Drew, but even so, I see no real reason to pronounce these books as inferior to single author, non-serial books.Nancy Drew is leading its fourth generation of girls to reading, something that can't be said of all of the supposedly &quot;better&quot; books.The Sign of the Twisted Candles is one of the best books in the series, and an early one; as such, it is a great introduction to Nancy Drew (you don't miss anything by not reading the books in order). It's compelling, and just chilling enough for a thrill, but not for a real scare. It's suitable for any girl who reads well enough to read &quot;chapter&quot; books, which can be girls as young as seven. Once a girl picks up the Nancy Drew habit, she is generally hooked for life. She'll read the books into her early teens, and may even occasionally turn back to favorite books as an adult.The new Sign of the Twisted Candles is available, and the new book is very good, but if the girl for who it is bought keeps up with Nancy Drew, check the used book listings for an older version of the story. The early books were all updated in the sixties, so different versions exist. The 1930's & 40's 200+ page book were not only brought up to date with regard to inflation, cultural references and such, but were also reduced to 176 pages.Don't let the girls you know miss out on Nancy Drew."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"i really loved this book.there were some sad and exiting parts in this suspenceful book.nancy goes to the sign of the twisted candles inn where rumors are heard that asa sidney,bess's and george's relative is being held prisinor in his own mansion.this is true and when nancy meets carol wipple,who lives in the inn with her foster parents.thats when asa sidney seeks mr.drew to come to the inn to make a will for him.on the way out of the tower room nancy looks out the window to see frank jemmit,carols foster dad burring a chest.but nancy is sure she saw the chest the other day in asa sidneys tower room.is frank jemmit and emma jemmit being dishonest to carol and asa sidney?in mr.sidney's will he leaves alot to carol,but why??find out in this exiting mystery.oh and the most exiting part to me is the 19 chapter where nancy climbs up a ladder to the tower room to see if emma and frank are taking hiding in there."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"It's wonderful to find the original version of this to purchase. I read it in my youth as a library book and have been unable to find a copy to purchase in recent years until now.

Sadie's plight with the abusive guardians; the friction between Bess, George and Nancy; the hundred-year-old man, and the fortune makes this story an extremely interesting read for all ages of girls, even older ones like myself. We will be reading this over and over again for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"In attempt to help a one hundred year old man, Nancy meets a girl being harmed by cruel guardians. While trying to solve the mystery of the Twisted Candles Inn, Nancy almost loses the friendship of her two closest &quot;chums&quot; - Bess and George.

A great read for mystery fans, young or old."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"This review concerns both the original 1933 edition and the revised 1968 edition, which is the one with which most younger readers would be familiar. Both books have a similar story; except the revised edition is shorter, some characters names were changed and some events were either eliminated or altered. During a storm, Nancy, Bess and George seek shelter at an old tea room. While there, they meet a one hundred year old man named Asa Sidney, as well as an orphaned girl and her dishonest guardians. This launches Nancy into the middle of an old family feud between Asa Sidney's relatives and the relatives of his deceased wife, who happens to have been the sister of Bess and George's great-grandfather. Nancy's involvement in the feud ultimately costs her her friendship with Bess and George. Nancy has a lot of work to do as she tries to end the long-standing feud, repair her friendship with Bess and George, discover the parentage of the orphaned girl and prevent the girl's guardians from stealing the fortune that Asa Sidney has amassed. There really isn't much of a mystery to this book; however, the story more than makes up for that. Like all of the other books in the series, it features unscrupulous people up to something dishonest and Nancy's usual desire to help someone in need, but this time she is affected personally because of the loss of her friends. I found the book to be very interesting and the writing was very descriptive (at least in the original version). I recommend reading the original version over the revised edition, if possible, but either way this book should not be missed if you are a fan of Nancy Drew. In my opinion it is one of the 5 best books of the series."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"When Nancy visits an Uncle of good friends George and Bess she gets involved with more than just that.

Whilst I have been aware of the Nancy Drew books all of my life I had never read any of them.We purchased the 4 DVD set of the Nancy Drew movies that were made during 1938-1939 and absolutely fell in love with them. As a result my wife bought me the first 6 books in a set. These were the yellow cover books that had been revised from the originals.Then I ran across the Applewood reprints of the original books. For someone my age it is my opinion that the Applewood books are more appropriate. The vocabulary and writing style of the late 1920's and 1930's was something with which I could identify.Reading the stories was like talking with my parents and grandparents again - wonderful. For me it was a return to the age of innocence that was long lost: Innocence lost due to time and war.The 'Sign of the Twisted Candles' is a great, fun tale full of twists and turns just as the book title suggests. I count it among my favorites, but then no matter which of the original Nancy Drew books I happen to read it too immediately becomes a favorite.The story shows Nancy at her best when confronted with a deep mystery and neither she nor you could ever be dissappointed with this 'Twisted Tale\\". I highly recommend that you read it - and share the book with your Grandfather.Any Nancy Drew fan will love this book and read it more than once."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"Applewood Books has turned back the hands of time and given back Nancy Drew to readers. Faithfully restored to its original form, word for word, this is the real Nancy. These beautifully reproduced hardback editions are not condensed, rewritten or updated. This is the Nancy Drew of the 1930's, her blonde bob and 30's style dress shown on the facimile of the original dust jacket, conjuring up images and phrases from the enchanted America of yesteryear.While it is still a book designed for youthful readers, there is a bit more depth here in the originals, and not a small dose of nostalgia when read today. You can almost see the Coke sign outside the River Heights Theatre showing the latest Nancy Carroll picture, as Nancy goes whizzing past in hot pursuit of a clue.\\"The Sign of the Twisted Candles\\" remains one of the best in the series conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, creator of The Hardy Boys. A ghostwriter from Iowa named Mildred Wirt fleshed out his story outlines and \\"Carolyn Keene\\" was born. When he died in 1930, his daughter Harriet continued to oversee his company and in 1933 \\"The Sign of the Twisted Candles,\\" the ninth book in the popular series, was published. A warm and affectionate introduction by mystery writer Carolyn G. Hart is the only addition or deviation from how it first appeared in this lovely edition.Nancy and her pals George and Bess are caught in a rainstorm and seek shelter at The Sign of the Twisted Candles. Nancy befriends a young orphan named Sadie and finds danger and mystery lurking at the Twisted Candles, of course. The plot revolves around Asa Sydney and his will, and a family fued which will cause George and Bess to desert Nancy for a time until a lesson about loyalty is learned. Nancy's father, famous lawyer Carson Drew, gets involved on behalf of his daughter, and Hannah Gruen, the Drew's houskeeper and mother-figure to Nancy, is present here as well.Buried secrets and an attempt to run Nancy off the road offer plenty of action unmarred by today's brand of violence for readers. An exciting and heartfelt conclusion punctuates a wholesome mystery which provides a role model even today. These beautiful Applewood editions stand head and shoulders above the others as they help young readers discover Nancy in a romantically nostalgic past. It is a past more innocent to be sure, filled with ice cream parlors and roadsters, five cent Saturday mornings at the movies watching our favorite serial adventure and, of course, Nancy Drew.Young readers will discover a new friend to rush home to after class and the joy of losing yourself in a book with this edition. Older readers who either read them in their own youth or bought them for their children all the time will heave a wistful sigh for a time long gone in America's past."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles (Nancy Drew, Book 9)","review":"I loved this book!

This isn't a book that wisks you away to exotic locales, high adventure and what not. It's a story about a boy in a walking race with 99 other young men. The book revolves around how these people deal with each other knowing only one of them can win the race, and live. Would you make friends with them to pass the time? Knowing that only one of you is walking away from it? Listen to their sob stories about why they need to win? With your life on the line, can you afford that distraction? That is what this book is all about, and it's fantastic. Easily one of King's best"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm not particularly a Stephen King fan. In fact, this was the book of his I've ever read all the way through...And it was without a doubt, a story that will stay in my head for a long time, if not forever.When I was reading this, I sometimes had to just stop, breathe a few deep breaths, and think:What it would be like begging for a break in your walking from absolutely emotionless soldiers who saw killing you because you were slow as no more significant than kicking a pebble on a Sunday morning stroll...Or having every step you take feel like a hundred knives being plunged into every muscle in your body...Obviously, something like what transpired in this story could probably never happen...But &quot;probably&quot; isn't sure enough. That's the thing about this story. It's unbelievable and yet horrifyingly believable at the same time.I wouldn't put it past human nature to devise something like this...So, we better be careful."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am a huge SK fan, and am on my way to catching up with him in terms of reading every book he has had published. Anyway, The Long Walk is definitely the one story I note as my absolute favourite SK story whenever I am asked (and I really like most of them). I cried at the end (as I do with many), but I felt really attached to the main character, it's like he was a real person. I became attached to many of the characters, and everytime one of them &quot;bit the dust&quot; it really hurt. But the whole point of the story as I see it was to try and make us see that as human beings, as unfortunate as it may be, we might all be able to do the same thing if it means our life over someone else's - meaning that we might all just keep going right on by someone that was our friend, &quot;dying&quot;, if it was what we needed to do to &quot;win&quot;. The story really has to be read to get the true feeling, I can't explain it well enough here."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This tale of a future marathon where the runners who stop are killed in front of millions is the best thing King's ever written, hands down. Unrelentingly dark and powerful, it holds your attention from the innocuous beginning to the end's bizarre twist. Not everyone's cup of tea, but if your taste in literature overpowers your desire for an uplifting story, read this book. I gave it 5 stars simply because there was no 6. Or, for that matter, no 10."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am a casual SK fan, having read the more obvious stuff (\\"The Shining,\\" \\"Different Seasons,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" etc.) and enjoyed it, but I am far from one of his more rabid devotees. \\"The Long Walk\\" may be the book that changes all that.Sometimes the most terrifying idea can be witnessing what somebody else considers to be normal. \\"TLW\\" works as a horror novel just for that reason. 100 teenage boys across the nation volunteer to participate in the Long Walk, a race that starts in Maine but has no formal finish line. In the early pages, it all seems like a lark . . . except for some of King's patented ominous foreshadowing. The boys hang out, size each other up, establish some cliques and a heirarcy, and then they are off.The rules of the Long Walk are simple. Maintain a pace of four miles per hour. If you fall below the pace for about 30 seconds, you get a warning - no exceptions. No medical emergencies. No time outs. No rest areas. You can erase a warning by walking at pace for an hour. After your third warning, \\"they punch your ticket.\\"That ominous phrase has the most dire meaning imaginable. Under the rules of the game, 99 tickets must be punched. The last Walker wins his heart's desire for the rest of his life. Each of the other Walkers gets a hail of bullets - there is no reprieve for being the runner-up.And this is normal. The Walk is as popular as the Super Bowl or the World Cup, and the rabid, adoring crowd is terrifyingly indifferent to the horror of the Walk.King gets into the minds of several of the Walkers, but the protagonist of the story is Ray Garraty, a Walker from Maine who is pretty much an Everyman character. Through Ray's eyes, we see his fellow Walkers gradually have their tickets punched. As the race goes on, we see the Walkers waste away as the miles eat away at their shoes, their clothes, their bodies, their hearts and their minds. Each Walker has to decide how much of this torture he is going to take, and how he is going to take it. Do you choose to have your ticket punched? Do you push on until you collapse? Do you go down swinging?Written in King's spare prose, \\"TLW\\" is one of those books that sends chills down your spine even though you're sitting in a comfy chair in front of the fire. The fate of the Walkers will stay with you long after you've read the last page, and you will ask yourself if you would as well (or as deplorably) as the Walkers do. That's a good book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is Stephen King at his best. King puts the readers in the worn out shoes of the Walkers. I found myself thinking over and over what I would do if I was on the Long Walk and thinking about how I would react to seeing everyone around me get shot down if they walked too slow or gave up. The Long Walk makes you think about life, and what we are willing to do to keep it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This goes down as my all time favorite King/Bachman story ever! It's in one word...HAUNTING! I am not one that typically re reads books over and over again, but that said...I have read this several times. The concept when written was light years ahead of its time. He made you believe that this premise of \\"game/competition\\" was indeed the future of where we are headed. I could not help but imagine that this was a likely senerio. After that set up, you can't help but have an interest in the characters and their outcome. Not only does this stay with you long after you have read it, but it's a rarity of book, that makes you wish you could read it again for the first time. Unlike some other reviewers I was not dissapointed with the ending and felt it was absolutely right on the money. I have yet to find another King that matches this intensity and gripping story line, but I sure wish he would head down this road again...now that's a walk I would take."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is classic King! Such an amazing ability of story telling and introducing the many characters in the book. Who else could make a long walk so intriguing?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am no fan of Stephen King. I don't hate his books, but I think this is the sixth book of his I've read, and the first one I've really enjoyed. I got 80% throughThe Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)before putting it down in boredom. I tried twice to get throughThe Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)and failed both times. I've never really understood his appeal and haven't had an interest in reading anything else by him, but when someone told me the premise of The Long Walk - I was so intrigued I had to try it out. After finishing it, I finally got a glimpse into some of the incredible story-telling that King is capable of.Written under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman, the premise of The Long Walk is that America is a different society than what we currently know. On the surface, every aspect of it seems the same with two exceptions. The first, is that there was some type of war or military/government event in the past (which King only alludes to), and second, the premier sporting event is a yearly event known as The Long Walk, in which 100 teenage boys are chosen to walk as long as they can until only one of them is left standing, which is a foregone occurrence since contestants are shot if they slow down too much. The obvious draw to this story is the event itself. Why would anyone choose to compete in it? Well, The Prize is the obvious answer - anything you could want for the rest of your life. But even so, the odds are so overwhelmingly against you it seems insane that anyone would compete. The majority of the book is an exercise in character development. King spends an exhaustive amount of time slowly developing the characters and providing insight into their motivations and backgrounds. The main character, Ray Garraty, is developed through his interactions with his fellow contestants. One of the most interesting concepts about the story, is that these are not professional athletes. These young boys have not spent the last four years training for the Long Walk. King makes no references to their being jocks or physically superior to other average teenage boys. Some of the boys do mention taking practice walks, but it is clear that most of them have never participated in anything like this until they start out that morning in Maine on April 30. The winner of the Long Walk is not gifted with superior physical endurance, but emotional and mental superiority.If King has any other novels like The Long Walk, I would definitely be interested in reading them. It is a very quick read and one that I honestly couldn't put down, as the intrigue never slows down for a minute. I also found that my mind was continually thinking while reading. King would detail a concept or rule of the long walk, such as the rule about outside people interfering with a contestant, and I would sit there and think about all of the different implications that could occur from such a rule. What if a contestant hired someone who had nothing to lose to run out and attach a competitor? Could contestants carry extra shoes with them? What about different ways they could use the bathroom while walking and now slow down? My mind was active the whole time I was reading it, and even after finishing it. I really love when a book challenges me creatively this way, and I'm not just engaged in \\"passive reading.\\" For anyone who wants an exciting and well-developed novel, I would definitely recommend picking up a copy of The Long Walk."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is an oldie. Written in King's college days, it was first rejected for publication. After quite some time it was released under Richard Bachman as the author.The book is a masterpiece of the dark human condition & the darkness of humanity. Set in a military, fascist America, The Long Walk takes place every May 1 with 100 teenage boys. King touches this new country with very minor references. The boys begin the Walk in Presque Isle, Maine & continue walking south non-stop until only one is left to claim the Grand Prize. The Prize being anything you want for the rest of your life. What happens to the 99 non-finishers? Body bags resulting from a bullet or two to the head from the monitoring soldiers. The boys, by the way, take a test for acceptance into the walk. They all participate willingly & are not coerced.You can accumulate 3 warnings for falling below a pace of 4 miles an hour. Every hour walked at 4 miles an hour erases a previous warning. If after 3 warnings you cannot continue your pace, you are quite literally eliminated.Actually, the Walk is considered a sport by this new America. Possibly the greatest event of the year, the crowds are throngs & the Walkers are heavily bet on.The rather mundane action of walking is masterfully molded by King into one of his darkest tales. It's a fascinating tale of the human condition where mental & emotional prowess & conversation among the boys must overcome the incredible physical pain of non-stop walking for hundreds of miles. The fear of the bullet, always on their minds. Friendships form, though they know they cannot last.By the time the end of the walk is in sight, these boys have aged before our eyes. The Prize is no longer important. The Walk may be interpreted as the walk of life, if you choose. There are a few interpretations the reader can make.The book is a real page turner. The dark tale will get hold of you & it'll be difficult to shake it off.I found myself with only a couple pages to go, asking myself how King is going to end this novel. The answer is he ends it very well"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is maybe my favorite King novel, (and I'm a huge fan!) and a very psychological-horror read. All of the other good reviews are the same things I would say in praise, so let me just recommend you purchase \\"The Bachman Books\\" By Stephen King and get the long walk along with three other long-short stories and save on making separate purchases for each novel!

I read it years ago while in high school when the Bachmann books were released in one text. I found this one to be the most attention grabbing, and memorable story. A true one of a kind.

Some of his best work."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Excellent piece of fiction that is both prophetic and terrifying at the same time.

As always, it was a book to captivate and entertain as well.As a King fan for many years he's never once disappointed me. I highly recommend this book to all his readers."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read this as a novel about 10 years ago and it has haunted me since. It is so gruesome and horrific in its telling that I decided to download the Kindle version and reread it during a long day of airport travel. It kept me entrhalled to the end, even though I knew the outcome.To imagine a story like this and better yet to think of the kids that volunteer for this walk is beyond comprehension. But the reasons behind their inclusion in this macabre event are questioned throughout the telling of the tale which is an obvious theme in the storytelling.It is hard to read at times, it is hard to picture, and even harder to imagine being a mother and allowing your teenage son to enlist and begin this journey knowing that the odds of ever seeing him again were 99 to 1.But the thing that is great about The Long Walk is the story of friendships and support between Walkers that ultimately have to come to end as each Walker \\"drops out\\" of the race.I sometimes wish there was some more back-story on the political environment of this world but there are hints at times.It always reminded me of Shirley Jackson'sThe Lottery, a short story about a town that holds an annual stoning of whichever resident \\"wins\\" the lottery. No one questioned why it was being done, it just was because that's the way it always was. A lesson to be learned by all that questioning things can sometimes be for the advancement of a society."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one heck of a book. I love SK and he outdid himself on this one. It's not the typical scary book but it tells a gripping story."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The whole concept of this book I found to be fascinating. Walk or you die. I wanted more. I wanted more of a conclusion. I am sure I missed some deeper meaning King was trying to get across but having the \\"winner\\" end it the way they did just left me with a want. I stayed up late to finish this book and this is what I got??!!! I was not happy !"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I was surprised when I read The Long Walk by Stephen King. I was always used to him writing horror stories to try and grasp the reader. But I was glad I read this book, because it taught me a lot about how important characters are when it comes to writing a novel.The Long Walk is no horror story...it is not \\"suspenseful\\" or \\"creepy\\" or \\"bone-chilling.\\" This atmosphere of suspense has been replaced with the feeling of being disturbed. I have read the book once, and I'm going back to read it again. Once you start reading the first few pages, King builds up suspense as the main character, Ray Garraty, constantly stares at his watch until it hits nine o'clock. The Walk starts at nine, and believe me, once you know what happens to the losers, and you go back to re-read the beginning, your heart starts to jump a little at the thought of the Walk.Imagine being drafted into a marathon. Imagine watching TV one day as an army major pulls names out of a hat, and he says yours on television. If you were in the story, that would mean you get to participate in the Long Walk, along with ninety-nine other teenage boys your age.Only one can win. Everyone else gets a \\"ticket,\\" which I won't tell you about. the most amazing part of the book is the characters; you can post on online forums to hear some of the trash-talk other teenagers say, and that's exactly what they sound like in the book. I like how King captured realistic dialogue in this novel. He also added unique personalities to each character to make them seem real enough. They were for me. In fact, he wrote it so well that the whole story seemed real enough to me.The theme of the book is so original and...well, how should I put this...sick and disturbing. If some of you readers out there like books with happy endings, you won't like this one bit. The idea of the book (walking in a lethal marathon) is so freakishly created that there were several times in which I had to close it for a few seconds because the idea scared the crap out of me. Think about it; you're walking in a race where only one person will make it out alive. And the characters seemed so real I felt like I was the main character.Is this book boring? Not in the least bit. Do they walk for 200 pages? Yes, but it isn't boring at all. You see, each character receives background information that was inserted perfectly into the plot. After a while, you feel sorry for learning so much about a character, then having to see them go.But another interesting part of the book is friendship. the main character makes friends, yet he knows that he shouldn't, because eventually, one of the friends will have to buy his ticket.I could easily relate to several of these characters. This is probably one of my favorite books of all time. I recommend any King fan to pick it up and read it; it isn't a horror story, but it is an interesting read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've grown bored of Stephen King. I believe his creativity diminished as his guaranteed sales numbers increased. As a lark, I read two of his Bachman books to see if the creative juices had returned for these stories. I was not disappointed. The story here involves children walking across America as a national contest, with the winner being set for life, and the losers having their lives ended. A bizarre and disturbing story, but well-written with fascinating characters. Anyone above the age of 10 will know who the winner will be after the first page, but all of the characters grab your attention and the way the boys interact will keep you reading. I strongly recommend this story."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Steven King's books always leave me feeling mixed. His stories are always exellent in the long run, but he leaves me always feeling that the same story could have gotten accomplished in a two to three hour period rather than a full day's reading. I always feel that not much was accomplished besides from going from point A to point B. But when I run the events of the book over in my head a lot does happen but it doesn't seem to be enough.The Long Walk though by no means is a bad story. It is a great story and very powerful. It rips your emotions up showing no mercy. The deadly walk/race that is only won when the other 99 participants are dead. You get to know these charaters and feel for them and watch them die just because they couldn't keep pace. If any of them lag behind, or doing anthing else that gets them under 4 mph. They get a warning, if they get up to four warnings they are shot dead. If they manage to keep pace for one hour one warning will be taken off. They do not stop for sleep or stop for any other reason. Got diahrea? BANG! Got a cramp? BANG! they don't care as long as you just go above 4 mph. Or Else.... The Winner? He gets all that he desires but at the end of such a race does he want it?This book undoubtedly can be looked at in many different lights. A mediphor of life, possiably the final result of going to the next level in Reality T.V., or a abstract inside look of the long walk the Nazis made the survivers of the concentration camps suffer through. You tell me which view is the correct one 'cause I don't know."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I just finished reading the long walk a few days ago and i have to say that i was fasinated with the concept of the book. The idea is very original and entertaining. However the ending was disappointing. The author never tells us what happens after Ray Garraty &quot;seems&quot; to have won the long walk."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Slowing down is one thing that this novella does not do. The pace of the action, and the development of the characters, and the true compassion you start to feel for the poor &quot;walkers&quot; all draw further and further into the web that Stephen King weaves.The Long Walk was orginally published in paperback as part of a compilation known as &quot;The Bachman Books.&quot; The Bachman books contained three other short stories, one of which is no longer published anywhere due to recent controversy over shootings in high schools.The long walk is about a competition in which 100 people walk at a pace of 4 miles per hour, until there is one man standing. If a walker slwoed past 4 miles per hour, he received a warning. Three strikes, and you were shot on the spot.The ending of the book is so powerful, I still begin to think about it whenever I watch a marathon on TV, or watch people on the treadmill at the gym.This book is a work of absolute wonder, and is more than worthy of all the praise that I could possibly give to it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is one of a handful of short novels that King wrote under the Bachman pseudonym. It seems to have sprung from the same kernel of inspiration as the more famous and more hip, but less intense &quot;Running Man&quot;. Both novels are set in a near-future USA where the most popular form of public entertainment is watching losing contestants &quot;buy their ticket&quot; in a diabolical game show spectacle.At the outset, the central character Garraty, is joined by 99 other hopefuls. The rules are simple; walk until you drop. Anyone unable to maintain a minimum pace or who attempts to escape is summarily despatched by the dispassionate military escorts. Along the way, our hero (who, importantly, is just an ordinary guy. He is YOU) is touched by friendship (McVries saves his life and keeps his spirits up), hatred (Barkovitch, who is demonised by the other contestants and ultimately becomes a pathetic sight, pleading for reconciliation), pity, horror, contempt, love, bitter humour and even a numbing morbid ambivalence through his sporadic conversations with the seemingly unstoppable Stebbins. You will have gathered by now that this is pretty deep stuff and far from being a typical King novel. The parallels between the Long Walk and each of our journeys through life are clear and profound. It made me consider my own mortality on many occasions and I salute King for achieving the almost perfect balance between exciting non-stop action and penetrating and memorable allegory.Furthermore, the book is almost unputdownable. I defy anyone not to feel obliged to complete it in one sitting. The image of the journey, both physical and metaphorical is an extremely powerful one. Just like Garraty is compelled to put one foot in front of the other the reader feels obliged to plough on chapter after chapter to see what lies around the next corner or who is the next to drop. And drop they do! I was concerned that King may have his work cut out to maintain the reader's interest through 99 executions. He does though; from the spectacularly messy death of the wretched Olsen to the quiet and poignant demise of the &quot;unknown boy&quot;.For my money, I regard this as probably King's greatest achievement, so why not top marks then? Simply because ultimately The Long Walk doesn't quite deliver the goods. What would have been a very interesting theme - the boys motives for entering the Walk and the pressure placed upon them from family, friends, lovers and the wider community, is only touched on very briefly. Most disappointing of all however, was the denouement. NEVER BEFORE HAVE I FELT SO CHEATED BY A BOOK'S ENDING! OK, so we can all guess who's going to win the Long Walk, but what does the victor chose for his prize? Does he use it to hit back at authority? Does he even survive long enough to claim it? How does it affect his relationships and plans, etc, etc, etc?I'm sorry Stephen King, but after stoking your readers' emotions to such a height, you should not leave us checking our copies of the book in case some malevolent person had torn the epilogue out!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I thought Stephen King did an excellent job keeping my attention in The Long Walk. I'm not much of a reader and I must say this book makes me want to read more often. I really like the way Stephen King doesn't clue you in on what is going to happen next. He surprised me through out the whole book. I never expected 'buying a ticket' meant death. I honestly thought it meant a ticket to go back home. From the moment I found out what a 'ticket' really was I did not want to put the book down at all. When i did need to stop reading I couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen next and who would be the next to 'buy a ticket'. Stephen King kept me on the edge of my seat at all times with the unexpected occuring.Another aspect of this book I like is the way I feel like I personally know the characters, especially Ray Garraty. Although you don't know much about the characters when the book starts, you find out more and more of almost every character as the Walk goes on through the stories the boys share with one another. Stephen King uses such great descriptions I could see the boys walking down the streets like I was there myself. The ending of the book took me by complete surprise. Honestly, I didn't understand it at first and had to read it a couple more times and have my mom explain it to me. This was the way I didnt want the book to end and it even made me upset. I can proudly say I am very happy I chose this book as an outside reading project for school and will most definitly read it in the future. This was absolutely the best book I have read so far. {=0)"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was an interesting story, but really not one of King's best. (I'd vote for &quot;Insomnia&quot; there.) There were two flaws, I felt. One was that I would have liked to have been given a bit more information, hints at least, about the nature of the society that would create such a contest, especially in the first fifty or so pages. The second flaw may bloom from the first; I simply could not achieve &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;, because I simply couldn't imagine that many kids volunteering for something with a 99% chance of certain death, and a 100% chance of extreme pain, suffering, humiliation, and horror."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm an avid Stephen King reader.

The Long Walk has that feel. It tells a story where the primary component is the interaction of participants in a contest that will spell the death of all but one of them. The reason behind the contest itself, and how it came to be, are left rather nebulous. Additionally, the story ends abruptly, and seems unfinished. I wonder if Stephen King got tired of writing it, and just tied if off suddenly. Among the other King novels I have read are Pet Semetary, The Stand, 11/22/63 and Bag of Bones. I like The Long Walk least, but still I found it interesting as a character study, and easily finished the book. 11/22/63 is a new King novel, and I recommend that one best of the King novels I have mentioned."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Out of all of the books and short stories I've read by Stephen King, The Long Walk was the most unique. It still has that macabre part of Stephen King that we all know and love, but it isn't horror. It's comparable to the modern-day hit The Hunger Games.The Long Walk is an event that takes place where 200 boys, 100 participants and 100 back-ups, are picked randomly to participate where they walk for days on end. Keep your pace above 4 miles per hour, because if you don't after 3 warnings, you are shot and killed.The main character is Ray Garrity, and throughout the book he mingles with some of the 100 he's walking with and forms a bond with a few of them, one being a boy named Pete McVries. As day and night passes slowly and hundreds of miles have been walked and boys are killed (in the book it's called \\"buying their ticket\\") one by one, the struggle for life over death become extremely real.Each character you meet in the book has his own idea of life and death, their own way of coping with The Walk, and what their life has been like before The Walk. As the characters continue walking and some of them even go insane, you see from Garrity's point of view what it takes to stay alive and how important mind over body is.There are a few reasons I didn't give this book five stars. For one, the ending was predictable to me and it left me wanting way, way more than what was given. Also, there were many, many details throughout the book that I thought were unnecessary, and some pages could be completely skipped through. But at the end, I thought this book was a very good read, and you weren't left bored reading it. It was definitely something I finished quickly, and finishing it was my first priority. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone (over about 17, of course due to language, some sexual crudeness and gore) and am definitely going to end up reading this book again."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Well the ending was not quite what I was prepared for even though I was gearing myself up for some Stephen King type finish which usually doesn't end too well for the main characters.I almost feel like I'm speaking blasphemy by saying this because Stephen King is my idol. Hee hee"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Good story that kept my interest. End was anticlimactic after all that. Just kind of stopped and left me wanting more."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I originally read this story as part of a series of short stories and it was extremely compelling. When I saw this book ten years later I had to read it. Unfortunately, the 300 page book is no different from the 30 page story. Really; I couldn't tell you what was added. The story is so basic and the true &#34;horror&#34; is in imagining yourself as part of this and what you would do, so it loses its appeal quickly. Maybe I had too high of expectations.I''m a huge Stephen King fan, but this belongs as a short, not as a novel. Imagine singing &#34;99 bottles of beer on the wall&#34; to the end and you get the point."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book was really, really, really creepy. Not many stories get to me, but boy this one sure did"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is the perfect example of what happens when a writer gets bored with his current book and rushes through just to finish it.Granted the whole idea of the Long Walk is hardly King's style, it's a great \\"noir\\" concept - 100 boys under 16 take part in a competition - one wins, the 99 get killed. And from the start up until 2/3 of the book the writing is typical SK - small Americana stories from the past intertwine with the ongoing story that would keep you reading (imho). But the last third of the book is the most sloppy writing I have ever read, period. After building up a good story, King all of a sudden rushes through the last part, leaving many questions unanswered, many stories untold and the main characters' deaths lack any emotion and are told in just a couple of sentences. In a nutshell, one can read about 2/3 of this book and just put it down and move on, without missing anything. A real shame as the build-up is great, but there is no \\"pop\\" towards the end.I honestly can't say if I would or would not recommend this book...But if given the choice, I would much rather NOT read this book than read it and be left with all those question marks and plot holes."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The book itself is not a typical Stephen King horror book. It is more like a bad 80s slasher movie, which deals with a bunch of kids on some kind of a road race where losers are killed. I must admit that though I did not quite find it thrilling, once I had started reading it I wanted to know what it was really all about and how it would all end. Needless to say, I was angrily disappointed with the ending. There are much better Stephen King's novels out there, and this is certainly not one of the best. I do not find it to be even a good novel."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was a really great story that pulled me in and had me cheering the characters but the ending totally sucked. King obviously didn't know how to end it. The book could have also been cut by close to a hundred pages and still have the same effect."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is about a 16 year old boy named Garrtey, who signed up for this walk. The walk is around 180 miles. Garretty and 99 other people were sitting in the grass when the Lieutenant came to give them their numbers. Garrety was number 47. the walk was very difficult, and so were the rules. You couldn't stop, if you get 3 warnings you were shot. If the person needs more water, the solider would go and give them a new canteen. The winner (or the first person to cross) wins a $10,000 cash prize plus a wish of whatever he or she wants.I think that the book had some strengths because it was pretty good and that it was written pretty good and it described the people really good. When he wrote it, it made you feel like you were actually in the book.If I were to compare this book to another one, I don't know what I would compare it with, because I haven't read any books about a people walking to and risking their lives trying to get a prize.I would recommend this book to people who like a little action, and suspense because you don't know what's coming up next. This book has some suspense because you don't know who's going to get shot next, and if who's going to make it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Every year, 100 teenage boys are selected for the Long Walk. Everyone gets a canteen, processed food belts and 3 warnings. After 3, your simply shot. You must not walk under 4 mph, speed walk, or come to a complete stop. You must not harm or help the other walkers. An interesting premise, of course. But, how Stephen King, (Bachman) can write 370 pages of this psyche, it's very tiresome. It's very effective material, because as Ray Garraty, our protagonist, gets weaker and weaker throughout the walk, mentally and physically. YOU get weaker and weaker during the LONG read. I found myself staggering, tired, rushing to complete this book.And they walk on..and they walk on..and they walk on. A conversation...and they walk on. A 2 page flashback...and they walk on. New terrain...rain...and they walk on.This book is as excruciating to read, as this very review I'm sure."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read 1000s of books and have rarely been disappointed. This story was a major disappointment. I will admit that it was an original idea for the time it was written but to be so invested in the characters and to simply end the story the way it ended was stupid. DO NOT waste your time. Go for a real walk and enjoy life! Hey King, you owe me $6.95 and 2 wasted evenings."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Richard Bachman's OK, I guess, but he's no Stephen King. At least, not here. I was actually quite shocked at how shallow this book was -- King's tales are usually multi-layed wonders with unexpected twists and turns, but &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is so one-dimensional and underdeveloped that I had to keep glancing at the cover to make sure I hadn't picked up the wrong book by mistake. And don't even get me started on the ending, which is so graceless and sudden that it left me feeling like an amputee. Skip this one, kids...."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"everything went very well. book was in great shape. would definitely use these guys anytime they had the best price on a book i was after. one of king's best books btw"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"i think that the long walk was a great book. it was a fun book to read. it had alot of good detals.i liked how he discrbed how people died. it was just a fun book to read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Disappointing. I love King, but this one drags on and on. The message he is trying to convey is subtle... really, like a sledgehammer on crystal. There is one storyline, and you keep reading on and on for a \\"twist\\", or something, anything OTHER than the long road. That's all you get. A long, boring road with one very straight-on conclusion."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read nearly all of Stephen King's/Richard Bachman's books. As much as I usually love his stories, the endings usually fall flat. This book, however, was boring the whole time. It dragged on. Then it just stopped. There's not even an attempt at a proper ending. Perhaps that's the point. Either way, was disappointed. It only earned the two stars I gave it for a couple of interesting scenes in the later chapters. I thought the book was finally getting good, but it didn't last. Oh well...on to my next read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is an excellent book of King and probably the best he's written as Richard Bachman. The flow of the book is perfect, the characters are extremely real and likeable but the scare factor isn't there. Yes, its shocking and weird but not scary like most horror books. If you want a good scare I'd recommend Blood Crazy by Simon Clark or Darker Than Night by Owl Goingback. You don't get much scarier than this."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"In all truth, it is the best book I've ever read.It might sound like a bit much, but it's entirely the truth.I first read this book when I was a young kid in elementary school, and since then I have read it over ten more times, if not more. . . .Never have I read a book that drew me into a story as much as this one did -- one that I could get completely lost in. Never have I read a book that so easily avoided a typical story to tell a fabulous, genius tale. And never have I read a book that made me question and ponder a piece of writing so much as this one. . . . especially the ever-curious, ever-brilliant ending.Having read other King works, I know that this far exceeds them in quality. King is alright. King is decent. But this is not King. This is Bachman. Bachman is genius. A great read. A fantastic read. I love it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk was a very good book where you really feel like you are walking along with the characters every step of the way. This was an unbelievably quick read for me because I was so eager to find out who would die next. However, the ending (don't worry, I won't give anything away) left me very upset. It didn't make much sense. It was the kind of ending where it just ends with no explanation whatsoever. Aside from this absolutely terrible ending, though, the other 369 pages were extremely well written and kept my attention throughout the whole journey."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I liked the book, but the ending was really wierd. Read the book. Oh, and the ending......if you reread it a few times you'll finally get it! (This also one of S.K.'s more gory books). In my opinion."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Great book. I loved the idea and it keeps you reading. Your like a magnet to metal. It sticks to you. You can't put it down! This is my first Stephan King book and I must say it won't be my last. I also thought the ending was great. Garraty wins the long walk and goes crazy at the end. Magnificent! I rate it 5 starts! Way to go King!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Boy, I guess i really got into the book, because I couldn't help feeling really really tired...I don't know, maybe it's just me. The book was very good, but I'm one of those that didn't like the ending very much. Maybe it's just too deep for me or something, but I would have liked a different ending.Sorry...."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I will keep it short.Good book, it keeps your attention the whole time.But the ending really sucked. But don't buy the book like this go out and get the Backmen books (A story collection) at a used book place for a lot cheaper.Or go to the library."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"First book that I have read that I couldn't put down. The ending could have been a little better."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I have ever read. I have always been leary of reading anything by him because I had heard that he was very descriptive and lengthy. From what I have read on these postings, I must have picked his best book yet to start with. I was very impressed with him and didn't find it ever to drag. The first night I had this book, I had sat down to just start it and had read through half the book before I noticed it.I do have to say that the last few paragraphs kind of threw me for a loop at first. I did have to go back and reread it just to make sure I wasn't missing anything.It did make me tired reading about all that these young boys endured throughout this long walk. I kept thinking how unfair things were for them. Anyway, I thought it was great, and I will read many more by him."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King wrote The Long Walk under his pseudonym Richard Bachman. As Stephen King has said, Richard Bachman is Stephen King on a rainy day. While most Stephen King books have happy themes intertwined with terror (his horror books) or other terrible circumstances (e.g., wrongful imprisonment as in Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption), Richard Bachman books are depressing all the way through.In this book set in an alternate present, a group of one hundred teenage boys, including the hero, Ray Garraty, start out on a \\"long walk,\\" in which the winner gets money and a separate prize and all the rest of the walkers get a \\"ticket.\\" The ticket, as many reviews have explained, and as you learn about 10 pages into the book (so it's not a spoiler) is a euphemism for a bullet or two in the brain. The kids all have to walk at 4 miles per hour. If a kid ducks below that pace, he gets a warning. If he gets three warnings he gets shot. However, if he can keep walking for an hour after he gets a warning, the warning is revoked.As you can imagine, this book is really a 350 page exploration of pain, suicidal thoughts and how strong the will to live really is. Since very few of us, outside of holocaust or Jim Jones survivors have experienced such a thing, it is a triumph of King's great writing that this all seems very real.The book is very much centered on the long walk, the pain and the anguish. Much of the book is about the transformation of good, bad, cynical, innocent, smart and dumb people under these extreme circumstances. Nevertheless Garraty and many of the other walkers do talk about their lives before the walk with each other, and you get a glimpse of what life is like under this totalitarian government. You also get two hints of why America has become such a horrible place that this is a prime sort of entertainment for America. (perhaps there are more hints, I only caught two). These hints were fascinating.The focus does remain on the long walk itself though, which distinguishes it from Running Man, the most similar King book (also \\"written\\" by Richard Bachman), which also is a book about a horrible life-and-death contest in America for sport in a country that has taken a wrong turn somewhere. In Running Man, you get much more of a flavor of the surrounding world. However, The Long Walk is just as interesting.Only one flaw kept it from being a five star book (and it is a problem with many King books). I was disappointed by the ending (which I will not spoil). I think the ending is supposed to be a bit of a surprise. However, rather than a surprise, it was something you would guess as a possible ending early on but hope it turned out differently.Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was a great book, for me, anyway. It was a page turner (as some may call it) because the first day I got it I read it for five hours (three in the morning and two at night) and the next day I read it for another two hours and finally finished. It was so exciting even though the idea was kind of silly that these mindless, emotionless soldiers would blow 14-16 year old kids' brains out. There was quite a few gory scenes in it. My favorite part was that King got into the characters so well, you either hated them or liked them. But the main characters Ray, Pete, Art, Stebbins and so on (there were so many characters) were so real. I actually missed and felt bad for them when they died. Even some of the characters some people might hate, like Barkovitch and Olson and Parker, I still liked them, in a way. Anyway this is a good book and I recommend you read it and pass it on to a friend. Although i thought it was good, some people won't like it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I first read this book as a young child and recently re-read it, as it had managed to stick with me for many years. I find the book to be interesting because it compels me to want to know what is going to happen next, or perhaps better said &quot;who&quot; is going next. King paints the suggestion that this is the future of telelvision game shows, and considering the recent revival of &quot;reality tv&quot; I'm wondering if he's not that far off. I give 4 stars, because I never feel that King fleshes out his characters enough for me, however, there is enough waiting and wondering for the reader, in this book, to make up for it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is a story that allows a glimpse into the mind of the teenage male. Maybe the society that would allow such an event as the Long Walk can never happen, but the willingness of the boys to take part in this 'game' can easily be imagined. The boys are not forced to enter the game, but instead compete for a chance at what they see as the glory if they win. Only after they ahve started and their friends fall behind around them, do they realize their small chance of actually making it through the Long Walk. My favorite Bachman book!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have to admit that I've been less than enthralled by King for the longest time. I'm either disappointed at an ending that is an anti-climax or just can't get past the half-way point without dozing due to boredom. This is a surprising exception. From the very beginning King held my interest by not allowing much information to be given about 'being ticketed'. It also helps that the Walkers, for the most part, are given a three-demensional existence so the readers can sympathize with them. This is real, flesh-and-blood, individual youth being manipulated in order to compete in a popular 'game' which, in turn, reflects on just how bloodthirsty this wretched society has become. I would say that this is one of King's best efforts!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"While I admit it is dark and morbid, it is probably my favorite story! It really brings you into the story and you feel like you are walking with them. I have read and reread this story many times and I never tire of it. I think if you read a Stephen King book and you are surprised or offended by its darkness, you shouldn't be reading King. You have to get past the horror of it and really read it. The character development is wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is a good Stephen King novel. It is not as polished refined or focused as other efforts, but as with almost all of his work it is spirited reading. The work introduces us to the parallel King universe of Richard Bachman, where it is indicated that the view is more dark and cynical.As many of Stephen King's novels, the novel itself is an examination of the human experience as depicted and revealed through exceptional circumstances. Although not as poetic, I liken the Long Walk to Cool Hand Luke. Both the book and the movie concentrate on flawed savior figures, in which we can easily identify ourselves, placed in constrained circumstances.The Long Walk centers around Ray Garrity who has elected to participate in the Long Walk, which is an endurance walking contest for young men. In this surreal parallel universe, the familiar geography of our United States is controlled by an unnamed marshal force. The controlling government challenges the fortitude of its young men, suggesting participation in a suicide contest. The rules are simple: the boys must continue walking at a pace of 4.0 mph or better. If a contestant fails, after three (3) warnings, to maintain this speed; he is shot and killed on the spot. There is only one winner, the last boy walking, and to him goes the satisfaction of any wish and whim he desires.While the horror or imminent and random death is the backdrop for the story, the substance lies in the examination of the individual participants and their individual reasons for participating. Garrity commiserates with those in his like lot. Engaging in discussions about the meanings of their lives, the boys examine their individual reasons for their participation, and form personal alliances for survival which seemingly go against the individual's chance for ultimate success. The main character, Garrity, is forced to examine himself and the reason for his participation. The circumstances are complicated when a stoic participant turns out to be the Major's (the symbol of Marshal law and host of the contest) son. Garrity is required to contemplate whether the ultimate reward is worthy of his participation.In many senses, the Long Walk is an extended and perhaps stretched allegory of life itself. The vagaries of life and death and the people and acquaintances we meet along the way. The Long Walk is definitely an enjoyable book that is filled with the texture that King lovers have come to appreciate. However, it is not as broad, accomplished or refined as other works, such as It, The Shining, The Body or Shawshank Redemption; or as horrifically well executed as Pet Sematary or Salem's Lot."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"after reading this book, i felt as if i had walked with the characters. it actually made me tired it was so full of descriptions of how each character was feeling and everything. the reader had a mental picture of what each walker looked like, smelled like, the tension between the walkers...it was overall a very good book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This Bachman title--secondly only to Rage--is a beautiful, well told, and highly thought provoking tale. (Rage being the Bachman Title King removed from print out of the dispicable act of Self censorship--and to make matters sadder, it was his best work.)It discribes a sporting event that is truly horrible in its particulars that everyone gathers to watch with great excitement. Of 100 boys, only one will win. And the consolation prize for the 99 that don't... death. King does a brilliant job getting you inside the head of the main character, and the emotion can be hard hitting. The story is well paced and well told, and the ending is more appropriate and surprising than I could have ever expected. A definate must read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"a story about a boy who, like many others agreed to take a walk. not just any walk but a walk where if you fall back far enough..they kill you. the characers are great and the story if riveting. i could not put this one down. if you like king, or just want something different, then you have found a good one."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I was never one for fiction until about 15 years ago when I read The Long Walk. I have since read hundreds of books, and I think this is still my favorite. King is always better when he keeps within the paramaters of the possible, like The Body, and Shawshank. I have recently re-read this horror story, and it holds up to my first impression. It also reminds me how disapointing books like the Stand are when a perfectly possible story is ruined by the loss of all sense of reality.This is the book you give to an adult who says he finds reading fiction boring."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk, which I read as part of a collecion of stories called THE BACHMAN BOOKS by stephen king, is a fantastic novel which takes place in the near future. There is a competition called the Long Walk in which teenage boys see how long they can walk without stopping. Of course there is a twist: go under 4 mph and you're dead. Because of this constant suspense, the book is hard to put down. Not only is it a creative story, It has very touching moments and the ending is magnificent. I recommend this book and &quot;RAGE&quot; By stephen king, which you can also read in THE BACHMAN BOOKS."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read many of Stephen King's books and I believe that Richard Bachman brings out the best in him. The Long Walk is the best book ever written in the entire world. I loved it. It's written in the eyes of a 16 year old boy so you get a feel of a 16 year old guy's wants and needs. Ray Garraty is in the contest where you have to &quot;walk out&quot; 99 other guys before you can get your prize. If you get three warnings, you get your ticket: death. I've finished reading it for the third time and every time I read something that I missed the time before. This is the only book you'll ever need cuz after you read it, you won't want to read any other book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book proves that Stephen King is the Great American Writer. After reading, I have felt my feet and back aching, this is how convincing and persuasive &quot;Long Walk&quot; is. Stephen King's insight into human psychology is honest and brilliant. That is what is giving power to all his books: Honesty. Not to mention language skills, of course."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is a rare instant where I actually enjoyed a Bachman book (except for the Regulators and Desperation which were thrilling). I was actually trying to breath for the long distance walkers and at one point, even felt tired along with the characters in the book. It was that realistic. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Reading this book was like watching a car crash, you want to but you can't look away! This book was disturbing on a number of levels. You begin to feel the futility and exaustion of the boys as the book drags on, but you just can't stop reading until you reach the end, if you reach the end, but then what...?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was an excellent read, I had read 95% of it in one day. I have read some criticisms of the ending, but the ending was intelligent. It is ambigious, and seemingly purposefully so. If you want to settle into a happy ending where the knots are fitfully tied, perhaps Judy Blume would be more suiting. I took a different spin on the book, somewhat similar to another critic's note on the simliarity of the Nazi death marches. I found this to maintain a striking similarity to the Vietnam crisis. Consider the parallels: At the beginning, all of the boys are psyched, blind, not knowing what they are getting into. The idea of a 'bang' flag suggests the notion of seeming invincibility. Yet when entered into the &quot;crisis&quot;, most are not able to succeed against the enemy (in the case, the road, or, each other). Those in Vietnam who made it home, paid a terrible price, usually in terms of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Consider this ending, where the protagonist's victory doesn't seem to be &quot;all it's cracked up to be&quot;, sure he may receive or is intended to receive his &quot;prize&quot;, but that is anticlimatic to what he is undergoing...the psychological and physical exhaustion, as well as death if one interprets the ending this way. A fast round of applause for this thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is so dramatic and the story is so incredible and involving. King (Bachman) reveals the characters so well that you almost feel that you know them personally. I actually felt sadness when some of the members of the &quot;Walk&quot; went down. You MUST read this book!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is about some young people who engage on a \\"death march\\" in a race that promises big rewards. It is a very different from many of King's other books. Is is quite an interesting read and keeps the reader aksing \\"what happens next.\\" However, by the end of it the reader is left horriblt disapointed and asking himself, \\"what is the point of it all?\\" But this is only my opinion. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Having read most of Stephen King's bibliography, I find that the Bachman books stick with me the most. The Long Walk is a compelling, if exhausting, read. The book is easily one of King's best, and the haunting images of it will linger with you long after you finish it. It beats the pants off The Hunger Games in terms of immersing the reader in the chilling terror faced by young adults who are forced to their deaths under the guise of tradition."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Everything about \\"The Long Walk\\" is perfect making this book a masterpiece. Stephen King is spot on from the beginning to the end. A story that will leave you thinking about it for days. A creative ending makes the journey all worth while. \\"The Long Walk\\" is an original story from the imagination of an author who is the best of the best."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I was first introduced to The Long Walk from a friend who shared the same love of The Hunger Games. I wanted a gripping story that made you think about the will to live. With The Long Walk I got so much more then that. Stephen King did a fabulous job telling a story that really digs deep into a teenage boy's (Ray Garraty) brain. I was surprized how spot on his thoughts were. I've never found an author that could capture the complicity of the teenage mind quite like he does. The Long Walk felt like it could almost be real in that sense. I would recommend this book to people with an open mind. If that is not you then you might get bored quickly and not see the point. This story can burrow deep into your brain and remain in your thoughts forever, but only if you let it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Not the most exciting boook but it really gets you in the mind of the characters. King is always so good at that! Recommended to read!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King is my favorite author. That's not to say he hasn't had starts-and-stumbles like any other author, he has. The Long Walk though truly stands as his strongest masterpiece.The Long Walk is a perfect blend of science fiction and horror. The story is a simple one revolving around youths who are entered into a death sport...with the macguffin \\"prize\\" waiting for the winner at the end.But it is the journey that is so truly incredible. It is a frightening experience to read this story and feel like you are there walking alongside the contestants as they plod one step closer to a \\"third warning\\" and the delivering of their \\"ticket\\".I envy any reader who has the chance to take this walk with King for the first time. And for those who have already read The Long Walk, there's still joy/discovery to be found in repeated trips. No Kindle should be without THE LONG WALK."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Again, this character driven novel was hard to put down. One of King's finest. And next to his Dark Towers series, one of my favorites. I emotionally felt every mile these boys walked - every bit of their pain, became so attached I experienced personal loss, even for the winner, by the end of the story.I read this many years ago and read it again years later, then just ordered it on kindle last month and read it again. Need I say more?King is the master - Susan Stec, author, The Grateful Undead: They're so Vein"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"My review is short. I enjoyed the book to an extent but I really hated the ending. I was hoping to read what he received at the end in the way of lifelong entitlements."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"While this novella is great and can easily stand on its own, do yourself a favor and find yourself a copy of The Bachman Books which contains The Long Walk, The Running Man (also one of King's best works, imho), Rage (which is excellent but now out of print), and Road Work."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Reason for Reading: I'm in the process of of re/reading all of Stephen King's works in chronological order. This was the next book in line.I originally read \\"The Long Walk\\" when King released his omnibus of \\"The Bachman Books\\" in 1985. Of the four novels \\"The Long Walk\\" and \\"The Running Man\\" were my favourites and I was looking forward to this re-read. Initially, the book struck a chord with me because even back in the eighties I could imagine a world where game shows had turned to life or death. Of course, now, in the 21st century, with reality shows that embarrass, degrade, hurt and sometimes seriously injure participants physically and/or emotionally; the life and death scenario is not so hard to imagine in today's death culture and in fact has already been done with the mock abortion reality show \\"Bump\\".In \\"The Long Walk\\" we are in a future America, which has a dictator and a military presence, we know only that some event happened in the past for things to turn out this way. Boys from the age of 14 to 17 are allowed to enter the annual Long Walk, from which 100 contestants are chosen. The event is a national spectacle and parts of it are aired on TV and millions of dollars are exchanged in bets on who will be the winner. The book focuses on the race from one participant's point of view and we experience the physical, emotional and mental hardships and breakdowns that these boys suffer. Penalty for slipping below 4 miles per hour during the walk results in a warning every thirty seconds, after the 3rd warning, their is a 30 second countdown and the loser is shot dead and carried away. The game ends when one contestant remains alive. I really appreciated the psychological insight into the Walkers as a whole group and as individuals; the dynamics as they broke down into small groups, pairs and loners; and the examination of the varying effects that the psychological and physical torture had on different individuals. Probably my favourite of all the Bachman books, but I'll have to reread them all before I make a definite decision. A reread that lived up to my expectations."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"the story is simple, yet incredibly profound at the same time. for me, this is nothing short of a masterpiece. i'm glad i got to read this book even though it's one of his lesser known titles."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"&quot;The Long Walk&quot; was the first book I read by Stephen king. Every year there is an event called &quot;The Long Walk&quot; where 100 teenage boys have to walk as long as they can. If they don't, they die. If they fall below 4mph they get a warning, the fourth time they fall below 4mph, they get shot. It's kind of a sad book because almost all of the characters die, but it's great. You'll have to read it to know what I mean, and I suggest you do."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST WRITING STEPHEN KING HAS EVER DONE.THE MOST GRIPING TALE IVE EVER READ. I ORIGINALY READ THIS STORY IN THE BACHMAN BOOKS MANY YEARS AGO. I GAVE THE BOOK AWAY AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR &quot;THE LONG WAlK&quot; EVER SINCE. THIS STORY WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT AND YOUR IMAGINATION!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one book I never tire of. I have read it so many times and I still crave it. The characters are awesome and so is the story line. If anyone wants to read an incredible book I would defenitly say read The Long Walk."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I loved the book PERIOD. The book didn't really explain the reasons for what was going on, but that was part of the charm of this book, we don't really know the depth or reasoning behind what is going on. I think if the reader had, than the reader would have lost that overall connection with the plight of the walker. I thought the book was outstanding but it left me wanting the winner to come back in another book and become the Major...explaining the who's, why's, what's, and how much's of it all. HEY MR KING, if you aren't too busy or too laid up, give up a follow up to this one, give me a nod???? GREAT PLOT!!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Truly a captivating book that was hard to put down. I enjoyed every step of the long walk. i was a little disappointed with the ending though. I would have liked to have seen what happened to the winner in the short and long term."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was definately a good story. I wouldn't really consider myself an avid King fan, but I really did enjoy reading this book. The story was horrifying, and sometimes crept into my dreams, and left me with that stomach churning feeling of desperation that these characters went through. The ending was kind of a dissapointment because somethings were not explained enough, but otherwise, a good book"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Before Bachman's untimely death of &quot;cancer of the seudonym&quot;, Stephen King wrote some of his most original work. &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is an example. It is like the spitting image of &quot;The Body&quot;, since both deal with the same subject: the loss of innoncence. But where &quot;The Body&quot; is an elegy to long gone friends, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is an scary tale of the erosion of childhood dreams.The premise is simple: 100 teenagers will walk, non-stop, until they drop one by one and are terminated, and the last one standing will be granted whatever his heart fancies. Around it King spools a gothic yarn of classic treatment. The kids that take the Walk go in expecting to fight only physical exhaustion. Slowly, they find out their enemy is a different one: MADNESS.Anybody wishing to take a walk on the dark side, come along. They are about to start..."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm not a huge Stephen King fan, but some of his books and short stories are pretty good, and I truly loved this novel and regard it as his best.King would no doubt be amazed to hear that anyone regards \\"The Long Walk\\" as his \\"best\\" book; it's one of his earlier books, written in the \\"Carrie\\" era when John Travolta was king of pop, and it was originally a \\"Bachman\\" novel - that is, written when, for experimental purposes, King hid his light under the bushel of a less famous pseudonym.Well, his later novels might have a more mature \\"style\\" and might flow easier, but the pace of this one is more tense and the characters are remarkably likable. And I'm amazed at how much confusion there is about what happens at the end. Reasonably intelligent people giving the ending an adequate amount of thought should have little trouble figuring it out.Set in a futuristic era, ruled by a military dictatorship personified by \\"The Major\\", the story is about 100 boys of high-school age who set off on a \\"Long Walk\\" which requires them to maintain a pace of 4 miles an hour, come steep hills, hell, or high water. Anyone who has walked a treadmill knows that this is quite a brisk walking pace. The ostensible goal is \\"The Prize\\" - everything that you want for the rest of your life.When a Walker drops below 4 miles an hour, he gets a warning. Three warnings are all that a Walker will get, though an hour without a warning enables the Walker to get rid of one warning. If a Walker slows down below 4 miles an hour while he's walking with three warnings, he's eliminated from the race. With extreme prejudice. By soldiers in a half-track armed with rifles. The winner is determined after 99 Walkers have been eliminated.Although this is both an early novel and a Bachman experiment, it's still vintage King - a macabre walk of death taking place in a recognizable middle-class setting.So King makes the occasion as festive as positive, adding his normal helping of cheerleaders, gym squads, Cub Scouts, Little League players, Italian fruit merchants, Grant Wood families, civic clubs, and automobile salesmen to the mix of spectators that cheer on the Long Walkers and roar at the crack of the rifles - as usual, this is King's way of accentuating the horror that he has created by \\"mainstreaming\\" it.Still, speaking as one who utterly despises endurance athletes, I see tremendous possibilities in this idea. If one could find a way to eliminate the lion's share of many thousands of real-world smug cliquish androgynous leisure-class weekend warriors that clog up metropolitan areas with their self-loving marathon fests and who clog up their other environs during the remainder of the week, what a finer, happier world we would live in!But the graphically-portrayed deaths of these boys aren't enjoyable at all. They are both pointless and heroically tragic. Even while making the Walkers very recognizably and coarsely adolescent, King is also able to make them quite endearing in their own way, much more endearing than the yuppie scum who participate in real-life marathons. As did other readers, I also enjoyed the camaraderie among the Walkers, made especially poignant by the knowledge that they had no hope of meeting again after the conclusion of the Walk.King's \\"message\\" is somewhat garbled by the curious \\"game show\\" quotations that precede most chapters, but it becomes clearer when a later chapter instead begins with a radio announcer's call from the second Cassius Clay/Sonny Liston fight: \\"The blood has begun to flow...Clay is killing him...Clay is killing him...Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know how to describe this scene.\\"Clearly, King means for this novel to be a \\"statement\\" against the violence of sports culture. It's a typical left-wing bogeyman, as is the right-wing military dictatorship that organizes \\"The Long Walk\\" as both ritual and money-maker. In real life, the intellectualoids who govern us would never tolerate the rule of a military that they hadn't already taken over, as far back as the McNamara era.And as athletes become wealthier and more yuppified, violence in professional sports has become less, not more prevalent, Mike Tyson notwithstanding. There is scarcely a millionaire sportsman today who would ever do anything as gauche as engage in open warfare for the good of the team.And while King agonizes over the \\"culture of violence\\", in the real world, young boys are severely disciplined for even having violent fantasies, such as bringing cap pistols onto school grounds or pointing an index finger at a rival and yelling \\"bang\\".Is the stench of violent death that pervades the world of \\"The Long Walk\\" any worse than the stench of antiseptic that pervades our own? And for all of the horror of the fictitious world that he created in \\"The Long Walk\\", is Stephen King aware of how relatively ATTRACTIVE it also is?He's on the right track when he describes the Major's presence as \\"very masculine and overpowering\\". The world of the Long Walk is all that and it is also scrupulously fair - both in the un-coerced manner in which Walkers participate and in the way that the rules of the Walk are disclosed beforehand and enforced honestly during the Walk itself.\\"The Long Walk\\" is an excellent story which attacks largely non-existent targets, a story about a world not as nightmarish as the author intended, but considerably more alluring.In another setting, Stephen King himself has repeated the maxim that \\"it is the tale, not he who tells it.\\" He doesn't know how right he is here.I'm giving King 5 stars for this novel, but I'm also ordering him to re-read the 1948 Ray Bradbury short story, \\"Pillar of Fire\\", for a more accurate view of what the future looks like now."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was the second finished novel Stephen King ever wrote, and it does show some marked improvement over his first effort (Rage). The premise is, of course, a bit unlikely--the chances that America would ever come under rule of a totalitarian regime could have been said to be slim even at the time that the story was written. This tends to make what I believe King's point in this story was a bit obvious. The Long Walk is a metaphor for living--The Major would be God (receiving the adulation of the people who he &quot;torments&quot;), and that, of course, makes for some interesting thinking as to Stebbins' role in this book, but the analogy can continue with relative ease from there. This doesn't make the book bad--in fact, since he was so up front about the book's underlying meaning (a concept that King was still naive enough to think of as a product of authorial intent) that allowed him to create an interesting and engaging story. For the casual reader, this is a book that will both provoke thought and provide entertainment. For my part, I read it in a single sitting (it only seemed appropriate), and all things considered, I can say that I genuinely enjoyed the book. In view of that, I'd recommend this book to most readers--the only people who should have substantial issue with the writing would be those overly philosophical types who demand that all art have a statement but that it be in no way explicit about saying what it has to say. A good read to be had by all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This work by Stephen King is entitled \\"The Long Walk,\\": and is 'written by his alter-ego' Richard Bachman. Mr. King's work's a phenominel, and this is no exception.I'll admit, at the beginning King tried to make a big mystery what happens to the walkers who 'get their ticket.' Also, you could obviously tell what the ending would be like. What I thought would happen did, but at the same time, it didn't. I know, I know. You guys are think, 'How the hay did this chump 'know' but 'didn't know' the ending?' Well, my answer to that is relatively cheesy. You have to read this novel to find out. I should stop blabbing on about my opinion now, and get down to some business about what this book is really about.Ray Garrarty is young boy who makes the tough decision to participate in the most grueling competition known to man. The ultimate prize awaits the winner, but for the ninety-nine losers, an award also awaits them. Their eternal rewards.Back to the opinion... it sounds boring, and basically that is all the plots about. If someone tried to convince me to read a book with just that, I would think that they were crazy! But the thing is, King takes this plot that seems to go nowhere, and he extends it to make it the ultimate thrill, that cannot even be captured on a roller coaster!In conclusion, all I have to say is, \\"Doggone it! King has done it again!\\""},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've been reading King since.... well.... forever. I bought this book at least 6 times, I give books away that I like, then I want to read it again, so I buy it again. This was the first Bachman book I read. To me it's the coming of age book. What does it tell me? What did I get from it? It told me I like to read a good story, and I got enjoyment and a little fright, each time I read it I get something I didn't see before. Love the Kindle, now I can't give it away and I can read it whenever I want."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is large triple decker hamburger, oozing with cheese, the kind of thing you know has no redeeming value, but you can't stop ravenously inhaling it until it is gone because it goes down so easy. First, let me preface this review with my admitted bias...I LOVE ALL THING STEPHEN KING. (For the most part...the regulators and the books written around that time were not my favorite.) But, the Long Walk was written during a time he was using the Pseudonym Richard Bachman...he wrote Thinner, this book and a couple others before he was \\"outed.\\" The Long Walk is based on an interesting premise. Set in a not too distance, unspecified future of the United States, 100 young men are \\"given the opportunity\\" to apply for a competition called the Long Walk. All 100 start walking on a predetermined route, and the prize is won by the last boy still standing and alive. Walkers are given strikes for not walking fast enough or stopping...and if they get 4 strikes, they are shot and killed by the accompanying soldiers. The main protagonist, Garraty, is telling the story from his perspective. And the roadside kill nature of this book makes it difficult to put down. I know that this surprised me years ago when I first read it, and it surprised me again when I read again recently. For some reason, it reminds me of that Shirley Jackson short story about the town that periodically picks colored balls from a bag, and stones to death the one who picks the black ball. The future of the US is grey and hazy, but it is an alternative one. There are vague references to the Colonel in the story being of charge of jack boot enforders...and different outcomes to wars or invasions. But for me, that was all just distraction from the main thing...could I survive? What if I had to walk for three days straight???This is a quick read, but you will rememeber it forever."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Like all of the other Stephen King books that I have read I was deeply moved when I finished this. The plot is straight forward and simple enough. One hundred teenage boys are selected in an alternative history United States to begin walking at a marker in Maine (the typical King setting) and to continue walking until only one is left. If you drop below four MPH you get a warning. If you get more than three warnings in a three hour period you'll get your \\"ticket.\\" A strange premise indeed, but in the hands of King you'll begin to understand how even the most mundane things (like walking) can become seen as horrific and scary.This book bears a close resemblance to another King book written as Richard Bachman, The Running Man. The main themes of American voyeurism and our obsession with violence, games, and reality T.V. are explored. In fact this book feels like a spin off to that novel, which is definitely a good thing.The less you know about this book the better. What I will say is that the characters are very well written and quite believable. The social dynamics that develop among the young walkers is both fascinating and disturbing and will keep your mind occupied even when your not reading."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one of those books you read over and over! You SEE the whole thing in your mind as you take this \\"JOURNEY\\". Stephen King is the master of the written word and this is a book that should NOT be missed. Ray Garraty and the other gentlemen are people that are hard to forget!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. First, this book is amazing. A friend asked me the other day if I'd read it. When I said I hadn't, he gave me the gist of it. Four days later, I'm writing this review. The Long Walk is an amazing look at the human experience, both good and bad, that demands just as much from its readers as it does from its characters. If this book doesn't make you question your life, your past, or your faith nothing will.Secondly, to those who don't like the end of the book, I have to ask, what did you expect? The reasons how this walk began and why exactly these kids do is never answered, why should the ending be any more clear? Then of course, there's always the old fail safe, \\"It's the journey, not the destination, that's the thing.\\" But with all that said, I'd argue that there is a pretty definitive ending, it's just not spelled out for you in black and white. The author's asking you to stretch your legs (and imagination) a little, and join the Walkers, to see what they see..."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Years ago, I found this work by someone named Bachman on a table with other books with their covers torn off on sale for a quarter. It was a quarter well spent. Of all of King's works, this has most often appeared in my dreams. Something elemental is touched. Life as a journey, with the watchers and participants, thebest and the worst of us. I find it unforgetable."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"While entertaining, the book is simply too long. The plot is so simple ( walk or die ) that by the time I was half finished I was getting bored. The suspense does pick up again but the ending was pretty much a dud for me. The main problem is keeping the reader interested when pretty much all is going on is the same thing over and over."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Another favorite from Stephen King, and another paperback on my shelf that's almost too ragged to read. The Long Walk (originally published under King's pseudonym, Richard Bachman) is one of those books that gets better the more times you read it. The premise is actually pretty flat -- In the not-too-distant future, a group of 100 teenage boys is selected each year to participate in The Long Walk. Basically, the participants in this reality show death march begin walking in Maine and continue south as a group until they can walk no longer. If they drop beneath a certain speed, they're shot. If they stop for any reason (no bathroom breaks here, folks), they're shot. Blisters and head colds are a matter of life and death in this especially brutal race.That said, there's not much action in this book. The story focuses on the relationships and friendships that emerge among the walkers, and how these individuals change along the journey. As always, King draws characters that are memorable and very real. He parcels out information about them little by little, allowing the reader to get to know them alongside the other Long Walkers. It's hard not to get emotionally involved when they fall, one by one, along the side of the road.The ending is typical King -- is it a happy one? Does the \\"winner\\" get his \\"prize?\\" I've read the book many times and I still can't make up my mind. But I challenge you to read it and draw your own conclusion."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I love this book! It's different than anything else I've ever read and I think King does a great job with the characterization and making us feel what the characters are feeling. This is probably my favorite Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Easily one of the finest books king has ever written and one of my all time favorites. For me, there is a slight difference between the king novel and the bachman novel. The man behind the machine was the same but different whenever he wrote under each of these names. The way he takes us on a rollercoaster with the storys main character Garraty who watches his friends and the rest of the kids around him all die is remarkable to say the least. The story is based in the not so distant future and is nothing but pure adrenaline. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"In reading The Long Walk, I think it's important to make the distinction between a Stephen King novel and a Richard Bachman novel. The essay at the beginning of The Long Walk, \\"The Importance of Being Bachman,\\" talks about why Stephen King decided that he needed to create an alter ego who could say the things that he could not. The Bachman alter ego is darker than king, has a different sort of humor, and is not the sort of man you'd want to invite to dinner. Accordingly, though all King novels have an element of despair and darkness, The Long Walk is a study in endurance, human nature, and the will to live. One hundred boys start out on May 1st walking with no particular destination in mind, but with the idea that they will either value their lives enough to walk through any pain, struggle, or obstacle in their way or that they will die, shot in the head in front of their peers who actually do have the motivation to continue. This book was horrific in its honesty, startling in its depth. If you're a fan of Stephen King, I think you'll enjoy this book, but it is also important to know the difference between King and Bachman."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is the epitome of Stephen King's writing method. It's King's forte to turn a simple idea into a fascinating world--one that maintains a relatable identity while mangled by horrible situations. I've read a lot of King like a lot of others have, and I'm sure that his works are as addicting for me for that formulatic reason.However, addicting as haunted hotels and post-apocolyptic America is, the style gets as tiresome as it is powerful. He gets to be an over-descriptive wordsmith with gargantuan thickets such as It and The Stand.When Mr. King decides to humble himself and write a more meager novel, as is The Long Walk, his effect becomes all the more haunting, moving, shocking and resonant. Often, it's what one doesn't say that is just as (or in the case of horror: more) important than what one does. I fear Stebbins, the mysterious ironman Walker, much more than the Spider in It. The Spider may have pages illuminating it as the most unimaginably insidious beast...but what kind of society has such animalistic urges engrained into its veins that the Crowd and the Major can allow--no, love and spectate--this Long Walk? When King can allude to some dark force without actually showing it--as he does with The Long Walk--his work becomes magical enough to turn all the playing cards comprising his novel into a haunted castle whose halls echo indefinitely, and whose doors slam shut when they please.Read The Long Walk. The bottom line is that it's short and sweet...and sweet in King's world can tingle your blood cold."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm an avid SK fan! I've read everything he's written so far. (I have to say &quot;The Stand&quot; is my favorite, followed closely by &quot;The Dark Tower Gunslinger Series..I'm waiting!). Sorry to zone out there! I read &quot;The Long Walk&quot; several years ago and was horrified, it is a story every SK fan should read! It was so scary, sickening &amp; engrossing that even when I could have upchucked at the amazing minute details (SK is the master!) I would put the book down, shaken to the bone &amp; grab it back up again! You just couldn't stop reading it! I loved it and want everyone to read it!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"One of Stephen Kings best books! The concept of the Long Walk (I read it in Dutch, where it is translated as &quot;The Marathon&quot;) is amazing and gives you great insight in the madness of other societies, beliefs and ideas. Before you read it, you think &quot;this will never happen in modern society; the idea is outrageous!&quot;. But then you start thinking about all the other things people die for these days: the ideal weight (anorexic?), sports, an idea, a political belief....why not this? The book is very gripping, it is a cliche - I know - but it is very hard to put down. It moves you to tears sometimes, because King portrays the despair and the helplessness of the characters in a way where you want to reach in the book and help them yourself. Five stars! Normally I am not automatically a King fan (at least not all of his books), but this is a good one. It stays with you."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Am I the ONLY one who thinks this book is the granddaddy (sorry Stephen!) to The Hunger Games? I read The Long Walk as a 1970's small town teen & it has haunted me ever since. I can still recall how sick to my stomach I got when the brothers sat down in the middle of the road. How I cheered the one kid who ran into the crowd for one last \\"fling\\" or how white knuckled I became during that last turn on the highway. My son recently moved into his 1st apartment as a sophomore in college. Last night he called and asked if I had any good books to read because he was not used to the quiet. For some reason, I immediately thought of this book. Just placed my order and can't WAIT for it to get here. I am very anxious to see if he will love it as much as his mother did 35+ years ago. I hope it gives him much food for thought....sooooooo much more food that ANY Hunger Games!!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It's almost comical. The way a parent would let their childjoin in with 99 other boys just to let them die. Life is precious andthey threw it all away at the hope of gaining everything. I was entrigued at how vulnerable we all were at that age and how the very thought of our dreams coming true would drive us to fight for our lives. King created a novel that stripped the mask from humanity and revealed the underbelly of society. To sacrifice your own child to a cause that wasn't worth his life. Like many others,I felt that the ending was disappointing. But I actually felt something for the characters that many other novels lack; emotion. Conratulations to King on a book that will anger even the calmest of people and humble the most offensive. This is life in its raw form. Bravo."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It was a good book and kept me interested. Just a little disappointed in the ending.

This story was very well written, and I was able to picture each of the main boys based on the vivid descriptions. The end certainly was predictible, but there were many twists along the way. I don't want to analyze the book, because I believe that is personal opinion. However the main character in the story embraced so many characteristics and qualities that are symbolic of a heroic personality.I do think the ending was a bit of a letdown,but it was left open enough for interpretation."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"One of the most memorable stories King wrote. It stuck with me over the years and I just had to read it again."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I first read this book about six months ago and it has stuck with me since then. As far as a dystopian novel goes, this one has a straightforward premise: boys sign up for a walk in which only the victor will survive. It is highly publicized and attracts the attention of bystanders as the boys trudge through the storms and up and down mountains in their vain attempt at fame and fortune. Throughout the walk we learn the story of our protagonist and the stories of the fellow walkers, giving explanations for why anyone would be willing to risk such a horrific death.Personally, I would not survive such an experience. That is what I thought every time a boy was shot down for walking slower than the 4 mph speed. I cringed at the idea and description of attempting to relieve yourself or even tie your shoe when every second wasted was precious. Like all Stephen King novels, the ending is crazy. But it is not enough to detract from the entire story. Months later, I am still fascinated by the concept. I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I bought this book based on a review I read. At first I was disappointed because I expected more diverse action from the book than just walking and thought about not finishing. After reading a bit I'd put it down then be drawn back later.

This began a lot like he explained The Dome, with him having an old idea and having it set for quite some time. He eventually returned to the beast and he quickly went to work on it once more. This left something great out there and it left me thinking of just how good it could be.a lot of people have covered the breakdown of the book, editorals included, and i simply want to add a few things. First, I liked the way the atmopshere of this book felt. A few times I actually caught myself wanting to peek ahead just so i would know and have an answer. I did not because skipping here would have been an ugly thing to do, but it was still a thought I was running with. That says a lot about the author to me, and moreso considering I never do anything like that.The characters are top-rate and you really get a feel for them. In some of King's books the background is what merits attention or some item or something else. In his newer books he has gotten the characters and has been able to deliver them fully, and i like that. It was like he realized something and like he managed to put it into something that captures the noise behind the character itself.Its great.You also have the book itself and the plot owering it, and it is a great read. I do not want to spoil anything and would say for review readers to be aware of some of that. Closing, I also want to stress the fact that this is good and that it actually was better a second time around.5/5 strong.Thank you for your time"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"While I like this one the best, there are several other Bachman stories worth reading. The other well known Bachman story is \\"The Running Man\\" and \\"Thinner\\", which were released as a movie. I notice that these titles are all available separately for around $8.00 but they were once published as a set, and this set can be bought used for around $5.00. There is also a Kindle version of this. It is well worth reading all of them to truly appreciate SK at this stage in his writings.http://www.amazon.com/Bachman-Books-Novels-Richard-Regulators/dp/0451191935http://www.amazon.com/The Bachman Books : Four Early Novels by Richard Bachman (Rage / The Long Walk / Roadwork / The Running Man)gp/product/B003BKZW40http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BKZW40"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk grips you from the first death and doesn't let go. The suicidal aspect of volunteering for this event seems to hang over every mile of the &quot;race&quot;. It is also sad that all these boys must die, just as you are beginning to know them, along with the Ray Garraty character. Simply written, emotionally draining, and profound."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"That's unmistakably Bachman! Who else could have written a story where characters are shot one after one, one after another, sometimes in pairs, in triangles, but mostly on their own. With all others watching. Waiting for the finger of fate touch them and pass the leprosy of death. Grim novel, but somehow beautiful in its own right. Like 'The Regulators', written 26 years later, here we have no winners. The two novels are sisters, in fact. In the latter the main fetish is television, in the one I am reviewing, it is sports - with live performance and spectators. It reminds me of the old movie with James Caan, 'The Roller Coaster'. Participants are wolves to each other, and although at the beginning they have their sanity working, not long after they lose all humanity and real ground, transforming into animals who operate on instinct. The self-preservation one. There is one thing we share as a society, which King emphasizes as symptomatic and ever-present. The circus. Remember ancient Rome and gladiators? Rome's people needed circus and bread, and since then the human race has not changed much. I could perfectly imagine myself as a spectator of The Long Walk. I do not deny that there is a blood-thirsty animal inside my own self. And I am not alone, I guess, which makes this novel more real than one might think initially. A final word about the writing style. Abstracting from the subject of fiction here, we can clearly see that already as an undergraduate, Stephen King was perfectly able to get a good grip on our throat, to make us read madly, to interrupt the main story with leisurely paced amazing digressions, to put life into his characters - make them 3-dimensional and ripe, to transplant his memories of fatherland into fascinating environment, and finally, just to write a helluva lot of a good story."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk by Stephen King is suspensful because there is a nonstop in the action. From the opening 3 pages of the book to the very end. A grueling walk that if you even try to stop,the guards following in the white jeep will shoot the Long Walkersafter 3 warnings, until there is only one Long Walker left. This book is very descriptive about the walkers death. Stephen King has several ways to keep his audience into the book and entertained. The book also gives great descriptive information on how the Long Walkers become tired and exhausted. Another good descriptive passagesas how muscle spasms in the back of the legs in the back of the calfs. Stephen King uses the characters in the book to keep the Long Walking paceand keeping the audience informed about the characters by having them make conversations and began to tell about their lives. This book really gives great and intensifying action for any Stephen King fan."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I thought it was a great book for a bunch of reasons. For one, it kept you on the edge of your seat screaming for more. It also thoroughly explained how the people felt. The book was non-stop action. If i had to put this in a genre, i would say it was a thriller. Anyone who enjoys thrillers or just likes to sit down and read for hours will really like this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read this story twice over the past month and find myself still troubled about the prospect of living in a twisted society that would condone The Long Walk. The story effectively made me feel the emotional and physical anguish of what it would be like to compete in such a walk. As far as the ending is concerned, I at first felt as if I was slapped in the face after page after page of building up to the ending. After careful thought, though, I understood the authors intent and I thinnkI would also, like Garrarty, keep on walkng..........."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"&quot;The Long Walk&quot; is very emotional and thought provoking. After reading it (it only took 2 days), my legs were sore. The characters are great, the plot may seem uninteresting but I couldn't put the book down. Some people disliked the ending, not me. It's classic Bachman. If you read the other Bachman books, particularly &quot;the Running Man&quot; (which is very similar to the walk) you won't dislike the ending. If the ending were different the book would suck. It had to end the way it did."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book was the first Stephen King I ever read and it was and is my favorite! I love the plot. I love the ending... even though most people don't. You just have to understand the ending to like it. And the characters are the greatest! My personal favorite is Peter McVries the scarred smart-aleck. I really recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I took this book out from the library and finished it yesterday. Now the book may sound boring 100 kids walking until 99 dies but it's not about the walk it's about life. And as you read it think about if there was a Long Walk would you do it?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Hey, this is a good book. I read it before I went on a 100 mile walk of my own, and hey, some of Garriety's ideas work! Not just that, the way it defines his thoughts, his slow departure into maddness, and his completley belivable feelings toward the walk and his friends with him. I know i felt in alot of ways just like he felt, but luckly i was not walking with a gun pointed to me head. Not kings best, but far from his worst, this book is good if you want something diffrent to read. oH YEAH, my take on the famous &quot;ending&quot;, Get with it! Sure its complicated, but i read the second half of the book again, and I finally got it. Use a little brainpower. I wanted a better ending at first too, but then i realized that it's not about the crowd, the spectators, or the major, or the soliders pulling the strings. Not about Garrity's mom or girlfriend, or even the walkers theselves. Its about a very,very Long walk. Garriety walks from nearly the first page to the last. There was simply no other way to end it, with out selling out the entire story, and its meaning."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read all of King's published fiction, and this is one of his best - top 5 I'd say. A great premise that pulls you in slowly but surely until it's too late, you're hooked - trying to figure out what you'd do and why some characters lose it. With Gerald's Game, his only works that will never have a video version. period (Although I'd love to see Michelle Pfieffer play Jessie - or Michelle Williams for that matter, who cares she's not 39)"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read the long walk about a year ago, and while it amazed me to the extent that it was refreshing and unique, I was still unsure about it. I recently read it for a second time about a week ago and realized how much I enjoyed the adventure that plays out for the main character (Ray Garraty). Truely excellent. I laughed, I cried, and by the end I was emotionally spent. Great Read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Having read Stephen King since junior high in the late 70s (gosh I feel old), I wasn't surprised at the unique plot (100 boys set out on a walking contest and only one will finish alive) or the writing style (matter of fact, direct, a love for Maine and Americana) or the characters (some normal, some crazy, some perhaps from another world), but I was surprised at the ending. Obtuse comes to mind. I suppose after a few re-readings it will become clearer. In some part of my mind, I was afraid it would end this way, and after reading the last word, I felt kinda sick to my stomach. But that's King for you. Sometimes he ends logically and sometimes he gives you something to really think about -- things you were hoping he wouldn't address -- things that you'd rather NOT think about."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is creepy version of the future. To think that anyone would volunteer to walk for days without rest at four miles per hour is almost unbelievable. But Stephen King makes it believable. I probably would have enjoyed the book more if I had been born when the book was written and I had a vague idea of what the walkers were talking about. I don't know of any teenagers that talk like that.Every King fan should check this out. In my opinion, it doesn't compare to some of his better works, but is still worth a read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book blew me away the 1st time i picked it up The story starts somewhere in the future where every year 100 teenage boys are picked to walk (not run) a marathon and if you go below 4 miles more then 4 times you get shot now this might seem a bit lame but not at all what i believe, makes this novel so great is the characters they all have different and unique personalities and they all have stories that they tell to there new found friends which are interesting and actually make you think. Halfway through this novel you will have your favorite walker. If you are a person who enjoys a novel with a creepy setting and an emotinal characters you will love this."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book was absolutely amazing. I was drawn in from the second I started reading it. My friend suggested it and the idea sounded quite weird. So I entered this book with an open mind and absolutely loved it. It is one of my favorite reads along with Road to Perdition.Who would have thought a book could be written about a walk? Well King did it under the pseudonym \\"Bachman.\\" I am absolutely amazed with this novel and will definitely have to check out some other novels under \\"Bachman.\\"Bottom Line--- Any doubt, Check it out!!!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Of all the Stephen King books I have read, The Long Walk sticks out in my mind as the most intense and gripping of all his tales!The story is about #47, Ray Garraty, the only participant from Maine in an intense marathon known as The Long Walk. 100 young men are chosen to compete against each other for a chance at $1 Billion and anything in the world! During the race, Ray meets several other contestants including the mysterious Stebbins who becomes a major part of the story.With real characters and great storytelling, The Long Walk is great piece worthy of all your attention! Hail to the King!!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, Stephen King released a collection of novellas some twenty years ago. The Long Walk, which did not receive the attention of The Running Man, translated onto the big screen, and Rage, which seems to have all but disappeared due to the tragic high-school shooting incidents of recent years, is one of them.The Long Walk consists of a group of 100 applicants, chosen each year at random from all of the submissions, to participate in a 'Long Walk'. The prize? Everything and anything you want for the rest of your life. The defeat? 'Buying your ticket' out of the walk means ending your life....as you are shot by accompanying soldiers, always mindful of your pace, as you cannot fall under four miles per hour, and always watchful for 'runners' who try to escape the walk as they wear out. The walkers are not allowed to stop, for anything, or they are issued warnings. After three strikes, you are out, permanently. King delves into the minds of several of the walkers, the largest treatise being given to Ray Garrity, the book's central character. Friendships are formed, enemies are made, and battle lines are drawn as each of the boys on the walk eyes the prize waiting at an undetermined distance ahead of them. The only way to win the prize, is to outwalk, and therefore outlive, everyone else.As in most King novels, the descriptions of sights and people in the State of Maine is entertaining, especially to a native, and his exploration of the human mind is continually captivating. One of the things I have most enjoyed about King's works is his honesty of thought with characters in jeopardy or pain. Although at times his words are bitter and hateful, somehow King always manages to deliver what 'real' people think in times of crisis. The boys actually wishing each other dead, though horrible to think about, reads as utter realism from anyone competing with others for their life. How many times have you, the average person, competed against another person, and found yourself entertaining thoughts that you would never dare to put a voice to? King goes that far, and as always, his brutal words paint his characters all the more realistic.Although I don't rate this as the best King book I have ever read, it ranks with my favorites, Bag of Bones, Misery, and Rose Madder. Stephen King seems to write best, and most convincingly, when he walks away from horror, the genre that has made him the best selling author of his time. His best 'demons' are the ones that lay within us all, in our own minds. Without the advent of major plot twists and turns, and a limited 'landscape' for the book, as the boys are continually on the road, and there is no shift to exotic locations, or dream states, or other worlds, this book does manage to hold attention to the last."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read a lot of Stephen King before reading &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, and I can't say that this is his best work...because it's not. However, this is far from his worst...in fact, I don't think he's ever written anything bad. But some of his books are better than others.&quot;The Long Walk&quot; takes place in Maine as usual. (If you're a King fan, this shouldn't be surprising.) One hundred walkers are chosen at random to particapate in the Long Walk...one of them is Ray Garraty, a sixteen year old from Maine, and is nicknamed 'Maine's Own'. He must outwalk all other ninety nine walkers to win the Prize: anything he wants. However, there are a few catches. If you slow down, you get a warning. If you stop, you get a warning. If you sit down, you get a warning. See a pattern forming? You should. If you collect three warnings, the next results in death...you're shot, plain and simple.Throughout the walk, Garraty meets many friends, which makes the walk harder considering they're all going to die in the end...except for one, but the odds that one of the &quot;Musketeers&quot; are very slim.I enjoyed this book more than others that I have read. It moves slower than &quot;The Running Man&quot;, but faster than most others. There isn't a lot of action, however, and the book mainly focuses on the fear and the pain the walkers go through. I recommend this book if you're a dedicated King reader, but not if you're just starting off. If you have yet to open one of his novels, you might want to start with &quot;The Running Man&quot; or &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot;, but these are just suggestions. Well, anyway, enjoy this one...it's quick and fun to read, not some of the massive dictionary-like novels that take months to read!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I started this book early one night and just kept reading. The chapter ends are so Strategically placed that you cant stop. Each character is described in depth, so you feel bad when each one dies. Each area of the race has a new problem,(my favorite was the 21 tounge salute). The objective in this was great. It reminds me of school. If you fall below a 65 3 times, they are just a warning. But if you fall below a 65 a fourth time, it's over. If you outlast everyone else you are set for life, but don't be the first to buy your ticket..."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is not what you expect. The story, on the surface, is about a race where death is the ultimate motivation. However, there is more too this story than that. The story is a metaphor for life. It will make you question why you go on living each day. A great story."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I liked this story a lot. Although I have never walked for days without stopping, trying to be the last one alive, I have walked in some awful road marches in my military service, so I identified with much of the described fatigue and thoughts of the Long Walk participants.I do wish though, that there had been more written about what happened to Garraty after the event concluded, but an ending like the one written is a fair speculation ending.But all in all, this was a good read, with good character development, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for an entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book has been sitting on my shelf for years. I finally picked it up and then couldn't put it down. It was dark and haunting, reminded me of how I felt when I read \\"The Road\\". Truly, one of Stephen King's finest."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I like King's writing but not horror, which makes it hard to read him. I've read several of his books but not even close to his full body of work. However, after reading The Long Walk, I have some thoughts about him in general.Writing stamina. The guy's got the stamina of a long-distance runner, and I don't mean just marathoners, more like those people that run 100 miles all at once. He claimed to have written The Running Man in 72 hours. Freaking amazing. The ability to put 100,000 words into some coherent form doesn't qualify you as a good writer, but there must be some sort of prize for that. King operates like a story is running through his head and he's just transcribing it. Just wonderful.Characters. His characters is why I like him. They're often quirky, spontaneous and irreverent. The Long Walk demonstrates this with so many players in the plot, there's always someone to love and someone to hate (Green Mile, anyone?).Blank page. Some writers work off an outline, others just start writing and let the story unfold without preconception and always a blank page ahead of them. Personally, I can't function without an outline. Maybe the blank page approach is what keeps his work spontaneous, but at times it drones on. In The Long Walk, I certainly had the sense I'd been walking forever, but sometimes not in a good way. At times, the story waffles and I had the feeling the story still had gaps (I'm still not sure what it meant to be squaded).Scenes and endings. King is a master of scene-building. I can still recall scenes in his books that I read years ago. Sometimes they make me laugh, sometimes cringe. Sometimes both at the same time. However, I haven't always been enamored with his endings and I'm a ending person. I can deal with a mediocre ride that has a stunning ending more so than the opposite. It's like sex. The beginning and middle are fun, but it's all about the ending. In The Long Walk, I was left with one thought at the end: Seriously?Adverbs. I know this is one of his earlier writings so it's not a reflection of his current work, but it shows you how writers evolve. The Long Walk is fully polluted with adverbs. I'm sure he'd cringe if he read it today. Maybe laugh, too."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE USUAL STEPHEN KING BOOK. I FELT VERY DRAWN IN TO THE WHOLE STORY. STEPHEN KING'S TAKE ON THE WHOLE MIND SET OF THE WALKERS WAS INTENSE. I COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND FINISHED IT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. WELL WORTH THE READ"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The book was a great read. It was almost addictive to want to keep reading to find out what happens during the walk. My feet hurt just reading about it. There was a twist in the middle and the end just happened so suddenly that I wasn't sure it was the end. i was looking for the next chapter."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This has got to be one of my favorite books by Mr King because it has a sort of believability that makes it that much more terrorfying. Most of his novels have a super natural force as the antagonist, but in the long walk the only enemy is the human mind."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Apparently set in a alternate history United States, and originally published in 1979 under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, The Long Walk follows a group of 100 teenage boys as they participate in, you guessed it, The Long Walk.The Long Walk works something like this: On the morning of May 1st of each year, 100 boys, chosen by lottery from all eligible applicants, gather on the Maine/Canada border, and at 9am start walking down the road. They need to maintain a speed of four miles per hour, and if they fall below that limit for a total of 30 seconds, they get a warning. After their third warning, 30 more seconds under the limit and they get \\"ticketed\\".There are no breaks of any sort, and they're not allowed to interfere with each other, or leave the road. The last boy to avoid being ticketed is declared the winner, and receives The Prize, anything he wants for the rest of his life.You might wonder how interesting it could be to read about guys walking down a road for 384 pages, but if you're a fan of King's style, you'll like this one. The interaction between the walkers is great, and even though the world the Walk takes place in is only explained in conversational tidbits, enough is revealed to rank it fairly high on the list of twisted dystopias.In any case, it's short, easily available, and a pretty fast read, so if you're in the mood for something other than the usual action-packed spectacle, I heartily recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"this is hands down my favorite book by the king, next to the stand of course. amazing."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I love to read any book by Stephen King, and this book was no exception. The book arrived quickly and as promised."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was the first Stephen King that I read. I didn't really know what to expect but the premise sounded interesting so I gave it a shot. I found that I was very attached to the characters and when bad things starting happening, I was surprised how much I was affected. Very good book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read many Stephen King books and he is one of my favorite authors. The Long Walk kept my attention from beginning to end of this survival saga. It was especially scary because the characters were youths going through what they thought was a rite of passage. Little did they know.... This is a book that I still remember after having read it many years ago."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read many Stephen King books and this one is written in the style I really admire. If you enjoy his books, get this and kick back for a while."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I thought this was a great book! I read long into the night, needed to find out who would \\"make it\\". Although simple, you begin to 'see' the characters. One of his good ones and I've read them all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This one didn't give me nightmares like Needful Things, It, and The Stand, but it is gripping in a non-horror way. I particularly liked the way King made the extreme premise of the book seem more and more plausible as the book goes on."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is really an awesome book by king. It my favorite so far out of 5 other books that I've read by king. To make this book short this book is about a 100 boys, about 16 yrs of age who made the decision to be contestants in the Long Walk. Each boy has a chance to receive three warnings after which they are shot down...DEAD. The last one standing will be the winner, who will receive a prize of their choice.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"For all those English Majors out there who think they're too good for so-deemed \\"pop fiction\\" like the works of Stephen King... You will likely be surprised at the high brow / philosophical / true-to-life questions King asks us to consider."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was my first Stephen King book I've read, the whole idea of the plot itself is scary enough, to think if this was a actual situation you wonder how it would play outMy favorite part of this story is you actually care about the characters, I've read countless books where you get to the point you really don't... I could not stop reading this book and its very interesting seeing the relationships built with people they are competing agaisntThe very end left a bit something to be desired, I'm not sure what I was hoping for but overall was very pleased with the book, high recommend it to others"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"A bunch of guys start walking. If they stop walking, they are killed. If they wander from the path, they are killed. In the end, there can only be one winner. And what does winning do to the soul of that lone survivor?That's it. It is the simplest premise, yet Stephen King explored every possible psychological angle to the story, peopled it with a huge variety of competitors and beautifully imagined the pain of the walk, the stress and especially the fragile bonds that grow between competitors...bonds that WILL and MUST be broken by death.It's a brief book, and could easily be read in a long afternoon. It is also impossible to put down. It's very old now, and some references and mentions of technology show those seams...but it is gripping. Occasionally funny...often bleak. It shows Stephen King's skills at dialogue at their best, and also his ability riff on mundane details until they are infused with meaning.This book cries out to be a movie...but I'd sure hate to see it done poorly. Over the years, I have read this several times. It just cries out to be dusted off and re-enjoyed.King has written what I consider a number of masterpieces (and these \\"materpieces\\" vary from reader to reader. THE STAND, THE SHINING, DESPARATION and to some extent, THE DARK TOWER are my gold standards). But this modest book, which doesn't even bear King's name, always sneaks in there for me. An unexpected jewel.DON'T OVERLOOK IT!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Wow, this book kept me turning pages quicker than thought imaginable. I generally read anything, but majority is either classics, fantasy, or science fiction. But my guitar instructor suggested I read this book, so last week I ordered it, and read it within three days. Generally I don't breeze through a book like that. The story unfolds, and it keeps you questioning left and right about whats going to happen next, why are they in this walk, who is going to buy the next ticket. I suggest anyone who is even mildly interested to read it. As you read the book, you start to feel like you are one of the fellow walkers, experiencing the agony, and befriending everyone. By the final chapters, you've personally become friends with everyone, wishing they don't buy the ticket. The only thing I didn't like was the swift ending, but other than that it was an amazing novel."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"i would have to say this is maybe Stephen King's best normal novel(meaning don't include The Stand or the Dark Tower). in my opinion, this is the scariest of all of his books, hands down. it delves deep into the human psyche and really makes you care about a few of the characters, and when they leave the story, it's a sad day indeed. anyway, it's short, so if you're one of the rare few that don't get into it, you won't be in for too much suffering. i recommend it to anyone that's ever read a book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"If you ask me, The Long Walk may well be the most fascinating novel Stephen King has ever written. Written back in 1966-67, while King was a college freshman, the novel earned the author nothing more than a form rejection letter. Finally, after a few years of dust-gathering, the manuscript was released into a much more welcoming world in the form of Richard Bachman's second novel. It's a magnificent story - not perfect, but magnificent nonetheless. It's a disarmingly simple tale centered on a seemingly mundane activity, yet in King's masterful hands The Long Walk burrows into the core of a number of characters, lays down miles of metaphors about the human condition, and absolutely mesmerizes you with its emotional force and power.The setting is an alternate, possible fascist America; King leaves things pretty murky on the sociopolitical end of things, almost surely by design. The Long Walk is really one of your \\"it can't happen in America\\" kind of stories, and the horror of it all (and, yes, I would categorize this as a horror novel) is made more powerful by obscuring the lines between our America and this fictionalized America. Here, The Long Walk is the premier sporting event in the land. Spectators turn out in droves, bets are made left and right, and the whole nation watches and cheers. Obviously, this is not a regular walk, nor is it a race in the purist sense. Endurance - mental even more than physical - is the key to victory in this sport. To win, all you have to do is outlast 99 other competitors - and the winner receives nothing less than whatever he wants for the rest of his life. Before you yell \\"Sign me up,\\" you'll want to hear about the details. You have to maintain a pace of at least four miles per hour; fall below the pace, and you get a warning. You are allowed three warnings (and you can \\"lose\\" a warning by walking another hour on the pace), and then you get ticketed. Getting ticketed doesn't get you a place to rest or even a little much-needed nourishment; all it gets you is one or more bullets in the head.The obvious question is: why would anyone volunteer for this, knowing that he was almost surely going to die? That's a large part of what this whole novel is about. The contestants do a lot of talking while they're walking; most of them dance around the \\"why\\" issue, but we see clues to some of the reasons as each lad draws closer and closer to death. For some, reality doesn't really set in until the guns started blazing. Cockiness turns to anger, fear, shock, and just about every other kind of dark emotion you can imagine. The boys are stripped bare in both body and mind as the Walk goes on and on, through all kinds of weather. Through his characters, King is basically asking the reader how he/she will face death when it comes. Will you freeze up early on? How long will you fight to stay alive after you've pushed your body far beyond the breaking point? Will you lie down and accept your fate, or will you lose control and lash out at your perceived enemies?The most weighty questions actually involve the crowd. As the Walk progresses, more and more people come out to cheer the Watchers on, secretly hoping to see someone get ticketed before there very eyes. This goes far beyond craning your neck to see everything you can at an accident scene. For the Walkers, the crowd eventually becomes Crowd, an amorphous creature always right there roaring and grabbing at them, living (and dying) vicariously through them. Obviously, one thing the Long Walk represents is life itself. The Walkers literally age before our eyes as exhausting hours turn into ever darker, more painful days. Death's approach changes every one of them. Fate has its way with each one's odds of winning, allowing for no favorites among them, as even those with the most going for them sometimes find themselves felled by injuries and sickness. During the journey, the Walkers arrange themselves into little groups, develop enemies, and help - or don't help - one another keep going. Is life a competition or a journey? Different things motivate them to keep going - family, a girl back home, or - for some - just the satisfaction of outlasting another Walker they don't like (oddly enough, the Prize never really seems to mean much to any of them).I could just go on and on with the symbolism of this story. I haven't even described the characters, and I think it is better if I don't - except to say that the story is told from the perspective of \\"Maine's own\\" Walker, Ray Garraty. I could read this novel over and over again without ever growing tired of it. It's just endlessly fascinating and illuminating. Even as a very young writer, King had a lot to say, he understood people, and - most of all - he knew how to tell a story better than just about everyone else who has ever lived."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is the second book I have read that was written by King under the name Richard Bachman. It is the in-depth story of how a boy named Ray Garraty must survive the greatest challenge of his life -- the Long Walk. This annual event is summarized as follows: 100 boys start walking; if you walk under 4 miles per hour, you get a warning; after 3 warnings, if you slow down again, you are shot dead. The winner of the Long Walk is the last boy left walking.Stephen King (a.k.a. Richard Bachman) introduces and develops the characters of many of the boys in the event. As a reader, you get to learn about Garraty, Pete McVries, Hank Olson, Art Baker, Barkovitch, Stebbins, and others, who each have their own personality quirks and ways of looking at life. Each boy has entered the Long Walk for a different reason and I found their discussions about life and death to be quite interesting (a social statement by King, perhaps?). The reader is led along the course and each significant event is mentioned along the way, with some unexpected occurrences that may surprise you.As the challenge narrows down from the original 100 competitors to less than 50, then to just a handful of boys remaining, the scenario becomes rather intense. Who will die next? How will he die? And most importantly, who will be left at the end to claim the Prize? Although the suspense builds slowly, it tends to add to the dramatic effect of the final moments and keep the reader wanting to read more to find out what happens (I was so eager to find out that I read the last half of the book in one sitting).Although the story is interesting and held my attention, there are a couple of criticisms that knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars. First, the ending was too predictable. I had a feeling from the start of what would happen and being verified at the end tended to downplay the whole story. Second, some of the characters were killed off rather abruptly without much detail or explanation. I guess it just depends on what you are expecting and how you interpret the story.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed reading the Long Walk. It tests the limits of human endurance in a unique way and makes the reader think about life and death in a new light (or at least I did). Unlike many of King's other novels, the Long Walk is more of dramatic suspense story rather than a horror story, which is what I have noticed about his writing as Richard Bachman. It is a good read, however, and I recommend it to anyone, whether you are a fan of Stephen King or not."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk has got to be one of Stephen King's greatest short story accomplishments, up there with the highlights of the Skeleton Crew.The story is about an endurathon contest, where 100 boys just start walking, and if any competitor falls under 4 miles an hour, he is issued a warning. However, if a competitor slows down to under 4 miles after receiving 3 warnings...he is shot dead.King introduces many unique characters to us, and we begin to almost feel their personalities, and the annoying little habits that they have. King does a masterful job of removing some of the characters from the story with not much detail, really placing an emphasis on the mental drain that is occuring with the competitors in The Long Walk, they are so tired they dont even notice how or when some of their friends are being killed.The final surge towards the end of the walk is written quite ingeniously, and is even quite surprising.Overall, I would highly recommend this short story. ALthough the book may be about an endurathon, it is certainly not an endurathon of a read, the pages will just fly by."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I first read \\"The Long Walk\\" about three years ago, and found that it stayed with me for nearly every step I've taken since then. Any walk of a mile or longer invariably brought up memories of the deadly Long Walk taken by a hundred fictional teenagers in the alternate-history Earth of this early King classic.As other reviewers have noted, just to read this book is to feel physically tired. The characters start walking, at a grueling pace of four miles per hour, early in the first chapter, and never stop. There are only two ways out of the contest: death or victory... and, out of the 100 contestants, there can only be one winner. \\"The Long Walk\\" takes place over five days in May, and by the final day, the Prize may no longer seem worth winning.As painful as your legs will feel by the final chapter, you'll be equally intrigued by the little alternate-history hints King drops throughout the book. With references to John Travolta and the handover of the Panama Canal, \\"Long Walk\\" is still very much a product of the 1970s. But when the characters mention \\"April 31st\\", or New Hampshire's provisional governor, or the German bombing raids over the East Coast in World War II, you'll find yourself wondering just how the world of the \\"Long Walk\\" came to be. Most intriguing is a fictional quote from the \\"second Clay-Liston\\" fight, which ends even worse for Sonny Liston than did the actual Ali-Liston fight in our own 1965.The only thing that disrupts \\"The Long Walk\\" is the ambiguous final page. King points out in the introduction to this edition that his Bachman persona did not specialize in happy endings, and of course we know that King writes insanity quite convincingly. I've beem vaguely dissatisfied with the ending after both my readings -- but, taken by itself, the final line is still a creepy finale to a very creepy book..."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is the only book I've read that actually left me physically tired after reading it. To describe this book as scary would be misleading (and an understatement). Horrifyingly intense is the only way to sum it up. There is nothing creepy or supernatural about this story. It is like nothing that has ever been written.What makes this story so intense is the feeling that it could really happen in the near future. Stephen King is a genius when it comes to pulling you right into his nightmares. The story starts out very subtly and then you quickly learn what the contest \\"The Long Walk\\" is all about (and it aint no benefit marathon). What is truly amazing about this story is that it was written twenty years before the explosion of reality T.V. The story seems even more plausible when read today.I have never been more engrossed in a story than this one. I really started to feel the fatigue and constant dread that these boys must have felt.This book is for anyone who loves to enter a different world and be terrified. Whatever kind of sick person would like that is beyond me, but you know who you are. Read this book you will love it. Oh, by the way, keep in mind that a happy ending is never guaranteed in King's early novels."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is a great book. It was recommended to me by a customer who told me of all of King's books, this one stayed with him the most. I only finished it yesterday but I can see that he's probably right. I can't really be within a group of people without somehow thinking we're all like the boys in the Long Walk, trying to outdo everyone else as if our life depends on it. Yet, we're trapped with one another, and the only thing that buffers us from insanity is other people (Sartre said hell is other people, but is lonliness really all that much better?)Well, not to get too philosophical or anything. It was a good, fast read. I was surprised most by the actual distance traveled in the Long Mile. I found myself wondering how they could still be on their feet, let alone walking at least 4 mph after hundreds of miles. And I was intrigued how desensitized the boys became to death, and how accepting they became of their own inevitable impending deaths. I can almost say some of them reached peace near the end. Perhaps that was the most disturbing part.The ending was vague, as many have said. But I think King made his point. The winner wasn't really a winner after all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Of all of the Stephen King books I've read under his pseudonym, Richard Bachman, this one is tops (or perhaps &quot;Rage&quot;).I picked this up for a second read after all of the reality tv shows popped up, and I still think it's scary how close we're actually getting to this scenario.For those of you unfamiliar with the plot line, one hundred young men are selected for what is called &quot;The Long Walk,&quot; and are watched like heros as they walk and walk. No sleeping, no slowing down to go to the bathroom, nothing. Losers are shot, but the winner gets ANYTHING he wants. Care to gamble your life with 100-1 odds based on your sheer will and ability to walk hundreds of miles?King's (er... Bachman's) pace is excellent, each character's story is interesting, but the greatest of all comes with imagining the rules and regulations and possibilities of this game. One of the networks actually picked up what sounds suspiciously like a VERY toned-down version of the game in the book. It has to do with walking or some other sort of endurance for a prize. Is it art imitating life or just plain creepy? Read this book and try and find a screening of an indie movie called &quot;Series 7&quot; (contestants each get a gun; the winner goes on to Series 8). They pack a serious 1-2 punch to the disturbing nature of reality shows."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I occasionally describe a movie as \\"Like watching a trainwreck.\\" You don't want to watch, but you can't quit. That's the way _The Long Walk_ works. It is excruciating. As usual Stephen King's dialog for boys is right on -- they are all teenagers, of varying sophistication -- all (but one) doomed to die -- and yet they walk on. We never know how the long walk got started, why it is tolerated, how there could be a civilization that would take 100 young men, carefully selected, and run them down into the ground, shooting each one mercilessly as they fail. Obviously, King was considering the Ultimate Game Show; miss a question and you die. The only real fascination in this book is wondering how he will kill off the odds-on favorites. They get colds, they go crazy, etc. etc. ad nauseum. I really wanted to put the book away (and did, to read some other book) but ultimately I had to finish it, just like I'd have to watch that train wreck until the last car stops.So. You've been warned."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I just bought a used copy of The Bachman Books and The Long Walk was one I just had to read (tried Rage first but wasn't as impressed with that as this one). This was the main story that attracted me to the book. Also, the Rage novel was a buying point being that it is no longer in print due to the school shootings in the past decade or so. The Running Man (I preferred the movie to this) and Roadwork are also good, but The Long Walk is the best of the bunch, for me.The Long Walk is more than the typical Stephen King (or Richard Bachman) book. Much like King's other novels about male youth (The Body, Dreamcatcher, Hearts In Atlantis, IT etc) you find yourself relating to the characters. While a story about walking can be repeatative and boring, King outdoes himself here by focusing on the characters involved. He pulls you into the story slowly until you feel like you are one of the 100 walking.I found myself so involved in this novel that I felt as if I were walking right along with these characters. Despite rooting against each other at first, there is a bond that takes place so that near the end it became sadder each time a boy was killed. The prize being \\"everything you want\\" is a bit vague, but it's also a double-edged sword. The one thing that can't be given as a prize is all the friends lost on \\"The Long Walk\\". They are gone for good. The toll that the walking takes is also another double-edged sword because the survivor is so worn down that he is a shell of his former self.It's amazing how King took an everyday thing for most of us (just simply walking) and turned it into a horrific event. Seeing others around you killed and knowing it could be you if you get more than three warnings, could play games with your mind. No stopping to rest, to eat, to go to the bathroom. No stopping for sleep or charley-horses or a pebble in your shoes. Seeing the crowds eating, sitting and relaxing also would play with your mind. I'm sure most people have walked so far that you felt you couldn't continue. It's easy to relate to for most of us. That's where King is at his best, when he reaches into your soul and gives you something that you can relate to.This book is simply a great read. It makes you stop and think about human nature. Why we do some of the things we do and sometimes not think ahead at how hard it could be. The walkers themselves are celebrities in this world created by King. Much like reality shows today have made celebrities (Survivor, Dancing With Stars, American Idol). It is amazing King saw ahead all those years ago when he wrote this novel, that reality shows would take everyday people and put them in contests like this.This is one of King's (or Bachman's) best novels. Very hard to put down. Despite knowing that 99 of the 100 will be killed King manages to make you give a damn about all the contestants. There is a sadness each time someone is killed. I have to give this novel a 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The &quot;Long Walk&quot; is one of the earliest books written by Stephen King under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, and it's not a horror story per se. King wrote this during his freshman year in college during the Fall of 1966 and Spring of 1967. This is a great book. And, one can tell at this early time of writing King had a knack for description, in addition to creative ideas and story-telling. When King submitted it in a writing competition it was rejected without any comments. So, he through it into an old box.In the &quot;Long Walk&quot; the backgrounds, motivations, beliefs, and social attitudes come out in the characters as they walk together. Ray Garraty (the main), McVries, Olson, Baker, Stebbins, and Barkovitch. Each has a distinct personality. The latter, Barkovitch, is the vituperative, harping, anti-social antagonist.What piques the reader and human nature, is that these guys chose to participate in this competition. They were among 100 selected across America. The very few to be accepted for the Long Walk. The prize for the single winner is everything you want for the rest of your life. For the rest of the 99 they get to rest, eternally.Like in almost all good stories, the conversations among these fellas can lead one to think about his/herself.To find out who wins, read this great piece of work by a young Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King has a long and wonderful career. His books are amazing, but for some reason, this book is my runaway favorite. That is for many reasons. Mostly because I can relate to it. After 18 years in the Marine Corps I know exactly what it is like to push the body and mind to it's absolute limits and with sleep deprivation. Though I was never threatend with a bullet to the head for falling out of a forced march, I never allowed myself to drop. Self-discipline is the key to success in situations such as these.This story is over 30 years old and I cannot imagine why it has never been made into a movie. Instead of Pet Semetary 2, or even worse 6 Children of the Corn sequals, why didn;t someone realize that not only could this be a very powerful and dramatic movie, but it could be done with a minimum cost? All you need are 100 teenagers, some dude to dress up like a major, and and soldiers riding on military vehicles. The only special effects needed would be intense death scenes, and heavy makeup for the third, fourth, and fifth day.Anyone reading this book will probably ask themselves if they would have the guts to do this. I also think people who read this book are naturally curious as to how far they could go. I do not think I would win, but I believe I could have made it to New Hampshire.Though I have read this book no less than 5 times, I still find myself unable to put it down once I start. It is a powerful book from page one and you keep turning the pages totally absorbing yourself into the situation.Some would say the ending is a disappointment and ends too quickly, but consider this, how would YOU end it? Walking for 5 days without sleep and watching 99 Walkers die, plus a soldier, what state would your mind be in? I wonder if after the Walk was over if Gary could even recognize Jan or his mother. Maybe this book did indeed need an epilogue, but maybe our own imaginations and suggestions of 'the day after the Walk' are more terrible than what even Stephen King could give us. It is the not knowing that gives this book an extra bit of horror. And yes I do consider this book a suspense/horror book.This is only one of four or five books that I have read repeatedly."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is undoubtedly one of the best, and THE darkest novel I've read. I won't go on about the plot, the other reviewers do an excellent job of that. I have a warning of my own. This is not for the timid heart. There's not an excessive amount of gore, and it isn't really SCARY, but very disturbing. To think that 100 young, teenage boys would participate in a game like this isn't the disturbing part. It's when they have begun to tire and ask the \\"why\\" questions. The systematic breakdown of each boy, physically and mentally, makes your stomach feel quesy. One boy in particular, Olsen, had the most profound story to me. He enters the game with, apparently, all the confidence in the world, and as the Walk goes on, he becomes reduced to a walking corpse. He literally ages as the Walk goes on, and dies with a fraction of his mind left. The transition Olsen makes is heartbreaking. He, as well as the other 99 boys that are in the Walk, find out the horror they've walked into (no pun intended) too late, when death is the only forfeit adn relief. The heartlessness of the soldiers and the indifference of the Crowd make this book the darkest book I've ever read. 100 boys start, and 99 must die for there to be a winner. When broken of body and soul, no prize in the world can bring you back. Very intriging book, very original. I've never read anything like it, and I plan to buy all the Bachman books. The metaphorical analogies to life are all over this book, which makes it such a wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I find it ironic that perhaps Stephen King's greatest story is written under his pseudonym and also one of the books few people have heard about. It's arguably my favorite novel - ever - and also holds the distinction of the book I have read the most (and the only story that has made me physically ill).The Long Walk is a superb sci-fi story that pits 100 teen boys against each other in a seemingly never-ending marathon death sport. How exciting can the act of walking be? VERY! King masterfully unfolds a story with three-dimensional characters and an intricate duality about the nature of death between the contestants and the audience who cheers every step on their march.Fans of the genre may also like to read the Japanese cult novel BATTLE ROYALE which takes a distinctly different (and more extreme) take on child death sports. For anyone reading this novel for the first time, I'm envious...enjoy the walk."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King's horror books usually involve gore and violence, which make them more gross than horrific. This book is a shining exception, and probably his greatest work. The book's central theme is an odd fascination with death, and how King exploits this through the participants and spectators alike: the desire to join the race even if only 1% survive, fascination in watching the event, disgust at watching the event but then watching it anyway, a girl kissing one of the boys because it's like kissing death, etc etc. It is an absolutely brilliant book which shows just how far King has sunk in the past few years (From A Buick 8 is such a sad pathetic departure from King's original brilliance shown in this book). Never mind the ending, it's the process and the unfolding of this book that matters most. Ignore the \\"hate the ending\\" posts!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read this short novel over 14 years ago while in high school. It's still one of my all time favorites and in a way, it still haunts me. I remember the characters vividly: Garraty, McVries, Baker, Olson, Barkavitch, etc. All unique and likeable in their own ways. How many stories can you say that about, where you clearly remember characters 15 years later? The plot been told here in other reviews, but it's simply the ultimate test of mind over body, with exceptional dialogue between the characters, as they try to figure out why they are doing this and what's led them here. I'm sure our soldiers in the Middle East have similar thoughts. You really get involved and feel like you know these guys. It's also an extremely prescient tale. Just look at the limits today's reality shows take contestants to: we are really heading towards a day where someone will die on something like Fear Factor or Road Rules Challenge and no one will bat an eye. On Road Rules Fresh Meat yesterday they were swimming with sharks! But this novel is so much better than anything you'll ever see on t.v., trust me. I wish the ending were a little stronger, and would love to here King talk about it sometime. You will not regret reading this."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"i started reading this book about 2 weeks ago at my local barnes and noble only reading 40-50 pages each time. Yesterday i decided to buy it and i have spent the past 5 hours finishing it. I will not give a summary of the novel, as that has been done several times by other reviewers. I will only say that this novel kept me hooked and i found myself speeding up more and more and more until i got to the end. While reading this book, i prayed this book would have a good ending. Honestly, i am not sure if i liked the ending or not. I will not tell you what it is, but i will say that it is pretty much open to interpretation. Probobly the most vauge ending ive ever read for a book. It doesnt answer a lot of the questions you have throughout the book. I recommend this to absoutly everyone! While reading, pay very close attention to the mysterious character known as Stebbins. Something is revealed about him in the last chapter that made my jaw drop and i had to go back and re-read it about 12 times before absorbing it. Excellent book, if you like books that will make you think, this is defaintly the book for you."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one of King's earlier novels and in fact was first published under the pen name Richard Bachman. In the version of The Long Walk I read there was also a chapter before the main story where Stephen King tells of the importance of being Bachman. Like many of King's novels written in the first few decades of his career, (this was published 1979) King's ability to get the reader inside the mind of teenagers (in this case Garraty) who we follow the story looking through their eyes in a third person way is second to none. Christine, It and Carrie are other masterpiece novel examples of where he has done this.The Long Walk is the story of one hundred teenage boys who have won the chance to partake in The Long Walk. This event is a last man standing walk where they follow a designated route across the USA and if the participant slows to under four miles an hour they are given a warning. Falling asleep, injuries, sickness, dehydration, warn out shoes or any other excuse are not acceptable. After three warnings you get shot. The winner gets to have anything they desire for the rest of their life. The other competitors get to find out if there's an afterlife.King never says if this is set in the future or a parallel universe, the reader just has to accept that America condones this event, the public would turn up in droves to watch it and competitors would readily sign up for it, knowing they in all likelihood will get shot. The winner was I thought just a little bit predictable and is the only reason I drop this great book one star in rating. Any fan of a great read though has to check out The Long Walk."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"There are horrors here that put to shame the parade of ghosts found elsewhere in King's opus. Here there is not a whiff of the supernatural, and yet in this powerful story lie the most haunting elements in all of King's books 1974 to the present. In an America of the not-too-distant future, a dictatorial figure oversees the new national pastime, \\"the long walk\\". This brutal gladiatorial contest is as the name suggests, a walk, but one with life or death consequences. We are introduced to gathering of young men from all avenues of existence and every corner of America, and these individuals begin a trek south at the Maine border. The only rule is that those competing must continue walking, non-stop, or be summarily executed by the squad of soldiers who follow along behind them. They go on, night, day, sunshine or storm, until only one remains. We meet the contestants, all well-sketched characters from King's early days, when his creative powers shone like a supernova, and we know that all but one of them must in the course of this rock-hard novella die. And one by one, they do. The Long Walk is the sort of book it is easy to underestimate at the start, and the kind of read that sticks with you for a long time. Along the course of its hundred-odd pages, virtually every emotion in the human soul is tapped and called upon. This is the book for those who snobbishly say Maine's most famous citizen has nothing \\"serious\\" to offer. Dare them to read this book, and then sit back and observe their reaction."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It's the Future of reality TV. One Hundered boys start walking down the road. They have to go faster than four miles an hour and cannot slow down below that rate more than three times. If they do they are shot in the head. That's it. That's all there is to this masterpiece. One boy wins the prize, the rest pay the price. This is more of a psychological terror book than anything else. We are in the mind of sixteen year old Ray Garraty as he walks down the road. We learn the why people would walk, and what keeps them going, and what happens when death is less painful than the next step. As I read this book I could not help but wonder how long I could last. As Ray learns it is not about the fittest or the strongest or even who has the best shoes. To be champion of the long walk takes something more. Of all of Bachman's book this is the one that is most in need of being read. It truly is a great journey and one that every reader of terror must go on.Relic113"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am an avid reader of Stephen King. This was the first book that made me wonder about the society these boys live that would allow them to take this walk. I loved the characters, friendships formed, and alliances that were forged and help among the boys to shield another. The only part that tore my heart out was the ending. After all that such heart break. I had to read the ending several times and then to my husband to get the whole meaning. Bravo Mr. King!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago. Since then, whenever I go on a hike I can't help but think of this book. How long would I last, I wonder to myself, if I were a character in The Long Walk? It's that sort of book. It remains in your brain long long after you finish reading it. And the plot keeps you turning the pages until dawn is breaking and your eyes are bleeding and you've finally finished reading it. But from the other reviews here, I guess you already knew that :) The only reason you may not want to get this edition is that it was originally published with three other novellae (I think the compilation was called Four Past Midnight... can't be sure though). It could be that a paperback edition of 4PM would be the same price as this one, and you'd get to read the other three stories too. (Mind you, this story is the best of the four)."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I love Stephen King, sometimes.The man is a prolific writer and sometimes that's his downfall. When you've written a gazillion books, not all of them can be winners and \\"The Long Walk\\" isn't a winner, in my opinion.Don't get me wrong, it's all right, but, that's the problem...it's just all right and not up to the standards I expect of Mr. King. I also readUnder the Dome: A Noveland was greatly dissapointed. As in \\"The Long Walk\\" it has its moments, but if you're expecting aCarrieor aThe Shiningyou're going to be dissapointed.Sometimes Mr King writes just to write and for that I'm sorry."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I first read this book when I was 12. It's been my number one book ever since then (I'm 23 now). I am a huge King reader. This was the first ebook I got for my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am an avid reader of NON-FICTION; that is all I ever read...with the single exception of Stephen King short stories and books.This book was exhausting...literally. I could FEEL the exhaustion the walkers felt as the walk progressed. This would have been a page turner in a regular book but I ordered this through my Kindle so it was a page clicker.When I began reading this story, it sounded like a fun walk. 100 boys sign up for a walk and whoever outlasts the other 99 is the winner. Sounds simple. Then you learn that the rules state the walkers must keep up a pace of at least 4mph. Should they fall below, they get a warning. After three warnings, they \\"buy\\" their ticket. This is explained early in the book. So gullible me is thinking, \\"oh they just lose; they are out of the walk\\". They certainly are. After the third warning, they get a bullet in the head! I nearly fell off my chair when I got to the first person who buys their ticket! Cheeeesh!Some of the less favorable reviewers state that this was not a good book in their opinion because who would allow their child to enter such a contest? Well, it is really unfair to give a poor review based on that. This is a book of FICTION created by one of the worlds most fascinating authors with a mind and imagination that I would LOVE to have! Stephen King is a gifted, and fascinating writer. The only NEGATIVE I can say about him is his penchant for killing dogs and cats in his stories. I've yet to read one book of his that has a dog or cat in it that doesn't meet some horrid fate such as in \\"Pet Semetary\\" and \\"Cujo\\" and all the others. Even in THIS book towards the very end, one of the guards watching the walkers KILLS an INNOCENT DOG! HAD I KNOWN that was in this book, I never would have bought it. I cannot bear to read anything where a dog gets killed...fiction or not. It breaks my heart as a dog lover and dog guardian. I cannot understand why he kills dogs in his stories. That is the only negative I can state in this story; however, I could not rate it less than five stars as the part where the dog gets killed is only a couple of sentences. THAT part of the story could have been omitted entirely and would not have affected this suspenseful \\"edge of your seat\\" thriller.The dogs in Mr. Kings books and stories (that I've read so far) always meet a tragic end. It has gotten so that whenever he publishes a new book, I find out if there is a dog in the story; and if there is, I refuse to read it. Silly, I know, as it is only fiction...but this is something that not only upsets me but every dog loving friend I have, as I've asked. I know Mr. King happens to have both a dog and a cat as pets and loves them...so why does he always seem to bring them to some awful fate in the stories he creates with dogs and/or cats? I would really like to know. In \\"The Long Walk\\", the part of the dog getting killed was just a minor mention, and probably why I didn't catch it before beginning the read. Had that been in the beginning of the story, I never would have finished it; would have deleted it from my Kindle right at that moment.I realize a lot of people will think my opinion regarding this part of the story is silly, but unless you're a TRUE lover of dogs, something like this...even though it is fiction, is very upsetting. I really wish he wouldn't do that in the stories that have dogs and cats in them; but he IS one of the greatest writers I've ever come across, and his books are the ONLY fiction I ever read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is a good one but the ending seems rushed. King does a great job of character build up given the environment."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I really did not like this book at all. I typically enjoy King's books, however, the story is true to the title, The Loooooooooooooong Walk, felt like a longer read. I gave it two stars because I wanted to know what was going to happen and I was disappointed! I read the ending a couple of times and I am not sure how I am supposed to interpret it exactly. It just suddenly stopped. I don't want to spoil the ending, but can somebody help me with this?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"My favorite book ever. This book is amazing and there truely are no words to describe it. I was honestly surprised, i figured there would be a main character and he was the only one you would care about, but halfway through the book i found myself caring for 5 different characters not wanting them to lose and die. So yes, this is an amazing book and you are stupid for not buying it the moment you read this review."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Good read. Really gets you thinking about life and death and all in between. HIghly recommended."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King was an anonymous to me before I read this great book. I've seen his movies before but never actually enduldged into one of his text pieces before. This book to me was a great piece of metaphors and similes. A real graphical Novel. I like how he starts his book off as a mystery. You never really know whats going on until around page 40. I like the mystery. It allows me to endulge fully in the words and pictured put into my head. Rather than spelled out for you by most writers.A group of kids decided they want to walk instead of play like everyone else their own age. A walk that not only endangers their life but, gets lots of attention...not a normal walk. A walk that could and does result in death. A walk that is proven to be a perfect campaign for buisnesses and cheering, but a death march. As the story goes on page by page you begin to feel what the ghost walkers feel. You begin to realize their fear and mistake it as your own. You as the reader are given an easy task, a task that can be completed because of King's writing abilities. That task consist of living the long endorous walk that those are commanded to do. To survive the sureal life that is given to you."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Reading that sticks to your ribs (so-to-speak). This story will stay with you for years. I read 'The Long Walk' as one of the original short stories of the Bachman Books about 10 years ago. I still remember the details to this one story to this day. I have always considered this to be the best of the best of Steven's works. After reading 'On Writing', Mr. King agrees.I lent my original copy to a nephew who never returned it. It took me 5 years to find the same [original] print.I've since lent this book to two people whom I felt needed to read the story for different reasons:* the first being one of those 'I can do anything' types. Loves a physical challenge, even at his age [45]. He needed a little reality check, and agrees he'll never forget this story and the emotions he felt while reading it.* the second I accompanied on \\"A Walk to Remember\\", a 444 mile trek to NYC. Each day he walked 35 to 40 miles; each day he rested and slept. A grueling walk for him, blisters, shin splints, the threat of stress fractures, but never the possibility of not finishing the walk for reasons described in this story. Every day I reminded him that I had a book for him to read - 'The Long Walk'. After reading this book, he agrees this is not one he could have read during his rest periods of the trek.I'm not one to recommend books or stories, but this is a reader's MUST. Just keep telling yourself -It's only a story. -It's only a story."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I loved this book, for some reason the title never jumped out at me as a &#34;must read&#34; but I gave it a shot and I highly reccomend this one. I couldnt put it down!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King is always a masterful storyteller, and it would be unfair to say that I didnt enjoy this story. It drew me in, and kept my interest. However, the ending left me wanting to know more...I know we are supposed to fill in the &#34;blank&#34; ourselves, and its fairly obvious what the outcome is, but it just didnt feel very satisfying to me...wanted a little more from the author. Having said that. I would still recommend it as a good read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Thank you for the quick service and excellent quality.I did wonder about the little hand written post it note on the cover which said the first disc wouldn't load and needs replacing. It loaded fine."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"About a month ago, I picked up my three-fourths unfinished copy of Stephen King's The Bachman Books. I say three-fourths because I had only read the first of four short novels contained in the book, the now out-of-print Rage, several years ago now. Rage is a dark and un-fantastic story that I didn't care for much, and the fact that it is now out of print is a good thing (King has admitted this himself). Despite this rare miss for King, other avid fans consider these four novels to be among his best work. Regarding the other three books in the collection, I would say my opinion falls somewhere in the middle of the road; these are not his very best works, but they are also far from his worst.I'm going to skip over Rage altogether for the aforementioned reason; it simply isn't that good and there isn't a whole lot to say about it. The true King fan ought to read it for sake of inclusion, and there is some classic-King dialogue in it that warrants a nod, but plot-wise it is territory that most folks wouldn't enjoy dwelling upon.The Long Walk, deals with a futuristic game-show of sorts in which all the contestants but the winner end up dead (it shares similarities with the last story in the Bachman collection, The Running Man). This story jumps right in with little backstory; a teen boy has been selected for this deadly annual competition called The Long Walk and his mother is driving him to the starting point. It involves exactly one hundred contestants, all male, all in their teens or young twenties, and the objective is to walk without stopping for as far as you can until you fall over dead. Slow down, stop, or violate the rules in any other way: you get a warning. Three warnings in a row, and you 'buy a ticket,' which means to be shot by one of the supervising soldiers on the sidelines. The prize: lifelong fame and riches for your entire family (starting to sound a little like The Hunger Games, is it not?). The participants volunteer for the game, which is televised, and it is somewhat of an honor to be accepted. The game is sponsored by a shadowy government and headed up by an equally mysterious official called 'The Colonel.'Initially, I was very intrigued by the idea but quickly began to wonder how King could possibly turn this idea into a 200-something page novel; it sounded more like a short story to me. But he does an excellent job of keeping things interesting, both with the initial shock of boys being killed early on in the competition and with lengthy, yet engaging, dialogue between the boys regarding their pasts, their connections to the Long Walk, their plans for spending if they win, and other entertaining (and often crude) teenage-boy banter.As the story unfolds, you find yourself rooting more and more for a handful of the competing boys (or aching for some of the troublesome ones to fall out) and all the while knowing that all but one of them will surely die. There is a claustrophobic, choking element to the story as you move along the road with them, realizing more personally what a sickening experience this would be, with literally no way out once you've begun but to win, or be shot. King uses a wide array of adjectives to convey just how tired these young men are becoming as they walk through one, then two, then three entire days and nights with not a single stop to rest, and maintaining the required speed of at least four miles per hour. Their feet aching is only the beginning; there's going to the bathroom to consider, charley horses in the legs to avoid, cramps from drinking too much water, salvaging the food they carry on their person, not falling asleep as they walk through the dark, and all the while not just giving up hope and sitting down on the pavement in defeat. There were parts of this book that just made me physically weary, perhaps like reading a Jack London novel can make one imagine they feel very cold.The ending leaves a little bit to be desired as it stops abruptly and partially open-ended. Just the same, it is perhaps the right ending, as the winning character finds himself in a bit of a catch-22 in the presence of his oppressive government, and it allows the reader to formulate in his own imagination what might have happened.Overall, it is a vivid and uncomfortable novel in the most compelling of ways, and is ultimately worth the journey."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"One of King's earliest works, so it's a bit clumsy, like the first stories he published in \\"men's magazines\\" way back in the day. But idea behind it is typical King; dark, twisted, and almost wholly original. It centers on a contest of endurance where to fail is to die, but to succeed is probably to die too; just later, and after a lot more painful travail.In a post-Apocalyptic world, young male competitors (boys, really), many of whom don't have anything else to lose, arrive from various points around the country to participate in a what is called a \\"long walk\\" for possible fame, fortune, and imperishable glory. But probable death. The rules are pretty simple: the group begins to walk, and whoever gets tired or just can't keep up the pace (for example, gets a cramp or a blister), is eliminated from the competition -- permanently -- by the armed guards escorting the contestants. Apparently, there can be only one winner, so the walk will go on and on until everyone but one has been shot; although as the story proceeds, we begin to doubt that winning is a possibility for anyone at all. We start to think that the game is rigged and these prizes are illusory and past winners myths men have made in order relieve the tension, or boredom, or whatever.Obviously, it's a purely symbolic story, but maybe that's one of the reasons why it's so good; it's unapologetically symbolic. It's not pretending to other things.It's also a tale told by a King before he was the King we know him as today, and so it is more interesting than many of his other stories. It's a lot like the first Dark Tower book, in that way. The King here is just a college nobody, no fame, no fortune himself. Just one of the many millions grinding away in the mill. And a grinding obsession in himself to learn how to tell a good tale.And this book, which is really more of a long short story, is a good tale, based on a solid foundation. Some mistakes here and there, yes, some cracks in the walls, so to speak, but still a good story.It gets more and more unsettling as it goes along, particularly when the contestants begin to hallucinate, and we find out that one of them may be the son of whatever sick despot rules this world (why is he in the \\"contest\\"?), and King describes with a sort of glee happy crowds cheering at the very glimpse of these sick, straggling children -- which is probably why The Long Walk eventually became a so-called Bachman Book.On a side note, this has a lot in common with The Running Man, which is another very early King book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"A long walk is a great book! I would recommend EVERYONE to read this book. When Stephen King writes as Richard B. the writing I observe is darker. I enjoyed this book and I even cried when one of the walkers was killed. I wont give it away but I cried hard wonderful book it rips into your emotions."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"If you like vintage King you will like this book. I would recommend to anyone who likes this genre of books."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"They said the book was in good condition and I thought it didn't reach that classification. Got to remember when ordering a paperback book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I have read in a long time. A friend recommend this to me because I liked The Hunger Games. If you are a reader that needs everything explained to you in the story this is not the book for you.

With that being said, I did like the story so I gave it three stars."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I thought the. Idea for this book was pretty cool.

I have read almost every one of his books. Normally I am very satisfied at the end, even when the dreaded villian shows he will return some day. However, The Long Walk is much like Cell in that you are waiting for the conclusion or ENDING and it just doesn't come. To say that both these books leave you wanting more is a HUGE understatement. It makes you angry you ever started reading it. I felt jipped. I have many other books I could have spent my time on rather than one that was such a disappointment.Don't give up on SK because of a few duds. He is a mastermind and has MANY really awesome books!!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Steven King is known for his suspense filled stories and edge of your seat tension. This story however failed to meet the expectations I have come to expect from King. This lacked the suspense of the dome and the creeps of Bag of Bones.

SK shows great psychology here. and there is something about the book that always grabs my interest. why would anypne participate in such a contest, you may ask. that's the book's real depth. there is no one reason. some want to die, one wants to see others die, some look for the meaning of life. the book tells something about humans. how we look for a meaning. how men try to become men. what life is about. the book is actually SK's deepest and most interesting. the one who works best on a human-to-human level too."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I couldn't put the book down, to be honest with you. The premise is just too interesting and there's never a dull moment. But ultimately the story really didn't amount to much.There's a very \\"Oh, the humanity!\\" theme running throughout the book as these teenage boys(who are strangely articulate and deeply profound for adolescents) walk themselves into madness and death. Meanwhile, spectators watch from the sidelines with signs, waving and smiling, cheering their favorite, treating the event like it were the olympics except for the collecting of feces and discarded shoes. Many times, I couldn't help but scratch my head and wonder: Why kill the guy who drops in cold blood? What's the point? If the contestants are there voluntarily, why should I sympathize? And why do so many people actually WANT to be in this thing?It would've helped if King would have described even vaguely the kind of world these boys inhabit that this kind of contest would exist, but he doesn't.So many questions are left unanswered by the end, which was anticlimactic at best. Quite frustrating.Also, some of the deaths seemed very unrealistic (one kid rips out his own throat), as well as the implausability of keeping at a constant 4mph pace for almost a week with no rest. That's very fast, almost running.It is, however, a very entertaining read. If you start it, you WILL finish it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Hey everyone! I found this book awesome!

The Long Walk is when 100 teenagers get together and have to keep walking at 4 miles an hour.

In the middle of the story he talks to his new friends that will only stay with him for a while, and gets to know them very well. They get unlimited amount of water, however, they have a limit of food until 9A.M. the next day. In the end they are so exhausted that they have to force themselves to eat. Most of the people go crazt and get themselves killed. Finally at the end Stebbins dies of exhuastion and Garraty wins the Prize. The Prize is what ever he wants. He doesn't really care about it he just wants to see his Mom and Girl Jan.

From that day on, I've been a huge fan. &quot;The Long Walk&quot; was exhausting for me. It felt as if I walked every mile with the boys. Many people disliked the ending, and at first, so did I. However, after further thought, it made sense. Ray couldn't have done anything but keep on going. Thank you Mr. King, for writing such incredible, unforgettable books!

If you think that sounds like it might be a better short story than a novel over 300 pages, it probably would have. It's a very dark novel and most of the real content occurs within the minds of the main characters. They're just walking. For three hundred pages. Walking. I enjoyed it, but when I read it I had too much time on my hands. I wouldn't exactly call it a great book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I think that The long walk by Steven King is a great story, and anyone who reads this book will love it. It is suspenful, it keeps you on the edge of your seat never wanting to put it down so you can find out what happens next. It also has great imagery and structure. Another plus to this book is that it has a lesson. Never take life for granted, one day you can be having a good time and the next you could be dead. Like in this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I just finished reading The Long Walk about ten minutes ago. I found this book to be captivating, intense, and creepy as hell. It's a book about the United States, run by a government that is only hinted at as being quite different from the one we know(Led by a man known only as &quot;The Major&quot; and policed by nefarious &quot;Squads&quot;). In this odd parallel universe, the national passtime is no longer the safe, sweet game of baseball but is instead replaced by an even known as The Long Walk, which is simply 100 boys under the age of 18 going on a walk. If any of the boys fall, stumble, leave the pathway, or walk under 4 miles per hour, they are given warnings. After three warnings, they are shot in the head. The walk ends when all but one boy has died.This story, while cryptic, provokes odd thoughts about life and death, about how far a body will be pushed by the mind just to continue survival, and about how unfair life truely is. Really a microcosm of what life is all about, The Long Walk shows friends being made and lost, bonds made and broken, about the fact that someday everyone you love will no longer be with you and the battles you fought to get where you are were nothing but a battle with yourself.This book is really great, but it still has a few problems; First, as a fan of 1984, I felt that the story skirts too much on the basic facts of how the government has changed or when and how it came about. Also, as a reader, you are tortured with the knowledge that no matter how fond you become of the characters, all but one of them is going to die. It is worth a read as most of King's books are, but if you want creepy and fulfilling without being scary, I'd recommend The Dead Zone or The Green Mile before recommending this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"There has already been enough said about the brilliance of this book, (though nothing has been said about the obvious Vietnam metaphor) so I won't belabour the point.

For example: what the hell happened to the boy who chickened out so that our protagonist came into the picture?What about thes soldiers doing the killing? Think about Vietnam, for instance.

But this novel is a true 1# Bestseller. My favourite figure in this novel is Stebbins because at first sight he seems harmless and so everybody supposes that he'd die quickly but you'll find out that he is very tough. Will Garraty win? -Check it out!

ASK &quot;YOURSELF&quot; ONE THING - WOULD YOU WALK?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I knew the premise of this story before I read it, and my disappointment does not stem from that fact. The first 3/4 of the book was great. King does his normally fantastic job of developing the characters, giving you incredible insight into who they are. He also dropped many tidbits of information that gets you thinking about side stories (was this an alternate time dimension, etc.)Unfortunately, the last 1/4 of the book doesn't hold up well. Main characters are killed off almost unceremoniously. I expected DeVries to be the 99th one to buy a ticket, but he was dispatched much earlier. The end of the story came so suddenly, I had to go back and see who #99 was. The story Olson (?) told of the end of the walk he witnessed was far better than the end King gave us. I don't mind being left wanting more, but I was left wanting a real ending. Not King's best work.A comment about the Kindle edition -- there were extra spaces sprinkled throughout the entire text, which I found annoying and, quite frankly, unacceptable. Seriously, how hard can it be to fix things like that? A simple spell-check of the raw document would have turned up most of those errors. This was my first Kindle ebook and, sadly, I'm disappointed in the quality."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The book begins slowly but soon, as with most King stories, you're hooked. You need to know why and how the boys came to walk the Long Walk. You're waiting for King to tell what really happens to the winner. But he doesn't. The book, like the walk, just ends. I've never been so disappointed in King's (or Bachman's) work."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"the end of the book i really dont understand what the dark figure is about. the rest of the book made for an exciting journey. you should of know by the tone of the book that it was intresting. its easy to figure out whos going to win."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I CANNOT BELIEVE HE WROTE THIS BORING NO PLOT NO ENDING BOOK.

I HOPE BAG OF BONES IS BETTER, I'M READING THAT NEXT."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"There's a reason this book is written by Bachman -- because it is terrible and King was smart enough to distance his &quot;brand&quot; from it. The story is dreary and uninteresting and the most fun to be had is chuckling over King's, er um, Bachman's use of language. Guess he was bored too. Don't bother. If you are this hard up for a book to read -- find some old Koontz thing lying around at a Library Used Book Sale."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Awful. Absolutely and completely horrible. That is all that I can say about this novel.The End."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"My complaint against Stephen King, whom I normally like his work is that he could not be original enough to come up with a title for this book that was not already used by another author (Rawicz) in 1956 on a subject that had nothing to do with this book. My message for any author of books, movies, or even song writers, Never create a piece of work and use a title for it that was already used by somebody else previously.King could have chosen \\"A Long Walk\\" or \\"The Deadly Long Walk\\" but dont be so unoriginal as to copy somebody else's title that has already been copyrighted. The penalty for doing so in this case, is that the average rating for the above book has now been decreased by my rating. This may actually cost King some money."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I first read this book back in the early 80's when I realized that Stephen King was Richard Bachman. It stuck with me, it harkens to a primative realization, that there are those willing to risk life and limb for money, fame, and untold riches. We see it every day in many ways. But only Stephen King, eats down to the heart of the emotion that comes along with that journey. For most people there is no one waiting there with a gun, and the \\"walk\\" is designed for youthful males...being they might have the endurance to last. It is a journey thru the human experience, and I loved it, and still love reading the story!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"To be correct, it TECHNICALLY is a Richard Bachman novel. However, since Bachman suffered an unfortunate death (wink!), King has so graciously agreed to allow it to be published under his name.\\"The Long Walk\\" describes a brutal, dangerous competition in an alternate, possibly fascist America. 100 boys are picked from thousands who apply to do the race. Their goal? To start walking from the Maine-Canada border, along a marked route southward, for as long as they can continue without any type of rest or true stop. The prize for the last boy standing is anything he desires in the form of what is implied to be a vast prize of money. However, should any boy drop below four miles per hour as registered by the military guards constantly accompanying them along the sidelines in speed, he receives three warnings before getting what is euphemistically called a \\"ticket\\" and dropping out of the race.King does an excellent job in characterizing the boys participating, as well as the mental and psychological toll that the race begins to exert on them as they endlessly continue their walk southward. When one of the characters finally falls to receive his \\"ticket\\", it is gut-wrenching.The main weakness of the story (and it isn't too bad) is the length. After a while, the story drags a bit, as you wait for the boys to finally start breaking down until only one is left standing. Nonetheless, it is still a very vivid image, one of King's finest."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read all of King's books and I'd go as far to say that this is one of my favorites; not only did I find it fascinating but the theme & thoughts of the book stayed with me for a long time afterwards.The Long Walk is the story of just that - a walk that begins 100 competitors, and finishes when only one is left standing. They walk through the day and night, rain or shine, while eating and while sleeping. Slouch below speed and get a warning. Get 3 warnings and get a ticket - in other words, a bullet.Garrety and the other young walkers start in high hopes, become friends and enemies... and start to ask the same questions that we as readers are asking - why are they doing this? Why would anyone volunteer for this? For me, the biggest questions were what on earth has happened in the world that not only is this an acceptable competition, but one that is encouraged & cheered? One whose non-supporters must keep quiet for fear of not only being seen as anti-establishment but are also squaded?And ultimately can there any winners in this, other than the eager crowds watching or the General, who makes his brief but arrogant appearances? We learn the fate of past winners, and can our hero, Garrety, be one of them? And if he is, can there be a happy-ever-after for him even if he wins the ultimate prize?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Although King does not count among my favorite writers I had followed Amazon ratings and found this time that most readers were right. King has achieved in this special book, out of an original idea a blend of a captivating story turned it into a superb thriller, featuring his always gruesome, grizzly depictions and at the same time making an entertaining product. Once, I started out \\"The Long Walk\\" I could not stop reading it and gobbled it up in just one week, because through the development of the plot I discovered that is the kind of book that holds the promise of an exciting ending"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"If you like King but find tedious spending long hours getting through his 800+ page titles, this short, quite enjoyable and dark tale is for you. I think this could obviously have been a \\"long\\" short story (if the guys would have been running instead of walking ;)), but King found a way to keep the story longer while interesting from the beginning to the end.The plot ? simple, but efficient : in a walking contest set in a totalitarian future, 100 teenage boys must walk at a speed over 4 mph, if not they receive up to 3 warnings before...well you'll see. Most of the story is set around Ray Garraty and a dozen other walkers, mainly those walking close to him during different parts of the trip South from Main to Mass. where the walk usually ends.King gives a lot of importance to the diminishing endurance of the walkers and their mental and physical battle to survive longer. And he does it well. The tale is dramatic and gives shivers.A different King, short, dark and enjoyable, maybe not before sleeping..."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book was incredible. I believe it was written under the alius of Richard Bachman and his style of writing is usually all story. He does'nt drag things out and you'll be biting your nails through the whole book. If you like this book I also suggest \\"The Running Man\\"... it's nothing like the movie and it's incredible!!! You'll Love this book,gauranteed!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"A very special SK/RB! Reading the book is like walking through Maine yourself! It blows your mind! Cool scary reading stuff! Absolute cult!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was a fun book to read. Obviously it is very plot-driven, with the theme being the whittling down of 100 contestants in the long walk down to 1, but in between it takes some time to be though provoking - as you dig into the psyches of people who are on the border between life and death.Clearly this was written early in King's career, and it's a bit raw, but for this subject matter that somehow seems appropriate. Perhaps some of the characters are a bit too black and white, but even that's OK here - if you imagine the conditions they're under, you can see how extreme behavior might erupt.Reading this book will make you think about life and death a bit, and about how hard humans will push themselves to keep going. And at the same time it's fun all the way through."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read this book 15 years or so ago and just picked it up again to reread. Seems the first time I was reading, my feet and legs actually started to hurt as the story is written with a lot of conviction. My feet and legs did not commit to the same agony as before - likely due to them always feeling tired and sore. All that said, it is a good book and you really find yourself drawn into the Walkers."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Every May, 100 teenage boys (all volunteers) are selected to participate in The Long Walk. The walk begins in Maine and continues without pause until only one walker remains; stopping for any reason incurs a warning, and at three warnings the walker is shot. Ray Garraty is a local participant and a favorite to win, and his long walk takes him through his past, into the reasons he and the other boys are walking, to the final step on the road. The Long Walk is all about concept, character, and motivation, and so is comprised primarily of an exploration of what the Long Walk is and what it entails, and an exploration of who Ray and his fellow walkers are and why they're participating. Unfortunately, the premise is never fully explained or justified, and so it feels artificial and the book is disappointing; the characterization, on the other hand, is exceptional. This book isn't quite as good as it could be, but it's intriguing nonetheless, with a chilling concept and wonderful characters. I recommend it.What drew me to this book was the concept: the endless, desolate road, the impossibly difficult journey, the death-wish of a hundred adolescent boys. That concept is as important as the protagonist (if not moreso), and much of the book's length goes to descriptions of the difficulty and perseverance of the long journey. King writes horror, of course, and he writes it well; The Long Walk is more distanced and psychological than much of his work, but his skills transfer smoothly and make the book consistently tense and chilling. Even when the deaths get monotonous (as they are wont to do when there are 99 of them), it only contributes to the unending, harrowing struggle down the road. Unfortunately, the book's concept is never adequately explored. King reveals more and more about how the Walk functions and how it affects both participants and spectators, but he never explains why it exists. Perhaps that's intentional--and the Long Walk does become a metaphor for living and dying in real life, which also lacks an explanation--but regardless, it makes the premise feel artificial and incomplete.Characters and motivations don't quite make up for this lack of explanation, but they are brilliantly realized. Ray, and his past; the friends he makes and the secondary characters who die along the way; what motivates each character and what eventually takes them to their death: King creates realistically detailed, individualized, compelling characters. Some back stories (primarily for Ray) and character traits (primarily for secondary characters) are over-simplified, but that's acceptable given the nuanced characterizations and character interactions (as well as the limitations of setting and plot) which do exist. The Long Walk did not quite live up to my expectations, and if there had been more reason and explanation behind the Walk itself, it would have been a better book. Nonetheless, it is a harrowing novel fueled by an intriguing concept and wonderful characters, and it's a pleasure to read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is simply amazing. It's Stephen King at his ultimate best. Thrilling and morbidly dark, the tale sucks the reader right in and never lets go. It provokes \\"that can't put it down\\" feeling on steroids. Really, books like this remind me how much I love reading. It's genre fiction as high art. After indulging The Hunger Games and Battle Royale, I was on a real teenagers death march in a dystopian vibe and The Long Walk delivered the perfect fix. I can't recommend it more. I've read a lot of Stephen King and, so far, this was my favorite."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I just finally finished reading, or rather, taking 'The Long Walk' last night. And it was exhausting.The idea of a 100 young men walking on a suicide mission sounded so different from King's other horror-type novels that I had to check it out.Though, for me, it did try my patience. Especially towards the last 100 pages or so. I even found myself going back often, rereading certain chapters, trying to remember who was who, who got what warnings, and who was ticketed.Though I found the story in whole riveting, and at times downright horrific, I was somewhat put off when King would jump narrative and start swimming in and out of poetic passages. It just alienated me from the core action.But yet I get it. I totally understand why so many people enjoy this book. Some of King's detours are so beautiful and out of the blue that they truly are haunting.Here are a few moments, or characters, that I found myself obsessing over during 'the Walk'. Spoiler Alerts!Early on, Garraty watches Stebbins, the boy in purple pants and green jacket, eating a jelly sandwich in a tree and starts to wonder about him throughout the entire race. It gets to the point where Garraty is so fixated on this mysterious kid that it starts to border homoeroticism. The more Garraty pondered about the jelly eating boy, the more I pondered too.Their strange connection forms into a love/hate relationship that is tested to the very last minute of the race. And, it turns out, that Stebbins has a few secrets of his own, that really caught me off guard. There's also a moment during a rain storm where Stebbins is clutching his stomach as Garraty watches, thinking that he may be in trouble. But it turns out that he is only trying to protect his last jelly sandwich from getting wet. These little moments were so fascinating to me that I felt like I was actually taking the walk with them.Another standout moment for me was when the little hick boy wearing overalls, a curious spectator, simply starts walking along with the guys in the game. Then, after about a mile, gets tired and plops down on the side of the road and watches them go by. How ironic and bittersweet. For all we know, this same curious little boy could be walking the race, for real, in the next five years and taking a bullet in the head. This passage was so powerful to me that I dog-eared the page just so that I could go back and read it over and over again. No kidding.And, towards the end, when Garraty starts to loose it while watching the last of his friends wither down, like death walking in a parade, was pretty hard to take. Creepy stuff to swallow.What made all of this frustrating for me is that I wanted the boys desperately to revolt against the soldiers. For Garraty to confront the Major. But I knew it wasn't that kind of tale. But I guess, that just shows how invested I was in the story. But, nevertheless, it was still frustrating at times. And it just seemed like it was stuffed with too much padding.By the way, I have my own take on the ending, but I would like to hear other people's opinions.Did Garraty just go bonkers at the end? Running away when the Major came to honor him? I'm sure anyone in that situation would. And, him seeing all the dead walkers coming up the road behind him was also an interesting bit. Knowing King's fascination with the supernatural, could this have been intended for the open-minded? Maybe I'm reading too much into it for being so close to the fire right now. But, it still would be intersting to hear from others. Thanx for reading- Kevin Brian"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I will admit to having mixed feelings about Mr. King's writing. Some I love, like the dark tower series (especially wizard and glass) others not so much (Tommyknockers). But the Long Walk easily falls into one of my favorite stories, not just from him, but overall. The premise sounds boring but by the end of the journey you have gone through the whole range of human emotion and felt real tangible fear of the machine that controls us all. The story is completely relevant with the now ended war in Iraq, the continuing war in Afghanistan and the \\"War\\" on terror in general, and how we view the service of our children towards our nation. I seriously can't encourage people to view this one enough, I normally don't write reviews but had to put in my .02 when I saw this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read this one in college and decided to pick it up again. I'm very glad I did as it had the same impact I remember from my first read. King is unquestionably the King of the macabre. If you haven't read this one, do so. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Out of all the King books I've read, this one ranks up there with the greats. It's not as long and enduring as The Stand, or It, but that's hardly a problem. This is one of those books you can read in a weekend. As soon as you start, it's hard to put down.The book offers a simply unique presence, 100 boys walk, until the last one stands. King's known for his imagination, and this book definitely stands out. It's not necessarily scary, but it's intense, and purely enthralling.You won't regret picking up The Long Walk. If I had to introduce Stephen King to anyone, this would be my book of choice."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"If you love Stephen King you will enjoy this book. It was very similar to the \\"Hunger Games\\" in as much as the world in it's current altered state has towns sponsor a walk of young boys in which if participants slow down, faint, get sick, or any number of other issues that interferes with their walking before they get to the finish line they are shot dead. I am always ambivilent about King's books but have come to love them."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I didn't even want to put my Kindle down. Short but incredibly written. First Stephen King novel I've read and now all I want to do is read more from him. I couldn't believe how involved I had gotten with the characters until I knew their fate!I recommend to anyone who loves to read :)"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I love this book! I rarely ever love a book. I read a lot, this was so unique, could not quit readingeexcellent....\\"............u will not be sorryBuy it, love it!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"My introduction to Stephen King, The Long Walk, took me to places I had never before imagined. The one thing that I've found that I love about King is his ability to capture the both the good and the bad of human beings in the midst of a traumatic experience. I was disturbed to read that people not only allowed the children in this book to participate in such an event, but also cheered it on. I was captivated, disgusted, saddened, proud, excited, and terrified all at the same time. This is a book that I have verbally recommended to quite a few people, and one that I will probably read again."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is not like any book I've read. It's a very simplistic storyline that manages to keep your interest and entertain you along the way.The story takes place in a bleak future where citizens are horrifically exploited for promises of fame and fortune. This seems to be a common theme with other Richard Bachman books. The book follows Ray Garraty on his \\"long walk\\" with 99 other contestants, where inevitable fatigue and injury are NOT viable options. As the story progresses, you learn more about the characters and the situation they find themselves in. The ending requires some interpretation on the reader's part but I thought it was brilliant."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm a big fan of Richard Bachman, Stephen King's alter ego. I usually love his books, as they are very dark and atmospheric. But The Long Walk wins it! This one is King's darkest novel. It's about a group of boys who, in a near future, participate in a race where the losers are killed. These 100 boys walk together for 4 days, discussing their non-existant future and death. This, of course, makes for a very bleak read.The book is short but it still felt a little repetitive to me. Sure, this is about a group of boys doing the walk (not much to do except, well, than to walk!), but it seems that King doesn't have enough to sustain the reader's attention for 350 fifty pages. As a matter of fact, the beginning of the book feels more like a short story than a novel. Did King start this one as a short story? It sure does feel like it.Still, this book is exciting in that King demonstrates how wonderful he is at writing dialogue. Everything these boys say feel true and real. You can't help but care about all these characters, even the so-called mean ones. This isn't the great King at work, but it's still a very good read nonetheless!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was a great book, i belive I finished it in a day, the idea is crazy, a walk where if you stop you die! I mean, when you first hear it, you think, hmm, i can do that, but if you really start thinking about it, you find it sort of frightening. That's what the teens in this Stephen King book faced, and Im telling you, i loved it. The books keeps you entertained, there is not a page that lags. The reason I gave it four instead of five, is for the ending, which left me wanting more."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The problem that so many people have with this book is that they place too much importance on who wins the competition. This book, however, is not a tale about the beginnings and ends. It is a story about the actual journey of life. After all that is what life truly is about.The fact that it is a story about the journies of a 100 kids, who all, to some small degree, know that they are going to die, makes this book so good."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman turns out a superb story that is set in the world that is passionate about an event that involves a game. The game is a lottery in which certain boys are chosen for the walk. The problem with this walk is that it is not a game where the loser goes home. They simply walk till...I will not give it away, I just want to say that it is a compelling read that I could not put down, and years later picked up again to read again. The communistic feel of the soldiers and law presents more feelings of Hopelessness in the days that lie before the boys on this road. From the beginning when his mother to the bizarre ending, and all the towns and people in between drops off the boy, it is story that has impact for sure. Follow them...into oblivion."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read The Long Walk as an inquisitive Stephen King fan, and by enticed choice; the Long Walk is undoubtedly a journey as you elicit at first, and the book follows through with that factor from the absolute beginning to the end. Stephen King as usual possesses the key to the main characters head along with disclosing his or her inside thoughts. Ray Garraty, whom you intagibly walk beside throughout the novel, becomes the onliest exclusive Long Walker you're aspiring to win.With a sole plot and purpose, you are constantly itching to discern what happens next. It is a simple journey you desire to read at one time, and finish quickly. I absolutely loved this book, and whether or not you're a King fan I suggest picking it up and seeing where your interest takes you."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was a very strange book. It took our reality and made a chilling twist to it where there is a contest every year and a hundred or so young guys walk continuously until they can't any longer. When they can't they're killed. At times the book seemed to be a bit slow and at times it seemed to jump ahead too quickly. I found the ending to be a little to quick and unlcear, but just the idea behind the book, and how the characters excepted this as normal and fun is all-out creepy."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was one of the greatest books ever written by Richard Bachman aka Stephen King. I very seldomly read books, but I've read many of Stephen King's, and this one is my favorite. The reason it was so great was the way we really got to know the characters, the surroundings/environment, and you knew what was going on all the time. What so scary is the fact that this is something that might actually happen decades into the future, as a rather sick way of population control, but this book was excellent, and the ending... well, read the book. That ending was something else."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book was impossible to put down from the first page to the last! I found myself truly feeling for many of the characters and I was genuinely caught up in the horror of The Long Walk. This is a book that no one (who can handle some really heavy reading) should miss. VERY convincing character development and plot."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Well, that is quite a statement, but now you're reading my review. I think Faulkner, Fitzgerald and Hemmingway both have a couple worthy of note, but all hyperbole aside, The Long Walk is a psychological thriller told remarkably well. This is the ultimate ghost story and is a defining work of a man who has earned recognition as one of the greatest storytellers in American history. I know, I know, I sound like another King fanatic, but truly, you can't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read The Long Walk well over 10 times in the last 10 years and it continues to get better and better. Once again, King has taken the most simplistic idea to an extreme to create an incredibly suspenseful tale. That idea, a sport where the loser pays the ultimate sacrifice. That sport, ultimately simplistic in itself. Walk. The characters have variety, diversity and depth. It is a riviting work that will hold your attention rapt from start to finish, exploring the depths of human consciousness. A must read for any true King fan. Not only the best Bachman book, but the best King book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Great book. Couldn't put it down. This book is just one more example of why Stephen King is such a great writer and storyteller."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am a big fan of Stephen King. I have not read one of his books in awhile, so this was a pleasure getting back to his works. The man's mind is stimulating to say the least."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The ending really surprised me because it left me hanging as to where it went from there. Very strange practice."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I sometimes like to judge a books popularity by its availability in the public library system. I figure the longer I have to wait my turn to get my hands on it, all the better it will be when I do finally get it, right?This was the case with 'The Long Walk'. It's not one of King's new releases but yet my wait for this title would have been over two months. Surely with a wait this long the book had to be a real gem. So rather than wait for it, I bought it on amazon for 8.00. I knew this title was a much earlier work of King's and I wanted to compare it to his more recent stuff.Well maybe it's just me but this story drug on and on and then on some more. Half way through I knew who the last boy standing was going to end up being so the suspense factor dropped considerably. With King's other titles I am always drawn into the story and greatly look forward to the story each time I open the book. With this one, I actually read two other non King titles before I finished 'The Long Walk'. It just didn't keep me captivated.So when I found myself lulling around for a new read, I thought to myself...'The long Walk' will get better...it has to, this is a Stephen King title. I thought after I picked it back up there would be some compelling twist or surprise that would finally pull me into the wormhole of his imagination. However, it just didn't so I thought, \\"Okay, the ending is going to be just smashing, right?\\" It wasn't, in fact, the ending really killed it for me completely and I was genuinely MAD. I won't spoil it for you though if your planning on checking this title out...misery loves company. Ha, Ha!Having been a much earlier work of King's ...before he was really 'KING' might be why I was a bit disappointed with this title. I'm the type of person that normally always says... \\"The book is way better than the movie.\\" But in this case oddly I think that this would have been more enjoyable as a movie instead."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is amazing in its own ways-that no man can describe. The only word you can describe this book as is suspending. A real breath-taker. Buy this magnificent book and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Enjoyed this story, but was left hanging at the end which I know was intentional. For anyone who have ever participated in endurance sports, there are sections in the story you&#34;ll relate too!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It is with some amount of hesitation that I review and, yes, even recommend \\"The Long Walk\\" by Stephen King, written under his psuedonym of Richard Bachman. While I greatly admire King's writing style, I am not a horror fan, and read his works solely because he is so good at what he does that it makes me willing to venture into a genre I normally wouldn't touch. \\"The Long Walk\\" is one of his lesser-known pieces, and while not perfect, is a shining example of how even his early work is above and beyond that of most horror writers.Reader discretion is strongly advised regarding this book -- King, while an excellent writer who's clearly a master of his craft, has a rather twisted imagination, and when he wrote as Richard Bachman he was even more sick and brutal in his stories. \\"The Long Walk,\\" which some reviewers have compared to \\"Battle Royale\\" or an adult version of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" is no exception.This book is set in a dystopian future where the USA has fallen under a military dictatorship, and focuses on an event that can only be called a bloodsport -- the titular Long Walk. One hundred volunteers, all teenage boys, participate in the Walk, which goes by the following rules:1. You cannot stop for any reason. If you stop, fall, or drop under 4 MPH, you get a warning.2. After three warnings, you get your \\"ticket\\"... a bullet.3. The last surviving walker wins.This book is dark and brutal, and most definitley not for all tastes. But it's fantastically written, maintaining an edge of suspense throughout. King's gift for words shines through as he describes the small towns and backwoods of Maine, and his characters all feel and sound real, which makes the knowledge that only one among them will survive all the more awful. And the characters' discussions among themselves as they walk -- their various motives for participating, not to mention their gradually decaying mental states as the Walk takes its toll -- are morbid yet fascinating in their own right.If you're squeamish, I would avoid this book. If you're looking for a pat, happy ending (or heck, even an understandable one -- this one ends in something of a mindscrew), I would avoid this book. But if you're interested in a look at King's early work, and at a raw, often disturbing but always sympathetic psychological study and suspense read, I would give this a look."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one of Kings better reads and one of his shorter novels but quite compelling. It's the story of perhaps either the not-too-distant-future or an alternate reality where bloodthirsty games are an integral part of a military rule kind of society. A man known only as \\"The General\\" seems to preside over the country but little is said about him, he remains a mystery figure throughout the story. The story entails an annual event called the \\"Long Walk\\" that is open to teenage boys under 18 years of age, where 100 will be selected to participate and a further 100 placed on standby to replace any who fail to start the contest. This is the countrys largest event and much money is spent gambling on it. The General himself starts the event (I cannot call it a race) and makes a couple of appearances further down as the contest develops.The aim of the contest? To be the only one walking at the end. They begin on a highway and walk many miles through towns and cities, the destination unimportant. The story centers around contestant Ray Garraty and progresses as he develops friendships and bonds with fellow Walkers. The rules are simple...slow down under 4 miles an hour, stop or sit down and you receive a warning. Receive 3 warnings and any further violation will earn you a 'ticket' out of this world with a grisly death from the soldiers who escort and keep tabs on the Long Walkers on their journey. The winner is the last Walker left, who earns 'The Prize' of anything they want for the rest of their life.The raw brutality of this is frightening enough but the real story deals with the 'whys' and why anybody would want to take part in this event in the first place. At the start they think they knew, but as The Walk progresses into the hundreds of miles and pain and fatigue and lack of sleep and fear set in, they rethink their whole philosophy on life and their reasons for doing this. Some make strong friendship bonds with fellow Walkers whilst others keep away from everybody to avoid losing friends. This book is about out inner strength to go on that comes from nowhere, when we've all but given up and all hope is lost but go on regardless, and the power of the human spirit. That's the real story I found here.The premise was a basic one but that wasn't what this book was about. It was about the human bonds we make and the choices we face, just when we have life all figured out and know what we want, we really don't have a clue.I gave it 4 stars, it lost a star for me because I think the ending could have been longer...it was good but needed more closure for me. All in all a very chilling and entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"To think that Stephen King had this in him so early on in his career just isn't fair. He is a master. As morbid as this book seemed, he made it out to be something more than that. Good writers try, great writers suceed. This was a sucess. It reminded me of being on road marches in basic training in the Army. Often times on long ones, we would tend to group together and talk to keep one and other motivated. We weren't under the same pressure as these kids, thank God, but none the less we championed some, despised others and tried to make it the best we could. This book will make you think. Is our society far off from this?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Like all of King's books, this is exceptionally clever and easy to read. The premise is that 100 young boys are carefully selected to walk until one survivor is left. Those who walk too slow are warned, and after three warnings and one more infraction they \\"get their ticket\\" (a bullet in the brain).There are flaws, perhaps because it was originally written very early in King's career. For instance, if the Long Walk is the central contest of this society, why don't all the boys know all of the lore surrounding the event and react to it? And if \\"the Major\\" who invented the event 20 years ago is such an icon in this society, why isn't he a General or at least a Lieutenant Colonel by now? Also, the required 4mph speed is a much faster pace than King thinks. A 3 mph pace would have been more realistic. Most importantly, I think the theme of obsessive media attention and its effects on the participants and the crowds could have been developed better.The strength of the book is the relationships between the boys participating in the event and the suspense that King skillfully builds along the way.Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\" handled the themes attempted in this book much better than King. This book is more entertainment than literature, though it is a fun read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I agree with the review that said this would make a great movie. Yes, it has the potential to be a great movie...in the right hands. But, alas, I'm doubtful that in this climate of (pinching my nose) political correctness, and over-budgeted productions, demographics and whatnot, there are many filmmakers with the balls to tell this story as it's told in the book: raw, shamelessly graphic, and unabashedly honest. William Friedkin is one of extremely few that come to mind.Even if the film gets an X rating, it should remain faithful to the book. Besides, the controversy would only attract crowds, not detract."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is a great book! As usual King pulls the reader into the heart and soul of the main characters. A very moving ending....."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"King is pretty much hit and miss for me despite writing really well every time. When all is said and done, though, \\"The Long Walk\\" is a hit. Well, most of it, yeah.In this, King is actually writing under the pen name of Richard Bachman. In the Signet reprint, there's a cool introduction by King himself explaining the importance of being Bachman in which he sheds some distinct light on this particular matter. Funny how he never meant for people to know Bachman was really King and that once the word got out, it meant Bachman's death, back in 1985. This and other early manuscripts are then really what Bachman's wife found hidden away in the attic of the Bachman's residence in New Hampshire. Meaningless and made up but interesting. Personally, I don't find much of a difference between King and Bachman, but then again this is the first Bachman book I've read.As for the story itself, it takes a very good premise and uses it to muse about life and the meaning of it all. One hundred boys have been drafted for The Long Walk, a yearly event where you can't stop walking literally for the life of you. If you stop, you're warned. If you don't get moving, you're warned a second and a third time. Then you're no longer warned. You're history. The last man standing is proclaimed winner and takes the Prize.\\"The Long Walk\\" reminded me of \\"Stand By Me\\" except it's inherently more gory. King suceeds in progressively turning sanity into insanity as time goes by and the boys each reach their ultimate stages of resistence much in the same way that you sense the crazyness going on in \\"Apocalypse Now\\". It's there, you can feel it, everything becomes more and more outworldly as time washes by. Where King in my opinion doesn't quite succeed is that the plot drags a bit in the middle and the end though surprising can be frustrating. If I got it right, that is.A good book but by no means essential King."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"King at his best... How many times has King had that written about him? Stephen's ealiest stories, from my point of view, were his best. And this one is definitely one of his earliest. Go for a long walk with King. You'll get a great story and a pretty good study of the Human condition to boot."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"When most people hear stephen King's name, they expect big monsters and lots of gore.Not in this case, unless you can see some of the worst off traits of the human race as a mnostrosity.In this book, we are introduced to an alternate reality. Nothing is very clear, but apparentlu the US is under military rule, under the Major. Every year, 100 boys go on something which is called the Long Walk. They boys just have to walk from Maine south, at a speed of 4 miles an hour. Anyone walking slower, in the wrong direction, or just happens to stop too long for whatever reason (legitimate as it may be) - gets a warning. After 3 warnings - he dies. If he manages to walk for an hour without being warned again - a warning is taken off. The last boy left walking is the winner, and the prize is - anything he wants. Every year, crowds gather to watch the boys walking.But as the walk progresses, and the boys realize most of them would not survive and the next person killed might be you - the attraction of the walk is quickly wearing off, and the horror of exhersion or death is growing."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This one is little known compared to It and the Stand, among others. But it may be his best. One of the more fast paced Stephen Kind novels. I gave it to a buddy and he stayed up to 4AM reading it. I would recomend it and any of the others he wrote as Bachman."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King's &quot;The Long Walk&quot; was a great story. As well as following through on King's natural horror story lines, King also depicts a horrible truth about mankind and it's search and thirst for entertainment. The crowds that line the roads to watch the Long Walkers, cheer even louder as child after child is shot, after falling and passing out from exhaustion or just being driven to the point of insanity, and... ripping his throat out. In the book, a boy named Ray Garraty, signs up for The Long Walk. A contest where the losers are given a &quot;ticket&quot; and shot. 100 boys begin the contest, one ends it, one lives. Ray walks on as he sees his own life compromised and watches boys just like him have thier blood paint the road. I STRONGLY reccomend reading this book. As well as chilling you and causing temporary insanity, hehe just kidding, this book will truly horrify you. &quot;The Long Walk&quot; should be read by anyone looking for a scare and a stomach to handle King's signiture, extremely detailed descriptions."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"King is a master plot-spinner. His pacing, with the possible exception of the last couple of chapters, is superb, and he's great at keeping the tension high. This is not, however, a novel for the ages. It's got engaging characters, several of whom you come to feel for, but they all too often speak with a kind of erudition that belies their years. There's a kind of commentary on the human condition, here, and a critique of contemporary society's obsession with the public display of pain & humiliation (think \\"Fear Factor\\" & \\"Jerry Springer\\") that, in a 1979 novel, seems pretty prophetic. But, when all is said and done, this is basically a beach book, and not the kind of work that repays the \\"only-novel-you'd-take-to-a-desert-isle\\" treatment."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"When I first read this book, I thought this would be one of King's worst works due to the rumors he had lost his touch, but I learned i was very wrong.As soon as I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The concept of the walk is defiently an amazing idea the King has come up with, and puts out a very powerful message to the reader about... nah, just figure it out for yourself. BE SURE TO READ IT, OR YOU DEFIENTLY WILL MISS OUT ON A GREAT BOOK."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"All i can say is WOW!. I was amazed at the detail in his writting. It was easy to get to liking the charecters and relating to the suffering they went through. I could visualize every moment. This was the first book by King i have ever read and if all are like this it certainly will not be the last."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Couldn't put this book down. Just wanted to get to the end. Forgot how much I liked the way the King writes."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This story of 100 teenage boys who set out for the Long Walk is my personal favorite of Steven King's books. Fans of the more recent Hunger Games trilogy would enjoy this terrifying story as this involves young people who must compete to the death in the name of entertaining the masses. Here the boys do not kill each other but instead will be shot when violating any rule such as not keeping up with the correct pace. The story follows one contestant whose psychological terror inside is as frightening as anything the soldiers are doing to the walkers who fall out of line. It has all the characteristics King has made famous. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk by Richard Bachman (Stephen King) is my all time favorite book. I first read it in 1993 and have read it about 30 times since. I recently found out it was on CD and decided to order it and take a listen. I wasn't taking a trip so I listened to and from work and around town so it took a couple days, which I liked because it stretched it out. The reader did a terrific job emitting emotion into the characters. I could feel pain in my own feet as he read. My only complaint was his accent for Art Baker. Baker has a southern drawl and the reader gave him a Gone With The Wind plantation accent. A little off in my mind. And I believe he was reading from the paperback version and not the Bachman Books version even though he did read the Why I was Bachman segment. I say this because in the Bachman Books version, the Walker who comes in fifth place is named Milligan but in the paperback solo version he is named Rattigan. The reader read Rattigan.If you love the book as much as I do I suggest you get it just to have it in your collection. What a great tale."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I had to use a book for a summer reading project, and after horridly failing at reading other 20th century author books, my friend had suggested trying one of King's novels. I loved this book. I still do. Its nice because its a change from his stereotypically scary books. This one is deep and has a lot more put into it than i had thought a book about boys walking could ever hold. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I understand that this is the first novel Stephen King wrote...It was published much later, but this is the first. It's VERY different than any of his other stories. You may be surprised (in a good or bad way) with the ending, but as King himself has said, he's just the channel through which the story flows. This is written in such a way that it could happen today, 100 years from now, or 50 years in the past. I couldn't put it down once I started. I love how he tells the story in pieces, and you find out more and more about the characters' pasts as the present story progresses. This is an extremely intense, DARK story (Bachman is an extremely intense and dark guy though)."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The reviewer with the \\"Most Helpful\\" about sums it all up for me. I just wanted to add that I had to read this book for a paper in Psych 101 way back in 1985. I recall being unable to put this book down, finishing it in one sitting. And no Cliff Notes version, either."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Even now, four months after reading this book, I remember it as if I just put it down.Thought provoking and chilling. Every time I take a walk I wonder, \\"How fast am I walking? Would I be getting a warning right now?\\"The only thing I would have liked to see different is a little bit more of a wrap up. What is the crowd thinking as he marches on? Does he ever realize he made it? Ect...This one is one of those where you can't wait to find out what happens but you dread it ending."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"My husband and I both read this while on vacation at the beach and we both loved it. Neither of us could put it down until we finished it. It's very dark and an emotional roller coaster and the end... those endings make me crazy. It was definitely food for discussion. Funny how different people get a different train of thought. Overall, a good read if you enjoy the type of story that will disturb you."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I thought the book was very good, very true to Stephen King, but after a few chapters it got really repetitive and I started to lose interest but kept with it only to have it end so abruptly. Not bad, but not my favorite."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I powered through this one expecting at least something for a payoff. But nothing really happened to make it seem worthwhile.

I found the whole story very interesting, it was very original and well written. I can't reccommend it enough. Definitely my favorite Stephen King book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read most of Stephen King's books, but, The Long Walk kept me looking forward to my next chance to read more than any other! Some of his works are quite lengthy, at times making it difficult to &quot;hold on&quot; to the whole story. But with The Long Walk, I &quot;kept pace&quot; with the whole story...every step of the way!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Science fiction? Social allegory? Existentialist nightmare? Martial wet dream?The premise of &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is deceptively simple: take 100 teens, make them walk non-stop down the road until they start dropping one by one and reward the last one standing with his own life and whatever his heart fancies. Over such a solid foundation, King built a study on the loss of innocence, one of his recurring themes (other examples are &quot;The Body&quot; and, more recently, &quot;Desperation&quot;).When the kids in this tale agreed to walk the Long Walk, they expected only to fight physical exhaustion. Gradually, it dawns on them and us that the real peril lies within: MADNESS.Maybe hard core horror King fans will be able to dig this one. Even if you are not one, try it. You'll find a great story in here."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book remains one of my favorite King novels. It's the best of the Bachmans, that's for sure. The ending is probably my favorite ending of all King's books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read so many review giving only 1 star and saying it was a very long book with no action. King here created a masterpiece - a PSYCHOLOGICAL Thriller . Not all book is about action or even blood and guts. I found in this book a rare and beautiful story of a young boy that finds himself trapped in a \\"game\\" and grows to know himself and some of the other boys he is walking with. We are following him through all phases of his mind, through the realization of the consequences of his action to the fear and pain he endures thorough the miles of the walk. The bond and connection with the other \\"player\\" will soon be unbearable and you will soon feel for them along with Garraty. I recommend this book to everyone that love Psychological thriller and character studies. I agree sometimes that king has a tendency to overwrite and go of on tangents, but this book captured me from the first line until the end of the book. Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did !"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"There's no doubt that the premise of Stephen King's The Long Walk is interesting. 100 boys are in a contest to see who can walk the longest, if you go under four miles per hour three times, than you are killed. The last one standing gets whatever they want for the rest of their life. It certainly sounds promising enough, but the problem here is the whole book is walking. I guess that's the point, but the story must rely on the dialogue to keep interesting. The story follows Ray Garraty, who joins the Long Walk because.....he wants to die? The other characters are the ones that keep the story going, as they constantly talk, mess around, and eventually die. It's a grueling tale, but does it stay interesting? Not really. I felt no urge to read it again once I had finished it, but that's not to say I wasn't interested to see who dies when. The ending is not really clear and can be discussed for hours. The Long Walk isn't bad, but there are better Stephen King books."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've become a Stephen King reader late in life and perhaps that has increased my enjoyment of his works. My earlier impression of Stephen King (based on hearsay only) was that they were full of horror and gore and would haunt my dreams. Now I find they leave me contemplating life: my own and the world around me. The Long Walk is written by Stephen King as Richard Bachman and is the only SK as RB book I've read so far. SK devotes an eight-page introduction to Richard Bachman and after reading the book, I can see a distinctly different persona. The Long Walk is a disturbing look at a future US society and one that I hope is never realized. 100 teenage boys begin the long walk in Maine. Once they begin walking, they cannot stop or walk slower than 4mph. If they do, they receive a warning. After three warnings, they are shot dead. My thoughts as I read the book were why would anyone ever want to participate in such an event. Either you win over 99 others, or you die. As they walk, most of the boys gradually form groups and talk about their lives and reasons for participating in the walk. Despite the horror one feels as to the inevitable outcome for the boys, it was heartwarming to see that many of them reached out to encourage and help each other. The boys, who had everything to lose, seemed more humane than most of the spectators who lined the streets to watch them as they passed or watched the event on tv and placed bets on the outcome."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"What I want to know is why is the kindle version $7.99 when he wrote this as richard bachman-the paperback is what 3.80?

I was reading on my kindle at stop lights, at lunch, anywhere I could grab another page or two.I have to say I was dumbfounded by how suddenly it seemed to end. I always hate finishing a King work of art. I feel like a jilted lover, so forlorn."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Back when \\"Richard Bachman\\" was a pseudonym that really hid the identity of the author, Stephen King unearthed this malevolent dark gem from the literary graveyard of his college days. THE LONG WALK is a fearless (some may say tasteless) trek into mankind's tendency towards self-destruction. The story vehicle for this idea is a marathon in which 100 boys start walking--and never stop. The boys must maintain a continuous walking speed of four miles per hour. Monitored by a roving contingent of future-military-types, they may receive up to three warnings in a given hour before they are shot dead to the applause of their roadside audience.Enter Ray Garrity, the \\"hero\\" of the story. You follow his progress through the long walk as, one by one, his fellow contestants--many of whom he develops friendships with along the way--are unceremoniously dispatched. King takes you deep into the mind of this character, as he seeks to understand his own motivations for volunteering himself to this unholy contest. All the while, for seven dark and nightmarish days, he keeps putting one foot ... in front ... of the ... other.THE LONG WALK is not an especially long book, but it sure does feel like one, and in this case, that's a good and deliberate thing. King makes you feel the nightmare in drawn-out excruciating detail, leaving nothing to the reader's imagination .... until the end.I'm still not sure I understand what happened there, and I don't get the impression King fully understood himself. It's a flaw in an otherwise fantastically clear adventure into the worst in human nature. This is a great book that could have been brilliant if only it had had even a good ending.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book, TEETH: a Horror Fantasy.)"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Originally released under King's alter-ego, Richard Bachman, THE LONG WALK is one of the most haunting and enduring novels that King has ever written. Apparently, King wrote the book when he was a freshman in college. He had attempted to get the book published, but after several rejection letters, gave up until he was able to release the novel under the Bachman name.Told from the perspective of \\"Maine's Own\\" Walker, Ray Garraty, the story is set in a fascist America not all that different from our own. Baseball is no longer the American pastime and has been surpassed by an annual event known as The Long Walk. Each year 100 young men are selected from thousands of applicants to participate in the Walk. The Walk is a walkathon where each Walker must maintain a walking speed of four-miles-per-hour. If they fall below that speed or commit any other infraction (such as leaving the route) they are given a warning. Each Walker is allowed three warnings. If a Walker maintains the required speed, he can walk off a warning after an hour from the time the warning was given. After three warnings and not walking any of the warnings off, a Walker is given a ticket. When you get ticketed, you aren't allowed a potty break, a chance to eat a snack, or to take a nap. When you are given your ticket, you are shot dead on the spot. Once you begin the Walk the only way to get out is if you get your ticket or outlast everyone else and win The Prize. And what exactly is The Prize? It's anything and everything you want for the rest of your life.THE LONG WALK is a brilliant novel that explores the depths of the human condition. Most of the Walkers have no idea what they have gotten themselves into once they begin the walk. It isn't until the first shot is fired that most of the walkers realize exactly what is going on: that they are walking towards their deaths. As the Walk progresses the Walkers learn a lifetime of knowledge about themselves, about each other, and about humanity. How should a person live? What makes life living for? How is it that a group of strangers can become closer than brothers in a few hours? Is life just a game or is it a journey? The novel illustrates that even those who have the best odds and the most to live for in life can be felled by the same diseases, illnesses, and temptations as everyone else. The novel also is full of social commentary, through the observations about the ever-present and ever-growing Crowd that surrounds the Walkers. How can people become so hardened that they cheer people on to get \\"ticketed\\" right before their eyes? This is just one of the issues that THE LONG WALK examines through the engaging tale it tells.The LONG WALK is easy to read and after the first few chapters of exposition and set-up becomes a page-turner. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and will read it again and again. I highly recommended it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk story essentially revolves around an endurance race between 100 boys, each one representing a different part of the United States, willingly contending in an annual race were the participants had to keep walking until they couldn't go on and then be eliminated one by one until the last one standing was declared the winner. The interesting thing about the race is that each eliminated boy is shot on the spot by armed guards.Stephen King masterfully describes the whole ordeal that these kids have to go trough in detail. He manages to take the simplest of ideas and make a complex and hard to put down story. Stephen King never really gives any solid background history about why this horrific ritual takes place, or what kind of sick world these youths live in, but what he does is give hints that that let you figure a lot of information by yourself. That manages to make the story all the more dark and enjoyable.Although this is not King's best written book, it is by far the one book written by him that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat until the very end. A must read for any Stephen King fan."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The book The Long Walk is probably the most shocking book you'll ever read. It was an amazing book cover to cover, because when you aren't wondering what these kids are doing, you are trying to figure out who was going to make it to the end. It kept my attention the entire time and I would find myself up late at night, needing to get up early, reading this suspenseful book. Stephen King did a very good job writing this one as he does with all his books. He wrote it under the name of Richard Bachman as he did with many books early in his career until this secret was discovered.The book is centered around a boy named Ray Garraty who has been invited to be a part of the long walk. The long walk is a race/contest that everyone in the country knows well and respects. Everyone seems to want to have their kid be a part of it, mainly because of the prize you get if you're the winner. King never gets too specific with what the prize is; he leaves that up to your imagination. To win this race you have to walk an extremely long distance without stopping, never going below the speed of four mph. This means you're not able to stop for anything, including eating, going to the bathroom and there's absolutely no sleeping. If you slow down too many times or break any of the rules, you are eliminated from the contest. That's the reason that the race lasts so long is because it doesn't end until there is only one person left. No one is willing to give up and lose after all the hard work they've done. Then, of course, there's some extra motivation to not fall behind that I will not mention so as not to ruin the book for you. During the book you get to see how the boys react to what's going on around them and the bonds they make with each other. King does a really good job of showing how people would actually react in the situation and also shows certain other, more, insane ways of acting that legitimately could happen.As you read this book and come to realize what is actually going on, you start to wonder what kind of society and government would allow something like this to happen. Not only that, but what kind of people watch and look forward to such an event. I think one of the things King might be getting at is the way that people can be entertained by the most disturbing things. This event is watched on TV and respected by people across the country. But when people who are watching this in person find out what is going on, their reaction is no longer an entertained one, it's more of a shocked and surprised reaction. It kind of shows how people don't really know what's going on in the world they are entertained by. They watch these things thinking it's something so great, but when you see it in real life you realize that it's a horrible thing to go through. This is one of the things I like about Stephen King books; he creates an incredible story and then also puts some meaning behind it that makes you think.Over all this is one of the best books I've ever read. It was interesting, suspenseful and terrifying like most of King's books. The only problem I had with the book was the ending. I am, however, rarely satisfied with endings, but in this story there really is no winner to the contest. Yes, someone does finish the contest but it definitely is not a happy ending and just kind of leaves you off in mid thought. Sometimes this just adds to the story and makes you use your imagination a bit, but I would like to have a little more closure to it. Despite this, The Long Walk comes highly recommended from me and would be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of reading."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This often overlooked story is probably one of King's best works. I have read it several times...a very, very haunting story and a real page turner. Character developement is wonderful. Wish more of this author's work was of equal quality (not that most of his stuff is bad, it's just that some is much better than others?. Thank you Mr. King."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read all of Kings published novels, about 50 or so, and this is my alltime favorite. In fact, of all the horror novels I've read, and believe me its 100s, this is the best. Incredibly bleak, gritty, and dark. This would make a great sci-fi film but is too bloody hardcore for the mainstream. The story follows 100 game show contestants struggling to survive. What makes the story great is you know only 1 of the 100 will win, and the rest will all die. It is only their willpower that will keep their life. As the story progresses King creates realistic characters of depth that inevitably get run down by the game. This format makes you keep turning the page, wondering how it could possibly get worse, and it does. This is the only novel I've read 4 times. Definately recommend for fans of bleak King, Horror, or dark Sci-Fi. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"&quot;The Long Walk&quot; is my favorite novel by Stephen King. Considering he's my favorite author and I've been devouring his work since I was a wee lass of 10, that's saying a lot.It's not exactly classic horror. The horror is mostly in the psychology, rather than in the words themselves. It takes place in the future or perhaps in a parallel world. Much like in &quot;The Running Man,&quot; games are played for all to watch. However, in these games the losers die.Eerily like the current reality based game shows, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is about a contest played by young men in their teens. They consider themselves to be lucky to be chosen to compete. The winner receives fame, fortune, their hearts desire.The concept of the game is to just walk. The 100 contestants walk, and walk, and walk... if one fails to walk, he gets a warning. If he gets 3 warnings, well, he gets his &quot;ticket&quot; and is out of the game. The last remaining &quot;survivor&quot; wins the game.The game is televised and is watched by nearly everyone. People look forward to this game every year and show up alongside the streets where the boys walk to cheer for their favorite contender.You might think it's boring, one book about a bunch of boys and all they do is walk, or don't walk as the case may be. While they walk, they talk. They talk about their deepest desires, their reasons for walking, their relatives, everything except, in most cases, what happens if they don't happen to win.I read this book for the first time several years ago. I recommend it to everyone and keep going back to reread it time and again.Pick this one up. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I began reading The Long Walk understanding the plot from friends recommending it. After reading a hundred pages I wondered if I could finish it. Stephen King writes so vividly you feel as if you were a contestant. Your feet hurt and you become tired and hoping most not to get a ticket. Once kids begin getting thier tickets I was horrified. Then King allows you to become acquanited with the lead characters and you cheer &quot;Maines Own&quot;. Every step you are with them. I have read almost all of Stephen Kings works and I loved this one. It is on my top ten list. Another excellent book by the king of horror."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read this book close to a year ago, and there is not a day that goes by since then that I do not think about some aspect of it. This is probabaly the scariest book I have ever read in my life, not because of the content of the book, but the actual idea. The fact that people would actually march to their deaths in hopes of getting whatever they want for the rest of their lives. Here's the scary part: there are people in the world who would actually do this. It is not that different from &quot;Survivor&quot;, it is the same idea. Who knows that people on &quot;Survivor&quot;wouldn't risk their lives if the prize was just a lot better? Besides being scary in that &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Running Man&quot; way, there are also amazing characters(I absolutely love Peter McVries, I cried because of him), and so many little philosophies in this story that make it so much more than a horror book. There are so many, I couldn't even name them all, but those who have read it know what I'm talking about. One example I can think of is when one of the characters compares the Long Walk to when people used to watch christians get killed by lions in the Colliseum in Roman Times. This is truly an amazing book, Stephen King is truly an amazing author, much more than just a horror writer, he's not the world's better selling author for nothing. Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"although you're actually just using your sense of vision to read this compelling story, you can actually feel your brain reacting to the other four. To all that say this story is unbelievable in its cruelty of the deadly determination of young adults...where is your imagination? Just because it doesn't happen right now in your world doesn't mean it's not a creative journey that had to be written. Steven, this is one of your best!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"An avid Stephen King reader, this one threw me. It was truly riveting, though unlike the King norm (no supernatural happenings and no monsters!) Although it did bring to mind &quot;The Running Man&quot; at certain points. The evil is man himself, and his love of the morbid, especially when it is socially acceptable.The basic plot is 100 young and fit men (teenagers, mostly), walking. Sounds pretty boring, but it gets better. When a walker breaks a rule, such as stopping to tie his shoe, he gets a &quot;ticket.&quot; The last boy walking wins &quot;the prize.&quot; The mystery of what these terms mean is part of the plot, and their definitions are truly terrifying.King spins a yarn, and reveals horribly gruesome facts about the walk as the story goes on. He pulls you in further and further until the shocking end and the bitter realization that winning always comes with a price-and sometimes that price is your very sanity."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I have read and, as a rule, I prefer crime noir to horror for my genre fiction. But I always remembered this book because a childhood friend was a Richard Bachman fan before that author's true identity became known. Curiosity got the better of me and so here I am.My take? Rather mixed. The story certainly contains an interesting concept (which, even without having read King, I would have expected). Set in a dystopian American future, young men compete in the long walk, a competition to see which will be the last boy standing. The winner gets anything he wants. The losers get a bullet each. Adding to the interest is that, despite (or more likely, because of) the morbidity of the contest, the walk is the most popular spectator event in the land.Again, a very interesting concept. We cannot help but wonder exactly what has happened? Why are so many young men eager to throw away their lives? The possibility of winning? The prestige of having competed, even if one does not live to see the glory? Some suicidal impulse? Or instead, is the tale symbolic of something else, such as the Vietnam War, which was being fought at the time THE LONG WALK was written? It is to King's credit that he does not even try to provide any answers. I appreciate an author that keeps us guessing.While THE LONG WALK is good on concept, it is much weaker in character development. I never felt as connected with the characters as I should have. Perhaps delving deeper into the characters would have revealed too much of their motivations, thereby providing us a clue as to what the walk represents. As I mentioned above, however, such answers as to what the walk means are missing, a fact that I appreciate. Nonetheless, I call them as I read them, and the book would have benefited by delving deeper into the walkers themselves. I should mention that, with respect to the military personnel enforcing the rules, they are conspicuously one-dimensional, no doubt purposefully, and appropriately so. Drawing them as mere background heightens the tension between what we read and what we do not know.Overall, if you like weird concepts and ambiguity, and are not overly concerned with deep human motivation, sure, give THE LONG WALK a go."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"When you think about it, the whole plot behind The Long Walk is both horrifying and ludicrous. But once you sit down and become involved with the story, and the characters in it, it turns out to be one of Stephen King's best books. Many would think that the whole concept of the book to be boring. But it's not. I was never bored during one point of The Long Walk. King writes at a steady pace, and the novel ends up being a quick and easy read. We read along, waiting to see who will get it next, and how it will happen. Sure, you know that it's going to happen to your favorite character, but you wish that it won't, so you keep reading along. A surprising hit from Stephen King, that was written unders his alias Richard Bachman. Read the novel, and you'll know why!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am an avid Stephen King reader and have read almost everything by him, and have found this story to be his best. The details and progression of the story is so chilling you want to put it down, but at the same time you can't. You just have to see how it ends. You have to see who will be the remaining contestant. My all time favorite Stephen King tale."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The characters had depth. As you read it feels like you really come to know them. However, the ending is anticlimactic."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk by Stephen King is a magnificent tale about one's will to live. The story takes place in an alternate America where 100 teenage boys sign up for \\"The Long Walk\\". The boys have to walk at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, and if they fall bellow, they are warned. 3 warnings and they are removed from the competition. This doesn't mean they are pulled off to the side to watch the rest of the walkers. It means they get a bullet to the head. Although this seems to be a somewhat dull and tedious plot line for a novel, King dives deep into the characters and how they deal with the situation. The way in which King develops the characters you feel like you are right there with them, enduring the same struggle. The horror of the book comes from the reliability, both between the setting and the characters. Even though it takes place in an alternate America the two are not that different. Same with the characters. The boys are just a bunch of normal teenagers. Once the connection to the characters is made, which is pretty quick thanks to King's wonderful writing style, the emotions begin. You feel the same disgust, terror, and realization that the boys do and that is what makes the novel such a wonderful read.The main theme in The Long Walk is the will to live. How far can you push your body and how long can your mind last when all your friends are dying around you. Just to give a clear understanding, the walkers have to walk nonstop all day and all night. They make friends right away because of the simple fact that going into something as scary and awful as the Long Walk alone would be a complete nightmare. Now imagine the physical pain and exhaustion of walking non-stop for days on end. Try to fathom, if you can, how devastating it would be to watch your friends being shot to death all around you. This is exactly what the walkers had to go through. I feel that King captures the feeling perfectly. The boys all deal with it differently but the imagery brings out your own reaction that may or may not be similar to the walkers'. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. King does an amazing job building up the characters. It is very easy to feel a real personal connection with the characters. Any parts of the story that are left vague are probably done on purpose so that the reader can fill in the blanks with their own imagination. There were a number of times when I found myself needing to take a break from reading so that I could reflect on myself just from the intensity of some of the topics brought up by the walkers and the narrator. Ultimately, a book is supposed to make you think and feel and The Long Walk does this better than almost any other book I have read. This is one of King's best novels and a must read for anyone of any age."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Having been a long-time Stephen King fan, I was surprised that I hadn't heard of this book until I read a blog that basically said, \\"If you liked The Hunger Games, you'll like these stories as well.\\" Well, I did like this story better than The Hunger Games. As long as you keep in mind that this was one of King's early novels and that everything about the book is preposterous so that you have to suspend disbelief throughout, then you can enjoy the book. The reason I liked it better is that I generally like books where people, if people are put in unnatural situations, will generally band together for their survival. This was not an every-man-out-for-himself type of book. Rather than being a detraction from the book that the competitors in this \\"Race for Life\\" built alliances, it helped humanize and provide motivations for why anyone would want to risk walking to their death with the slim promise of anything they wanted for the rest of their life if they managed to survive. I thought King had authentic teenaged voices, largely because King wasn't much older than being a teen himself when he wrote this book. Also, King does a good job of creating a sense of place. He is able to place us in those small towns in Maine and make us feel like we are also participating in this \\"race\\" and walking with these boys."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was written in 1979 under Stephen King's \\"Richard Bachman\\" fake name.Within its genre, this is a legitimate classic and is King at his best. By genre, it is mass-market commercial suspense fiction - but it's great.This is also a chance to read King at the peak of his writing powers. He can still a good story, like \\"11/22/63,\\" but \\"Long Walk\\" is when he knew how to edit out his worst excesses. You can tell the effort and attention he paid to the very tightly controlled sentences, which I haven't seen in his longer fiction in quite some time.This isn't even a third the length of \\"11/22/63,\\" but it tells as interesting and as well-plotted a story, with characters the reader invests in and cares about. The young 'walkers' act like teenagers, too.With all the hoopla about \\"The Hunger Games,\\" this is a great example of an earlier story that dealt with a lot of the same issues - a dystopian society, a bizarre competition, and teenagers fighting and dying among themselves. It's brilliant - and very, very dark."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"While I agree with the reviewers who criticize the premise of the book, I was still enthralled by the book. I know some will be disappointed by the ending as is the case with a lot of King's books, but I am one of those who believes the journey of the story is what makes a good book, not just the ending. I would encourage anyone who enjoys a simple character based novel to pick this up."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Although I did enjoy this book, I think that some parts were a little sick. The ending was incomplete in a sense that I wanted to know more. I wanted to har the major say that he was the winner just to confirm it. This book was the first Steven King book I've ever read and I liked it so its my third favorite book. It does make me want to read all of his other books."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book, was very well written especially for Stephens Kings writing capabilities. Although it was a thriller I wouldn't call it horror. It was another good look into Stephen King's mind. I would give the book 5 stars, however, the ending was a bit confusing, and it would be nice to know what happened to Garraty after he won."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"...the ending was such a disappointment. It could have been much better"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I was so disappointed. The Long Walk was a Long Walk that I could not wait to end. :("},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is set in an alternate reality where the U.S. appears to have a totalitarian government and a bloodthirsty event called The Long Walk is held once a year. One Hundred boys from around the country volunteer to walk. The pace of four miles per hour must be maintained at all times. If you lag, you get a warning. Three warnings and then you get a bullet to the head. Warnings also drop off at a pace of one per hour so you can get back to a clean slate. The walk continues until only one is left alive and he wins what amounts to anything he wants for life. The main character is Ray Garraty although we get to know a number of the other boys along the way. Some of them are likeable but others are mean spirited. Along the way, each of them is tested to the limits of their endurance and beyond.The overall tone of this book is pretty grim. There are some heartening moments where Ray and another boy, Peter McVries, help each other despite the obvious incentive to let a competitor die. Mostly, the walkers are ground down in every way possible. Emotionally, mentally, and, of course, physically. From the moment the walk starts, it is an unremittting grind and the reality of their hopeless situation becomes more inescapable with every rifle shot and every step that adds to their fatigue.Because the book is about a slow grind toward breaking down the boys, the reader is inflicted with a certain amount of fatigue as well. There are so many passages that blur into others that seemed the same... more walking, more sore feet, more walking, vacant eyes and bitter words... repeated over and over again. I understand the purpose but it doesn't make for the most enjoyable reading. The ending was almost painfully anticlimactic and a bit ambiguous as well.All in all, I would only recommend this one to serious King fans who are up for a depressing read. The book is similar in concept toThe Running Manbut not as entertaining."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"You either keep walking or just die,painfully.This novel can be very dirty...Here is the plot:One hundred teenage boys (picked at random from a large pool of applicants) are chosen to participate in an annual walking contest called \\"The Long Walk\\". Each boy must maintain a continuous four mile per hour pace, or receive a warning. After receiving three such warnings within a three-hour period, a walker who again falls below the required speed is eliminated from the contest by being mercilessly gunned down by the armed guards overseeing the event from halftracks. The event is run by a character known only as \\"The Major\\", who is the lead overseer of the Long Walk. He may (or may not) be a high ranking official in the United States.Watchers tend not to view The Long Walk for the winner - they enjoy seeing those that fail.There are no stops, no rest periods, and no set finish line during a Long Walk. The race ends when only one \\"Long Walker\\" remains, who earns the ultimate grand prize: anything he wants for the rest of his life. It is interesting to note that many winners of the Long Walk have died soon after the race - not because of any foul play, but because of the mental and biological stresses of the race itself. There have been contestants who actually tried to crawl at 4 mph in order to survive after their legs have given out.Each year's contest results in one winner and ninety-nine dead losers. The Walk begins every year at the Maine-Canada border and continues down the east coast of the US until the winner is found. The story mentions that it's a rare event for the Walk to finish outside Maine.The victor of this season's Long Walk is main character Ray Garraty, a 16 year old boy. Having made many friends during the Walk (and watching them all, in turn, die), Ray experiences a nervous breakdown when Stebbins (the illegitimate son of The Major) dies. Ray believes he sees a \\"dark figure\\" beckoning to him in the distance. Believing that he is not done with the Walk (because there is another person walking in front of him), Ray ignores both the cheering crowd and The Major himself.The next time Ray feels The Major's hand on his shoulder, the novel's final line informs us that Ray found the energy to run towards the dark figure ahead of him.The ending has been a source of confusion for many people. The most commonly accepted interpretation is that Ray has either gone completely insane, or that he was moments away from death, or some mixture of the two. Some people believe that he is merely about to faint.What makes the novel rather gruesome (and gripping storytelling) is King's exploration of the slow-paced race to the death. He relishes the walkers' psychological breakdown with great detail, as they push themselves to the limit of human endurance and test their will to live.The story delves into several themes, particularly the survival mentality, and mental and physical exhaustion. The Hands on a Hardbody contest held annually in Texas (and the movie by the same name) explore similar ideas.On a deeper level, it has been suggested that the storyline is a metaphor for life itself, replete with all of its trials and tribulations. Every participant in the walk either continues to walk, or dies (reminiscent of the phrase, \\"It sucks to grow old, but it beats the alternative\\"). Like life, every participant finds different reasons to endure what the walk has to offer. And like life, some just give up and allow themselves to be shot (an equivalent of suicide). And like life, it is only the promise of a better life down the road that propels the participants forward.enjoy...Nigel"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Nothing compares to this book. I've just started reading it again for the 3rd time -- and i dont re-read books."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"\\"The Long Walk\\" was a decent read when you consider that the only thing happening in the novel is the Long Walk. King does a good job in describing the physical and psychological effects the Walk has on the boys. It's not every author that can take something as mundane as walking and turn it into a horror novel.I wish King had gone into more detail as to why the boys signed up to do the walk in the first place. They weren't forced nor was there some law forcing the boys to participate. More information about the government that created the Walk would have added to the horror of the novel. I also agree with the other reviewers about how aburpt the novel seemed to end. The story didn't feel finished.Overall, \\"The Long Walk\\" was a enjoyable read, but one that won't stand out as a personal favorite."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Yes, I know how many people despise the ending to The Long Walk. But I'm here to tell you that out of all King's works, it's the most brilliant ending he's yet committed to paper. I know most people look for more closure once they reach the ending, and they want a &quot;happy ending.&quot; If King would have gone this route, as so many of you seem to wish, I would have been extremely disappointed. He took an unconventional, downbeat approach, and I'm glad he did. It gives the novel that much more power, at least to me. In case you didn't get it, Garraty didn't survive long enough to claim his prize. The &quot;dark figure&quot; who &quot;beckoned, beckoned in the rain, beckoned for him to walk, to come and play the game&quot; is obviously the figure of Death, and the game which he wants Garraty to come and play is the game of death. When he finds the strength to run, he's obviously running to meet his death."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Didn't care for the book; it was very repetitive with people getting warned, etc. I wasted a lot of time reading this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Ok. 100 kids. 1 race. 1 survivor. 99 corpses. The Long Walk.This is the story of a boy(wow) named Ray Garrety. Garrety along with 99 other teen/adults make the insane decision of participating in the Long Walk. If you don't know what the Long Walk is, it is an annual race from Maine to New Hampshire. There are as I said 100 competitors. They must maintain a pace of over 4 miles per hour or else you receive a warning. You get 3 warnings. If you get one more warning then they kill you on the spot.The whole 370 pages is the whole race. At first I was a little disappointed by that. Well, actually it is more than kids walking, but it is about kids bonding together. It is a story of sacrifice and friendship and death(there's Bachman for you).If there is a flaw in the novel then it would be the absolutely bizarre ending which I did not understand(so sue me). Other than this Bachman's writing was amazing. We sometimes hear about good books where we are actually next to the characters and expieriencing them, but in the Walk we go inside of their MINDS!!I was Ray myself. It felt like I was playing a video game and I was in control of Ray. We not only communicated with Ray but with all the other Walkers. Each time a Walker is shot it made me cringe especially if it was a Walker that King made us bond with for a while. This book is not an average King book where we get spooks and it is very action packed(IT, Shining,Stand), but rather like the Green Mile. I make the comparison because most of the time in the Green Mile everyone is in the Prison. In fact there is only one time when they leave Prison. In the Green Mile it is much like the Long Walk for the fact that King makes us bond a LOT with everyone.I read this book starting from 8oclock in the morn and finished it on the same day at 430pm. I don't do that a lot with books. I only read Cujo and the Mile in one day. That fact should tell you that this book is pretty good.Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one of my favorite books ever written. even though the plot is pretty simple, Stephen King does not bore us during the three hundred or so mile walk that these boys are competing in. Plus, i like walking, so i understood what it was like to go on long walks."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one of Richard Bachman's books. The situation is extreme and it deals with the practice of a competition to the most absolute ending possible. It is a walking competition. It has a starting line but it has no finish line. The finish line will be determined by the distance the winner will be able to walk, when he is the last one on the road, because all those who stop or try to escape will be put to death. This is a denunciation of absolute competition, even of competition per se. To compete is to want to defeat the others, to crush them under one's foot, and hence it contains a destructive objective that goes against any kind of human project. It leads to practices that are unfair, unjust, unacceptable like the use of doping drugs, like the use of pushing the others off the track, like the use of limited and hidden violence to get rid of the opponent, etc. One should see the practices that emerge in cycling for instance, in the pack at the head of the race, a pack of mostly wild animals. Brutality on soccer fields or rugby fields is well known in some countries, etc. Here Bachman pushes the game to its logical ending. If you enter a competition you can only get out of it dead or the winner. Competition is torture, even on oneself, in order to determine who the best one is. Unacceptable. We dream of sports that would be more humane and less beastlike. But is there one sport where this competitive spirit does not govern the psychology of the players ? In universities this is called the paper chase. But in sports it is a flock of rats or spiders that have to conquer their grub by eliminating their opponents and competitors. We dream of practicing a sport just with oneself and competing with only oneself, trying to go beyond one's own limits but not pushing others off the race to get the title or the medal. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is perhaps the most riveting story Stephen King has ever written. Not the best, but definitly the most shocking. I've read this book several times and always seem to pick up new things every time I read it. Errors, of course, are to be found in nearly every book. Just a couple to keep your eye out for:1) When Stebbins throws up on day 5, it says he was warned for only the second time since the walk began. He was actually warned twice before that; once in the first minutes of the walk and the second right after Olsen bought his ticket.2) A &quot;shifty-eyed&quot; character named Milligan bought it going into Augusta and a Milligan bought it on the last day. Since he made such a deal about there being two Bakers in the Walk (Art and James), if there were two Milligans, he should have made that distinction as well.I know, I know, I need to get a life. It still doesn't take anything away from this outstanding read. Poor Scramm, not realizing that nothing is a sure thing...until the end. Barkovitch, who is probably a good enough guy, never able to make friends which made the Walk tolerable for those who did. At first, I was a tad disappointed by the ending, but after reading it a couple of times, it does make sense. Garrity is walking, then running, towards the dark figure who is death. He ends up like Reggie Cotter, never able to claim his prize."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I thought it was a great book for a bunch of reasons. For one, it kept you on the edge of your seat screaming for more. It also thoroughly explained how the people felt. The book was non-stop action. If i had to put this in a genre, i would say it was a thriller. Anyone who enjoys thrillers or just likes to sit down and read for hours will really like this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"On the whole, this book was really good but the ending was kinda 'incomplete'. I don't really know how to describe it but I had this feeling like it wasn't totally finished yet... I knew right from the start that Garraty was going to out-walk them all. Another thing is that once more than one fourth of them had died, the rest of them just started dying too quickly. Apart from those few pointers, this book was very nice to read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I love &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;. I think the 4 tales are some of King's most interesting stuff, and they are very enjoyable for me, since they depart from his standard horror writing. I decided to post this review, however, because of the appearance of this edition on the shelves. The 4 tales of &quot;TBB&quot; are novellas, really, and not long enough, in my humble opinion, to warrant an individual release. So what we have here is the publisher splitting up the original collection (priced at $7.99), and asking the exact same price for 1/4 of the material. Oh, but wait, it's been spread out by approximately 100 pages to make it thicker. Good grief, Stephen, like you need the money... My advice: go to the used bookstore, find &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;, and let this overpriced book collect dust on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen dropped the ball here. If you are a King fan, you could skip this one and never miss anything."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Was a bit of a disturbing book that isn't for everyone.

The first time it happened, I had to read it again just to be sure I read it correctly. It's not a horror by any means and it's not even a thriller. The book is very repetitive but for some reason, not boring.Once again though, I'm confused with the ending. This is the third Stephen King book I've read where the ending doesn't make sense and I feel cheated.Overall, it was a decent book although I don't know I'd recommend it to many people."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Very simple storyline: Young men walking to death. If what is important is how a story is told, that is a wonderful story. It is pity that it is written by a popular writer who calls his books as &quot;fast-food&quot;."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I think this could have happened 10 years ago, maybe in the mid-eighties but no-way no-how today. Back then violence was exploited to the max as entertainment but now after Columbine, violence is now on the politically taboo list. If someone tried to organize a competition like this, they would be chased out of town, and character-assassinated for life. The story was nice and tasty and filled you up like a good chocolate malt milkshake. I think that the story is a metaphor for how 1980's society reveled in violence and killing for fun and profit. They say that a society's view of the future reflects the society's present mentality (remember The Running Man - both the short story and the movie?). Super story - a good snapshot of how we used to condone violence and pain back in the 1980's."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Endings seem to be a weak spot for King. Nowhere is this more perfectly exemplified than in THE LONG WALK. For readers who like to know how things play out for the main characters....don't expect to find out. There is no d&eacute;nouement. That said, the story is enthralling throughout....no doubt adding to the cheated feeling at the end."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm a Stephen King fan, but this book fell short of my expectations. The story was captivating until I reached the end when I realized that none of my questions were going to be answered. I was left confused, empty, and angry that the reader wasn't given more. I would have given this one star, but the cold horror that is Stephen King is present and doesn't disappoint in that respect. But overall, it's a disappointment.I've read many Stephen King books and this is one of his worst. Also, is he capable of writing a story that takes place outside of Maine? Apparently not. Although I've never been to Maine, I'm already bored of the place."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm writing this as a counter-point to other reviews of \\"The long walk\\". In many ways, this is typical King; if you like this author, you will probably like this book. In other ways, King has written a truly transparent metaphor for the human condition. The story about a long walk in which you die if you stop walking suggests trite comparisons to our collective journey through life. The ending of the book also conjures up a parallel with the inevitability of death; the winner of the Long Walk doesn't truly win, he dies like the rest of the contestants, much as all of us will ultimately die regardless of our walk through life. Overall, this is the \\"pulpy\\" King at his pulpy best, and the \\"philosophical\\" King at his philosophical worst."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Decades ago, Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short story about two men, longtime rivals, who find themselves captured by the enemy during a war. The enemy commander orders that the two men be lined up side-by-side for a footrace to finally settle their ongoing dispute. The trick is, he has his men slice their throats before he yells \\"Go!\\" They both die, of course, but one of them manages to thrust his arm ahead of his rival before the end. He, of course, is \\"the winner.\\"Stephen King's THE LONG WALK is pretty much this same story. Set in an alternate America, the novel revolves around an annual footrace in which a hundred teenage boys walk to the death. The rules state that the walkers must continue at a speed of at least 4 miles per hour. If they fall below that speed for any reason, they are warned. After three warnings, they are shot. The winner, who is the last boy standing, gets something vaguely referred to as \\"the Prize,\\" which is supposedly everything he wants for the rest of his life. One wonders while reading whether \\"winning\\" such a contest is even possible.King wrote THE LONG WALK when he was eighteen and a freshman in college back in the 1960's. His goal seems to have been to satirize the very American fixation on television game shows (in which people willingly humiliate themselves for a chance to win a refrigerator or a car), as well as our perverse attraction to such horrors as highway accidents, fistfights, and bloodletting of any kind. King has a valid point and THE LONG WALK works as social satire. However, it doesn't work as well as a novel.First, the premise itself is impossibly absurd. The walkers in this novel continue for over four days (yes, more than 96 hours!) at a brisk pace of 4 mph without a break of any kind. This is, without a doubt, physically impossible. World record walkers have managed close to 127 miles of continuous walking, but King's teens make it over 300 miles.Second, these walkers spend most of those 96 hours talking to each other! Anyone who's ever done any fast walking knows that you can't carry on a conversation for very long when you're exerting yourself like that. But King's teens rattle on and on about their childhoods, their girlfriends, their fears, their philosophies of life, and their wishes and dreams. They make jokes, razz each other, yell at each other, and act like any bunch of kids hanging out on a Saturday afternoon. It just stretches credibility beyond its limits and makes it hard to really buy into the real horror as the boys are shot dead, one by one.I like King's work, and THE LONG WALK is entertaining enough, if you can get past the absurdity of its plot. I think, however, this would have made a much better short story than it does a full-length novel. Borges got it right in just three pages."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I love Steven King! But--this novel was too dark, and it had a plot problem. I could not accept the idea of parents allowing their teenagers to be in a race in which failure meant death (soldiers shooting the kids that slowed down--shooting them in front of watching crowds!).If you make things too inhuman, you go so far over the top that the reader has a hard time accepting the premise. This novel is heavy with the metaphor that we are all born in a race and get picked off one by one. This view of life just does not appeal to me.MAKING KING'S NOVEL BETTER: Okay, the boys join the long walk, and when someone slows down, they are picked up by a white van and taken away. Everyone believes they are being treated well. But the hero discovers a dark truth. He runs off the side of the road to take a leak, and he sees a white van. He sneaks up and looks in the windows. Inside, a doctor is removing the heart of one of the runners. Thus, the boys are all being killed for their organs--including their families who just up and disappear because of this evil organization. At the end, the boys rebel and attack the white van. They kill the bad guys, and the evil organization is revealed and destroyed.Wouldn't that be more satisfying? As it is...I won't tell the ending, but it is not satisfying. In the \\"Stand,\\" billions of people die off, and a few good guys re-establish civilization. In the \\"Tommyknockers,\\" the bad aliens get their just reward.That's what the readers of horror novels want--a scary escape that ends on a hopeful note. We read books about horrible things that turn out good (even if a lot of good people get killed). We don't always need a happy ending, but at least a satisfying ending.King's essay at the beginning of the book on the \\"Importance of Being Richard Backman\\" was interesting, but weird. Oh, well, like I said, I love Steven King's novels, but this one didn't work for me--too much of the same thing.Read my review of Steven King's \\"Colorado Kid,\\" which I think had a similar flaw.The Colorado Kid (Hard Case Crime)"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Despite this being a \\"Richard Bachman\\" novel, the book is a complete loss. You become easily lost from the beginning of the story and become entrapped into this vicious cycle of losing random characters back and forth. If you cannot keep up with the characters and what conversations that they have held with Ray Garraty, then you will be completely lost.I do not see how Stephen King came up with such a lame idea for a story! It's absolutely horrible and I would not recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is was honestly one of the worst books I've ever read. I recently got on a Stephen King kick, and read (and enjoyed) The Stand (complete and uncut) followed by 11/22/63. I chose this one to read next since it seemed to have some pretty good reviews.BAD.IDEA. There is no better way to describe the plot than \\"a long walk.\\" It was as dull as watching paint dry.100 kids go on a walk. They walked 5 miles. One died. They walked 5 more miles. Another dies. That's essentially how it reads. Just repeat that for 400 pages.I don't know who in their right mind is recommending this garbage, but save your sanity. Avoid it at all costs. Read one of the two mentioned previously, or Insomnia or Dreamcatcher - books by King I've read and loved (although I was greatly disappointed in the ending for The Stand, I'd still recommend it).This book is an embarassment to Stephen King's collection."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is the best King I've ever read. I think the morbid idea of a walk to the death fascinated me and kept reading to see who would go down next. Garraty is a terrific protagonist and the fact that he's &quot;Maine's Own&quot; adds to his likeability. I highly recommend this book and &quot;Rage&quot; also written by King under the pseudonym Richard Bachman."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is by far the best Bachmann, or King book for that matter I've read yet! I read it in two days, I couldn't put it down! I love the whole government gone dictatorship sort of thing. As for the ending, try to use a little brainpower and figure it out for yourselves.

Their was a constant air of suspense and pain. This was an excellent insight on life,and in a way was a parody of life. Excellent book. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Easily the most compelling and thought-provoking novel written by the late Richard Bachman, &quot; The Long Walk &quot; rarely fails to deliver the goods. More a morality tale than a run of the mill horror story, the plot centers around a grotesque contest of will where the winner is rewarded with all that his heart desires, and the losers pay with their lives. The young man at the center of this madness is a frightened 16 year old named Raymond Garraty, who, along with the circle of other young men he befriends during the course of their journey, quickly run the gamut from feeling excitement at the beginning of the walk, to alternately feeling scared, repulsed, and worst of all, tired. Tired is what the reader will feel at the end of this book, having felt like they made the walk themselves. A truly frightening look at what could be in the years to come."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was the most amazing Stephen King that I've ever read. I couldn't believe how much it moved me and how much I could feel what the characters were feeling. I read this book all in one day, or should I say, night.

Stephen King, you poor soul in the hospital, you are a genious."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I think that this book, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is a really good book.

We haven't gotten to the end yet, but i have kinda figured out from other reviews that Ray wins. That is good, but I have also heard the ending is bad. Well, if you haven't read this book yet, I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"99 guys walk towards death.One walks towards glory.But he doesn't know.A great book about loss of innocence, about the border between life and death, about friendship.

Sounds like fun.King/Bachman has come up with a great story line here, and its so fitting in today's \\"reality\\" show market. Its a combination of Orwell's 1984 and another Bachman book, the Running Man, that will leave you wanting more.The story starts off with a group of boys getting ready for the walking competition. The characters come from all walks of life and they all have different purposes for winning the competition.(...)P>Its a great read, even for someone who isn't a King/Bachman fan."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"In the age of real life being sprawled all over the T.V. we seem to loose where we are going. In this book you get to feel (I reall mean feel) what it is like to be put to the edge of both the mental and physical raod. This book is has become my new favorite, and I don't think that any book can top the jorney I went through with these characers. This book has got to be one of the greatest acheivemets in the litterary world. It grips you into fallowing the raods and dosen't let you stop. It's better than such novels as Red Sky at Morning and the Exorcist. If you haven't read it, do it as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book served as my introduction to King (aka Richard Bachman) The reason I chose it was because all the other works available were 800 pages plus and I didn't want to spend 800 pages on an untasted author.Needless to say, after finishing the Long Walk, I will now be tackling some of the larger tomes. The story was well written, rich in imagination but chillingly realistic in description. The characters jumped off the pages and walked around the room with me. King is a master craftsman.I am surprised that nobody in Hollywood has pounced on the movie rights to this book. With the right actors this could be the movie of the year."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I HAVE TO SAY THIS BOOK WAS SUPERB. THE STORY IS APPALLING, HEARTWRENCHING AND PAGE-TURNING. I FOUND MYSELF GOING BACK CHAPTERS AT A TIME JUST TO REREAD THE HORRIFIC PARTS. WHEN I SAID IT BROUGHT OUT ALL THE EMOTIONS, I TRULY MEANT IT. I CRIED MANY TIMES WHILE READING THIS STORY. I WAS BROKENHEARTED, ANGRY, HAPPY AND DISGUSTED, YET I WAS COMPELLED BY THE SUSPENSE TO CONTINUE READING.IF EVER YOU WANTED TO BE ONE OF THOSE KING-READERS WHO ALWAYS READS THE LAST PAGE BEFORE READING THE WHOLE BOOK, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BOOK YOU'LL WANT TO DO IT TO. ALTHOUGH I DON'T EVER DO THIS MYSELF, I MUST SAY IT TOOK ALL MY WILLPOWER TO REFRAIN FROM TURNING TO THE LAST PAGE AND READING IT. THATS HOW MUCH SUSPENSE IS PACKED IN THIS BOOK. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This has got to be one of the most disturbing Stephen King books - or any book for that matter. Its story plot is genius! He puts you RIGHT THERE with the walkers - my favorite was McVries. It's mind boggling and defintely not a story to be forgotten soon...at all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. You get drawn into the lives of the characters and just have to know what is going to happen to them. This book stays with you long after reading it. It really makes you think of what would happen to you if you were in the same position as Garraty and his fellow Walkers. I recommend this book to any King fan or anyone in need of a good read. It's fantastic, I read it twice. :)"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is perhaps the darkest, most &quot;down&quot; King novel I have read (including some other Bachman books). It is, however, very well done and surely a must-read for King fans. Not scary so much as exhausting and utterly claustrophobic and linear, The Long Walk will keep you reading.Because if you stop three times, they'll come and shoot you."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I loved this book"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the King's best.

King didn't really tell us why these boys were walking or why they wanted to in the first place! He brought the characters to life tho so you could know each individual's personality. The ending was NOT tied up and I was left questioning did he or didn't he survive?Or win? Overall, it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"A great read as always with Stephen King. My favorite author. Love his style of writing. Loved the story and the price was affordable."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"\\"The Long Walk\\" is a fascinating novel written by American author Stephen King in 1967. He published it in 1979 under his pseudonym pen name of Richard Bachman. It is a story about a game show featuring an annual race between teenage boys. King is able to transform what would be a seemingly boring and ordinary plot into one that is riveting, entertaining, and even disturbing at the same time.The story takes place in an alternate, totalitarian version of America, sometime in the near future. One hundred teenage boys selected from a random pool of applicants would compete in \\"The Long Walk\\" which is a national and highly publicized event. The winner of the contest receives the ultimate prize of anything that he desires for the rest of his life. All of the young boys, who are under the age of 20, are required to walk continuously at a speed of at least four miles per hour. If their speed falls below this threshold for more than thirty seconds then they are given a warning. After three warnings, another violation gets the contestant a \\"ticket\\" or he is otherwise eliminated from the contest. Their warnings can be reset if they resume and maintain the minimum speed for a period of time. They also can receive warning for interfering with other contestant and get an immediate ticket if they leave the race track for any reason. The walk begins at the border of Maine and Canada on the first day of May of every year and continues until all but one of the competitors is remaining and is not stopped for any reason at all.Receiving a ticket isn't clearly defined in the beginning but it is quickly revealed as the first contestant \\"buys a ticket\\". This unlucky soul had succumbed to muscle cramps shortly after the contestants broke a record for the best start ever. When he slowed below the minimum speed after his final warning he was immediately shot in the head by accompanying military guards. It is discovered that buying a ticket meant certain death to a participant and the contest would only have one lone survivor by the end of the race.The event is extremely popular and attracts several applicants every year. Only a select hundred are chosen from a large pool of candidates. One might ask why so many young boys would volunteer for what would more than likely be their undoing. This question is answered throughout the story as applicants are eliminated one by one. The spectators don't seem to care who wins the race, but rather are only there to witness the deaths of the losers. The atmosphere is reminiscent of the bloody, gladiatorial contests that were held in the Coliseum during the days of the Roman Empire.Ray Garraty, the main character is a sixteen year old kid from Maine. He like most of the walkers makes friends along the way and starts to get desperate, afraid, and a little crazy as the contestants are eliminated one after the other. Although at bit depressing at times, King's does an excellent of keeping you in suspense despite the plot being about something as simple as walking. He keeps you hanging from your seat as you wonder who will be the next to buy it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"About:Whenever I start reading a King book, I have high expectations. I'm happy to say my favorite author delivered here yet again.The Long Walk is an annual event that begins on each first of May in Maine. One hundred teenage boys are made to walk on a stretch of road for hundreds of miles and through several states. If anyone slows to under four miles per hour they get a warning and after three warnings they are shot dead. Who is in charge of all this? A man called the Major. When does the Long Walk end? When there is one person left standing he will win the Grand Prize, which means he will have whatever he wants for the rest of his life. There is no established finish line and no stopping of any kind. If anyone stops for more than 30 seconds, first warning is issued. Each walker is not to receive any outside help either. Armed guards follow the boys on trucks on the side of the road, gauging their speed with computers.This national sport is televised and as the boys walk, spectators can be seen on the sidelines cheering them or just staring at the gruesome sight. As The Walk progresses and there are fewer and fewer left standing, the crowds get bigger and wilder.As the boys walk, the soldiers provide them with canteens full of water anytime and food packets at 9am each morning. These are the same armed guards who shoot them.The protagonist is 16 year old Raymond Davis Garraty from Maine. While Garraty walks, the few boys that are walking with him become friends to him. Peter McVries, Arthur Baker, Hank Olson, Collie Parker and a few others start to refer to themselves as The Musketeers.My thoughts:Stephen King has said that The Long Walk is the first novel he ever wrote and he started it eight years before Carrie was published.I was surprised to find that this book is a bit dystopian in nature. It takes places in the near future where America is ruled by the police, not the government.Garraty's inner monologue gives insight into his good nature. As he walks, he wonders if he can win this whole thing but at the same time he doesn't want to see his friends die. The thought of seeing his girlfriend and his mom again is what keeps him going. He does wonder what he will do when he finally sees them in the crowd. What else will he have to look forward to after that?He and McVries become best friends on The Walk and it's interesting to see these two help each other out because essentially, only one can win.The Walk is gruesome in itself. It's a sad, hopeless scenario. As can be expected some of the boys go insane while others suffer illnesses that eventually lead to death. Endurance is key, mental as well as physical. While they walk, the boys talk about life and the reasons why they signed up for what is basically suicide.The characters are all well written, I think that's a given with King. Garraty and McVries were my favorites.The police, are always there, a menacing presence. As is usual with King, here is the struggle of good verses evil. There is symbolism within the story. I think the walk itself represents the human condition, the journey we all take. Each person is different, each struggles in different ways.\\"They walked on, somehow in step, although all three of them were bent forever in different shapes by the pains that pulled them.\\"p.358, The Long WalkAnother thing I noticed while reading is the similarity to reality tv within the storyline. We've got shows like Survivor and Amazing Race where the contestants become reality tv celebs. The boys in The Walk become celebrities as well, with the bloodthirsty crowd cheering them on, making banners and chanting their names.The storyline is so intense, as I read I was on the edge of my seat, I could almost hear the walkers footsteps on the blacktop. King drew me in completely.He takes the act of walking, and turns it into this gripping and emotional story. Masterful storytelling as per his usual. I could not put this book down, especially towards the end and I even dreamt about it. It invaded my sleep.I wound up reading the last chapter twice because the ending left me stunned. If you've read this one, let me know how you interpret the ending. It's by no means a cliffhanger, but I do think it's up to interpretation. I found myself so drawn in, some of what happens at the end left me misty eyed. That's another thing King has a knack for, writing about the strong bonds of friendship. Friendships that form in the most unlikely of places.I recommend The Long Walk to any King fan and to readers looking to get caught up in a scary read that will completely suck you in and leave you stunned.\\"They walked through the rainy dark like gaunt ghosts, and Garraty didn't like to look at them. They were the walking dead.\\"p.349, The Long Walk"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"After reading The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, I tried to find some of the books that shaped the \\"teenage arena\\" sub genre. In The Long Walk, Stephen King did many things way better than Collins, and this is a book you definitely should read. Garraty, the protagonist, is incredibly humane and tridimensional, a boy for whom we really root. Other characters are just as well drawn, some nice, some evil, some anonymous. The tension of the Long Walk (an event where 100 boys walk until only one is still alive) is palpable and every death makes you cringe, while some will sink your heart. There are stories of friendship, of love, of loyalty and a big thread of loss -- and bodies.This goes though 99% of the book, then there's the ending.Man, does it suck!As far as I know King's work, he's really bad at endings (I mean, Dreamcatcher, anyone?), so I didn't have my hopes up. Well, it played as I expected. But the thing is, the rest of the book is so good, it all seems so possible in the reality TV dystopia we already live in, that one can go over the ending and pretend it just never happened.I only wish there were fan fiction picking the ball where King left it fall.And yes, it's way better than The Hunger Games -- except for the ending."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"A must read for fans of Stephen King. Although the ending is a bit abrupt. Its a very good book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I think Stephen King is at his best when he's telling me what is going on inside of his characters. In many of his books, I have endured, speed read or skipped the monsters, just to get back to reading more about the characters. I own several that I will never finish because the monsters played too big a part. To my delight, there are no monsters here, just King at his best."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have been an avid Stephen King reader since my freshman year in high school. I got a C in Freshman english (so don't ask me to diagram a sentence) thanks to reading &quot;The Stand&quot; in class. I would forage the library for books similar in style and substance to Kings. I think I checked out and read &quot;The Long Walk&quot; 4 times during high school, if not more. I always had a sneaking suspicion it was by Stephen King since the style of writing was so close.This book as always stuck in my mind. EVERY time I go to the gym and walk on the treadmill I envision the 4 mph minimum speed for the walkers. I try to imagine myself walking that fast for so long.When the truth finally came out and the Bachman books were released I bought myself a copy and have read them several times. The Long Walk remains my favorite of the bunch. To me it is nostalgic but if you like King's work you should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I first read &quot;The Long Walk&quot; a few months ago, and I am still thinking about it. It's the kind of story that works its way inside your mind and stays there. The story is gripping, impossible to put down, even though for 99 out of 100 Walkers, the end is clear. The prose is very accurate and descriptive. King describes horrifying scenes without sinking into over-the-top gore for its own sake. The backbone of the story is not horror, but the connections forged between the doomed teenagers. What is truly frightening about The Long Walk is that it is not fiction, but a look at our own future. This is not a sci-fi thriller set in some fantastic future five thousand years from now. With the huge sucess of reality TV shows like &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Temptation Island&quot;, The Long Walk is breathing down our necks. Like &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; strikes a chord of truth, and gives us warning of what may come. &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is too important to be dismissed as just another horror novel. I think everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"BE ADVISED: DO NOT read the forward written by Stephen King until after you have finished the book THE RUNNING MAN. King gives away the ending to The Running Man in the forward. Unless you like spoilers DO NOT READ THE FORWARD! BE ADVISED!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm a spread out book reader, reading any kind of genre. If there was ever a book that I would label as the most impacting it would be this one. This story could possibly be the most depressing ever created by King. It's set in a distant future where a supporting society sends 100 of their most athletic children out in a gruesome contest. In this contest these young children have to continue to walk at a steady pace until the rest of the group slows down to the point where the soldiers monitoring them kill them. In a two sentence synopsis it sounds so sick and horrible, but dragged out to create a book it creates a sense of dred that the characters inside would feel. You feel like you are walking with them, with the knowledge that you know all but one of them will be filling the page by the end. It is the most engrossing novel ever. I wanted to read it all in one sitting, and ended up reading it in two days. If you want a novel that you will never forget, this is most certainly the novel for you. It makes you think if our society will ever get to it's point and will fill your sleepless nights with thoughts for months after finishing it. Beautiful storytelling."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read Stephen King for the last 16 years or so and am an avid fan of his work. All are pretty good, many are great. 'The Long Walk' is one of the greatest of the great.I have read this story three times over the last decade and a half and have gotten more out of the story each time. This story simply gives a lot and keeps on giving.The characters are unforgettable. Ray Garraty and Pete McVries form a bond that is so strong they are willing to risk &quot;the Prize&quot; and their lives for one another. Interestingly, at the time this bond becomes the strongest, the two have only known each other for about two days. This is only one example of how this terrible contest forges relationships between its many participants.The storyline, while simple, and at times existing only in the minds of the various Walkers, keeps you enthralled and you will find yourself unable to put the book down until the end. You never know what will happen next or who will be the next walker to be eliminated from the contest.As a long distance runner I often think about this story while on long runs. While not exactly the same, the real horror hits home when I think about not being able to stop or slow down and the price to pay if you do.The ending of the book is a little fast and abrupt but is very disturbing, particularly the last line.Overall this is one of the first King books (written as Bachman) that I have ever read and over the years I find myself going back to it again and again. It is a short read and an excellent story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"If asked what my favorite Stephen King novel is I automatically answer &quot;It.&quot; But in order to include the other King work that I consider my favorite, I always say that &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is my favorite novella of SK's. True enough.I first read &quot;The Long Walk&quot; as part of &quot;The Bachman Books&quot; and it impressed me even then. I recently picked up a copy of the novella in a single volume; I was thrilled to discover this version.I tend to re-read many of SK's works over and over and &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is definitely one I never tire of.I seem to get something new out of the story every time I read it.The main characters are very real. My favorite is McVries. And their fates are heart-wrenching.You all know the story of the Long Walk by now. Several reviewers have tried to instill some sort of deep significance and underlying meaning into the tale (the day-to-day &quot;rat-race&quot; that is the work place; sending our boys to Vietnam; the march to the Nazi death camps). And although I can honestly see some of each scenario in the story, I really don't think King is using this novella as a metaphor for anything. Which is not to say that King isn't &quot;deep&quot; within his literature. I just think he leaves the &quot;politics&quot; of writing to others and concentrates on STORY-telling.Remember what writer Bill Denbrough said in &quot;IT:&quot; &quot;Why can't a story, just be a story?&quot;Enough said.As for the ending, it did not disappoint me the first time I read it nor does it now. But I will admit that I've had to do a lot of thinking about the last couple of pages to form an opinion of what I believe happens.The dark figure whom Garrity runs towards at the end can only be the Grim Reaper himself. Death appears to be waiting for Ray at the end of his agonizing Long Walk.They say that hell is repetition. I only hope that heaven is Garrity's final destination; and that his last journey will allow Ray Garrity to finally 'sit down in the middle of the road.'"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was my first Stephen King Novel and i have to say he definetly did not leave me disappointed. I would not recommend this book to readers you like closure to their readings. According to some readers, this book lacks the ending which i disagree with. If one just thinks about it, the ending makes perfect sense. There could not be any other ending. Overall the book was great, i couldnt put it down. I can honestly say that this was the first ever novel that i finished in two days. It's a must read. Everything the characters went through, I felt also. I felt like i was part of the long walk. It was only the matter of how long i could last. And I still question myself about it. After reading this, it will leave a reader satisfied."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"&quot;The Long Walk&quot; was a fantastic story about a young boy named Ray Garraty, one of one-hundred others selected to participate in this annual event. Garraty befriends another boy named Peter McVries and constantly analyzes a young boy named Stebbins, the quiet one of the walkers. Garraty and McVries also befriend several others during their participation in the Long Walk, which is probably one of the worst things to do in an event such as this.The reason for this, is because of the rules of the Long Walk. Once it begins, you must stay at a steady pace of four miles per hour or above. If you drop below that pace, you are issued a warning. If you can continue walking for an hour straight, that warning is removed. But if you should be unfortunate enough to recieve three warnings and then allow it to happen again, then you are issued what is called a &quot;ticket&quot; ... the result of which being three carbine rifles to take you out of the Walk.Through this story, Garraty must come to grips with the things that are really important in his life ... but with the hope of staying alive dwindling with each blast from the carbines, Garraty begins to wonder if he'll make it out alive to see those things again.The object of the Long Walk is to stay alive so that you can be the one to claim what is called &quot;the Prize&quot; ... and for those of you who weren't paying attention and that have read it, &quot;the Prize&quot; was to have anything you want, along with a large sum of money.But the point of The Long Walk, is not &quot;the Prize&quot;, however, the point is what is truly important in life ... and that no prize or sum of money could ever amount to the love and friendship of others. And to those of you who were expecting a better ending, I don't think that there could have been one. It just goes to show what happens to someone's mind when they must go through a traumatic event such as The Long Walk.All-in-all, I thought that this book was a very realistic interpretation of the trials one must go through when their life is on the line and the many reasons as to why events such as this should never take place. Another classic from Stephen King, to say the very least."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm a misanthrope. I guess that I was one of the 8 or 9 people who read this book when it came out as a pulp paperback in the late 1970's. I was so stunned, shocked, and horrified, by this book that I literally couldn't get anyone else to read it. My mind was so captured by the characters that I couldn't work without wondering &quot;where are they now?&quot; &quot;What is happening?&quot; I had to take off work to finish the book.Now here it is...20+ years later. I still remember when Thinner came out and the world discovered Stephen King was Richard Bachman. I had become a Stephen King fan and was very happy, elated, and suprized, that he authored a book that to this day invades my waking space and my nightmares.I'll be blunt. It's not the best written novel I've ever read, but it is the most gripping. Be careful, be honest, and beware, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is coming."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Originally released under King's alter-ego, Richard Bachman, THE LONG WALK is one of the most haunting and enduring novels that King has ever written. Apparently, King wrote the book when he was a freshman in college. He had attempted to get the book published, but after several rejection letters, gave up until he was able to release the novel under the Bachman name.Told from the perspective of \\"Maine's Own\\" Walker, Ray Garraty, the story is set in a fascist America not all that different from our own. Baseball is no longer the American pastime and has been surpassed by an annual event known as The Long Walk. Each year 100 young men are selected from thousands of applicants to participate in the Walk. The Walk is a walkathon where each Walker must maintain a walking speed of four-miles-per-hour. If they fall below that speed or commit any other infraction (such as leaving the route) they are given a warning. Each Walker is allowed three warnings. If a Walker maintains the required speed, he can walk off a warning after an hour from the time the warning was given. After three warnings and not walking any of the warnings off, a Walker is given a ticket. When you get ticketed, you aren't allowed a potty break, a chance to eat a snack, or to take a nap. When you are given your ticket, you are shot dead on the spot. Once you begin the Walk the only way to get out is if you get your ticket or outlast everyone else and win The Prize. And what exactly is The Prize? It's anything and everything you want for the rest of your life.THE LONG WALK is a brilliant novel that explores the depths of the human condition. Most of the Walkers have no idea what they have gotten themselves into once they begin the walk. It isn't until the first shot is fired that most of the walkers realize exactly what is going on: that they are walking towards their deaths. As the Walk progresses the Walkers learn a lifetime of knowledge about themselves, about each other, and about humanity. How should a person live? What makes life living for? How is it that a group of strangers can become closer than brothers in a few hours? Is life just a game or is it a journey? The novel illustrates that even those who have the best odds and the most to live for in life can be felled by the same diseases, illnesses, and temptations as everyone else. The novel also is full of social commentary, through the observations about the ever-present and ever-growing Crowd that surrounds the Walkers. How can people become so hardened that they cheer people on to get \\"ticketed\\" right before their eyes? This is just one of the issues that THE LONG WALK examines through the engaging tale it tells.The LONG WALK is easy to read and after the first few chapters of exposition and set-up becomes a page-turner. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and will read it again and again. I highly recommended it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I'm a young reader, but don't let that fool you; I have great tastes in books, and Stephen King is my favorite author of all time. I've got to say that this is the best book I've ever read by Stephen King. It's not a \\"monster-thriller,\\" but it's still creepy... Every year on the first of May, one hundred teenage boys gather at a road. Their mission? One must \\"outwalk\\" the other ninety-nine walkers. Whoever's left standing wins. However, consequences do apply... If you fall under speed, stop, walk off the road, or physically assault another walker more than three times, well... You buy your \\"ticket.\\" Even though the book is about a walk, King makes it so awesome that you will have a pretty tough time getting your eyes off this great book. I've finished it, and at the end it made me think, \\"Wow, that was a cool idea!\\" This is a COMPLETELY ORIGINAL STORY, only from the great mind of King himself. It may not be monster-scary, but it still delivers the disturbing lasting after-effect that every one of King's books gives to the reader. I encourage any reader who loves suspense to get this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book was very good. It kept you interested all the way to the end. Although the ending was a little weird (and could have been a little better) the book overall was excellent. I enjoyed it very much and I highly recommend it. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is horrible... horrible. and it was one of the best books I've ever read. I am stunned. I read it in 2 sittings... A few pages in I knew this book was special, I read it for 5 hours into the night, then forced myself stop. The Long Walk was the theme of my disturbed thoughts as I drifted in and out of confused sleep. A few times I woke up thinking \\"keep going\\" first and wondering where I was second. I can not say enough about it; it will consume my thoughts for days.Not much of a review, but then reading it has left me exhausted like I was there. King is a genius. Yet he is popular for all the wrong reasons. Amazing... I have some thinking to do. Don't read the reviews or the synopsis, just go directly to page one."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It's been over a year since I read The Long Walk and it still makes me think. By reading the plot, you'd think it would get boring but King always seems to have something for us. It reads like a really long short story and I believe it is that that I love the most. Its story is simple yet holds so much meaning. Some have said that it deals with mordern day athletics. I saw it as a take on the military.I was wanting to join the army before I read this. Though I still kind of want to, it made me think twice. The boys joined the walk for grandure and pride. Many young people join the military for the same reason. But, the truth is that in the long walk, you die. If you win you go crazy. Sounds a lot like going to War. What starts with pride and honor ends in blood and regret.The whole book was good. The end left me dissapointed a little. I believe I understood it when I read it but didn't really want to think that was it. Over time I realized I was right. There could only be one end to that story, its not one we want to see but somewhere you knew it was coming. Just like those boys. Anyway, the rest of the book was so great and well written that it is still my favorite King. I think it is better than The Shining. Well maybe not better. The Shining has so much more to it, but The Long Walk is still my very favorite. Its the kind of book I'll probably read over and over and then give it to my future son to read. I loved it, every page."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"That's all I can -- WOW. I've read everything by Stephen King, and this is one of only two stories that has ever given me nightmares. It's awesome -- just sit there and think for a minute about being in those boys' shoes. Can you even imagine? This is such an original tale, the perfect example of why I started to read the Master of Horror to begin with -- alas, I wish he still wrote stories like this."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Unlike most previous reviewers, I&#65533;m not a devoted fan of King. I remember reading something horrid by him many years ago and deciding that he was just a hack writer and not worth my time. But recently I found myself curious about King&#65533;s appeal so I picked up The Long Walk, not one of his more mainstream titles. And I&#65533;m impressed.Within the first few pages, King manages to setup an entirely surreal situation and he does this with little explanation up front. Instead, he feeds readers small pieces of information throughout the main body of the story. Of course, he kept the answers to many questions from the reader &#65533; when this story takes place, what drove society into such a state, etc. But perhaps that makes the story that much more interesting and riveting.Bottom line: I&#65533;ll go for any novel that really proves to be a mind-trip and this is one of them. This is a fabulous novel and has truly changed my opinion of King&#65533;s talent.Other great mind-trips: A Hard-Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World by Haruki Murakami, The Bridge by Iain Banks and Marabou Stork Nightmares by Irvine Welsh."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The long walk is a prime example of why so many people read Stephen King. It is the everyday made macabre. Since I was 13yrs old, and picked up a copy of The Skeleton Crew I have been hooked. It is fair to say that I love it all, but I am not so biased to say that all of his books have been masterpieces, because that would be untrue. However, having said that, this story is, quite frankly, incredible. The momentum throughout the story builds so unassumingly that you are halfway through and realize that you can feel the soles of your feet ache and the emotional panic that the main character slowly begins to feel. Only Stephen King could write page after page describing a walk and have you squirming in your own skin."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read a lot of books in my time. Horrors, mysteries, fantasies, you name it. I've read long books and short books. I've read classics and the latest thing. When it comes to the last page of a book, I thought I had experienced it all. But that was before I read &quot;The Long Walk.&quot; When I finished it I felt a sensation I had never had before at the end of a story: exhaustion. I was TIRED! Though I had not walked one single step, my feet were sore. I was hungry, thirsty, aching, and worn out. That is what King's story will do to you if you wisely choose to read it. You will walk every step with these young kids, go with them through their trials and fears. The miles will pass for you, too, as you see them die and fall to the wayside. For days after I read it I couldn't walk anywhere without wondering what it would be like to never stop, to walk all day and all night. It makes having to park a few extra slots away from the store seem not that bad. Get this book. Experience it for yourself. You won't regret it. This isn't just a story. It is an event. The gameshow Survivor has NOTHING on this contest."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"After reading it I really had to question Stephen King's sanity. A great book nontheless, and I'm surprised it was never made into a movie.Everything's already been said about the plot, so I won't even bother. Instead I'll just say what I liked and disliked.First of all, Stephen King's writing style is all his own. It's so descriptive and intelligent. You actually understand what's going on. The characters have a basis in real life. They aren't just far-out works of unbelievable fiction. The story itself is intriquing, it tells us about the capabilities of the human body, not to mention the human psychee. Wow, I don't think I put it down until I was done.The only thing I didn't like was the ending, but I guess that's part of Stephen King's style. He won't tell you everything, and you have to guess what's really happening at the end by yourself. Some like that, I really don't care for it.Still one of his better books in my opinion and I've read a lot of him. I loved this book to death, and I'd recommend it to anyone in an instant."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Before reading a book I have these pre-conceived ideas about who the author is and where the book is going to go. Richard Bachman/Stephen King has spooked me in to figuring out this whole king/bachman thing he has goin...but The Long Walk was a book that slapped me in the face over and over again and loved it every time, a book that gets you to pinpointing reality and make believe. Dare I say, Dead Poets Society meets The Running Man? A story of young boys with the pressures of humiliation, family, peers, and survival, but to see the evolution of which one is most important is the gripper.A book I carried around with me at all times while traveling, you can read and read and still be intrigued....A book that is a must read and a must re-read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is a very disappointing work from the master of horror. The characterizations of the main and supporting characters were mundane. The ordeal they were going through never hit it with regards in making the reader feel the pain and exhaustion one should feel in a story like this. Everything, every event, every graphically described death was predicable - even the ending. A big \\"fail\\" for an author who wrote so many amazing books - this one falls so short of anything else Mr. King has written."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Normally, I love King's books. But The Long Walk is not one of them. When I was about 30, I realized that I did NOT have to finish every book I started. It is the author's job to keep me interested enough to keep on reading. Sadly, Mr. King did not keep me interested enough in this book to keep on reading."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"My husband is a fan of Stephen King, he has an entire collection, so I started reading this book... personally, I like to know why things happen so I can be interested. I figured I would eventually find out while I was reading, but it kept dragging over and over about the same thing that had no reason to happen at all. I kept waiting and expecting for it to get better, but it was just more of the same. The kids on the book are just walking and getting killed for no reason, yet they sign up for it and are very excited about it... ???? So I just kept wondering why everyone in the book was so dumb, and continued reading. The book has good ideas, and of course I think it is a predecessor to The Hunger Games, but this \\"story\\" is very disappointing. It just narrates people walking and getting killed. I continued reading anyway, then started skipping pages, until I gave up and asked my husband to tell me about the ending (because I skipped to the end and the book just stops). So he explained that THAT was the whole idea, to keep you wondering. Oooooh God I'm so glad I didn't continue reading until the end. It was such a waste of time! So to summarize this, the book is pointless, boring, dumb and a waste of time. He should've never released this book without trying to make some sense of it all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I received timely notification that my item was shipped, but I never received the item. After two inquiries, my purchase price was refunded."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"By the time I finally got to the finish line, I felt like I just took the long walk myself. The story was drawn out and bland. I know this is obviously not the popular opinion here, but this was not one of my favorites. I couldn't wait to just be done with it."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am a huge Stephen King fan, but I only got about one third of the way into this book. Once I realized the kids were all going to get shot dead (one by one, in the road, like dogs), the book kind of lost all appeal for me. I just couldn't get past the premise, knowing they were pretty much all going to die. The whole thing seemed ludicrous, that mothers would let their kids basically commit suicide or play some kind of slim-chances Russian Roulette. This book is really disturbing, even for SK (Bachman). There are only a few of SK's books I haven't been able to finish, this probably tops them all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I consider myself one of King's Constant Readers, but, I had no time for the likes of The Long Walk. The premise alone was ridiculous so maybe that is why this whole story did not appeal to me. This story is not worthy of King's name. ( He wrote this novel under the pseudonym Richard Bachman.) I read about one half of the book then simply skipped pages to the end. This is what I do when one of my favorite authors writes what I consider a \\"dud\\". Of course it will remain as part of my collection but he has written many, many better novels."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book was terrible. It was hard to follow and was never fully explained. Save your money and get something else."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I did not like this at all, If you read the first and last chapter you have all the story"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I typically enjoy Stephen King novels, but this was pathetic. A painful read. Slow, tedious, boring. About half way through I only read one or two lines per page and that was sufficient. I would not buy this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The book would have been much better with a bit more character development and a better ending. I never felt vested in any of the characters, and I wasn't sad to see them shot. The whole book was a long walk for me - just there and reading it for the sake of it. I had hoped for a great twist in the ending, but like my walks around the block, it just ended. There as nothing clever or scary about this book. For a King book, it was a big disappointment, and I'm sorry I payed almost 8 bucks for the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"this is the best book ive ever read. im 10 years old and loved this book. the ending stank but the whole book rocked"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is full of suspense. I honestly didn't think I would enjoy a book about 100 boys walking themselves to death, but before I knew it, I was enthralled.I've now read 2 of the Bachman Books. I've enjoyed each one immensely. The book is not a difficult read. Not overly wordy compared to some of King's works.I'd reccommend this to anyone who enjoys a good read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It really make you think about what a world that would be to send your kid to his own death, for a prize, would it be that honorable? When i read this book,I woundered could human being at this time think about doing that to there own child for a quick rich sceme? I took a long walk my self, I thought to my self it would be the most unbearble punishment of a life time, sometimes is wounder if they would put this to a law in this time, sending convict for a walk, kind of a march to your own death or a new form of terrorist punishment, hmmmmmmm. Well any ways, this is an excellent book, I was in awe, if any one out there deside to take a good long walk, read this book, it will make you think diffrently about that walk."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one of my top five books of all time. I am not a big Stephen King fan but I love this book. It is a brilliant read. For me it shows how someone can overcome the odds and achieve anything they put their mind too.It's not about being the strongest or being the fastest, being the fittest or being the healthiest. It's about being a good person. Having a good attitude. Ray Geraghty is a brilliant character and the character development in this story is amazing. You get to know all of the other boys doing the walk. It is all very real and you feel you are there with Ray every step of the way.This is a an amazing classic that achieves what so many authors try to achieve. You empathize with the characters and even though its fiction that is very unlikely, while you are reading you feel like the story is real.So even if you are not a fan of fiction or of horror or of Stephen King, read this book you will love it!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The best King book I have read. Actually it's the only good one I have read. As usual he ruins another book by a terrible ending. A great read though. Would have been a five star book except he quit when it came to the ending. Make up your own ending and enjoy this read. Another problem I have is, why couldn't we have some politicians on this walk...lol...."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have long been a fan of Stephen King, and because of that I have been able to gather the energy to get through the Bachman books. This was a decent tale filled with different motivations. I felt the concept was a bit lame, so it was difficult to keep it interesting. Although the character building was not what we are used to from King, he manages to do what he does best and keeps us in suspense, right till the very end."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am a big stephen king fan because I love horror stories and anything that can give me a scare, and nothing does that more than my own imagination. This book is well written, but doesnt have all the adjectives and fear that King usually incorporates in his work. It reads well and is interesting but he has other books that are definately better."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"In the begining you are interested in it but and by the middle you are asking questions. At the end of the book the questions aren't answered and the most likely thing happens. It seems that the Author had to finish it quickly. I was still expecting another chapter."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I was never a big fan of Stephen King, in fact, the only thing that brought this book to my attention was a co-workers high-praises. But to be honest, I enjoyed the read. After I'm finished reading a book, I come here to amazon.com and read the reviews to see if I agree with the other readers. And most of the time I am. But after reading some of the &quot;customer reviews&quot; of The Long Walk, I find that no one really read the book the way that I did. To make a long story short, I found that this was Stephen King's view on how we conduct ourselves as a society TODAY- not in the future. The long walk can be seen as the &quot;rat-race&quot; of our daily lives. I think that King was commenting on man's workplace. Think about it: To get ahead in life, you have to work that much harder than the person next to you. You can't have any &quot;compassion&quot; in the workplace or you'll never get far. I believe this is what King's trying to relay. That the way in today's society to be successful is based on out-living your competition. And when you finally reach the top, you have to CONTINUE or you'll never get another raise, never get another pat on the back, and never feel confident about yourself. Even though Bill Gates is the richest man in the world, has he given himself a break? Has he realized he's finished the race and he can now sit down, rest his feet and say &quot;I've won!&quot;. No, he's chasing the shadow figure that he can't seem to catch. I may be wrong, but the ending he wrote was the only ending there is. It's man's way. I offer a simple question: How many people have you out-&quot;walked&quot; to get where you are today?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am sorry that I bought this book. As I read it, I looked forward to the end. The story dragged like the plot."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is one of those books you look at and you say to yourself, this might be good. Then you realize within the first few pages that you've made a lot of mistakes in your life and if you were honest with yourself, you would never listen to your own advice.The problem with this book, other than the fact that it was written by Steven King, is that the plot is so implausible that you laugh at the absurdity. I was waiting to see what mental asylum these teens broke out of to join a competition in which there is a 99 percent chance you die. Perhaps this was Steven Kings way of saying \\"I can put my name on anything and it will sell because my name is Steven F-ing King.\\" He then proves how gullible the public is by writing a book about walking. Wow. It made me want to crawl for a week in protest."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"After seeing the rating I was really excited about the book, It's one of the first novels of my favorite author, and sadly it shows. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great novel, but SK went a long way in developing his narrative thru his career. The characters are very cleverly tough, but lack the usual deepness of characters in other books, also I didn't get the usual imagery of other SK books. Probably it's a book that will communicate more with teens.Still it gives you a different perspective on SK, actually this was originally published using a pseudonym"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was one of the saddest books that I have read in a long time. Young boys are selected to walk, and walk and walk. They cannot stop for anything. I did not enjoy this book at all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is a classic from the Bachman books, and a story that sticks in the psyche for many years. This clearly dated novel is the pre-amble to the Hunger Games, and I feel is far more horrifying. When transferred from the book to Kindle it is filled with far too many type O's and some of the words are separated with hyphens to enunciate syllables (Garr-aty). After a while I have to figure out what is being said because of the large amount of mispelled words. That's irritating. Buy the book used for a reduced price if you would like to read it the way it's supposed to be written."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I love Stephen King Books. I have most of them in CD audio version. The Long Walk, was a journey where the main theme was how many possible stumbling blocks can you throw at a story that should have taken much less time to tell. With a predictable ending, I could see the ending coming from a mile off. In my view a good book but not worth a purchase, a loan from the library would be much better."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"this book was received within the suggested time frame and in the condition advertised. I'm very pleased with my purchase. It was worth the price sent."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Stephen King wrote as Richard Bachman when he created THE LONG WALK, which here appears in audio with his own name the highlight. Kirby Heyborne, a musician and professional narrator, brings to life a vivid story of a hundred teen boys who meet for an annual 'Long Walk', only to find there can be only one winner in this event: the one who survives."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Having grown up without the allowance of Stephen King within my household, I have only recently discovered the sheer genius of his writing. This one, written as an alter ego by the name of Richard Bachman (in the edition I read, there is an intro by King explaining this), strikes me as brilliant.First, the way that King creates his character profiles ever so slowly, with foreshadowing of what is to come of each of them based on their personality but never revealing everything at once, is the perfect way to intrigue a reader and draw him or her into the story from the beginning.King himself admits to having a dark side that he often represses when writing because in real life, so many things do have happy endings, and he wants his work to reflect real life. In reading this novel, which goes on and on at such a pace that you can't stand the thought of putting it down, you can see that happy ending from the very beginning.The Long Walk can have only one winner, and since the story is told through the eyes of Ray, a single individual, you know who is going to win from the first, despite a couple of really good scares when you think you are wrong.But remember, this isn't a King novel, it's a Bachman novel, and Bachman throws in a strange and incomprehensible surprise at the end. Well written as a King novel with the twist of a more morbid alter ego, The Long Walk is gripping and delightfully fear inspiring, and by far my favorite King read yet."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk I would guess is either one of those books you love or dislike. I read this sucker and still have this book. Depressing at times and eerie at others, its one of those books that I can say I won't forget. I read it and liked it, though the ending is different from what I had expected I guess. I'd say try it out and see how it flies so to speak."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I usually love Mr. King's stories, but this one bored me to tears. I am always one who finishes a book no matter how good or bad it is, but I deleted this one from my Kindle when I was half way through just so I didn't have to torture myself."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Longest book ever!!! Should have known by the title. After the first 100 pages I skipped to the end and still didn't miss anything."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Not one thing in this book goes right. From the beginning to the end, it is slow, boring, and uninspired, NOT recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The only notable quality of this whole novella was the excellent, captivating and gripping ending. The rest of the book was simple, predictable and frustrating. I gave it a star for the ending alone. Just read the last 4 pages and all will be clear!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is very formalaic and predictable. It's obvious that the first-person narrator is going to survive, so there is really no suspense. The reader simply plods along with the walkers, waiting for the next one to die. The narrator's emotional defeat, despite having won the walk, was predictable. It was like \\"so what?\\" This was not Stephen King, or Richard Bachman if you will, at his best."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have enjoyed King's books until this one. The ending was disappointing. The entire novel you are wondering what the winner will receive and are never told."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I purchased this book because I generally like Stephen King novels most of the time. I was swayed by all of the 5 star reviews & the &#34;its one of Kings best...you have to read this...you won't be disappointed&#34; comments. Boy; I sure was fooled! The Long Walk was one of the WORST books I have ever read. It did not even make sense. Maybe there is some kind of deep symbolism at play that just went over my head? 100 boys go for a walk & get shot if they walk too slowly. They fart...talk about sex...eat tubes of concentrated food...watch crowds who gather on the roadside wave at them...crap in the road while the crowd watches them. Its this over and over again. Save your time & money."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Okay read, it could have been about one hundred pages shorter if King had left out the zillions of times the Lord's name was taken in vain. At least he didn't insert his proabortion leftwing politics like he did in his book. Insomnia."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The worst book I ever read, so boring!! The boy's walk, they slow down, they get shot!! End of story, so sorry I spent money on this book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is a very tedious and stupid story about a bunch of losers who go on a long walk. If they don't walk fast enough then they get shot!!! Isn't that a wonderful story idea and that is about all there is to say about this highly overrated \\"one note song\\". I give this book 5 stars because when it was published under the Bachman name nobody bought it and when it was published under King's name it almost became a bestseller. King would have made an excellent \\"Marketing Executive\\"."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"For those true Stephen King collectors. This book grabs you from the beginning and will not let you go till the end. I found it one of the best and know you will too. I hated for it to end."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I loved this book. I couldn't stop thinking about it when I wasn't reading it, and when I was reading, I couldn't stop! The characters were so well developed and so human that I wanted to see several of them win the walk, not just one. I hated to see some of my favorite characters get their ticket. The only complaint I had with this story, like many others, was the ending. I wanted a more complete conclusion. I may just be the kind of person that requires closure, but I really wanted a more detailed description of the end of the walk, since I had invested so much time and emotions in reading about walk itself.Definitely a great book though. Emotionally draining and very addictive!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It was a wonderfully captivating story, scary in its idea, and frightfully haunting. I remember reading this story feverishly day and night, totally enchanted, thinking about it every moment. I was even subconsciously &quot;walking&quot; and &quot;talking&quot; to Ray and them in my sleep (well, not outloud, but thinking it). It's simply great...yeah...*BUT* I totally detested the ending. That's why I gave it a four-star. I don't know if it's my problem or not, but I just hated that kinda ending, ever since when dinos roamed the earth. However, it's still a highly recommanded read."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"As a high school English teacher, I often find myself giving up on books because they are not a &quot;classic.&quot; However, King develops a mood in The Long Walk that does not allow you to leave. Just like the boys who start the walk, there is no turning around for you. The story urges you to turn the page and it grabs and holds your attention with its intricate details of the 3 plus day journey to the end that no one could ever comprehend. The end...that is where the question marks lie. I was a little disappointed with the way King ended the story. He did such a fantastic job developing the characters, their relationships and the plot, that I felt a little cheated that the ending could not provide a little more closure. It is definitely open for interpretation, but the lack of details of the much anticipated &quot;end of the walk&quot; leaves the reader feeling like a starving tiger left alone in the wild with nothing to sink its teeth into. The story will definitely satiate your thirst for a fast-moving adventure that illustrates and parallels our violence-thirsty society."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is an old book that Stephen King wrote under his pseudonym of Richard Bachman. It encircles a few days in the life of Richard Garrarty, when he is on a &quot;Long Walk&quot; with 99 other teenagers. They all walk until the last man is down, and the winner gets &quot;the Prize,&quot; which is something that is really good, I suppose.A walker gets three warnings, a warning being issued every time they fall under four miles per hour. If they fall, or sit down, they get a warning. Each hour that passes, they lose a warning. After three warnings, a &quot;ticket&quot; is issued, where the soldiers on a half-track shoot the walker to death with their carbines.Consequently, Garraty wants to win. He befriends Peter McVries, another walker, and analyzes the behavior of Stebbins, a kid who never talks, and especially never acknowledges the Major, the chairman of the event. Later in the story, Stebbins reveals his plan and it is discovered that he is the Major's son and wants revenge for something that happened a long time ago.It takes several days of pure punishment for the walkers to wear each other down. Garraty is the last one standing, and he wins the Prize, but he concludes that there isn't any importance in it anyhow.The Long Walk is somewhat like J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; where the teen protaganist rambles within his thoughts, but it is a bit more tame in that. It is a chilling story, based on death marches that the Nazis put Jews through during the Holocaust. Do not read this book by yourself!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book wasn't that interesting but somehow I just kept reading it. I think it was wondering what this race was all about that wouldn't let me put the book down. Although the ending was disapointing.

Altogether it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book wasn't that interesting but somehow I just kept reading it.

I'd reccomend this book to almost anyone who loves horror stories."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Is it too much to ask for an ending? I read the whole book very quickly and was left feeling robbed at the end. This was the first time I had taken a chance on Stephen King for a while and this has not got me running out to buy another."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"ON BACHMAN:Stephen King did not write this book, Richard Bachman did. What I mean by this is that Stephen King didn't just throw on a different name and call it good; he actually wrote in such a way that is different that how he writes in almost every way. There elements that remain the same, sure, such as character swearing. But, you gotta remember, up until this point, Stephen King had only released Carrie, 'salem's Lot, The Shining, Night Shift, The Stand . . . and then this book, with no supernatural elements--no wonder he had people fooled (at least from the start of Bachman's career).PREMISE:One hundred kids from around a near future United States volunteer in a walk-a-thon until only one kid stands. If any of the walkers go under four miles per hour, they get warned; if they get warned three times, they get \\"the ticket.\\" What do you think the ticket it? Well, it isn't good. The ticket is what Robert Downey Jr.'s character sold in Tropic Thunder: a bullet. And to the head, of course. The last young boy still walking gets the PRIZE. The premise is as simple as that.ANALOGY OF WAR:Why would young boys volunteer to walk in such a death race that they would likely die? Honestly, I don't know, but Stephen King was trying to make an analogy between the kids volunteering for the Long Walk (for their country) and going the service and going to war (for their country). Of course it is an antiwar message--and maybe Vietnam was the main vein that King drawing his creative juices from, because Vietnam was quite pointless--or so he believes (and so do I).Essentially it draws similarities between how when soldiers first enlist, they're eager and ready to go, ready to take care of business, ready to go in guns a-blazing; or maybe they thought it was just going be an easy walk on the beach and when they were done, their school would be paid for. And then, when they get summoned for war or a battle or their unit gets attacked, they probably had the same feelings that the Long Walkers did . . . why did I volunteer?But don't get me wrong, it's not so thick in this political analogy that it cannot be enjoyed if you don't share the same political point of view, because, in the end, this is a book a entertainment and horror and it's never preachy. But, where it's not trying to be preachy, it cannot help but be a sermon.The sermon is this: why are you doing this potentially deadly thing? Just why . . . that's all it asks.HOW IT COMPARES:I've been recommended the heck out of this book (along with Battle Royale) with the people who've liked The Hunger Games, but a lot of those \\"young people\\" are addicted to the flavor of the month fads and won't take a risk with an older, more established writer, either because he's too popular, or too old. But, as someone who has read The Hunger Games, The Long Walk is the better book because it's better written and it never tries to suck up to the reader and he's not afraid to piss off the reader.And it's because of this: Richard Bachman is not such a nice guy."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I am currently reading Stephen King's memoir \\"On Writing\\". In it he describes \\"The Long Walk\\" as probably the best of his early books. He is absolutely correct.This book gives just another example of what he is able to do with character development. He doesn't use them as simple plot tools, but creates actual people that we develop a relationship with while reading their story.In this book the main characters are a group of young men who have entered a contest that sounds ridiculously heinous to us, but has become the norm to them. (the story is unofficially set in a future and place not too far from where we now live)When I first heard the premise of this book I was immediately interested. The author did not fail to exceed the expectations of this \\"constant reader\\". Whether you are a Stephen King fan or not I would recommend this book to you. It's brief, to the point, and extremely good."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I think King's greatest gift as a writer is that he often comes across as a good buddy telling you a wild story. The Long Walk is a perfect example of this. He excels at the detail level of character carmaraderie which pulls you into the story regardless of where it is headed. Here, it seems pretty clear, but we still don't want to stop listening."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have loved this book eversince I discovered it several years ago! I continue to read it over and over. I always thought that this would also be a GREAT MOVIE! I would reccommend this book to anyone its a great book!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Not even done with this book yet and I love it!! I got into the characters a lot more than I thought I would, and almost care about them like I know them. Its very different from his normal horror stories but has so much symbolism about life and death, and makes you think constantly about how you would react in the same situation. I wish it was a longer book just because I love the characters. But you have to read it!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is all about thoughts. The thoughts that would go through your mind if you were walking with 100 kids trying to be the last one standing so that you won't get shot. The concept itself is absurd, but it still holds possibility in our messed up world where Ultimate Fighting is becoming a huge sport. This book will stick in your mind for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This story definitely messed with my head...you can practically FEEL the pain of the walkers through Bachman's writing. Once I finished this short fast paced story, I felt more f---ed up than ever. Raw, Intense, psychological thriller. No beating around the bush here. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk was an interesting book, with Stephen King's usual keen insight into the minds and motivations of teenaged boys. The story was fascinating and disturbing, with plenty of surprises. While not his best work, I recommend it if you're a King fan."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is second Stephen King novel I've read and it confirms my original conviction that he is an excellent writer. Set in near-future America the book follows a sixteen year old who signs up for the biggest sporting event of the time: the Long Walk. A walking competition where the last man standing wins and if you slow down for too long you buy yourself a 'ticket' out of not only the walk but also out of exsistence. As the teenage boys begin their greuling trek across the state of Maine frienships are formed, stories are exchanged and mind and body are put to the ultimate test.The idea for the plot I thought was brilliant and only Stephen King could tell the tale. Except I don't really know King enough (having only read one of his other books) to feel qualified to say that. However if all King's novels are all like these first two I've read than the man is an absolute genius. Only this story idea could come from a genius.I love the way he keeps the plot moving and still has time to paint a sharp mental picture for the reader. His characters act with incredible realism and he shows the walkers slow descent into hysteria with a kind of terrible beauty. He also gives the gore in his stories a gut wrenching quality and whether you want to or not you are forced to see the repulsive majesty of the scene he is describing. Chills run up my spine when I think what one of his more ghoulish tales (the other King book I've read being the Green Mile) with a lot more blood must be like. 'The Long Walk' has its moment but for those weak of heart and stomach (like myself) rejoice, this book is not scary or incredibly gruesome. It may leave you feeling slightly disturbed but not horror struck.I had only one problem with the book: the ending. The conclusion was kind of clipped. It felt like King had forgotten to finish the book until the morning before it was due be to published and in a mad scramble he had to rush the last bit. The rest of the book was so thorough and detailed but the last part was too adbrupt for my liking. I think this may have been a deliberate attempt by the author to make the writing change as the main character slowly lost his mind, however I still don't like it.Besides that not much is wrong with the book. It is a constant page turner and is not a very complicated read making this a thouroughly enjoyable novel. It has finished the work the Green Mile began and turned me into a loyal fan of King."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"\\"The Long Walk\\" is one of the Richard Bachman novels that has a clear distinction from the rest of Stephen King's body of work. Like \\"The Running Man,\\" it is essentially a dystopian novel, which is extremely rare in King's fiction because his greatest strength as a horror writer has always been that he could take the fantastic and put it in the world of the commonplace. King's horrors are always around the corner or in the near future (each edition of \\"The Stand\\" is revised towards just that end) and they usually happen to relatively normal persons. But even though \\"The Long Walk\\" takes place in some sort of fascist America, this not a warning in the tradition of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" or \\"The Handmaid's Tale.\\" It is simple the world that King needed to construct in order to tell his story.The Long Walk takes place each year and only 100 applicants, selected from around the country, are allowed to participate. The prize, which speaks to the nature of the world in which it takes place, is everything you want for the rest of your life. Evita did something similar to this to distract the people of Argentina from the fact the thievery of the Perons, but there is a key difference in that she just granted wishes at her whim while the Long Walk consists of a competition. The basic rule is simple: whoever walks the farthest wins. The conditions of the competition are what makes this a horror story: the participants must walk four miles an hour and not stop. Failing to do so results in a warning. Three warnings and you are shot.The story works because who has not had to keep on walking when they wanted to stop, sit down, and rest? The difference is that nobody is going to put a bullet in our head when we do so. But for Ray Garrity and the other Long Walkers that is going to happen to every single one of them save the winner. The reasons why these young men would spend their lives on such a desperate gamble are second to the Long Walk itself. In the end the story turns out to be vintage King, where he displays the horrors of the journey and milks it for everything it is worth.I will end with my strongest recommendation that you read \\"The Long Walk\\" in a single sitting. Ray and the others do not have a respite during their walk and I really think you lose something essential to the experience otherwise and the book is closer to a novella than an epic novel."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I've read everything published by Stephen King, and this story is by far my favorite. What makes this my favorite story is how the tension of life vs. death is constant, (stop walking and you die) so you don't want to stop reading, because you have to know which of the likeable and unlikable characters avoids the ever watching guards, and which ones tire and pay the ultimate price. The story is a metaphor for life, in that life also is like a long road you must keep walking on, or die. Also, \`The Long Walk' is not as 'over the top' in unreal horror as SK's usual."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Very different, but isn't Stephen king usually pretty different. It was one of those books you just want to keep reading to find out what happens at the end."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read this short story over and over again! Whenever I find out a friend has never read Stephen King I always tell them to check out this story to get a taste of what he has to offer. So far they have all become big fans of his books."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is my favorite Stephen King book, but I think it's because I imagined contests like this one when I was a kid. I've read it several times."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The setting is all American, New England with cheering spectators and hormone heavy competitors. The scene looks normal yet the game is a suicide ride with a winner takes all and losers are shot. Instead of a background of desperation or self-destructive depression, the boys carry on with conersations of everyday life. Their coversations gradually merge with similar vulger wit (smart kids talking dirty) that seems far from character of willing participants locked in an irrational game. Parental intervention is mysteriously passive as the kids are dropped off to their likely deaths like a scene of suburban summercamp. This is clearly the product of a young writer who casually suspends disbelief perhaps morbidly thinking that assisted suicide for teenagers would serve as a simple convenience."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I have read most of the author's books, and just finished reading (for the first time) The Long Walk. Stephen King is such an extraordinary writer. He's not called the King for nothing.Those awards are well-deserved. The reader is with the narrator Garrity throughout that book,walking alongside him, feeling the terror, the pain, the despair and thegrim determination that keeps him putting one foot in front of the other.This is a true horror story but the monsters are just regular people. Areally quite unbelievable premise when you look on the face of it, (sortof akin to Shirley Jackson's The Lottery) but it is his attention to detailthat makes The Long Walk a great book, instead of just a good one. King'scharacterization, description, his sensory details are pure genius. Heinhabits the character's skin and never falters. A gripping page turner."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Fascinating story and this story itself is going to make me buy the rest of King's/Bachman's stories to read.My only complaint? Like too many Kindle converted stories, it is breaking wor ds left and right and it's distracting."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Of all of the Stephen King novels that I have read, I have to confess that I found The Long Walk to be the most psychologically horrifying. While it is true that the majority of King's body of work has deeply psychological elements (whether exploring multiple personalities or the horror of dealing with poverty in dystopian realities), this book hit home like a punch in the gut. Anyone who has ever suffered will be able to relate to this book in some way or another.The story has been told numerous times in other reviews here, and of course there are hints given on the back of the book. 100 boys are chosen from a pool of volunteers for The Walk, a contest in which only one boy can possibly win. The walk continues until there is only one Walker left.Throughout the story, King follows the perspective of Ray Garraty who, along with his small band of friends, struggles with his own emotions, his hopes, and his feelings of teenaged angst. We learn just enough about Garraty to keep us reading. We know that his father is dead, that he has a girlfriend who he is desperate to see during the Walk and that his mother is afraid of what will happen to him.The story of The Long Walk is the story of psychological, rather than physical, suffering. The first time I read this book I considered it dystopian, but I am now not sure that this genre placement is accurate. Instead of the story being sociological (wherein we see the depravity that often comes from poverty), we are dealing with the thought process that leads up to a boy submitting himself for The Walk.Each boy must endure a series of tests in order to qualify for the walk, and still only very few are chosen. Of those chosen, each has the choice to drop out before the deadline, and yet there are 100 boys at the starting line every year, risking everything for the walk.I don't want to say too much (not that too much hasn't been said in other reviews) because the book does hold some secrets. Anyone who suggests that the ending is predictable or that the entire story can be given in a review without giving it away is a fool. Read the book for yourself, and ask yourself: Would you submit yourself for The Long Walk?"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"It wasn't Stephen King and Richard BachmanIt is Stephen King AS Richard Bachmanthe \\"two\\" are one and the same"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"The Long Walk is a great book, my first GOOD Stephen King book.

The Long Walk is not just a perfectly written story, it's also a novel that combines terror, desire, humanity, goals, competition, survival, death, cruelty and so many wonderful characters, that is impossible not to identify with one of them. The story itself compels you to keep reading until the exhausting end, which is left open to our imagination and creativity. Still, it left me wanting to know more about certain things, but overall it's an extraordinary story. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I read reviews on this book and they described the horror of the story, etc. However, it's certainly not horror on the level of IT or some of King's other works.

The basic premise is really simple and really compelling, and Stephen King's writing is terrific as Richard Bachman.The ONLY real issue I had is that, given the pacing intrinsic to the storyline, the ending was a little abrupt and of nowhere for my taste. Not sure what I was expecting, but I was disappointed and felt that Stephen King just wasn't able to come up with anything as good as the story itself.But it's definitely worth a read, and the storyline sticks with you. I was inspired to take a two-hour walk of San Francisco just because of it!"},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Loved it...couldn't put it down....the ending could have had more of an impact.....left me wanting more.

This story is phenomenal. I had never heard of it, and stumbled upon it when looking for \\"just about anything\\" to download. I asked my King-expert friend if he had read it, and he hadn't. I am very glad that I did. The beginning of the book doesn't make much sense, King hints at things, and writes as if we already know what is happening. But he withholds the truth from us long enough to formulate a guess or two. I had my own \\"is (x) what's going on here?\\" thoughts, and then when (x) happened, I wished I had been wrong. There is something simply dark, and truly mesmerizing about this novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"In some weird dystopian future 100 teenage boys volunteer to walk a death march across America in search of the \\"Ultimate Prize\\" for the sole survivor - you see, if you can't walk anymore, you're shot. Thus begins an epic 200+ mile walk in which the endurance of the human body and spirit is pushed to its limits.King does a good job of keeping the story moving despite not much variation in what's happening over nearly 300 pages: they walk, someone falls, is shot, they walk, someone falls, is shot, etc, repeat. The cast of characters is built up and then brought down. We slowly see the characters start to crack up psychologically and then physically, then turn on one another. It's fascinating for a while.King also doesn't give much away about the world this takes place in - it's recogisable except there is talk of a \\"Change\\", of \\"Squads\\", and the mysterious \\"Major\\" who runs the annual (!) Long Walk. The Walk is spectator sport at its bloodiest.We are also kept guessing as to the reward for the winner - a prize is mentioned but walkers talk about how they just shoot the winner instead. The ending is masterfully written to keep the reader guessing as to what really happened.But even if this is one of King's shortest (by his standards), I still think the book was overlong. It's an interesting story that gets a bit long in the tooth due to the slow depletion of the 100 boys and could've been as effective at half the length.Despite the feeling that it dragged a bit for me, I was definitely impressed with the way King portrayed psychological disintegration so well, as well as the subtletly in which he kept the boys' motives for taking part in the race somewhat ambiguous (\\"volunteer\\" is a term used loosely as you find out - or is it? Are they all mad or not?). One of King's most interesting works and better than some of his more well known books, a definite book to check out if you're a fan or would like to read King without the supernatural horror he's famous for."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This is sort of science fiction, but not really. It is really psycho-horror. Its about an alternate socialist or communist or fascist america, where people march to their deaths in a contest. Very strange book, the horror is they are all young boys and they walk until they can't then they are shot or whatever. They walk to death, in a race of endurance. But there is not SF reason for this, or supernatural reason. Just a political one.The characters are all generally good. There are some things I had trouble getting over, such as the idea they didn't all start off terrified. I mean, if you know it is a march to the death, you should be terrified, they all start off too happy. Also, the whole point of the thing was somewhat shaky.This was one of his very first novels he wrote, I've heard his very first. So, from that angle, its quite good."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"the long walk isn't an end of the world story but it has that stark, captivating feel of a PA novel as well as a hint of nuclear war and a german-won WWII in the background. the concept alone is so horrific it makes this the most fearsome of all of king's work. the writing is also unusually spare. this book is difficult to put down. the clock is always ticking on our young hero. the long walk is short and sharply conceived."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"Don't think there is more to this story than what is mentioned in the title. The whole book focuses on the long walk a group of 100 teenagers take in New England. During this walk, there are plenty of character moments and insight into who these people are. I would have loved to have read more about the society where this walk would happen. This book is not as strong, in my opinion, as the other Bachman book I read (THE RUNNING MAN). There are plenty of good moments in this novel, but there are also more areas where I felt the story dragged. I will say that the Bachman persona is surely a dark writer. Both of these books have featured very bleak outlooks on our society. I know that King often writes about dark topics (PET SEMETARY being a perfect example), but these two books are very dark."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"I started reading this book when I was 12..I never finished it due to my short attention span, but when I picked it back up last year (I was 21) I saw what so many King fans had been talking about.

Some \\"friends\\" recommended that it was one of his best, so I thought I'd give it a try. Before this my only real exposure to the horror genre was reading Poe in high school. Overall I found this to be a good reading experience, though it was a little long and the end was disappointing.Every year, 100 teenage boys go through The Long Walk, a competition of endurance and survival. They start near the Canadian border in Maine (being a King book, where else would it start?) and go through New Hampshire, possibly into Massachusetts if anyone survives. The winner receives a Prize, wherein supposedly they receive everything they could ever want. The only drawback is that if you don't win, you die. Get three warnings in a row and you get executed.So the rules are simple: keep walking or die. There are no stops to use the bathroom or sleep or eat or get a foot massage. You walk all day and all night until you stop walking and die. It's sort of like the Tour de France then if the bikers had to keep riding 24 hours a day and the losers were all killed. The contest is broadcast on TV and is a huge thing in Vegas. Throngs of people show up on the sidelines to cheer on the Walkers, showing little concern even as the losers are shot on live TV. (A similar premise to another King story, \\"The Running Man.\\" With reality TV the way it is today, is such a thing really so implausible? I think not.)In the current year's competition is young Ray Garrarty, a local boy from a small town in Maine. His father was abducted years ago by \\"the Squads\\", some kind of fascist secret police. (The story takes place in an alternate history where either the US lost WWII or otherwise turned into a fascist state. It's not entirely clear what happened, but there is mention of Germans bombing the US east coast and a raid on a German nuclear plant in Santiago in the '50s.) Ray has since lived with his mother and has a girlfriend named Jan. But for whatever reason he signs up for the Long Walk along with 99 other boys from around the country. He bonds with some of them like the cynical McVries and the weirdly prophetic Stebbins even as they are ostensibly trying to kill each other. They face a variety of physical challenges like steep hills, cramps, and fever but the real challenge is the mental fatigue from pushing on while watching all the people around you drop and die. Can Ray make it to the end? And what then?I thought this book probably would have worked better as a short story or novella. At 370 pages it's a little too long. It sort of sets into this pattern of they walk for a while, someone gets shot, they talk to each other, some more people get shot. Yadda, yadda, yadda. What saves it though is the bonding between Ray, McVries, and the other characters as they become well-fleshed characters. You really do want to see who's going to make it and who isn't.The end was disappointing, ending with a whimper instead of a bang. After going so far, I was really hoping for something a little more epic when it gets down to the last handful of people, but instead King/Bachman wraps up the last stage in just a couple of pages. So it seems like a lot of buildup for little payoff.Still, it was a good book and makes me want to get my copy of \\"The Green Mile\\" off the shelf.That is all."},{"Title":"The Long Walk","review":"This book is about a contest in an alternate world where young boys start walking once a year, and basically whomever is left standing at the end is the winner. This details one specific contestant as he is about to begin his trek along with the other boys. It is a great read, a very easy book to pick up and finish, and the whole concept of the thing will stick in your brain. If you like Mr. King's books than I would highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I have read most of Hesse's other works (I am quite fond of Siddhartha) and really like his novels. I guess I am a little bias. On the other hand, most of his stuff is written quite simplisticly. This is probably the best book I have read. He spent several years on this, his last work, and it shows. I LOVE IT."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I have just finished reading this book after a false start in college 8 years ago and after a month now. Siddhartha was a life changing novel when I read it as a college freshman and thought that maybe this would be as &quot;awakening&quot; for me now. However, I fear I read it too late and should have finished it 8 years ago when I was struggling with the notion of spending my life in academia. I came to the same conclusion about ivory towers that Knecht comes to about Castalia and moreover I have not regretted it as Plinio, nor did it take me a lifetime to realize. Knecht as a main character is rather lifeless and underdeveloped. It is this fact more than any other that makes this a difficult read. Even though Siddhartha clearly takes place at a point in history, it reads as fresh as if it were written today. On the other hand, The Glass Bead Game is so obviously written by someone living during World War II, or shall we say in the middle of the age of Fuillerton, that I found it quite distracting. Something along the lines of watching Soylent Green and having to believe that the world is going to be like that soon. I can appreciate it for a cautionary tale of stagnation and separation rather than synthesis; however, I don't feel the story itself truly captures the theme of transcendence which is a shame. I think that perhaps Hesse was trying too hard to infuse historical people and events into an existential idea and it doesn't really come off successfully for me. Moreover, there is no clear voice writing this story--at one point it's a Castalian telling a non-biography, at another it's a secondhand account, and at yet another it's an original document. This is a detriment to the storytelling, although I grant that it may have been used to reinforce the hypocrisy of Castalians being unable to successfully synthesize a single voice. I think Hesse was more successful at writing in shorter forms. The poems at the end were more poignant than the novel itself. Unlike Eco who is slow to start but then propels the reader forward, Hesse was unable here to compel me to keep reading. There are interesting ideas brought up and compelling notions, but as a novel I don't think it's his best. Perhaps this is a better read with a deeper knowledge of twentieth century philosophers, but it is this fact that keeps The Glass Bead Game from being timeless."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"My son requested this book for Christmas and, being a Hermann Hesse fan, I was happy to buy it for him.

This book in the first edition, was really what I expected.Best regardsRalf"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I wanted a hardback copy of \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" I hoped it would be from the main publisher. It was like a bookclub edition which was kind of cheezy. New, in good shape, yes. A library shelf addition, not much better than a paperback."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"It is amazing how this book is read by so many and seems to have been missundrestood by most - as master himself has stated."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"There are many things that were missed by many of my friends who have read the book, even though they could've done it many times. Everyone finds something in the book, according to one's character, knowledge, or even needs, and there is nothing wrong with missing some of the most sound points (which are sound in my opinion, of course) and getting from it something else, be it entertainment, plenty of which I had while reading it, or whatever else.What I want to stress here is one of the concepts of the Game and it's relation that it has, again in my opinion, with some other writings and thoughts by other people. For those who already know what I might mean by that, there will be nothing new, as there was pretty much nothing unexpected that I found in the Game also.There were writers who showed relations between different sciences and compared those sciences with other non-scientific disciplines. One of whom I know is, first of all, Mircea Eliade. His way of mixing linguistics, philosophy, history, etc. to express many of his positions as a historian and a coparativist of religions might not seem related to the Game at first, but his ideas in his earlier books (which were more philosophical than scientific) are certainly tied to some of the Game's principles. It was not only Eliade, of course, who started to merge different disciplines to come up with new and fascinating results.Another example is the modern science. Neurology and psychology now are often expressed using the language of quantum physics, and, at the end, all that mix is often used to explain some aspects of shamanism, for example. T. Leary, R. A. Wilson, and others in some of their books show similar relationships. To explore the trend deeper, also check Stan Grof (e.g. \\"Beyond Death\\").I think Hesse showed a future step that this trend may take or already took in a very beautiful and metaphoric way. Of course, the Game is much wider than the idea I just mentioned, that Hesse might have meant. The Game is multi-dimensional.I did not mention Kneht. I perceive his biography somewhat separate from the story about the Game, but it is not less interesting than the Game at all. It is as great.I would strongly suggest reading the book in its original language. There are also some translations in other languages, which seemed to me much better and closer to the original than those of the English ones I saw. They are satisfactory though. (I think it is not the fault of the interpreters. It is the author's great style, which, I think, is difficult to translate.)"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Despite the importance and timelessness of Hesse's theme, I found the work tedious, mostly on the basis of his protagonist: essentially a bloodless eunich (or lacking virility, as a kinder mind put it). His answer to Nietzsche: a kindler, gentler Ubermensch is unfortunately just not very interesting. Nevertheless, I finished the work, perhaps because I was awaiting the legendary repudiation of Hesse's essential philosophy, which occurs, albeit rather weakly. The most moving concept in the novel, namely the Glass Bead Game itself, is disappointingly underdeveloped. Sure, accuse me of philistinism, but I have a sneaking suspicion that many other readers are similarly affected by Hesse's tedious style and milquetoast protagonist."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"An excellent agglomeration of existentialist perspectives. The ending is typical German hilarity. Allow me to also recommend The Fairy Tales of Hermann Hesse Translated and with an Introduction by Jack Zipes."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I described \\"Anathem\\" to a buddy of mine. He told me if I liked \\"Anathem\\", I should try \\"The Glass Bead Game\\". I picked it up and went through it fairly quickly. I don't quite know what to make of it.I've decided this book is one gigantic inside joke.It's written in this portentious, mock-academic style, about a man who rises to the top of his chosen hierarchy, throws it all away to look for new mountains to climb, and then dies suddenly.It's an interesting enough read, even if it does leave you gobsmacked at the end. I'll have to re-read it later, to try again to see what others see in it."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I must take issue with the two current \\"spotlight reviews.\\" First of all, I am an Objectivist (the philosophy that runs through the works of Ayn Rand), and I am uncertain as to how Hesse provides an \\"antidote\\" for her, whatever that means. Perhaps it would be clearer if that review's author had explained what he meant. I wouldn't suggest that Hesse and Rand are necessarily compatible philosophically--of course they're not in many ways--but neither is Hesse anything like a formal refutation of what Rand had to say, either. The one issue Hesse really develops at length that opposes Rand directly is his idea of a mind-body split, but he develops his idea through metaphor and analogy, mostly, not as an argued treatise. Further, the \\"sacrifices\\" that dominate Hesse's work are always undertaken for the improvement and happiness of the individual; Hesse's characters don't sacrifice themselves for others, they make \\"sacrifices\\" for themselves. In this way, it really is more compatible with Rand than might be thought at first.The other spotlight review says that this is Hesse's best work. I won't say it's not (it's an individual measure, after all), but it certainly isn't my favorite. The Glass Bead Game has many worthwhile things to say; I recommend reading it, for those who are *very* interested in philosophy and/or eastern thought. On the other hand, Siddhartha also has many worthwhile things to say, and Siddhartha is much shorter and more entertaining. Even those without a real penchant for philosophy would probably enjoy the read. Narcissus and Goldmund was also a more entertaining read. The Glass Bead Game is probably too drawn out for the more casual reader, and there were stretches that tried my patience.Finally, Hesse's fiction often concerns two people who each explore spiritual asceticism versus bodily carnality, and find them incomplete--two halves of a whole, each of which needing to be overcome or transcended. While The Glass Bead Game explores other issues as well (like the cycle of student to teacher to student), this remains the dominant theme, but takes 500 pages to produce it. Having read as much Hesse as I have, it seems as though this was really the song he was longing to sing, and in his various works he found different melodies to incorporate the same beat, if you will. The Glass Bead Game is a complex work, and worth the reading, but Hesse was able to develop his main theme in his other books in less writing and with more excitement. If brevity is the soul of wit, then Hesse has been wittier elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game is another excellent novel by Hesse. I have read and very much enjoyed both Siddhartha and Demian years ago, and found The Glass Bead Game to be a equally enjoyable, though clearly more sophisticated book. Told from the perspective of an anonymous biography, the story revolves around a rather likable character named Joseph Knecht and his ascent throughout the rather esoteric hierarchy of the Order.The tale is presented in a rather fragmented style, highlighting various part's of Joseph's life and the relationships he develops with various figures throughout. Although the book begins slowly, I found it does gradually pick up, and becomes completely engrossing in the later chapters.Like Hesse's other works, The Glass Bead Game offers plenty of insight into society, culture and the human spirit. If you enjoyed Demian or Siddhartha, with a bit of effort, you should enjoy the Glass Bead Game."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This book, along with the rest of the Hesse catalog, and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance changed my life forever. I am sure many have said this and many more will in years to come.I started reading Hesse when my best friend in high school got me to read Steppenwolf. I worked my way through Siddartha, Narcissus and Goldmund, Beneath the Wheel etc. But Magister Ludi was hard for me. I had a very hard time getting through the book for some reason. perhaps it is so dense and perhaps it is because I read it while I was in graduate school. But the book was difficult when I found other Hesse books absorbing. But like Pirsigs book, I understood that sometimes the hardest books to start are the ones that are the most rewarding. It is with that conviction that I finally finished reading Magister Ludi.The philosophical points and ideas in this book have transformed my world views and have given my life a meaning that wasn't there before. For better or for worse, this book change my world view and made introspection a daily part of my life.I think that this is a must read for any intelligent adolescent and that we need to require everyone who has read it to reread it at least once during their lifetime."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"With biblical simplicity, Hesse tracks the awakening of an intelligent man constrained by society. The book pits yin against yang: reason against passion; social responsibility against individual needs; abstract against concrete; past against future. Hesse's hero lives an inspiring life and dies a fitting death. Poems and three short stories add to the beauty and wisdom of the work. This book will change your life and as Joseph Knecht awakens, so will you."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This is clearly a masterpiece. The book takes place in the future but never says how far and is centralized around a community of elite men, a physical ivory tower. Hesse starts with a history and analysis of the glass bead game, moves into an academic biography of Joseph Knecht, a master of the game, and ends with stories Joseph Knecht wrote as a student about past lives he had imagined for himself. The story is epic and beautifully wrought, telling the life story of a unique individual and how he transforms and transcends.So why only four stars? While I can recognize that this is genius and masterful, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. The novel started out in a tedious way, and although it improved, the writing remained oppressive (albeit in a beautiful way)."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"In typical Hesse fashion, \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" contrasts the spiritual and the worldly, and draws attention to the Buddhist concept that attachment is the primary cause of human suffering.However, more than just advocating a reconciliation of the mind and body (common in Hesse novels) this story also supports the value of striving for a synthesis of all knowledge. Solely for that, I gave it three stars.But overall, the work is quite tedious to read. Also, the bulk of it is supposedly set in the distant future, yet doesn't feel even slightly futuristic. And as is usual with Hesse, women recieve short shrift.I much prefer both \\"Siddhartha\\" and \\"Narcissus and Goldmund\\", and not just because they're easier to read. They're just much more fun. Of course, Hesse may have intended \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" to be instructive rather than pleasurable to read, or at least only really pleasurable if you can pick up on the extremely subtle humor and rather obscure references in it (which were by no means clear to me).In total, though, I believe this tome of a novel pales in comparison to several of Hesse's other works."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I've always loved Hesse work and this does not in any way dissuade me from that view.

There is really nothing typical about this story.

They all dealt with issues of faith versus science, contemplation versus service, and broad integration. The Brown and Hesse books were so similar I sometimes forgot which I was reading. Wilbur's book puts the other two into a broader perspective, albiet of his own design. It has been an extremely thought-provoking two weeks for me."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"A wonderful experience, but the themes have been explored many times over in Hesse's more lyrical works. At time I felt as though I was reading a more complex version of other Hesse novels. The construction is impeccable and lucid. Nevertheless, the style is less poetic than Siddhartha and more emotionally distant than Demian."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Although Hesse is not in fashion among academics these days, this book (unlike some of his earlier more romantic stuff) deserves to be noticed as a great work of the 20th century. It's very complex, and can be frustrating (especially if you have little or no knowledge of German history, literature and music); it's nevertheless an important, and often very moving reflection on the nature of modern society (and isn't yet outdated), and equally on some of the dangers of trying to escape that society."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"A classic book about what? Part musical composition, part philosophical vehicle, Part pedagogical critique, part iconoclastic portrayal of society, Hesse's book traces the path of a poor but brilliant student from his experience as scholarship recipient to the top magister in the education system of 20th century Germany, although parts of the book seem to be intentionally indeterminate in the time period.Siddhartha by Hesse is a much shorter and accessible book for those who would like be a traveling man and journey to the east of spiritual enlightenment. This longer and more more poetic book, however, greatly appealed to me. It contains evaluations of the relationships of public and private institutions of education, the economy, society, and religion. It is not light reading, and really stretched my mind.Another gentleman mentioned the dubious relationship of Baroque music and Chinese arcitecture, which were probably more a part of Hesse's life than most people's. Music is viewed as a sacred and divine transcendance for the enlightened, as are buildings for the proper use of human activity in establishment. Both draw light from the darkness and form from the void; it is civilization hewn from the untamed wild, beauty for the higher existence of man.Some parts are truly phenomenal, but other parts thoroughly complicated and loggy. The glass bead game is never really explained in totality, and must be viewed as a system rather than anything concrete. I personally made it what I wanted to: music, art, writing, politics, an analysis of competitive sports and recreation, business, or whatever interests you in your life.The book is a quite literary example of bildungsroman and kunstlerroman, German for the story of the spiritual, moral, artistic and mental development of a character, and details what seems a lifetime of philosophical perspective. Its length and translation I think are true to Hesse's intent, as alot of material is examined quite beautifully. It can really drag on from time to time, though, which takes a strong work and makes it a pretty good work. I'd probably give it between 3 and 4 stars due to that fact."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game is one of my favorite books, and certainly Hesse's best. The writing is masterful, and the plot is centered around a philosophy that is simultaneously expansive and intimate. Other reviewers have mentioned that it may not be as engaging for younger readers, but I read it when I was 15, and loved it. Its literary and philosophical merit makes it worth reading whenever you happen to come to it, though you do get more out of it if you're willing to put in more effort. The book feels richer each reading, and never stops being engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with the time and the imagination to immerse themselves in a fantastic literary work."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I came away with one main idea when finished with this 600 page tome of brilliance: Do not allow your soul to bend to your body, and do not allow your body to bend to your soul. This book is an expirience to read, and if you are familiar with Hesse's life, you will laugh with regularity at the sprinklings of subtle hilarity that litter the pages. The novel takes place in Castalia, a world dominated by the mind. The main character, Joseph, explores whether the world is a specious facade or a veritable heaven on earth. The esoteric &quot;glass bead game&quot; must be studied assiduously for years before one can begin to partake in the games. Joseph is dilegent but has massive growing pains that eventually lead to a overhaul of his beliefs."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Hermann Hesse was a great writer, and many of his works, such as \\"Siddhartha,\\" \\"Steppenwolf,\\" and \\"Narcissus and Goldmund\\" are masterpieces. But no book of Hesse's is as important to me personally, and to mankind in general, as \\"The Glass Bead Game.\\" \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" is a criticism of both the intellectuals of Hesse's era and the institutions of the world in general. The book is especially important to us in 2004, as intellectuals face a life in which they are more and more separated from the daily realities of the world. I will not go into a lot of detail, as many other reviewers have voiced my opinions. Simply put, \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" is a challenging yet rewarding novel that all young college students and other intellectuals should read before departing on their life's path."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game is set in an indeterminate future, a long time after the century of wars, also described as the age of the feuilleton, a time of shallow and fruitless individualism, our time. Scholarship has resumed its rightful place in society, a place at the same time of power and elevation and of humility before knowledge. And at its apex, or rather apart from it, are Castalia and a group of sister organisations which, around the world, practice the glass bead game. The game itself is not described, except that it is a play on a synthesis of science, music, and the arts, an attempt to touch at universal truths by sounding echoes between the disciplines. Its disciples, to match their dignity, vow celibacy and poverty much like the religious scholars of old, Western, Chinese, or Hindu.The book is shaped as a bibliographical report from Castalia's own archives, complete with documentary attachments. This makes for a very slow pace, and for a whole that leaves much detail obscure. The Glass Bead Game is, voluntarily, tough-going up to well into its first half. It is as if Hesse scorns in advance his reader's expectations for an easy and entertaining piece, expectations that rightly belong to the age of the feuilleton. But the design becomes clearer, and a deep inner tension emerges as the novel progresses. Joseph Knecht, whom one follows through childhood, then a brilliant period of study, and various ambassadorial missions all the way into the glass bead game's high priesthood, is beset with doubts. And set against him is Plinio Designori, friend and admirer but the scion of a family of politicians who, unlike Knecht, has chosen to grapple with a fate in the real world. Knecht comes to worry about the durability of Castalia, and about the very value of cultural pursuits so cut off from their historical mainstream. The book closes with a set of poems by Knecht, and with three lives he purportedly wrote in his student years, all balancing the destinies of sages with the temptations of worldly pursuits in various settings: stone-age, early-medieval Christian, and Hindu.The Glass Bead Games asks questions and sets problems rather than provide ready-made answers. It is a meditation on the roles of culture and study in society and on the value of philosophical knowledge. Hesse also asks whether culture can or should be considered to be historically independent from politics and its social conditions, an interesting question in the light of the recent rehabilitation of culture in political history-writing. And his novel delves into the nature of education and the relationship between master and apprentice. Knecht is increasingly portrayed as a prisoner in a cherished tower of glass. The question is whether he can escape without shattering it. Demanding but subtle and resolutely un-categorical, this novel is to be read by anyone who has a vocation or interest of any kind in academic, artistic, or scholarly pursuits."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game is divided into four distinct parts. Part 1, the general introduction to the game, is likely to be the least interesting to the general reader and may be skipped without concern that important information to understand the story will be lost. Part 2 is the fictional biography of Jospeph Knecht, the Magister Ludi of the title of the novel. As other reviewers have noted, the entertainment value of this biography is slight. The story starts slowly with Knecht's childhood and education and then moves to the point in the middle of the novel where he is appointed Magister Ludi (teacher of the game). I was interested in the various problems Knecht faced as Magister in the future world called Castalia. Knecht slowly moves toward enlightenment and we watch his steady progress. His journey becomes more interesting as he faces obstacles, not only with the ruling elite of Castalia, but also in himself. Everyone recognizes that Knecht is an extraordinary human being, but he challenges the status quo and has genuine concerns about the future of Castalia that not everyone wants to hear. The end of Knecht's story comes as an abrupt surprise to the reader.Joseph Knecht's poetry comprises Part 3 of the novel. The poems help us to understand the inner life and world of Knecht and are useful in that regard. The poems are worth reading even if they did not relate directly to the story.In Part 4, the final section of the book, Hesse gives us three long stories related to the novel. Many readers will find these stories the most entertaining part of the novel. In fact, another review suggests readers begin their reading of the novel with these stories - not a bad idea. The stories are well told and genuinely interesting. I read the poems along with the stories; some poems - Stages - I read several times.Summary: Many people will not get beyond the general introduction to The Glass Bead Game (Part 1); watching paint dry is how some readers have described it. Joseph Knecht's story (Part 2) will interest those readers who love the work of Hermann Hesse and want to read his final novel, his crowning achievement, as some have called it. I am in this category of readers and read with interest this final novel. The poetry and short stories which complete the novel are genuinely entertaining and similar in style to much of Hesse's other work. If the general reader starts at the end and enjoys the short stories and poetry, skips the general introduction, and then moves quickly through the early life of Joseph Knecht, reading The Glass Bead Game may be an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Set in an undefined but obviously distant future (the papacy of Pius XV is mentioned), Hermann Hesse's novel \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" (1949) is not so much science fiction as philosophy fiction, taking place in a monastic yet secular realm where life is balanced by the cerebral excercises of the mysterious titular Game. (I don't know why the alternate title \\"Magister Ludi\\" was given to the English translation. The original German title \\"Das Glasperlenspiel\\" translates directly as \\"The Glass Bead Game\\".) The fact that the Game is never described in detail only adds to its mystery. Evidently it is not a regulated game of strategy like chess, not an execution but rather an inspiration based on a single concept, be it a detail in Chinese architecture or a passage from a Mozart andante. Castalia,the realm where this game is idealized, is outside the everyday world of business and society and has been inaugurated for the very purpose of maintaining spirtual and educational ideals after a long period of destructive wars and facile culture referred to as the Digest Age. By having his futuristic characters look back on this epoch with distaste, one can only assume that Hesse was referring not only to the 20th Century but to the 21st as well. If there is satire intended here, it has eluded me. Within Castalia is the Vicus Lusorum (Game Town) where the Game is played and polished and where the Master of the Game (the Magister Ludi) is in serene control. The novel's central character is Joseph Knecht, who during the course of the story becomes Game Master. Oddly enough, the word Knecht in German means servant, and at one point he reveals that as Master he associates himself with Christopher, the saint who gladly accepted burdens. Thus it is partly out of intellectual curiosity and partly out of political spying he visits a Confucian hermit and a Benedictine monk in order to understand their viewpoints, visits which are not completely approved of by the pedagogy in Castalia. He also holds long discussions with Plinio Designori, a civilized but somewhat decadent man from the outside world (shades of \\"Steppenwolf\\"!), and eventually becomes tutor to the man's son. In order to take this worldly position, he must renounce Castalia and the Glass Bead Game, leaving his colleagues and superiors shocked and saddened. (At this point I can't resist stating that in many ways \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" resembles Mann's \\"The Magic Mountain\\".) Hesse's book closes with13 poems and \\"three reincarnations\\", supposedly student works of Knecht's published posthumously. The three stories (the third one, a study of Yoga, is especially interesting) are reminiscent of the novelle of Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, a writer probably admired by Hesse in his youth. Speaking of youth: I attempted to read this book when I was in my 20s. Personally I was not prepared, but that doesn't mean other young readers can't appreciate it. Though it requires serious concentration and some patience, particularly in the opening pages, \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" is a fascinating example of Hesse's ideals, what one reference book calls his \\"spirtual search for new goals and values to replace the no longer valid, traditional ones.\\""},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"For those who don't, a dull and pointless novel. But then, all of life is that way until youu start to wake up. PS: Just a note about writing reviews - the rating is for the book, not the characters in it. Just because you don't like an organization or individual in the book doesn't mean that the book deserves a lower rating."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"In this, probably the best book by Herman Hesse, the author shows an amazing ability to predict the difficulties of modern mankind. The focus on superficial matters, the lack of true human communication, the disregard for the basic values that plague today's environment are shown by Hesse as the raw material of the founding of Castalia, the spiritual order thant appears to save all knowledge and real feelings and to preserve it for the future generations. This book should be mandatory reading for every statesman, political leader, teacher, parent and everybody interested in the rescue of the real sense of human life. We all need the surging of a Castalia, and we need it right away!"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"When in my 30s, after having read several of Hesse's novels, I attempted to read The Glass Bead Game. I couldn't get past the first 50 pages. I was unprepared to accept Hesse as a humourist and satirist. Now, approaching 60 and having learned not to take life or Hesse so seriously, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and consider it Hesse's greatest. A mature Hesse, who understood life's ironies, wrote The Glass Bead Game for a mature audience, who could laugh at life's ambiguities.The Glass Bead Game is comprised of a novel, 13 poems, and 3 short stories. I think the reader would enjoy the novel more by reading the book in reverse order, starting with the three short stories: The Rainmaker, The Father Confessor, and The Indian Life. The underlying theme of the stories is that the forfeiture of self, or self-interest, leads to redemption or an awakening.The poems superbly unite the novel's cultural, spiritual, and mental perspectives. Hesse's best known poem \\"Stages\\" is included. Here's a four line excerpt:\\"If we accept a home of our making,Familiar habit makes for indolence.We must prepare for parting and leave-takingOr else remain the slaves of permanence.\\"The novel is set in the future and located in the sequestered province of Castalia. This is a world of academia that consists of theory, analysis, interpretation, and debate - all elements of \\"the game\\". Absent from Castalia are action, creativity, originality, and experiment.The protaganist, Joesph Knecht is raised in this culture. He also lived at a couple of subcultures outside Castalia. At Bamboo Grove, under Elder Brother's tutelage he learned to meditate, play I-Ching, read Chuang Tzu, and learn Chinese studies. (All this self absorption without gazing at his navel; instead, he stared at the carp.) Later at a Benedictine monastery he was the guest of Father Jacobus, with whom he discussed politics, religion, philosophy, music, and history. Knecht learned everything to play \\"the game\\" and was elevated to the role of Magister Ludi. But his knowledge went unapplied beyond Castalia.Even those within Castalia were not immune to mid-life crisis. Knecht, while in his 50s is impacted by the words in \\"Stages\\":\\"Serenely let us move to distant placesAnd let no sentiments of home detain us.The Cosmic Spirit seeks not to restrain usBut lifts us stage by stage to wider spaces.\\"Anyone who has made a break from the routine will enjoy The Glass Bead Game."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"First: From a prose point of view, I found the first 50 to 100 pages of this translation to be very difficult going. More astute readers would probably pick up on the subtle humor (Ziolkowski mentions it in his introduction) but I found it dry and tough going. I mention this because I've run into a number of people who say, &quot;I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't even make it past the first 50 pages!&quot; If you find this to be the case, just grin and bear it: Know that after the first 100 pages the book picks up considerably in pace.I won't comment on the book's philosophical corollaries or references, since others better versed in such things have already done so, better than I could.Rather, one of the aspects of the book that I found particularly compelling is the Game itself and the ideas behind it.The Glass Bead Game, as Hesse describes it, is a meditation, seemingly both competitive and collaborative, on different fields of knowledge, where the point is to take concepts from otherwise disparate disciplines and associate them in creative, profound ways -- finding a pattern shared rhythmically by a piece of Baroque music and spatially by ancient Chinese architecture, say.An observation I've made over time is that of all the people I know, those that I would say are possessed by genius all share a common trait, the ability, to use the cliche, to &quot;Think Outside the Box.&quot; To realize new, previously unseen associations between things is a quality of a great mind, and here Hesse acknowledges the value of this talent, elevating it even to an artform (though I suppose the Castalian players in the novel would firmly call it &quot;post-art&quot;.)The analogy I make is to 2D math: Consider a point in space, represented in either Cartesian or polar coordinates. Each representation is as valid as the other, but each representation, makes different analyses easier and others harder.Another good analogy is the Windows 98/2000/XP explorer window: the window displays a list of files, with a number of columns of various information. You can click a column header to sort the list by that information. A given sort makes certain things easier, and others harder. If I sort by file size, I can easily find the largest file. If I sort by name, I can easily find a file beginning with the letter 'C'.The idea of the Game is, essentially, to find different &quot;sort columns&quot; -- to find different ways to slice knowledge to compare it and examine it and learn from it.The fascination of *Glass Bead Game* was that, for me, it began to formalize the idea of meta-knowledge -- that is, how we think about what we know. There's probably tons of psychology literature about this phenomenon, learning theory, or whatnot, but Hesse manages to incorporate it not into a dissertation on the Game, but on a decidedly artistic book that revolves around the Game. What talent, to so eloquently present such a profound idea as merely one aspect of a larger work of art!It took me about a month to read this entire book, consistently reading twenty or thirty pages a night. When I finished, I found that some nights I'd get so caught up thinking about the book and its implications and possibilities that I'd be unable to fall asleep.Rarely do I have the opportunity to read something so compelling!"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This book is to Hesse as \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is to Dostoevsky. Throughout it are the same ideas that have been put forth in earlier works, often with similar characters, but with a fuller and more articulate expression than before. Like Dostoevsky, he finally figured out how to say *everything* he had to say in one volume. So it comes as no surprise that those only concerned with certain aspects (particularly the more spiritual ones) of Hesse's writing would find it disjointed and tedious. If you want to read more of Hesse's stories about tormented and/or confused souls looking for meaning in the world, this isn't your book - go reread Damien and Steppenwolf. This book has that esoteric search, but its main character, Joseph Knecht, pursues this search as a curiousity and not out of some desperate need. I'm sure that's why several people seem to find him lacking compared to other Hesse protagonists - they're expecting a conflict in him that isn't there.As I read these other reviews I find it fascinating that everyone seems to come away from the book with such different things that they were struck with. In my case, this was the socio-political commentary. Through this book, Hesse comments on our own time and on a fictional opposite to it, thoroughly exposing the flaws in both. I remember most distinctly Knecht's letter of resignation from Magister Ludi, where he tells his colleagues that although they understand the importance of their society's existence, they made the fatal mistake of not educating the people who support them. That they cannot take the existence of what they have for granted, for the day would eventually come when all they built would be dismantled. Perhaps this was because I read this book when I was in an institution that resembled much of what Hesse wrote about, and exactly when Congress cut the NEA.Reading this book changed my view of the world most in that it changed my expectations of it. More to the point, I abandoned my expectations. I am much more apt to let other people be themselves. To explain how or why would take far too long, suffice it to say that there is more to this book than a pursuit for spiritual meaning or a balance of intellectual and physical need, but also balance on many other levels, and Hesse explores all of them in his classic manner - first by their disparity, then by their eventual unity. A stunning conclusion to the career of one the greatest writers of all time."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I picked this up after meeting Charles Cameron, who invented the Hipbone Games, a variation of the Glass Bead Game as described in this novel. Charles was so wildly enthusiastic about it--and I was so intrigued and delighted with his game--that I immediately visited the university library the day after chatting with him and began reading the life story of Joseph Knect, the Master of the Glass Bead Game. As I fell deeper and deeper down Hesse's rabbit hole, I found myself asking people if they knew that this novel, which basically won Hesse the Nobel Prize in Literature, was science fiction? How come this isn't mentioned in genre studies, if not with the pulp masters, at least among those literary books that strayed into far shores like George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm or Aldous Huxley's Brave New World?Set in the far future, where today's emphasis on entertainment is termed the Age of the Feuilleton, The Glass Bead Game describes a world that has once again settled down from the conflicts between humans in a new Golden Age, but one wherein a new caste has been created. Not a religious order, although their devotion to their ideals resembles religion, this new group is based on education, one of their duties being to train all the teachers in this country. To be accepted into the group one must be educated in their elite schools, for only the brightest and the best and--this is important-- the orphans are accepted into Castalia. Why orphans? Because family ties are the bonds that weaken the link to the Castalian society. The crowning achievement of all Castalia is not the elite schools and their pupils, but the game--a systematic method of linking math and music and history and art and, well, anything, into a perfect &quot;whole.&quot; Everyone admires the game, and the master of it, the Magister Ludi, is the pivot point for the players, and thus, Castalian society. The book, once it gives you this background, then describes the path of Joseph Knecht from elite student all the way to the seat of the Magister, and then, surprisingly, back to student.Okay, I'm sure that had I stumbled upon this book when younger that I would not have finished it. Unlike pulp SF, the purpose of The Glass Bead Game is philosophical, not adventure. While you can read it for plot (and the &quot;Three Lives&quot; appendices provide plenty of that, in three different &quot;fantasy&quot; settings), the idea of perfection and what does it meant to be human are the real characters here, and the physical creatures described are just pawns in this literary gameplay. A few times I found myself rushing through the interminable equivocation, but for the most part my imagination was captivated. Seems to me that this might be the antidote for some of Ayn Rand's sins."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Hesse is an anomoly among authors in that what he writes is both very beautiful and very true. The philosophical heritage of this book dates back to St. Thomas Aquinas and his discussion of the opposing Aristotelian poles that exert their magnetism on our lives--the pull of the active life (Vita Activa) and the life of contemplation (Vita Contemplativa). This discussion, the centerpiece of this book, is as original and atavistic a trope as can be found. It is a noteworthy characteristic of the topic, however, that it is always fresh and worth of a new evaluation. As Ralph Waldo Emerson instructs us in his 1838 oration to Harvard's Phi Beta Kappa society, &quot;every age must write its own books.&quot; Hesse's _Glasperlenspiel_ an evaluation of a great philosophical theme, analysed with great beauty for our age. In the spirit of Christmas, the protagonist's name, Josef Knecht, echoes the spirit of giving. Hesse used the name Knecht (&quot;Servant&quot;) in open defiance of Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_ (&quot;William the Master&quot;). In a season devoted to a spirit of giving, _The Glass Bead Game_ is a work rich in both artistry and ideology. As an addendum I must note that the full force of Hesse's prose is muddled a bit in translation. In translating passages to send to friends, I often found there was no way to express in English the sentiments of Hesse's flowing, heavily punctuated German, beset by a disinclination to use a full stop. The book, however, is mystic (in the Greek sense of being &quot;closed mouthed&quot;); Hesse's meaning is thankfully quite independent of the translation. In a scene that for me defines the book, Knecht crushes a bough between his fingers and struggles to define the smell: &quot;es laesst sich mitteilen, gewiss, aber nicht uebertragen.&quot; (It may be said, of course, but not communicated) Hesse's descriptions, at their best, are, to permit the paradox, descriptions of the ineffable."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This is a really important book that unfortunately has too often been misunderstood by both its supporters & detractors. I've been looking through all of the reviews to Hesse's \\"Glass Bead Game\\"(Magister Ludi), and one important theme that most have missed is the theme of education--an issue which Hesse has consistently introduced into his work from the very beginning, \\"Beneath the Wheel\\", to the end of his writing career. This book is, I believe, Hesse's exploration of what the ideal teacher (the magister) and ideal educational society (Castalia) should be like. However, it seems that through the course of writing about this ideal society, and writing from within it by using the masks of genre (i.e. Knecht's poems & writings), Hesse comes to the conclusion that even an ideal society is doomed to fail if the educational system ROTS from within. Seen in this light, the Glass Bead game, which many readers are disappointed to find only lightly sketched-out, is really not that important to the story; it's only a curiousity demonstrating the end-process of the Castalia system. The real issue is the methodology of teaching & the problems facing an ideal society that has lost touch with the real world. Indeed, Knecht admits that as he gets older he prefers to teach younger & younger students in order to reach them earlier. A hint that maybe all is not right with the process of educating those who become members of the \\"order\\". The book is, as many readers know, quite a feat of the imagination and a feat of literary mastery, but at it's heart are basic questions: how do we educate ourselves and others, how do we use what we've learned, and how do we balance the real world with the imagined world? These are difficult questions, but they are the ones that Hesse tries to solve with this book; the game itself is but a convenient vessel with which to explore these issues."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I'm a big fan of Hesse and this was the sixth book of his I've read. I'll remember it as one of the most profound, original and idiosyncratic of this great author's impressive canon.Initially though I struggled and my patience was tested. In fact it wasn't until perhaps halfway through the book that The Glass Bead Game really started to lure me in and work its unique charms on me as a reader.There are plenty of other reviews on this site that elaborate and comment upon the plot, the protagonists and the themes of this book; I won't rehash any of that. But I will recommend to anyone - particularly fans of Hesse's other works - that they have a go at and persist with The Glass Bead Game. You will reach the end and reflect on a literary experience quite unlike any other. The whole concept of the story is surely as fresh and original today as it was when it first appeared.Architecturally it is as sublime as the poetic prose for which Hesse will always remain a cult favourite. Few authors can write about the human condition with quite the same elegance, insight and aching beauty. The way all of these traits converge as he describes Joseph Knecht's last days is simply stunning. Ultimately I was so deeply moved that I feel almost ashamed of my impatience at the beginning.I am so glad I persisted, and I suspect you will be too."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This is a story of one man's life and spiritual journey of awakening. It is presented as the biography of Joseph Knetch who, among other things, becomes Master of the Glass Bead Game (Magister Ludi) in a fictional province of the mind segregated from the rest of the world. The book is divided into four parts. The first, and weakest part, is an introduction to the Glass Bead Game and to the fictional world in which the events take place. If you have the endurance to make it past this introduction, you will find your reward in the second part which is the actual biography of Joseph Knetch, and which comprises the bulk of the novel. The final two parts are collections of Joseph Knetch's writings from his student days: a series of poems, and three short stories depicting his hypothetical life in three different historical settings.Hermann Hesse's style is reflective and inwardly focused, and he writes with remarkable clarity and depth of insight into human nature. He discusses actions of the mind as effortlessly as most good authors discuss actions of the body. I have never been more content at being able to relate to a character, and I left the book feeling as if I had experienced living another life.I disagree with the characterization of this book as satire or humor. Do not pick it up expecting humor or satire. While it is set in the future, it is also not science fiction. It is simply a penetrating and beautifully written character exploration that the more mature and reflective readers should find deeply satisfying."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This novel is by no means for everyone. It is long, dense and is more about philosophical ideas than anything that's actually happening. But if you like philosophical novels chances are you'll adore Hesse's magnum opus.The book is set in the future where a special elite state of scholars has been created. This grand institution of Castalia mirrors to an extent the scholastic and/or classical education of yesteryear. Not content to be the puppets of political and practical whims, the masters withdrew into a virtually monastic lifestyle. Their pursuits included philosophy, logic, philology, music and mythology as elements of the greater transcendent ideas. To supplement this, the Glass Bead Game was developed: a syntactic game with a library of tens of thousands of symbols whereby one can relate one thing (eg. an architectural monument) to another (eg. a famous piece of music). This novel is the biography of one of the most celebrated masters of the Glass Bead Game.Hesse never explains the mechanics of the game in detail, which is part of the beauty of the novel, however there are currently many attempts to create some game like the one he described. However, the novel is not about the game. It is about the relationship between the intellect and the emotions, between the formal and the playful. Hesse brings together some of his ecclectic interests such as music as an exploration of the sacred, linguistics, symbolism and Chinese philosophy. Even if like me you may think his collection is a tad dated in terms of the time he was living in (especially in terms of his excitement over \\"Eastern philosophy\\"), it is truly an interdisciplinary worldview that is presented.And above all, the novel is about the nature of intellectualism, as our hero constantly struggles with the non-contextual, ahistorical withdrawal from the world of his colleagues. The book debates the importance of \\"pure\\" versus \\"practical\\" knowledge and the differing attitudes that abount therein.All in all, there are literally thousands of themes in the book (which is about 200 pages too long in my opinion). Nothing there was anything that was lifechanging for me, nothing shook my world. But it was still a very amazing exploration. As someone who loves seeking out unlikely connections between things, and seeing them seeked out, I was in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This book is brilliantly written (and brilliantly translated, I might add), but there is so much more to it than Joseph Knect's awakening and his poignant ending. The book is so subtle and so masterfully written it's scarry. Here are some examples.As the book begins, the narrator, far removed in time from Knect himself, seems rather indifferent towards the Knect, the glass bead game, and Castalia. As the book progresses, the narrator comes to admire Joseph Knect just as the reader does. His praise comes more often and his admiration is obvious. The writing style becomes more florid and poetic rather than the historical account of the first chapter. This illustrates how Knect puts a spell on people and is liked by all, including the narrator.Also, as the book begins from outside Castalia, there is copious detail about the surroundings and the world. As Knect becomes part of Castalia and the Order, the detail vanishes and instead becomes introspective, meditative prose that is based only on thoughts. Then at the end it goes back into vivid description of the setting. This shows how the world is more material and Castalia is more intellectual. During his time at the order, except during moments when he seems to be a citizen of the world, the book is virtually devoid of physical detail.Finally, the ending. I won't say what it is, but it is brilliant. When the beauty of reality and the genuine action of the &quot;world&quot; converged with the beauty of the intellectual and Cultural Castalia, you something momentus had to happen. Something had to give, but something was also created, almost greater because of the youth.If you haven't figured out already, I want you to READ THIS BOOK. I know I've missed much of it, but I wanted to relate what I did think I understood to you so that you might have a more enjoyable read. Also, in response to someone who thought it was boring. Although I see where he comes from, I disagree. I read the whole book in less than a week.Thanks for your time {{{milo}}}"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This is by far Hesse's best work.

Of course, is longer than any other Hesse's books. If you're looking something like Siddartha or Demian, this is not the case. This book is quite longer, but it takes you to a world totally different.Hesse's writing is so magical and spiritual that it caught me all along the book.If you are a Hesse's follower, you should not miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game is the pinnacle of intelligence, wisdom and learning that the 23rd century Castalia has to offer. Students are plucked from their families and lives at a young age to become 'elite' pupils, gradually inducted into the Order and the Game to carry on the traditions and ceremonies of Castalia. The Order's purpose is two-fold: One, to protect the sanctity and accuracy of knowledge from the current time down to antiquity, and two, to showcase the talents and minds of the elite with dazzling, lengthy Glass Bead Games.But there is a problem, and only Joseph Knecht, the Magister Ludi - Master of the Game and hero of the story - can see it. The Glass Bead Game, while being the pinnacle of intellectual achievement, has no creativity side, no ability to move beyond what it currently is. Philosophy, music, art, mathematics, sciences: All these are condensed into symbols representing, say, a piece by Bach or a mathematical equation. However, no new symbols are allowed, or if they are, the process is so mired in bureaucracy that it may as well be impossible.We follow Joseph from childhood to Magister Ludi, and we learn through him what Castalia is and is capable of. A supreme intellect, his life culminates not in the appointment of Magister Ludi - as so many other great player's would consider it to be - but rather with his famous 'circular letter', addressed to the other members of the Board, highlighting his concerns with the Glass Bead Game.The plot of the book is minimal, and we are all but told it at the very beginning. Rather, we are invited to take a look at this could be-world of Hesse's. Castalia, however, is not the entirety of the world, as much as the inhabitants would like to think. No, they are 'merely' an enclosed, fully-supported (but not self-supported) university like establishment, churning out works that may or may not have any real use outside of their walls.At first, the book mercilessly attacks our time, with its commercialism, its way of turning men intelligent in one field into minor celebrities in another, its way of asking movie stars or musicians to comment on the state of the world even though there talents lie elsewhere, its way of putting wealth above all. It seems at times as though Hesse was caricaturing his own time, but the frightening thing is, in 2004, we have become this caricature. After this attack, the beauty of Castalia is revealed, as explained above. But then, as Joseph Knecht learns and discovers and becomes Magister Ludi, we learn that Castalia is not so important, not so wonderful, not so essential as first presented. It is difficult for him to accept this, but easier for us.In the end, no solution is given. Hesse emphatically states that our present time is too shallow to be the answer, but so is the staid environment of Castalia. It is worth noticing that no character beyond Knecht has a personality; even his is poor. Females do not play a part, and there is no conflict. Is Hesse saying that a world without creativity becomes a lifeless, boring world capable of beauty but incapable of appreciation of this beauty?"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"A magisterial work of art (excuse the pun)! A synthesis of profound philosophy, captivating storytelling and that distinctive smattering of sublime moments particular to the greatest of novels. In masterful fashion, Hesse achieves a seemingly impossible balancing trick of, on the one hand, invoking the game as a metaphor for the sum of human experience and knowledge yet, on the other hand, never allowing the reader to directly encounter it's practice. Would that it were so that one were fortunate enough to have the time to re-read this book many times over."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This book was in my college days treated by some as if it held the secret of the universe in it. It was spoken about with a kind of hushed reverence, and ohwow awe. My reading of it was not I am afraid very successful and I found it impossible to really understand either what was going on, or why I should care. Rumination is literature perhaps, but usually when given in shorter doses. In any case I realize that what I am saying is probably going to defend diehard Hesse fans who know the secrets of the beadgame even though as I understand it it is not fully described in the book. I also was taken aback a bit by the kind of monastic intellectual and spiritual discipline which it seems Hesse is recommending as summum bonum. Isn't there life outside the kind of elite discipline that seems to be recommended here.I have I must admit always been fascinated by the idea of an intellectual synthesis , a kind of ' theory of everything' or a ' unified field theory of all human disciplines' In some sense this is what is hinted at here. But I did not get how it works.So my review is more about my own failure to understand what to some is a major classic of world literature. I may be wrong but I simply did not like this book very much and did not get it at all."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I read MAGISTER LUDI many years ago after I had been first introduced to Hesse by the short novel DEMIAN. I found my interest in this book was captured by the &quot;Posthumous Writings&quot; of the main character, Joseph Knecht.I found &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; segment fascinating. It is the first of three short stories about what Knecht might have been in other times and places. The Rainmaker was sensitive to nature, and could deliver rain when it was most needed...except once. At which point he was sacrificed and his heir, whom he had prepared, took over. Rilke once described a poet as a man who must understand &quot;the gestures with which the flowers open.&quot; The Rainmaker did.But top billing in my book is the one page poem STEPS. (My translation is by Mervyn Savill, a most superior one, in my opinion.) I have often described it to my friends as &quot;the best poem in the English language.&quot; Do I dare type it out in full?STEPS, by Herman HesseAs every blossom fades and all youth sinks/ into old age, so every life's design,/ each flower of wisdom, every good, attains/ its prime and cannot last for ever./At life's each call the heart must be prepared/ to take its leave and to commence afresh,/ courageously and with no hint of grief/ submit itself to other, newer ties./ A magic dwells in each beginning and/ protecting us it tells us how to live./High-purposed we must traverse realm on realm,/ cleaving to none as to a home. The world/ of spirit wishes not to fetter us/ but raise us higher, further, step by step./Scarce in some safe accustomed sphere of life/ have we established house, than we grow lax;/ he only who is ready to inspan/ and journey forth can throw old habits off./Maybe death's hour too will send us out/ new-born toward undreamed-of lands, maybe/ life's call to us will never find an end.../ Courage, my heart, take leave and fare thee well!This poem was written by Knecht in his student days, and has become my most prized poem. Another one is fascinating to me, also, titled A DREAM. It describes the flashes of insight that come to us out of nowhere...and disappear just as quickly.The translator deserves special mention with his&quot; &quot;Scare in some safe, accustomed sphere of life have we established house...&quot; Lovely alliteration, to my ear. Master philosophical novel, truly meaningful poetry. Thank you, Herman Hesse!"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game is about a future society called Castalia in which the most highly regarded cultural institution, almost a religion, is the game of the title, in which players relate ideas to one another in a sort of cabalistic exercise but encompassing every field of human knowledge (but especially mathematics and music) rather than just scripture. The Game, however, has little connection to real life but operates in a sort of Platonic world of Forms, as the relations between ideas it establishes are generally superficial rather than based on real, essential or fundamental similarities.The story follows one past (to the narrator) Magister Ludi, or Master of the Game, and tells of his eventual disillusionment as he learns more of history and the outside world. \\"I regarded it as my mission,\\" as he puts it, \\"to expand Castalian life and thought\\"---but ultimately, he resigns his post and leaves Castalia altogether.His resignation ties the story, which seems a bit disjointed up to that point, together: \\"But I must also tell you the meaning that the word 'transcend' has had for me since my student years and my 'awakening.' It came to me, I think, while reading a philosopher of the Enlightenment...and ever since then it has been a veritable magic word for me, like 'awakening,' an impetus, a consolation, and a promise. My life, I resolved, ought to be a perpetual transcending, a progression from stage to stage; I wanted it to pass through one area after the next, leaving each behind, as music moves on from theme to theme, from tempo to tempo, playing each out to the end, completing each and leaving it behind, never tiring, never sleeping, forever wakeful, forever in the present.\\"The Glass Bead Game is a great novel and probably Hesse's masterpiece, certainly better than Demian or Siddhartha, though personally I probably enjoyed Narcissus and Goldmund more. It starts off a bit slowly, but builds and builds and is ultimately fascinating and quite satisfying. Definitely worth a read.If you enjoyed The Glass Bead Game, you might want to check out James Beckel's Pulitzer-prize nominated horn concerto of the same title, inspired by and loosely based on the novel (all the more appropriate given the important role of music in the story)."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I loved Hesse's work as an adolescent but the title of this book put me off, and it took me 25 years to get back to it.

After turning each page I kept asking myself, \\"What's the point? What's the plot?\\" For me-and probably a lot of others out there-there isn't enough dialogue or action to keep me interested.

One way to read this book is to skim through the tedious prose and look for anything that might be of import to the plot or of interest otherwise.Being Indian, was able to appreciate the story of Dasa better than any other section of the book. In a very deft manner, the writer has combined elements from the Ramayana, the life of the Buddha and other tales to make an interesting tale. The character of Parvati is very atypical of heroines in Indian myth (supremely virtuous). That might be typical Hesse, though.As many readers have pointed out, the book lacks any credible analysis of life in the future. A greater limitation of the book is the lack of detail of the glass bead game. At the end of the book, i dont even have an idea of how a typical game might have played out. Baroque music and ancient Chinese architecture - does anyone know if these two can be mixed?

Definitely not a \\"page turner!\\"Having read Siddhartha some years ago and as I recall enjoying it, I thought I would like this book.However, I am plodding through and keep hoping it will get better, pick up, become interesting. It has so many shortcomings I don't know where to begin but to summarize I will use a sentence from a 5-star review \\"Absent from Castalia are action, creativity, originality, and experiment\\" substituting \\"the book\\" for \\"Castalia.\\" Where is the action? the creativity? originality? (one person says the main theme is the giving up of self to reach enlightenment - what's original about that? it's Buddhism in a nutshell!)Hesse uses (overuses) \\"big\\" words in a way that makes it seem we are to be impressed. I reminds me of someone I went to high school with who would write a paper and then go to the Thesaurus to find as many big word substitutes as possible, even though it made the paper awkward and pretentious.Another person who gave a low rating of this book hit upon one thing that I find to be not only a shortcoming but downright offensive - that is the fact that women are totally out of Hesse's thinking.I find it ludicrous that the book is supposed to be set in the 23rd century - so far nothing gives any feeling of its being futuristic! One of the ways that it completely lacks any creativity. In fact, much of the book feels ancient.The plot (?) is weak, the characters uninteresting, the writing cumbersome, arcane and esoteric (in the most negative sense of the word). There is no poetic or descriptive language. Hesse alludes to what \\"the game\\" is but never fleshes out the idea or gives any real description. It's all very vague, ambiguous, and unconvincing! Again a lack of creativity.In spite of the fact that I am an intelligent person who enjoys philosophical thinking and writing as well as poetry, so far this book is nothing but a dull struggle. I'm determined to finish it - and maybe, just maybe I'll change my mind. Perhaps I should try (as one reviewer suggests) reading it backwards!"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I'll just be honest: the Glass Bead Game is boring!! The only positive aspect of this book for me was that it kept putting me to sleep quickly.The first set of problems I had with the book might not be real serious, but they did bother me on a constant basis throughout, and that is that the book is quite dated. For example, women deem no serious mention by Hesse in this book at all. I had a hard time getting past Hesse's discrimination in this regard. The fact that his \\"utopia\\" is based on monastic corollaries provides no excuse; there should at the least have been some discussion about the convent analog and what the women Glass Bead Game players were doing. That might have added some interest, anyway. There are lots of other problems with dating in Hesse's supposedly futuristic society, but it appears most readers are content with them.So back to the main problem: the book is just really boring. It espouses meditation, and the positives of Buddhist philosophy, but in such a repetitive manner as to be somewhat mind-numbing. The positive descriptions of the supposed utopian society are easy to disregard, being obviously a sterile and inert society. It therefore comes as absolutely no surprise when Hesse informs us late in the book that this is so, and that the main character agrees. (yawn) The comparisons with other philosophies and religions I found lacking. The mysticism and meditative ideas were not novel or particularly interesting.I heard about this book from a friend that enjoyed Eco's The Name of the Rose. That was a book I really enjoyed. This one never resonated for me in any way."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I suppose you could say this was more than a little impenetrable.

There's no denying that it is long and not much physical action takes place, but it is definitely worth the time and effort. Hesse's subtlety is simply wonderful. He resists the need to tell the reader everything, and leaves concepts and ideas (like the Glass Bead Game itself) to the reader's imagination. The characters are wonderfully drawn, and by the end (which in itself is one of the most amazing things I've ever read) the reader is so completely involved with Joseph and his journey that one simply wants to be able to read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The book which won Hesse the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Steppenwolf and Siddhartha were favorites of mine when I was younger. This novel has made me question Hesse. I'd have to say that I did not like the main body of the novel, Magister Ludi. I wish I had been better able to get what Hesse was trying to convey by this long and tedious story. However, the three short stories at the end redeemed the book as a whole, for me. I found them enjoyable and they spoke to me more clearly. Why should this book be called the Glass Bead Game? Hesse fails to develope this very fascinating idea to any real depth. For me, he seemed to fall short in developing the aspects of the story that I found interesting so I really was left wondering what he was trying to say in the novel. Surely it couldn't be a mere commentary on academia, the ivory tower. The poems and stories at the end feel like a commentary on the novel, but as such render the Magister Ludi story more disappointing rather than less. I wished Hesse had stuck to his orgininal plan of making this a series of reincarnation stories, making the Magister Ludi story a shorter story at the end of the series. This might have given more resonance to the Magister Ludi story while you read it, rather than getting the further shades of meaning from the stories at the end only after having read Ludi. The Drama was really killed by the narrative style Hesse chose to use for Ludi, and should be a lesson to any writer never to use such a style, pretending to be an academic biography. And then there is Hesse's usual disdain for women.Of course, if you are a Hesse fan, you have to read this novel whether you like it or not. He seems to deal with many of the same issues in all of his novels. I intend to read the biography:Hermann Hesse: Pilgrim of crisis, by Ralph Freedman, to get more insight on this and his other work."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"...is the object of the game and we all are Magister Ludis one time or another.

Hesse provides philosophical insights of the level of an inebriated Dan Brown while his writing, admittedly in English translation, is worse. There is no sense of space or time and I don't mean that as a compliment. To make matters worse there isn't a single character in the book worth caring for, including the pompous Magister Ludi(crous). The book is a quick read compared to anything written by Joyce, Proust or Virgnia Woolf because unlike those masterpieces the Glass Bead Game has no substance whatsoever to check the reader's progress. When Hesse describes individual Glass Bead games, his literary handwaving reminds me of an Aesop's Fable I read as a child: An athlete gains quite a following by boasting about the incredible jump he recently performed in the city of Rhodes until someone less gullible than the rest of the townsfolk exposes him by simply saying, \\"Jump here then.\\" In other words, don't just use adjectives to describe how amazing a particular Glass Bead game is. Instead, show us how the game works or your book fails even as science fiction. Hesse's expository style of writing is so spectacularly bad that even thinking about it makes me cringe and feel embarrassed for the author. The only good that can possibly come from reading such a book is incidental; you realize that a Nobel Prize in Literature is just another meaningless label. Politically motivated literary prizes aside, it is my opinion after reading this book that Hesse is such a bad writer with such a large following, that he might eventually gain a historical notoriety that surpasses his current fame as a writer. Siddhartha, for instance, appears to be deep and full of meaning to certain Western audiences. If you are unfortunate enough to have fallen under its sway, get someone from India to deconstruct it for you and you'll laugh out loud. Throughout the Glass Bead Game I was hoping against hope that it would turn out to be a brilliant satire with a delayed-action bite but unfortunately Hesse appears to believe page after page of his own ponderous drivel. That's right folks, it's drivel. If you are unable to see that, you need to ask some long hard questions about your ability to critically read literature. Save your time, money and sanity. Don't bother with this book. It is as pointless as the game it describes."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I have had this book for years and it is the only Hesse book in my collection that I have not read all the way through at least once. It seems like a really good book, but the length keeps me from being able to finish it before I HAVE to read another book for school or just get to busy. By the time I come back to it I need to start over and that's a little frustrating. I think if you can find the time and get through a little rocky translation and to read it all without getting pulled too far away from it, it will be a very good read. Be prepared to be in for the long haul though, as with all Hesse books you do not want to rush through it and miss things. keep the faith, dEx"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Hermann Hesse is my second-favourite writer, but this is the only of his eleven novels which I found boring, bloated, and a chore instead of a delight and joy to read. It's not because it's long (I love long books, the longer the better in fact, and this book is far from the longest book I've ever read), but because there's a lack of focus on a real plot. Hesse was a master at writing short memorable novels; by the time this one ends, in media res, you get the feeling that he realised he'd created a monster and needed to slay it before things got any further out of control and there were another 400 or so pages dedicated to the life of Joseph Knecht! All of his other books, even the earlier less-memorable ones like 'Peter Camenzind' and 'Knulp,' can be summed up by giving distinct synopses of what happens in each chapter, or a memorable scene from each chapter. You don't get that here. It's so given over to the story of the life of the mind that it loses track of the lively things which make his other books so enjoyable. I never even made out any sort of plot beyond describing things that happened to Joseph Knecht. Hesse's other books usually have friendship as one of the important plots, like the friendships shared by Narcissus and Goldmund, Peter Camenzind and the poor cripple Boppi, and Max Demian and Emil Sinclair. The other characters in this book don't seem to do much in the way of friendship with Knecht besides philosophising. Father Jacobus would have made a great dramatic foil, but unfortunately he only appears in one chapter and then this potentially great character never shows up again. Even the most important foil, Plinio, gets bogged down in boring philosophy discussions. The closest we get here to a story of real human friendship is that between Knecht and the old Music Master, who is his mentor and father figure besides just a friend. This relationship is truly touching and one of the better parts of the novel.Other problems with this book, besides being overly long and being bogged down in bloated conversations and philosophical meanderings, is that we're never really told how this Glass Bead Game is played. We get a general sense in the Introduction on its origins, but other than that there's no sense of how it's played, or how Knecht and his friends go about making their own sketches for future Games. And if it weren't stated in the introduction, I'd have no idea this story takes place in the 23rd century. A story set in the future doesn't have to be a sci-fi story, but it at least should be obvious that this story isn't set in the present. Where are all of the future technologies, for example, and where are all of the women? The only woman in this book is Plinio's wife, who doesn't even have a name. This book reads like it was written during WWII, which it was, not like a true book about a futurist utopia. We don't even know who's telling the story; is it an original document, a biography by an Castalian admirer, or a biography from a non-Castalian?I also had a problem with Plinio Designori, the first person to come along and challenge Knecht to reevaluate the monastic and overly intellectual and stagnant lifestyle he's living in Castalia. After Plinio leaves the school, which he was attending as a privileged outsider, he doesn't return till their college years. He's offended and hurt that his friendship with Joseph isn't the same as it was before, and then years later, after Knecht has already become the new Magister Ludi, he confesses the depth of his feelings over this matter. I sympathise with Plinio, since this has happened to most people, but after you get over the wounded ego and hurt feelings, you usually come to realise that it's normal for friends to grow apart and develop other interests, particularly if they've been apart for awhile like he and Joseph were. People move on. This was bothering him for twenty whole years?The poetry section and the \\"Three Lives\\" stories are so much better and much faster reading. I felt the story finally majorly picked up when there were only about 20 more pages left to go, and then bam, it ends so abruptly, in media res, with a lot of unanswered questions. I think I would have liked this book a whole lot more had it been condensed into maybe 300 pages and given more room to exploring Joseph's relationships with characters like Father Jacobus, Fritz Tegularius, and Carlo Ferromonte. I can admire Knecht for following his convictions, even though they went against the grain, and coming to these beliefs only after decades of careful thought, but I'd be able to sympathise with him a whole lot more if we got a clear idea of just how he got those beliefs, instead of being bogged down in layers of bloated and superfluous verbiage."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I have just finished reading this book after a false start in college 8 years ago and after a month now. Siddhartha was a life changing novel when I read it as a college freshman and thought that maybe this would be as &quot;awakening&quot; for me now. However, I fear I read it too late and should have finished it 8 years ago when I was struggling with the notion of spending my life in academia. I came to the same conclusion about ivory towers that Knecht comes to about Castalia and moreover I have not regretted it as Plinio, nor did it take me a lifetime to realize. Knecht as a main character is rather lifeless and underdeveloped. It is this fact more than any other that makes this a difficult read. Even though Siddhartha clearly takes place at a point in history, it reads as fresh as if it were written today. On the other hand, The Glass Bead Game is so obviously written by someone living during World War II, or shall we say in the middle of the age of Fuillerton, that I found it quite distracting. Something along the lines of watching Soylent Green and having to believe that the world is going to be like that soon. I can appreciate it for a cautionary tale of stagnation and separation rather than synthesis; however, I don't feel the story itself truly captures the theme of transcendence which is a shame. I think that perhaps Hesse was trying too hard to infuse historical people and events into an existential idea and it doesn't really come off successfully for me. Moreover, there is no clear voice writing this story--at one point it's a Castalian telling a non-biography, at another it's a secondhand account, and at yet another it's an original document. This is a detriment to the storytelling, although I grant that it may have been used to reinforce the hypocrisy of Castalians being unable to successfully synthesize a single voice. I think Hesse was more successful at writing in shorter forms. The poems at the end were more poignant than the novel itself. Unlike Eco who is slow to start but then propels the reader forward, Hesse was unable here to compel me to keep reading. There are interesting ideas brought up and compelling notions, but as a novel I don't think it's his best. Perhaps this is a better read with a deeper knowledge of twentieth century philosophers, but it is this fact that keeps The Glass Bead Game from being timeless."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I'm usually the sort to give excellent authors their due. I have a tremendous admiration and respect for Hesse (who can read Steppenwolf or Siddhartha and be unmoved?), but The Glass Bead Game was, in my opinion, an exercise in reading the absolutely unreadable. After a hundred pages or so of attempting to awaken myself from what is purported to be an intellectually stimulating plot (the term &quot;plot&quot; here is used until such time as another word is coined to best define the quagmire in which Hesse would leave us sinking), I was prepared to disengage myself from this book at all costs - the idea of chewing off my leg in order to rid myself of this tome came effervescently to mind. However, I stuck with it, as it had been recommended to me by friends who obviously keep the book on their shelves to appear cerebral to visitors. Weeks later, lying exhausted in the muck that was this book, I promised to cleanse myself by reading not only the other Hesse books that I had come to love, but also those of his contemporaries. Wanna read a good book that espouses the same virtues? Give Mann's &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; a try. Sure, it's predictable, but it's also readable. Thanks for hearing me out."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I love many things about this book. The short stories at the end presented as the early writings of the Magister Ludi, the beautiful ending, and particularly Hesse's poetry. Since the day I finished the book, I've said that one can't come to a complete understanding of Hesse without reading it.That being said, however, I have to agree with those who say that Das Glasperlenspiel is ultimately a bloody boring novel. Glorious...yes. Brilliant...yes. Bloated and overlong? Sorry, but yes. One sees fewer high school students reviewing this work (check out the Siddhartha section here), but I suspect many of them would throw this book down after 50 pages...many of their teachers would too, as a matter of fact.By the time Glasperlenspiel was written, Hesse had become a truly poignant philopsophical/psychological figure...but it seems that some of his skill as a storyteller was lost in the process. In the end, I feel that I know something about Hesse's thinking because of this work...but I love him as an author because of Demian and Narciss und Goldmund."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The multiplicity of levels of reading greatly enrich a work of art or literature. It is the ability to master this multiplicity what distinguishes artists from artisans and good narrative writers from mere story-tellers. &quot;Das Glasperlenspiel&quot; is a great book, so great that one would be tempted to look for support on the strong endorsements that the book has received since its publication. Undoubtedly, the 1946 Noble Prize in Literature carries a lot of weight. One is left to wonder about the significance of the dates. Why was the greatest prize awarded to a man that despised wars at the end of the worst of them for a book published in the middle of it (1943)?The truth is that &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; would not have been conceived without the World Wars. But now that they have happened, one must be glad that something this good came out of them. This is not a book about war. As a matter of fact, it takes place at a time when war lies distant in the past. It is really hard to say more, it is up to the reader to define the meaning of the story: his own or his lack of one. It has as many potential readings as readers there are in the world.Of course, this is by no means a conventional novel and unconventionalism is not always fully appreciated. In addition, if you really enjoy this book, you will ralize how hard it must have been to translate it. I have heard of bad translations into English and Spanish, and of people who have ended up hating the novel because of them. I had the good luck of getting this recent edition with a translation by Richard and Clara Winston that reads excellently.I recommend &quot;Das Glasperlenspiel&quot; as THE best book that I have ever read.Transzendieren!"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"First time I read it when I was 15, and I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read.

While his earlier novels are full of force, angst, and dramatic desire, this is as simply serene, peaceful, and beautiful as its main character. It must not be missed."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Sorry, my English is not as good as my German! After having reviewed some of the comments I get the feeling that some American friends are used to read short and simple sentences!

I can imagine that the English translation could never reflect this beauty."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game should be required reading for anyone interested in the price of pursuing a &quot;life of the mind.&quot; Bringing together all of the aspects of the aesthetic life in the growth of the main character (Knecht), the book asks the central question: shall one give up living in the world as a result? The demands of chasing wisdom while addressing the needs of day to day living pre-occupied Hesse throughout his literary life. This predominant theme of his work reaches its culmination in The Glass Bead Game. It is a novel of exrtaordinary beauty and life...few pieces have ever reached deeper into the wellsprings of what it means to be &quot;alive in two worlds.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Yes, I agree with some of the reviews here that, of all Hesses books, 'Glass Bead Game' was difficult to follow at times, especially when compared to books like 'Demian', 'Siddhartha', etc. I had tried to read it several times & always my attention just drifted while in the middle of the introduction.The problem, for me, is the english translation, the one by Richard & Clara Winston (Who also did Klingsor). In 1969, after the book had already become quite popular in a different translation, ( one done by Mervyn Savill in 1948) someone decided that the book needed a new translation, one that would try harder to capture the style of the German version closer. The Winstons tried very hard to do that, but their version really seems so wordy, so verbose, that it often just loses you. It is interesting though, to compare the two versions to see just how different a translation can affect the style, the tone of the book. I would really like to learn to read German, only to read Hesse in the original language, & also so I could read the volumes of his letters, only a small percent of which have been translated into English.But yes, the 1st translation seems to hold your attention better from the first pages, much like Hesses other books do (at least FOR ME it does). To find it you will need to look in used bookstores, it has a white cover & is called 'Magister Ludi'. - The different title, in fact, was Theo. Ziolkowskis main problem with it, rightly feeling that both 'Journey to the East' & 'Bead Game' needed to be titled not after a hero, but instead for the 'realm' where the journey to discovery takes place. It would be like if 'Steppenwolf' had been titled 'The Magic Theater' because 90% of the story dealt not with Haller so closely, but the theater itself (it didnt do that, but thats what 'Journey' & 'Bead Game' are doing, in essance). But the fact that the 1st version had the wrong title doesnt make it an inferior bookl, especially if it is the version that is more enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This book took Hesse ten years to write, and largely because it turned out so differently from what he planned. His heroes having pursued the ideal spiritual-imaginative kingdom throughout his novels, one, Joseph Knecht, finally finds it in the futuristic Castalia--which he is forced to relinquish for reasons of higher calling. Absolutely awesome. Don't miss Knecht's soliloquy on &quot;cheerful serenity.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This is Hesse's last novel and, along with \\"Narcissus and Goldmund\\", the best. Basically it tells the life of Joseph Knecht, an orphan who, thanks to his intelligence, dedication, and strength of character, is chosen to be a member of The Order and to live in Castalia, the place of residence of the intellectual elite of an imaginary nation, at some point in the future. Through years of intense study, especially of mathematics, music, literature, and history, Knecht works his way up the hierarchical ladder. He gets involved in the Glass Bead Game, an enigmatic pastime that has become a true calling for many of the most brilliant minds. More than having a plot, the book is the story of Knecht's spiritual development. When his formal studies are over, Knecht, according to tradition, enjoys several years of free learning (we all should have that chance!), which he uses to visit his dear mentor, the Master of Music, from whom he learns that the goal in life is to attain wisdom, meaning a state of \\"cheerful serenity\\", through knowledge, music, and meditation. He also spends some time with a sort of hermit who lives in a Chinese garden, where Knecht meditates as he stares at a pond's fish, and learns to play the I Ching. But after that happy period, he is called back to Castalia, where he receives the comission to travel to a Benedictine monastery in order to build a diplomatic relationship with the Catholic Church. Finally, after several crucial services and an impressive development as player, he is designated Magister Ludi, the Master of the Game, one of the top positions at Castalia. He receives this distinction with mixed feelings for, although it represents the apex of his vocation, it entails serious administrative and political responsibilities which will take away precious time for study and meditation.In what follows, Knecht will find himself trapped between two opposing forces, represented by two old comrades: on the one hand, the intellectual emptiness of ordinary, social life, business, politics, etc. On the other, the emptiness of an intellectual life completely isolated from real human worries and tribulations, the practice of study as a vacuous game devoid of objectives. The resolution of this tension is the culmination of the novel itself, but not of the book, as it has, in the final part, three short stories of sacrifice, redemption, and altruism. They are very beautiful and can be read before the novel.This book may be interpreted both as a bildungsroman and a parody, with no mutual exclusion of both perspectives. It certainly is a moving and engaging story, the development of a strong mind always being interesting to look at, and of course Hesse's prose, at his highest point of maturity, is beautiful and inspiring. But there also seems to be, lurking in the background, a sense of mocking at intellectual life, as understood since the dawn of civilizations by priests, monks, hermits, and intellectual reclusives of all kinds. The book raises several important issues, such as the relationship between the intellectual experience and the vital, sensual, emotional experience. It could be said that one conclusion is that both, isolated and without mutual feedback, are worthless and leave humans alone. Instead, they should complement and nurture each other. Another conclusion may be that it is worth living bravely, humbly, serving our fellow humans, studying, and in general searching for that mysterious wisdom, that \\"cheerful serenity\\". But of course a complex and rich book such as this will contain different messages for different people, so read it and find for yourself."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Like so many teens, Siddhartha had a profound impact upon me, and in the next few years I set out to read all his works. Seeing the same message presented over and over as Hesse's style evolved provided some appreciation, but it also helped me realize a bit more how The Glass Bead Game was such an amazing achievement. Three years after it was published, Hesse won the 1946 Nobel Prize in Literature. It was his last work.While Hesse's masterpiece has the same theme as Siddhartha, it's not the same short, simple work as that and his other classics. Magister Ludi's inventive setting and method takes the basically unchanged storyline (gifted young man progressing, achieving, and finally discovering the true meaning of life), and creates a historical biography of the protagonist -- to include a collection of \\"posthumous\\" writings by the character.Different people will identify more readily with various incarnations of the Siddhartha/Demian/Steppenwolf/Josef Knecht character (Siddhartha, one of his earliest, is the easiest read), but Glass Bead Game is so worth any extra effort that may needed. I've read it several times, and will read it yet again."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game is presented as a biography, posthumously narrated by an evident admirer of the protagonist. This loving narrator's voice is vital for the charm of the book. The protagonist himself, Joseph Knecht, lives the life of a secular saint. The plot does not progress through overt drama. Indeed, Knecht has every wish fulfilled with scarcely any oppostion. The interest of the reader is sustained through a kind of magic - we are invited to see Knecht through the eyes of the narrator, and so share the narrator's love of Knecht.The laws of drama are not wholly ignored. While there is little external conflict, internally Knecht is conflicted. However, this conflict might not resonate with all readers. At one level, it is the conflict between attaining worldly success versus living a more personally fulfilling, but ordinary, life. The worldly success, however, is not of a material nature, neither monetary nor ostensibly political, but rather what would typically be considered intellectual, or even spiritual, achievement. It is as if Knecht is choosing between the life of the Roman Catholic Pope and the life of a Catholic monk, devoted to teaching school children. This is hardly the conflict which many of us face.Knecht does change, but the change is not catalysed by external events. Rather, it is more like watching a seed grow into a tree - the process of development is internally generated, the environment offering encouragement rather than opposition. Given the narrator's reverence for Knecht, it is a iittle like hearing a proud parent telling the life history of a favoured child.While the Order of Castalia to which Knecht belongs is secular, in the book links are made to the Roman Catholic Church. A subplot concerns the Castalian heirachy's desire for a closer association with the Catholic Church, seeing the two orders as compatible, and an alliance as beneficial to the survival of both. The Castalian elite are male, celibate, and renounce monetary success, in return for security and the freedom to pursue their intellectual cum aesthetic interests, these being scholarly and contemplative, akin to a spiritual endeavour. Sex is conspicuously absent in the book. Women are entirely peripheral. The analogy with the Catholic Church, its heirarchy and clerical life, is imperfect but suggestive; Hesse's engagement with Eastern religions also bears on his vision of Castalia, meditation explicitly featuring in Castalian practices, as do the ideals of detachment and control over one's emotions and desires. A further somewhat tangential link to Christianity resides in the fictional origins of the Glass Bead Game being said to lie in the study of the music of the 16th through 18th centuries, this being largely religious music, typified by that of J.S.Bach. In sum, Castalia feels like a curious amalgam of Catholic heirarchy, Buddhist spirit and practices, and the study of music is German academe.Being bereft of women, the novel has a certain sterile quality. Knecht is an orphan, so there is not even the background figure of a mother. Some commentators of Hesse have opened the question whether there is an implicit homosexual theme running through his work, but it is difficult to ground such readings in the text. If Knecht ever entertains a sexual thought, the reader is not allowed to eavesdrop.The introduction to this edition suggests that the narrator's pompous and protective voice is meant to be taken ironically, even humorously. It seems unlikely to me that many readers will laugh along with merry old Hermann. I can't imagine Groucho Marx, John Cleese, or Tina Fey would be seen as competition for Mr.Hesse. Maybe the irony tempers what would otherwise be an offensively reactionary veneration of a rigidly stratified society. How much it tempers this, I'm not sure. Hesse seems to be enamored of a world where there is a talented elite who are loved and elevated by their not-so-talented populace, and where even if one renounces the privileges of the elite, as per Knecht, still life is a matter of some kind of personal ascension towards rewards.The three \\"lives\\", or life stories, that end the book, were written by Hesse prior to the bulk of the novel. Initially, we're told in the introduction, he saw the Knecht chapter as being equal in length and importance to the other three tales. Things changed. In any case, his themes of attaining worldly success of one kind or another, and the vanity of such a quest in the face of mortality, are further explored - if anything more poignantly.To me, Hesse's vision is decidely abstract. He references religious writings, Jungian psychology, and music, more than he references his literary antecedents, and in this he is quite unlike most other celebrated writers of the early twentieth century. The reality that he does draw on is that of childhood, specifically a childhood shaped by the education system present in Germany in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, that is a system that is a formal meritocracy, one of the few ways to overcome barriers of class, with family at one remove. His protagonists feel detached from their own emotions, hoping instead to find security through the approval of others, usually older men in the role of mentors, or the approval of the impersonal system. Their relationship to the cosmos has a similar feel - they seek a benign protector, one who will treat them with the love that the narrator bestows upon Joseph Knecht in this book.I hope this review gives prospective readers some sense of what awaits. If you do like this book most of Hesse's work is self-recommending. Narcissus and Goldmund is probably the novel closest in feel."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The ending drops like a bomb. Intentional or not, it cuts against the rhythm of the long, well articulated story that leads up to it. I am still pondering why Hesse chose to end it in such a way. I'm sure many will agree and there are many differing conclusions why. Hesse's storytelling blilliance shines otherwise, using the Glass Bead Game as a mistical metaphor around which he spins his human and spiritual threads, rather than a concrete game that can be learned and brought into present reality which many readers spend too much time trying to do.That said, the three short stories at the end of the book are its crowning halos. They stand alone as brilliant delicasies worth owning and reading the book for."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This book was recommended by a friend (Mark F.) as containing the best summary of the point of the Book of Changes he had found. \\"We should be mindful of everything, for we can interpret everything.\\" But the GBG summary of the I Ching seems to start as Knecht (Hesse) goes to study with Elder Brother p. 111.

Having enjoyed that book -- When a friend suggested GBG -- I didn't hesitate to start it. The principal protagonist, Joseph Knecht (German for \\"servant\\"), in attaining the position of \\"Magister Ludi\\", becomes successful with minimal effort on his part in his life in Castalia, the province of the intellectual elite in GBG. Although this novel is set in the 23rd century, there are no obvious clues in the text that render the environment of the book to be futuristic. Thus one can read this work as if it had been set in the present day. A complementary world of organized religion exists along with Castalia -- In that world, Knecht comes into contact Father Jacobus and expands his knowledge of history. Both societies appear to be monastic -- And both view one another with suspicion. The only female character I can recall is the wife of Knecht's classmate from his youth (Plinio Designori) -- She is described as being cold and lacking in compassion [Knecht has 3 major friendships in this work -- All of which are meaningful and important at various points in the novel - Though they suffer due to Knecht's inaccessibility in his role as Magister Ludi]. At one point early on in the book -- Castalia is described as being a place where women are available to young men. But this element of Castalian society is never spelled out in detail. And so the Castalians seem to live as monks. Which comes as no surprise given that the \\"Glass Bead Game\\" is an ultimate synthesis of the philosophical, the intellectual, the artistic and the spiritual -- As opposed to the physical, the carnal and anything that could qualify as a baser element of human expression. The entire concept of The Glass Bead Game is veiled in mystery -- Which makes it all the more intriguing -- As the reader can only imagine how this game ultimately manifests, in the context of a technology existing 200 or more years from the present day.Knecht is blessed with an easy-going, pragmatic personality and is perhaps naive in his reactions to how his success has been thrust upon him. He is a \\"servant\\" who follows the path that has been presented to him. He does not stray or rebel, he takes advantage of every opportunity along the way, he masters whatever task is presented to him that will be necessary for him to move forward to the next level. At the same time Knecht appears to be genuinely creative and enough of a people person so that he can sublimate his energies into the social realm -- Thus minimizing any major professional conflicts. He is all business, he avoids and / or manipulates those who could be a threat to his career -- While simultaneously exhibiting compassion for his fellows. Knecht seems to be the envy of his subordinates and yet all is not well within his inner paradise, where his doubts and misgivings about Castalian society continue to multiply -- Via an expansion of knowledge gained through experience. He ultimately realizes that in the philosophical-intellectual-artistic-spiritual confluence that defines life in Castalia -- Its inhabitants live an over-protected, privileged world where they will never rub up against the shoulders of the common man living \\"outside Castalia\\". Most Castalians (with the exception of Knecht, who at one point is utilized by the Castalian hierarchy as a kind of ambassador-envoy) are unlikely to visit the world beyond their borders and to know the particular suffering of the \\"Outsider\\". If the reader were to see the world of GBG in a futuristic context, it could be viewed as a kind of \\"Star Trek\\" where the Castalians, in the manner of the Vulcans, have mastered baser human emotions via \\"meditation\\" (which could also be interpreted as \\"mind control\\"). The Castalian practice of meditation has taken the place of organized religion and their society is therefore technically godless.That being said -- Knecht is a spiritual man -- As well as one who wears masks for the sake of his career. As humble as he seems to have been portrayed in GBG -- Perhaps Knecht overreaches his grasp and ultimately tries too hard to be good. Thereby he attempts to share his goodness in situations where it is not called for or even desired. He may even be suicidal and unaware of it. He is after all a man blessed with so much good fortune that it would be easy for him to delude himself into thinking that no achievement exists that is beyond his grasp. Thus the end of the book is devastating: Although a tragedy is alluded to by the narrator, I had no idea what form it would eventually take. There are layered / multiple meanings inherent in the ending that I pondered over for days after finishing this novel -- There are so many ways that its conclusion can be interpreted. Fortunately the 3 chapters that ended the book (following a short addendum of Knecht's poetry), entitled \\"The Three Lives\\", helped me to recover from the unfortunate yet realistic conclusion of \\"Magister Ludi\\" Joseph Knecht's biography -- As well as to gain an understanding of the work in its entirety. Knecht has a lifetime of good luck behind him when he finally \\"disappears\\". Why this happens is as much of a mystery as the mystery of life and death itself. In the end the message that this book relayed to me is as follows: Even if one has everything planned out perfectly in one's life, and even if one successfully executes everything that one has planned -- All of that can be lost via the misfortune of one random event, through a thrust of fate, or by means of a miscalculation based on human error.In closing: The character who best represents the attribute of \\"goodness\\" in this novel is actually the Music Master -- Who guides Knecht forward in life -- Beginning in Knecht's childhood and onwards to his success in Castalia. In one haunting section of the book -- The Music Master is dying and essentially transforms into a blazing sunset of serenity. In this moment -- One can see the arc of a truly fulfilled life and the effect is almost chilling. The Music Master enters into a Nirvana-like state during his last days on the planet and Knecht is a witness to this metamorphosis. It is probably in this moment that Knecht realizes that this is how he would have wanted to be himself. But at this point it is too late -- Knecht has virtually been locked into his position as Magister Ludi -- A position he will be expected by the Castalian hierarchy to retain and maintain until the end of his days. Knecht, whether inadvertently or not, has chased power and fame, has been granted the gifts of its privileges, and will ultimately pay a price for having made that decision. His life becomes both a blessing and a curse. Though he becomes a master of \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" -- The game that he does not master, and that no man can master, is \\"The Game of Life\\".-- Stephen C. Bird, author of \\"Catastrophically Consequential\\""},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"I first read \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" in my teens and have since read it four or five times. True, it doesn't have the action/plot type format that most \\"Bestseller\\" readers are used to. That being said, the character of Joseph Knecht was remarkable. Because of this, the book was effortless to read.Sometimes one looks toward something greater than everyday life, everyday events, in order to escape. This is the perfect source of that escape. It revolves around a better world, a world of discipline and perfection,a world that could almost be compared (with a stretch of the mind) to Star Trek's Vulcan. Though this is, by no means, science fiction, the characters and background of this story are, so to speak, enlightened beings. They seek to perfect their various talents, whether it be in music, art or math, in an environment of peace and beauty. The world of The Order is almost like a cross between a monastery and an elite Vulcan training academy. And at the center of this world, it's shining star, is Joseph Knecht. It was so easy to be enamored of him, to become mesmerized by his progress through the system, and to admire him as he rose effortlessly through its ranks.But, equally important, is Hesse's beautiful prose. He weaves a story not unlike the The Game itself - enchanting, slowly-developing, yet effortless, flitting back and forth between the scenery of Waldzell and Castalia and Knecht's own thoughts and impressions. You are not bogged down in plot. But you savor it,as well as the path you take to get through it. This is not the kind of book in which you can look at the back and \\"know what happened.\\" And that is the reason why it is so readable, even repeatedly."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game...The title itself should provide the reader with some insight into the enigmatic, obscure world to which Hermann Hesse aludes in this, his Nobel prize winning magnum opus.

Give it a try if you have never read it."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Awarded the Nobel prize for literature in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the Geramn-born Swiss writer Hermann Hesse came to embody the cultural and spiritual values nearly destroyed by National Socialism. Nowhere is Hesse's commitment to those values more clearly evident than in the late, valedictory novel The Glass Bead Game. A futuristic work set in the fictional Pedagogic Province of Castalia, the novel exhibits many of the virtues and some of the flaws of his earlier works. The themes of his earlier fiction are all there: The concern with individual liberty versus collective responsibility, the romantic conceit of the gifted individual adrift in a hostile environment, and the self-absorbing search for spiritual liberation. What distinguishes the Glass Bead Game is Hesse's mature vision of a society estranged from the creative sources of tension and change without which no true culture can hope to thrive. Castalia is a museum of the mind, the Glass Bead Game a travesty of creative activity. With gentle irony, the author portrays the ways of the monastic order which inhabits Castalia, dedicated to preserving the non-renewable resources of a fomerly rich and now baren cultural province. Hesse's lifelong fascination with Baroque music and non-Western ways of thought are clearly in evidence: The Masters play the music of Bach and Froberger, study the classics of Chinese philosophy, delve into the mysteries of the Medieval alchemists and practice meditation. Buth whereas these arcane pursuits provide the citizens of Castalia with no more than the elements of the game, they gradually lead Joseph Knecht, the Magister Ludi, to a realization of the ultimate sterility of the community which has nourished and sustained him almost from birth. His contacts with the strife-torn outside world (echoes of wartime Europe) no less than his own reflections prompt his resignation from the position of Master of the Game and his return to the outside world as a private tutor. In his letter of resignation he recalls the original meaning of the Latin word &quot;magister&quot;: teacher. The need to impart knowledge in a practical, wordly sense heralds the beginning of Joseph Knecht's liberation, the liberation from the kind of alienated intellectual elite which stands idle as tyrants emerge to sway the masses to unspeakable acts of cruelty and devastation. That liberation is to end in Knecht's untimely death soon after his departure from the Pedagogic Province. Like his beloved music teacher, who in old age is unable to communicate save through an enigmatic smile, Knecht realizes that the end of all true creative activity is silence. Ultimately, the many pleasures afforded by a sympathetic reading of Hesse's novel are best summed up in the German word &quot;Heiterkeit&quot;, used to describe the best qualities of Castalia and the Magister Ludi himself, a word meaning both cheerfulness and serenity."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"This is Hesses testament and his most complex book. It took me 6 years to manage to read it, and I tried many times. If you want to read it you have to be prepared to put in an effort, if not, you should read his other books before you decide if it is worth it. Start with Demian, before Sidharta or the Steppenwolf (which is filmed and quite well also with Max von Sydow as Henry Haller (HH!)).If you want to get a feeling of the Glas Bead Game, read the introduction and then skip to the last part; the short stories which are excellent.If you like this boook, you will probably also like Zen and the art of Motorcycle maintainance by Pirsig, and you are probably also addicted to works of writers like Dostojevsky or Gunter Grass or Stefan Zweig?This is not a easy read and one needs to have reached a place in life to be able to appriciate it (which does not necessary have any thing to do with age). Therefor be patient and let it lay waiting for you until you are ready for it. I pity for those of you who have to read it to take some class, but I pity still more for those who give it for someone to read in class.

The first reading evoked an \\"awakening\\" experience, precisely as described -- this is not a coincidence -- in The Glass Bead Game and Hesse's autobiographical writings: my perception of the world, myself, and existence in general was forever altered. It was a mystical experience -- and not of the conventional variety. I expected my second reading, as with most books, to be less compelling, less significant. I also expected to discover aspects of the book that I disliked -- both in style and content. This, however, was not the case. The second read was equally as powerful; even after four years I can still feel the resonance of my first awakening experience. This novel has become, in a sense, my existential guide -- the only truly reliable source of wisdom that I have. Who else besides Hesse could bring together -- qua \\"rapprochement\\" -- the poles of modernism and, as I interpret it, the beginnings of postmodern thought?

Presumably she says that because it places itself in the future. Futurism is not, however, an attribute of science fiction. It is neither necessary (many science fiction novels are set in the present; some take place in the past) nor sufficient (many non-science-fiction stories are set in the future).Science fiction is fiction that explores the human consequences of technological change. One of the striking things about this 1943 novel is its apparent obliviousness to the industrial revolutions, the virtual absence in its stories and poems of industrial revolution technology. Radio is mentioned once briefly in passing, and automobiles are mentioned briefly in passing three times; otherwise this could easily have been written in 1750 (the year J.S. Bach, who is referred to often, died). The obvious intent, you might say, is to make the novel timeless, which should also explain why the society-within-a-society it depicts in the outer story is so strongly patriarchical. (The first of the protagonist's \\"lives\\", by the bye, depicts a matriarchical society.)Hesse is a writer concerned with the problems of the twentieth-century, but he is a creature of the nineteenth-century. He is essentially post-Romantic, which is to say that his style and his fundamental attitude are steeped in Romanticism. Textbooks conventionally asseverate that \\"reverence for nature\\" is characteristic of Romanticism. In fact, the Romantic Movement occurred just at the time it began to become obvious that technology was encroaching on nature, that nature was for the first time threatened. Romanticism does not entail \\"reverence for nature\\" so much as an awareness of a new natural fragility. In this sense, the seeds of science fiction are in much of Hesse's work, and I'm thinking of \\"Steppenwolf\\" in particular. What I called above an \\"apparent obliviousness to the industrial revolutions\\" is really a studied obliviousness. Hesse wishes to isolate certain concerns, but the others lurk as a backdrop, notable for their exclusion."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"In my humble opinion The Glass Bead Game is the greatest novel of the 20th Century. A fine piece of art which will simply weave its way into the readers subconscious as subtly as the sublime nature of its content will inspire a feeling of peace during and after the reading Hesse's opus.

Indeed many of my friends, from all accounts, have this book sitting on their shelf unread seeming to both call to them and daunt them as well. Oh my panthiestic friends, fear not childern for it is you who truly have the keys and a full tank of gas for your journey to self fulfillment.

My advice to these people is to finish the book, and by the end you should hopefully understand what Hesse was going for here. It is far more intricate than most of his other works, but it is worth finishing. Hesse explores almost every aspect of our existence and ends up summarizing an ontology that is an appropriate finale for his literary career."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"It's a synthesis.

Frankly, it's a wonderful dream.Despite the flaws of old literature and translations, I found this book riveting. The first fifty pages of background is not absorbing, and the style makes it hard it get into. The wonderfulness is because rather than the soul-crushing themes hedonism and nihilism present in so much modern 'literature,' this book is a celebration of living life and the best of man. The conceptualization of the Glass Bead Game itself overshadowed the flaws in plot structure and the overwhelming use of telling over showing into unimportant considerations.A classic work that's stood the test of time, much more than the sum of it's parts.

Rather than addressing symptoms, it addresses underlying spiritual, philosophical, and academic short-comings that crippled human growth in the XXth Century. The plot is both very straight forward, a biography of a man who is promoted to the highest academic office in his land, then goes through a crisis of professional conscience and resigns to obscurity, and very complex, almost rococo with delicate themes woven through out the larger story.The only caveat is that this book will be slow going until one has completed a couple of years of college. Some of his characters are academic archetypes, and unless you have spent time in the company of people who behave like that, they can be implausible.Simply by the conceptual scale of the book, it is hard to appreciate in a single reading. It is devoid of action, relationships are muted and subtle, but the vision of a society that appreciates selfless intellectual achievement is inspiring. At the same time it carries cautions about how noble endeavors can fail.I can't recommend this one highly enough. At the same time I probably shouldn't read it again; developing a social conscience at my time of life is not seemly.E.M.

I tried to read The Glass Bead Game when I was 17 and couldn't make it past page 100 or so. I tried again when I was 20 and have not seen life the same since. In Siddhartha, Hesse told the meandering story of life as a river, but in The Glass Bead Game life is expressed as the unfolding of a perfect and precious blossom: sprouting, reaching, blossoming, and falling to the ground to enrich the flowers that come after. I have since read the book three more times, and am wealthier after each experience. This is, to me, the greatest novel of all time."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"A true world masterpiece. Beware, this &quot;hardcover&quot; edition is an ugly orange library-quality binding with no dust jacket, in other words, hideous. I immediately hid it in a paper jacket. Additionally, the quality of the pages is only a half step up from recycled tabloid paper stock. Hesse and the Winstons deserve better."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"The Glass Bead Game, Hesse's culminating work for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1946, expresses the author's view of life as a quest for intellectual and spiritual unity in an imperfect world. The tragic though rejuvenating story is told through a novel (biography of Joseph Knecht), followed by a collection of poems and three short stories, presented as the posthumous publication of Knecht's fictional writings during the student and scholar phases of his rapid ascent to the venerated post of supreme game master, Magister Ludi.In Hesse's own life--which included upbringing in a Christian missionary household, an early religious crisis, suicide attempt, broken marriage, time in a sanatorium and reclusive final years--an attraction to Eastern religion and philosophy (yin-yang, Buddhism, reincarnation, etc.) influenced him greatly, resulting in the dichotomies pervasive in his work: nature vs. mind, intellect vs. meditation, service vs. awakening, real vs. \\"other\\" world, etc. The \\"Game\\" of the Glass Bead Game is an intellectual-meditative game played by elite members of Castalia, a rarified society co-existing alongside but separate from the real world. Like the overall novel itself, the specifics of the game--intriguingly described as embodying the cumulative and highest accomplishments of the human mind during the future-in-time, however neither politically nor technologically futuristic, circa 25th century world in which the story is set--remain nebulous, implicitly suggesting the incompleteness of our collective human understanding of how to achieve intellectual and spiritual oneness.In the main story, Knecht gracefully advances from disciple to master but, almost as naturally as the transitions from one stage to the next earlier in his life, he experiences a mid-career \\"awakening,\\" triggering his sudden resignation from his esteemed position as Master in Castalia and leading him to choose the humbler role of teacher-tutor to young students in the outside world. Similar spiritual awakenings affect the lives of characters in the short stories: the Rainmaker (Knecht), after losing his perceived ability to foretell the weather, health and well-being of his tribe, must sacrifice his own life to appease the angry gods; old Father Dion, plagued by self-doubt following years of service listening to the confessions of countless sinners of the world, is strengthened enough spiritually to dig his own grave after realizing that the other priest (Joseph) has also undergone the same crisis of self-confidence; and Indian royal prince Dasa, in going full circle from child crown prince to ostracized cow herder and back to royal prince, becomes ruler of the people and, through an inevitable war with antagonistic neighboring territories, loses his son, wife and palace and is imprisoned in the enemy's dungeon, but mystically awakens in \\"a dense miniature forest within the great forest,\\" transcending the real world as disciple of an enlightened yogi.Despite the tragic inability of each of Hesse's heroic characters to \\"solve\\" an insurmountable problem within the boundaries of the world through which they define their own intellectual achievement, social position or political success--a limitation that ultimately leads each to appeal to individual, other-worldly, arguably \\"escapist\\" solutions--the ending of each story does offer a ray of hope: Knecht drowns but his friend's son, Tito, is awed and changed by his newly appointed Master's death to \\"demand much greater things . . . than he had ever before demanded of himself\\"; the Rainmaker's son, Turu, consecrates his father's body on the pyre and becomes the new Rainmaker; Father Dion and Joseph find spiritual strength by working together to overcome their mutual weakness; and Dasa discovers inner peace in the yogi's timeless meditative world, albeit separate from the real world he came from.Both Hesse's own life and his fictional creations exhibit the irony of spiritual disquietude harbored within outward success. While the other-worldly awakenings Hesse offers may be spiritually sublime, I personally would prefer to see fuller \\"this-worldly\\" solutions to the profound problems so well articulated by the author. For example: what if Knecht could elevate the game to a still higher level (and tell us curious readers specifically how music, mathematics, logic and philosophy encompass the depths of all intellectual insight, reaching beyond the book's sweeping generalities) and integrate Castalia with the real world, instead of suddenly drowning in an icy lake?; what if the Rainmaker were to expound to the village head a new wisdom acquired through careful study of climatic fluctuations, instead of succumbing to outmoded traditions and sacrificing his life?; what if the holy men, Dion and Joseph, were to leave their hermitage and join the real world, showing the commoners how to live a dignified life above sin?; and what if Dasa could succeed in teaching the neighboring princes the mutual advantage of peace over war, instead of losing the battle and slipping into the yogi's dreamlike world? For me, true heroism means facing real world issues head on and improving our current standing from within, rather than opting for the other-worldly Hesse-ian path, however magical and enticing that mystical alternative may seem."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"_What is the Glass Bead Game? It is no less than the highest reason that an entire future civilization exists. It is the grand and ongoing synthesis of all knowledge into a unified, integrated whole (a Unio Mystica.) It is an attempt to forge a holographic intellectual world where all is interconnected and reflected in every part. This is a mission to weave the golden thread of significance and meaning through every part of a culture- science and the arts and the spiritual are all unified into a system of concentric, interpenetrating rings. All this is primarily accomplished by using the language of music and mathematics as common universal symbolism (the \\"glass beads\\" are part of a symbolic physical aid that was once used for this purpose.)_It is no wonder that the book places the first origins of the game with Pythagoras, Gnostics, and Socratic ethics. No wonder that the League of Journeyers to the East also figure prominently in its development. To some extent the Game has been the goal of all sensitive and introspective individuals and groups down through the ages._All of this stands in stark contrast to our own Feuilletonistic Age where all knowledge, all culture, is unsynthesized, chaotic, and largely meaningless babble._The crisis that develops from this is that even if you accomplish this grand synthesis in some isolated ivory tower refuge of intellectual contemplatives- it isn't enough. It is necessary to reach out to the entire society once it is achieved in the same way that a bodhisattva attempts to enlighten the rest of mankind instead of individually passing onto Nirvana. The entire society must be made whole and sacred and not just an isolated elite. This is the realization that comes even to the Magister Ludi, the Master of the Game._For the game to be ultimately meaningful we have to coach everyone to eventually become Masters."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"Alright, I just finished reading this mammoth novel a few moments ago, except for the short stories at the end. The AP english class at my school had to read it last year and this year there were extra copies so I grabbed one thinking alright this might be fun. Well, I'll admit, I struggled with it. And I'm a pretty avid reader but I had to put it down and read other things in between. In the end though, it's remarkable. When Mann said this was a &quot;treasure of purest thought&quot; he hit the mark. The next to last chapter &quot;The Circular Letter&quot; changed my whole way of looking at this book. Yes, it's dry. And Yes, parts of it may seem boring and too drawn out. But for the reader that toils through it, it's an amazing novel and very deeply thought out. There are times I wanted to burn this book, but now I'm honestly very glad I read it. It's beautiful and more relevant to today's day and age than one might think. In that sense I suppose it's timeless."},{"Title":"The Glass Bead Game","review":"An amazing novel encapsulating much of eastern philosophy and thought as it tries to reconcile it with western hubris, expectation, and dissatisfaction.

Did you know that you can get a tax refund if you spend x number of dollars in a Parisian store? Feldman explains how this works, and much, much more.Paris is normally thought of as an expensive place to live -- and of course it can be -- but the author shows you how to circumnavigate this popularly conception of Paris. It may make an expatriate of you, as it apparently has of her.The book is divided into convenient chapters, so that whether you are eyeballing food, clothing, perfumes, supermarkets, wine, flea markets or more, she will send you to the right places once you read the right chapters.

It's publication date was 2004 and so a lot of information is outdated, which is why most travel books are published annually. If a book isn't going to be updated, they should avoid putting information in there that can become quickly outdated. For instance, they say gorilla permits in Uganda are $275, but the cost has risen twice since then and they are now $500, so the traveler that read this book and decided to go see gorillas would be in for a nasty surprise.Some other incorrect information may be less important, but really embarrassing. For instance, it calls Dar Es Salaam the capital of Tanzania. It is the largest city and referred to as the \\"commercial capital\\", but Dodoma is the (political) capital. It can be a bit confusing, but you expect travel books to get this stuff right. Also, the book states that Churchill called Uganda the pearl of Africa, but it was actually Hemingway. Shoddy work, especially for something published by Fodor's.Finally, the information is generic. I found this information, and much more, for free on the internet. For instance, it talks about the Great Migration in East Africa happening in a clockwise fashion annually. Well, that doesn't help you know where you need to be if you want to see the Migration and are there in May, for instance. However, there are sites on the internet that show the migration circuit and you can choose where to be at what time of year. All the dos and don'ts and packing lists and entry requirements are also easily found on the internet. And the list of National Parks in many of the countries is lacking. For Tanzania and Uganda it misses a bunch of them. As far as I can tell, there is pretty much no reason to use this book at all.

If you struggle with finding what relationships or &quot;items&quot; in your life need the most attention, then this book is for you. Howard shares from experience. From being a pastor, a dad, a seminary professor, and a man who loves the Lord, this book shares from the heart of someone who has lived out what he is writing. Because of this, this book is transparent and gives hope to those who live in the &quot;tyranny of the urgent&quot;."},{"Title":"Balancing Life's Demands: A New Perspective on Priorities","review":"The original book by J. Grant Howard was a text book at Bible college. This book influenced my perspective of priorities.I grew up hearing about the heirarchial approach of priorities. For example, God is first, then your spouse, then children/parents, then job, etc. But do we spend over 40 hours a week serving God, with our spouse, and with our children? It looks great on paper but is impossible to live out consistently.Howard proposes a different model. God is the central priority. Then, there are the other various priorities all connected to God. Thus, there may be times when one priority becomes more important than others, but each area of our life is under God's authority."},{"Title":"Balancing Life's Demands: A New Perspective on Priorities","review":"Dr. Howard was Professor of Pastoral Ministries at Western Seminary in Portland Oregon.

After counseling, Greg is excited and thinks that he is going to have his cake and eat it too. Greg and Rena start their search by going to swinger websites. In the story, swingers are people who are looking for others to have sex with no strings attached. Greg and Rena may get more than they bargain for from this experience.Each of the book's chapters is told from either Greg or Rena's perspective.

The novel follows a married couple Rena & Greg who are having marital trouble. After what amounts to yet another affair being blown wide open, Rena gives Greg one last option, marriage counseling. However, things quickly go from the couple trying to help keep their marriage in tact, to the idea of swinging. When all along, Rena has a growing bi-curiousity that she is very willing to explore and understand. Greg being the alpha male sees this as an all out opportunity for a endless buffett of women to sate his very strong libidonious appetite.Ferguson not only delves into the \\"lifestyle\\" but also the emotional issues at stake for such an undertaking. Greg and Rena have built a very shaky house of cards and through one careless act, causes that house to fall down around their ears. Readers are given detail after detail of the emotional and physical aspects that the couple goes through. The one thing that is very clear from the very beginning of the novel is that Rena is very much exploring a different side of herself. She is cautious yet very willing to understand and learn. Greg however still only sees this as a way to have conquests. He doesn't care about what his wife is going through.Greg does finally learn some lessons but in the end it may be lessons learned too late to save him or his marriage."},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"I started and finished this book in one evening. This is the best book I have read in a while, and I haven't given a book 4 stars in a long time. There are so many good things to say about this book....for one the sex scenes make Zane's stuff sound elementary and the characters have a way of jumping off the page.I know men like Greg.....and maybe some undercover freaks like Rena. The language was so real to me and a lot of authors these days have a hard time using real up to date language with their characters. I loved how the story was told just from the POV of Greg and Rena and how comical the book was at times...I found myself laughing out loud numerous times. I will agree with other posters and say that Mr.Torrian Ferguson needs to invest in an editor next time as there were a lot of typos and some of the background facts in the story did not stay consistent. Editing did not keep me from loving this book. I also have a problem with people sounding preachy, but the religion in this book was perfect and not over the top.

Greg, possessing the typical male ego, feels his quest is to conquer as many women sexually as he can, while expecting his wife to remain home faithful. Since Greg doesn't seem to be able to cure himself of his philandering ways, Rena takes on an \\"if you can't beat \`em, join \`em\\" attitude.Swingers opens the door and allows the reader to share in the sexual escapades of Greg and Rena Robbins, those of which I found to be a little too good to be true at times. In an effort to salvage their marriage, Greg, a successful senior advisor at a major stock brokerage, and Rena, a pediatrician with her own practice, take the advice of a counselor and open themselves up to new and daring sexual explorations as a married couple...with other couples. In doing so, they also open themselves up to the repercussions that result from their promiscuous behavior. Will their vows of \\"for better or for worse\\" be able to withstand the tribulations Greg and Rena must endure and overcome as a result of fulfilling an underlying fantasy? Or will this be another case of curiosity killing the cat, or in this situation, the cat and the dog?Upon completing this novel, I was left with astonishment. For these to be professional adults, I found the antics of the characters to be over the top and quite frankly, childish. Their reactions to certain situations are those I would expect from my teenage son. In addition, the typos, incorrect grammar, and content inconsistencies hindered me from fully enjoying the story, causing me to stumble every few pages or so. My suggestion to Torrian would be that even though you had an interesting and risqu&eacute; plot, invest in an editor so your readers will be able to better enjoy the story you have penned.With some scenes actually causing me to blush, I would have to say this book is perfect for the uninhibited reader, which leaves me to wonder what Torrian plans to put out next for his awaiting, and curious, fans.

Thier fantasy WENT beyond curiosity and it led them to a greedy lifestyle that unfortunately would end.You know the saying what happens in the dark comes out in the light and soon enough they will regret everything. All in All, this book turned out to be TOO HOT TO HANDLE!!"},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"For anyone who has ever been married or thinking about it Swingers should be put at your bedside. Mr. Ferguson takes the reader on a journey where to the naked eye will freak your brain. That is until you let loose and free yourself in his book. For those of you out there that think you have the player game on lock, I dare you to take the time to read this book you will never think about sex the same. With the correct publicity this book has the potential to be a best seller over and over and over again."},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"Before I tear it all to shreds, let me first say that Mr. Ferguson is clearly a talented writer. Nevermind the grammatical errors or how one minute his first-person characters are talking in past tense then in the next, speaking to you in the present. At least the man knows how to tell a story and keep you turning the pages.Like a lot of erotic fiction writers though, he gets all preachy at the end, go with God and all of that. That's all well and good, but why do so many erotic fiction writers get this way at the end of their books? It's sad how they all act like they need to apologize at that end of the book for \\"exposing\\" us to all of that graphic sexual material...like we didn't buy the book solely for that purpose.Here is my main problem with it. While Mr. Ferguson obviously did a little homework on the lifestyle, he clearly is not, and has never been a swinger, and I found his portrayal of the lifestyle teetering between realism and complete BS throughout the whole book. It was entertaining, and there are certainly a few idiots like Rena and Greg that get involved in the lifestyle for all of the wrong reasons, but I didn't like how the lifestyle gets blamed for sending their already ruined marraige further down the toilet.Over all the story is well written but to me it's just another book that perpetuates the negative, (not to mention repetitive and largely untrue) stereotypes involved with the swinging lifestyle. The real moral of this story is that if you are a selfish, deceitful, arrogant, idiot, things will go badly for you no matter what lifestyle you choose to live. But you already knew that, I hope."},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"Swingers is certainly the exception to the rule of \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\":-) The title appropriately does it justice. Greg is a pretty boy who know his looks & charm can get him just about any piece of booty that his third leg desires. Rena is Greg's wife who's pretty mundane when it comes to their sex life. What Greg doesn't know, is his wife secretly desires women and wants nothing more than to explore her curiosity which leads to them swinging to an ultimate low. Even after Greg has a woman willing to do whatever, where ever, with whom ever is he still not satisfied with having his cake and eating it too. ANY sexual thought you've ever/not imagined lies right here in this hot, erotic, explicit, raunchy, slutty, explosively freaky novel and I loved every bit of it!"},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"This book is HOT! A quick read and very interesting! Ferguson has really made me look twice at my neighbors! \\"Swingers\\" is a great book to share with good girlfriends, significant others and married couples!

Rena learns the hard way that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. I loved the book! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. As a sister I could relate to and appreciate the plight of Rena in dealing with her husband, and as a single woman I appreciated the details of the swinging life as seen by author Torrian Ferguson. I'm hoping for a sequel to this book. Shame on the editor for so many typos though. How unfortunate for Torrian his novel was filled with so many misspelled words. I still say it's an excellent book though, in spite of..."},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"I picked this book because it was recommended to me through Amazon because I LOVE the Eric Jerome Dickey books. I was sceptical but thought I would give it a try. I'll tell you what if it ever even crossed my mind to do something like this this book changed my mind. Scandelous, steamy sex, and unfaithfulness is my summary of the book."},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"Swingers was a quick and on your toes read! Mr. Ferguson crafted and novel that made you get a good look at Swingers. What I truly enjoyed the most was when the main character Greg thought he was \\"gettin' his\\" when all along his wife was \\"gettin' hers.\\" That's what happen when a cheater thinks they're getting over.I recommend this book to all especially book clubs because it makes for great discussion. I know it did in my club, the Ujima-Nia Book and Social Club. Can't wait to read the next one.Shannon N. DavisAuthor ofNothing Like Friends and Monogamous Intentions"},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"Usually when I read threesomes, it's really all about the sex, but Torrian Ferguson actually gave me a story. WOW! What a concept.Swingers was a well written story that dealt with the issue men and women face with a threesome along with a twist. The author was great at presenting this issue to readers and he now has a lifetime fan... or stalker. I especially loved the ending and how he really came full circle with the marriage between the main couple.I was so dizzy, excited, enthralled and titilated by the end of the book. He gave me inspiration to write my own erotic novel. Thank you so much and BTW, I read this book three times and not just late at night when i was lonely either. The plot was just that good!!"},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"This was a great book. Greg and Rena have been married for 11 yrs. They have two children.Greg has a good job with stocks and Rena is a doctor. There marriage isn't so happy. Greg is a player. He cheats on Rena whenever he sees a fine woman. She allow's it b/c she says 'if i didn't see it, he didn't do it.' Well, that changes when Shonda, a young ghetto chick calls the house and tells Rena she was in her bed, her tub, using her soap and doing her man. That's when Rena says she's had enough.She makes Greg go to marriage counseling, but there's a twist. The doctor is a gay friend of Rena's, of course Greg doesn't know he's gay or is Rena's friend. He tells them that they should allow women into their bed, to understand why Greg likes to cheat. What Greg doesn't know, is that Rena wants to do a woman.They eventually become swingers and it eventually destroys their character. Let's just say they each find out a lot about one another. They find out how freaky one can get, as well as heart break.This book is filled with sex, drama, and everything you can think of.This is a hot read:)"},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"When I recieved this book as a gift, I was so waiting to read it. I could not put this book down for one second. I read this book in one day. This author had me on the edge of my seat. I really enjoyed every single page.. Very good work."},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"They say the freak in you comes out at night and for Rena Robbins in SWINGERS, this could not be closer to the truth. For most of her life, she has yearned to be with another woman and it began long before her husband Greg stepped into her life. Greg has been cheating for most, if not all, of their marriage, but when Rena receives a phone call from one of the women he has been sleeping with, she takes a stand. Though hurt from discovering that Greg is in fact cheating, Rena seizes the opportunity to make her hidden desires come true and she goes all out. She invites her husband to seek help from a marriage counselor for what she claims will repair their marriage. The counselor suggests they admire women together.Never in his wildest dreams does Greg imagine the ultimate game being played on him. Rena is secretly excited because she will have the opportunity to do what she's always desired. So she gets on the Internet and starts her search to find a female she finds attractive. Since her willing husband thinks he has a license to cheat, he agrees with her plan and sits back to take the ride. However, in searching for this female, Rena enters into a new place she had not considered and the lifestyle of swinging.In SWINGERS, Torrian Ferguson has given us a peek into a lifestyle that many people have embraced as a way to spice up their sex life. Even though Rena set out to get her desires met, she really discovers more about her husband and herself in the process. I like the way this story unfolds and gives the reader some voyeuristic peeks which allow him or her to engage their personal thoughts on the subject of swinging. A definite page-turner, SWINGERS will keep you entertained until the very end.Reviewed by Nina Lewisfor The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"This was a very good book.

Rena is sick of Greg cheating on her throughout most of their marriage. When she confronts him they both agree to get counseling. When the doctor advises them to bring another woman into their bedroom Greg is ecstatic; now he can have his cake and eat it too!

What Greg doesn't know is his wife has developed a \\"curiousity\\" for women.

And Greg(the unfaithful husband)he seemed to change gears toward the end of the novel. At first he was God's gift to everyone and toward the end he settled for the unthinkable. I grew to dislike Rena's action when she didn't care about her husband's pride. Even though he was a cheater he tried to keep his affairs away from her. But she was determined to disgrace him and that could never be forgiven. I think she got a taste of her own medicine fooling with Lisa and her thug friends but still her request to her husband was unforgiveable.

Their fantasies may turn into a nightmare if their professional colleagues find out what goes on behind their bedroom door. Are they willing to risk it all?Swingers is a spicy, erotic, novel by Torrian Ferguson. What I liked about this novel is that from the title and the very first sentence you know exactly what this book is going to be about. Ferguson gets to the meat of the story right away and doesn't fool around with needless dialogue or pointless sub-plots. There is also a valuable lesson to this story: You have to know the rules in order to play the game. The jaw-dropping scenes were so captivating, it was almost like you were watching a movie. This story is so fast paced that I literally could not stop reading until the very end. Although the topic in Swingers was risqu&eacute;, you will be totally submerged into this story.

Hopefully, this is just the start of a long career for this author."},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"Handsome well respected couple Greg and Rena has been married for eleven years.

Dr. Pamplin's advice: bring another woman into the bedroom so Rena can see what interestsher man!Whoa! Author Torrian Ferguson certainly \`kicks it up a notch' with this fast-paced read. The title alone lets you know sex is a factor, but scenes in this book will have you doing anything from cringing to blushing and maybe even congratulating the characters for releasing their sexual inhibitions. Torrian has shown he has a knack for writing erotica and attention grabbing fiction, but given the subject of this book, I would like to have seen more reference to safe sex than just a single condom out of many escapades.Nevertheless, the story flowed nicely with the exception of a few instances when the author flips from first person point of view to third. The plot was intriguing, I wanted to follow and understand each characters motives, so I was disappointed when at one point Greg sets up a tryst with another key character and the book continues with no follow up on the subject. Even still the ending was neatly wrapped up and has me wondering what will be next from Torrian Ferguson. There's no doubt about it, \`Swingers' is a page turner and lovers of the genre will find a new favorite in it.EnglishrulerARC Book Club Inc.Star Rating: 4 stars"},{"Title":"Swingers","review":"from the very first paragraph, this book draws you in and captures your attention.

Don't be misled by its title, it is NOT a survey of the molecular electronics field. Instead, it's based on the very particular technology and experience of Prof. Tour and his colleagues.The book's contents are primarily: (a) a very brief commentary on the nanotechnology business, based on Prof. Tour's experience, (b) a description of particular technology of Prof. Tour's start-up, and (c) detailed chemical synthesis protocols for compounds relevant mainly to Prof. Tour's company's technology. Part (c) is by far the longest segment of the book.I was benchmarking for a possible VC investment in this field around the time this book was written. Prof. Tour's company was among those I looked at (albeit without any direct interaction with the company or Prof. Tour himself). On that basis, I'd suggest that his description of his start-up experience might not be particularly enlightening for others. The fact that it's described in a turgid and pompous style doesn't help, either."},{"Title":"Molecular Electronics: Commercial Insights, Chemistry, Devices, Architecture and Programming","review":"This book is great!

We might push back and concede that the controversy began with Darwin and his famous theory, but this is wrong, too. The battle between Galileo and the church had been fought centuries before (the church nominally won, to its shame), and then Christianity versus science was stilled, but it wasn't Darwin who reactivated it. For 200 years before Darwin, scientists and philosophers had faced the difficulties that Enlightenment thinking had brought for those who thought the Bible literally true. In _Before Darwin: Reconciling God and Nature_ (Yale University Press), Keith Thomson has given the history of the conflict before Darwin's Theory of Evolution was proposed and became the cornerstone of biology. He examines thinking on both sides of the issue, and is fair to both; after all, science came up with flawed evaluations for, say, the age of the Earth or for heredity, and the clerics came up with explanations that only seem absurd with the hindsight we have the luxury of displaying from the twenty-first century. It is a great story of a march toward eventual understanding, full of odd personalities and dramatic events.The main figure in this book is William Paley (1743-1805), a \\"somewhat shy, shambling figure, built short and square,\\" who wrote many books on faith, but it is his final book, _Natural Theology_, that made him famous, and its ideas are still used by creationists and those who favor Intelligent Design today. Even Darwin was impressed by it, before he toured the world and started coming up with his own ideas. He said it gave him as much delight as Euclid did. Paley's famous contribution to the argument was that of finding a rock on a heath versus finding a watch; it is all too clear that the watch has a designer. (In England, indeed, Thomson's book is titled _The Watch on the Heath_.) Similarly, anything as complex as a living organism must obviously have a designer, and of course the world had a designer, too. This argument was not original to Paley (it goes back at least as far as Cicero) but he expressed it so forcefully as to make it his forever. There was more to Paley's book, and he accepted as an intellectual ally Thomas Malthus. He helped promulgate Malthusian ideas, such as how people showed overproduction of their numbers and that the environmental economy changed in the struggle for existence. Paradoxically, therefore, Paley was advocating two of the fundamentals that would power Darwin's ideas. The theme of such connections between those promoting faith and thereby eventually assisting the triumph of science runs throughout Thomson's book.Christians had to reconcile their faith with what scientific evidence demonstrated to them, not only about the age of the earth but about the imperfections within creatures and the amorality of animals in competition for resources. Thomson shows that the way forward for Christians devoted to their Bibles as well as to natural history was to accept that the sacred texts were not scientific texts, and were metaphorical. Science and religion would deal with two different realms. They could always satisfyingly trump science with a \\"That's the way God made it\\" or \\"That proves God's benevolence,\\" but this in itself indicated a basic acceptance of the scientific truths first. The alternative of rejecting science's findings entirely remains attractive to many, but also rejects the simple fact that over the centuries, science has proved to be a better way of explaining the way the universe works (setting aside such fields of enquiry as ethics or salvation). Those who make such a rejection loudly insist that there is controversy over Darwin's ideas when actually there is no such scientific controversy, but Thomson's fine book shows that they are merely participating in a long losing battle. The battle didn't start with Darwin."},{"Title":"Before Darwin: Reconciling God and Nature","review":"When we think about the modern biological sciences, one name invariably pops into mind: Charles Darwin. Keith Thomson's book, \\"Before Darwin: Reconciling God and Nature,\\" looks at the approximately two centuries of science that predate Darwin, partially in an attempt to see what influenced him, but mostly because it's a fascinating history in and of itself. Thomson is almost wholly concerned with an age in which all natural science (then still often called \\"natural philosophy\\") was almost always natural theology - that is, an understanding that the study of science and nature would draw one close to understanding the mind of God. William Paley, the eighteenth-century English naturalist whose book \\"Natural Theology\\" had a tremendous influence on Darwin's early career, thought that the ways of God are shown to man through a rigorous and critical study of the natural world.We get a quick, breathless account of big scientific developments from Copernicus to Newton, and see that the more we learn about God, the less ground natural theologians have to stand on. Thomson rhetorically asks, \\"Once Pandora's Box was opened and a new, lesser, role ascribed to God, who could predict where matters would end?\\" (p. 44).The rest of the book is taken up with discussing the contributions of several scientists, many of them not nearly as recognized as they should be, including Thomas Burnet, John Ray, Robert Plot, and Martin Lister. Paley and Ray especially built an argument from design, but there was one glaring problem: it's clear there are many things in nature that are not perfect, and that don't look like they were designed. The human eye - commonly adduced by modern-day creationists as an example of \\"irreducible complexity\\" - has a blind spot that lacks photoreceptors and therefore would make us more susceptible to attacks from predators if we still lived out in the open. The sacroiliac region at the base of the spine is mechanically imperfect to bear our weight, which often results in back pain as we age. Someone convinced that the human body is a perfectly designed machine can't explain the appendix, a vestigial organ for which there is no observable purpose.What Thomson seems to be saying is that natural theology had a historical tendency to reverse engineer science to fit its own theological ends. Therefore, what we see here is not so much science as we would understand the term today, but the use of science as a kind of anthropocentric cherry-picking to shore up preformulated beliefs, namely the creation accounts (there are two of them) in Genesis. Ironically, these culminate in a the work of Steno, a Dutch geologist and anatomist who was blithely unconcerned with how much his own work - the work of a Catholic bishop, mind you - confirmed or denied the accounts in Genesis.There's tons of other fascinating stuff in here that I won't get into about interpretations of the fossil record (apparently people used to think that fossils just grew in place in the ground and that their resemblance to animals was purely coincidental), geology, paleontology, and what everyone thought about the Great Flood. It could also serve as a reference work if you're interested enough in the history of natural science in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It's pretty much rekindled my long-dormant interest in the history of science."},{"Title":"House and Its Head","review":"I'm beginning to become addicted to these little neglected treasures that the NYRB Press is reissuing. Not only are the editions themselves little marvels (with beautiful and well-chosen color covers and gorgeous paper stock), but whoever is making the choices for which books are reissued has near-infallible taste.A HOUSE AND ITS HEAD, like so many of Ivy Compton-Burnett's novels, reads something like a modern updating of a Greek tragedy: most of the novel is told through dialogue, there is a kind of chorus that comments on the action of the principal characters, and the plot involves murder, incest, and familial cruelty. Yet for all these borrowings Compton-Burnett paradoxically remains wonderfully sui generis: no one else has ever mastered her capability for evoking such extreme subtlety in manners that the merest cruel nuances can become evoked (if one reads carefully enough). She is also a master plotter: just when you think you've caught up with the characters' schemes, she allows the other characters in the novel to make similar realizations, and then jumps even further ahead. This is a real page-turner as well as a subtle commentary on Edwardian manners and moral monstrousness."},{"Title":"House and Its Head","review":"Compton-Burnett (abbreviated as CB henceforth) is one of the truly remarkable modernist writers, with a span of resonant fiction that she wrote from the 1920s through to the 1960s. Through her principal and powerful focus on the use of dialogue in her fiction to convey in a dramatic way her characters' individual personalities, tensions, complexities, resentments, repressions and sometimes savage irony - she herself is a savage, i.e., wonderful Swiftian ironist/satirist, scalpel-sharp - she is reminiscent of other modernists, in particular and most especially of William Gaddis (e.g.,Recognitions,Carpenter's Gothic (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin), andJr, Henry Green (e.g.,Loving; Living; Party Going (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics), the dialogue from the early plays of Harold PinterComplete Works, Vol. 1and sometimes Samuel Beckett.As with her other fiction, she has a set of themes she returns to time and again - you could call them obsessions, in a way, from the Victorian repressive household settings, to the patriarchal, remote, powerfully domineering father/husband of the household, to the anaesthetised (dream-state-like) wives, and the children, who are fearful or sometimes wonderfully, mordantly insubordinate (as with Nance, the daughter in this novel), or otherwise self-serving, and monstrously deceptive (as with Sybil, here).In the Edgeworth family in A House and its Head, published in 1935, you therefore have the archetypally representative CB family. The author often referred to it as one of the two of her most favourite works (the other being Manservant and Maidservant (New York Review Books Classics)). It opens with a conversation between husband and wife that is disconnected, disjointed, alienated and reminds you of Pinter's early work (The Room, The Birthday Party). While Duncan Edgeworth, the father, is without doubt a tyrant, dictating all terms to his family, there are two snakes in the grass in the apparently-servile daughter, Sybil, who in some ways is far more destructive than him; and Grant, Duncan's nephew.As with Gaddis' fiction, sometimes it can be difficult to identify the speaker of the dialogue, as CB rarely identifies the person; you come to recognise them through their individual natures and thereby the content of what they say. This is what makes her so identifiably such a modernist, and she remains a radical and remarkable one at that. While demanding in regard of conversation, the satire and razor-sharp language and characterisation make this and all her other fiction well worth the effort (never a painful effort, by the way, just requiring a participating, not passive, energy on the part of the reader) and, as with her other novels, it leaves you intellectually and emotionally rewarded. And amazed at her brilliance.For those who are keen to learn more about CB, I highly recommend three excellent sources:1. A dedicated, very helpful website on CB, her work and her critics, titled the Ivy Compton-Burnett Home Page, which you can usually find listed as the second search result under Google, if you search under the author's name2. In this edition there is an excellent afterword by Francine Prose, the National Book Award-nominated novelist, which you can access for free online at New York Review of Books' website (NYBooks), just search for the title of the novel or the author. In it, Prose characterises CB's fiction rather wonderfully as '[...] less like conventional fictions than like the laboratory notes of a meticulous and rather mad scientist.'3. Hilary Spurling's masterful biography,Ivy: the life of I. Compton-Burnett."},{"Title":"House and Its Head","review":"Ivy Compton-Burnett may not be a household name, and may even be obscure among dedicated readers of literary fiction, but that shouldn't be the case. Writing almost entirely in dialogue, Compton-Burnett uses the frame of polite conversation in Victorian England in this novel to expose deeply flawed characters willing both to commit things like adultery, murder and a whole host of other acts leading up to a casually stunning final few chapters. The delightfully slithering way Compton-Burnett's characters behave in A House and Its Head make for feverish reading if you're willing to have a little patience at the start to get to know the many characters. Compton-Burnett's work is also interesting as a precursor to William Gaddis in its brilliant use of dialogue, but you should read A House and Its Head on its own merits and you'll absolutely be rewarded for your effort."},{"Title":"Our Time Is Now","review":"Although OTIN is indeed a rare masterpiece one shouldn't forget Birmingham's true magnum dopus: \\"The Vancouver Split\\" - especially those heart wrenching and deeply poignant sections dealing with the handsome Billy Dumont towards the end of the \\"novel\\"."},{"Title":"Our Time Is Now","review":"This is a good book by Birmingham.

More than 20 years ago, Roszak showed how an alienated generation undermined the foundations of the prevailing technocracy. Miller acknowledges this but goes on to point out how the Counter Culture gave free press and credence to right-brain values that they saw as much neglected -- this before &quot;right-brain, left-brain&quot; became buzz words.&quot;Peace, love and flower power are no longer standard argot,&quot; observes Miller, &quot;...Hip culture has bloomed and died like a centuryplant...&quot; But the &quot;new ethics&quot; of the hippies are here to stay nevertheless. They are a potpourri of traditional values, untried social experiments, and a few truly original ideas for an American setting. Hippies attacked new icons such as technocracy while honoring agrarian values coupled with a new hip Eco-consciousness. The Counter Culture dropped out, disaffiliated from the prevailing society and changed themselves in order to change the world.What I like most about this book is that it is a resource. It belongs right up there on my bookshelf with Roszak's classic study and with *Sleeping Where I Fall* by Peter Coyote, for starters. It's no dry old bone, however. There are marvelous pictures of Be-Ins and Drop City, and rock groups and posters. There is a bibliography of both well-known and obscure underground newspapers (from which the author quotes extensively). Where and when was the first Earth Day, the first Human Be-In, that Death-of-Hip coffin? They're all here. And more. Miller points us to where and how the legacy continues even to this day. If you never read another book about hippies, read this one. pamhan99@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Hippies and American Values","review":"This book is very well researched. I think one of the best things Miller did is in his research phase, he hung out and talked with a lot of people who were (still are?) hippies; he went there, he listened. He returned and developed relationships with the people he wanted to understand. This book also provides good distinction between two of the many civil rights movements going on simultaneously in the 60s: the New Left--political activists, and the counter-culture hippies. Two wings on the same bird, but both having ideological differences that kept the two camps from becoming a united force. This is where the nickname \\"Fists\\" and \\"Heads\\" came from. Fists being the political activists, and Heads clearly wanted to drop out and disengage from mainstream culture. Clarifications like this are very helpful to understanding the era and all the divergent activity that ultimately had the same goals: human rights, freedom, peace. Thing is, reading this book brings me to realize things have not really changed for all the effort that the Fists and the Heads spent their youth on. Americans are still repressed, stressed, consumers--and it's magnified since the Sixties. In the 60s, though, seems like people may have had time to stop and realize their life had no meaning besides work, bills, keeping up with Jones. Today, so many people don't even have time to stop and realize how insane our great American lifestyle has become.I grew up as a hippie kid. Miller's book has helped me to understand better what my parents and their friends were trying to do, and why. Today, as an adult, having for many years shared my zany childhood stories, it's clear that mine was not a mainstream childhood. I have long sought to understand my parents motivations. I am aware of everything Miller writes about, so what I appreciate is how he he has put it all into perspective. He shows clearly how the different aspects of the Sixties movements all worked together and defines the weaknesses where these movements fell apart.If you're interested in this era in American History, I highly recommend this book. It's got the crediblity and standing of good scholarship, but is written in a way that anyone can enjoy reading this fascinating book. Thank you, Timothy Miller."},{"Title":"The Hippies and American Values","review":"This is a good read but like all books about the hippies and the sixties it completely misses the true genesis of the counterculture: technology. Marshall McCluhan wrote about the technological extensions of humans. The sixty's revealed the first generation which had grown up on television and other new electronic extensions were in fact rebelling against their electronic master. The slavery was in the mind. Everyone over thirty trusted the new direction the culture was headed in and by the seventy's the revolution/rebellion was over. Now hear in 2008 we have put on our ear plugs, eye shades, and as Pete sang, \\"You know where to put the cork.\\" We took it."},{"Title":"The Hippies and American Values","review":"So for my history college class we had to do a book review, and my professor hinted that he loved a book review written a few years ago over hippies.

It's a must read for anyone who wants to understand what was going on in the 60s. For a thrilling fictional work, have a look at \\"Life Boiling Over\\" by Jon Michael Miller. This brilliant novel deals with a couple who go through the hippie scene together, starting at Ohio State University and ending up in Woodstock and San Francisco. It follows the turbulent events that culminated in the campus turmoil that led to four student deaths at Kent State. Through passion, folly, joy and love, the couple struggles to understand themselves and their relationship. Their struggle comes to conclusions that will startle you.

The result is a well-written history of ACG, with lots of great anecdotes and inside information. My only complaint is that there are no illustrations.

One thing I liked in particular is that it was very enjoyable to read and I learned a lot at the same time. A lot of books that teach aren't all that fun to read, but this one is an exception. Another thing I was impressed with was the quality of the book. As mentioned by some other reviewers, it is produced on very high quality paper in full color and has great graphics. Maybe it will raise the bar for poker books in the future. It also seemed to have something for everyone in it. The first part should be very helpful for players that have little or no experience because it explains all about what to expect in the casino. If you have a friend or spouse that hasn't played a lot and is interested in poker, the first few chapters alone would make this an excellent gift for them.The other chapters start out simply but continue into some pretty involved stuff. I've read the No-Limit section a few times and picked up something new each time. Johnny really explains his philosophy about No-Limit, which is that you need to play the players instead of the cards. He talks a lot about his style and explains why it works for him. I especially liked his explanation of how he decides how much to bet against various hands he determines his opponents have. He talks about what percentage of his opponents chips he would bet in various situations and also how he might make the same bets if he were bluffing and thought his opponent had either a weak hand or an unmade draw. He also mentions why his bets put the other player in a difficult situation.The limit Hold-em section covers similar stuff to what is in some of the better poker books and perhaps could have included a bit more material. It does discuss things like what hands to play in what positions, how to alter that strategy when someone has raised the pot in front of you, and how to play unmade hands that are actually the favorite to win the pot. It talks about free cards and how dangerous they are to give and when to try to get them. There are a bunch of examples of good and bad flops to various hands and it explains why they are good or bad. The book also mentions in a few different places how important it is to get maximum value on your hands. It tells you to be aggressive in getting value because in limit play that is one of the most important things. There are a few spots where I was missing bets and what I read should help me in that area.The Seven Stud section is excellent and to the point. It explains how to select your starting hands well and stay out of trouble. It does a good job of distinguishing how the selection of what hands to play changes according to cards shown in other players hands. It then goes on to talk about how to play each of the streets and how to get the most value out of your hands.The Seven Stud Eight or Better and the Omaha Eight or Better chapters have a ton of information. I have the least experience in those games and the book pointed out a lot of mistakes I've been making so I'm going to re-read it a few times to make sure I understand all the information. One part I liked in particular that I was never quite clear on was how to play the high hands and this book covered that material very well. It also explained starting hand selection very well. It pointed out a lot of situations where it doesn't pay to continue with draws that look good, but may end up costing you money in the long run. I usually play the nut low draw very fast, but the book explained a lot of situations where that is not necessarily a good idea. It also explained the difference between how to play in multi-way pots as opposed to how to play short-handed pots. Another interesting thing it pointed out was how vulnerable a set is in Omaha Eight or Better. It gives an example of flopping a set of Kings to a deuce-five-King flop with a couple of reasonable low draws out against you. In that example any of sixteen turn cards will scoop you unless the board pairs. The graphics really made things a lot easier to understand.I also liked the chapter about all the high limit players and the center section with the photos. This book is very easy to understand because it's so well written, but when you really stop to consider what is being said a lot of it is pretty deep stuff. It gets right to the point and explains how to avoid a lot of mistakes you see people making all the time. All in all, I would say this is a great book."},{"Title":"Play Poker Like Johnny Chan, Book One: Casino Poker","review":"Saw this book on amazon.com and figured, what the hell, I'll buy it and see what happens.

After reading it and trying out the different techniques, I was pleasantly surprised to see my profits increasing. Well worth the price and the time to read. Have since read through the other sections and am finding myself getting some good earnings in Omaha and 5 card stud as well, although 5 card stud is a bit tricky.I definitely believe this book is good for beginners and advanced players alike.

I had not been doing this, so I employed it and I can safely say that it was a highly effective strategy.Now, I'm not claiming that this advice is exclusive to Chan, or that he made it up or that it's some big secret, but to a new player just learning and having difficulty, employing this advice and at times against my better judgment revealed that it's very effective, and because I got this advice from Chan, I got this book (years later) because in my eyes, Chan was 1 for 1 on good advice given to me.At first I was a bit disappointed in that many of the tips and advice I had already learned for myself. However, Chan goes on to give strategies, once again, that I had overlooked. Advice on \\"second best\\" hands where you trap yourself is rock solid, as is the advice on mid-range suited connectors. I deliberately and intentionally applied the advice on suited connectors which had been previously contrary to my play style and ended up winning 2 tournaments and numerous additional hands by following his advice. The book paid for itself in one session. I can absolutely guarantee that I would not have won these hands in question without Chan's advice.Having said that, the book tries to be all things to all games and suffers from not having the depth that Chan is more than capable of exploring. All sections are a minority and are largely unrelated. I have no use for advice on Omaha or 7stud so there goes 44 pages I don't need. I don't play 8 or better stud so there's another 18 pages. People that Johnny has played with and giving shout-outs to doesn't help my game... that's another 28 pages. What to expect at a casino (I already know) that's 9 pages. You get the picture.In spite of this, the advice on NLHE is short, but sweet. There are a couple of good tips, and they alone have potential to substantially increase your revenue. In the end it hardly matters if 20 pages of solid game improving advice is shorter than 900 pages of solid advice; if your play is improved and it makes you money, then it's worth it.But rather than to add filler outside of specific playing advice, Chan makes good points about playing when you're winning vs. when you're losing. I'm not talking about tilting, but rather Chan's consideration of factors to your play that you're not aware of, and how to exploit these unknowns even if you don't understand them. I appreciate how Chan is sensitive to the notion of factors that one may not be aware of but can recognize as having impact on play by their results, and how to counter or capitalize on this depending upon how you're affected.This is a 5 star book, but I give it four stars simply from my own perspective in that I learned everything the book could teach me in my experience, all in one sitting. I know Chan knows a lot more, and could have included a lot more, but for an intermediate player (especially HORSE players), this book has a lot to offer even if too diverse to be elaborate on a single subject."},{"Title":"Play Poker Like Johnny Chan, Book One: Casino Poker","review":"The quality of this work is evident, from the high quality paper used in the book itself and the excellent photos, to the most important part of the book, the poker information contained within. This book seems to be geared towards those new to poker, however, even advanced players will be able to pick up useful concepts from this book. I personally found Chan's thoughts on recognizing and minimizing tilt to be extremely well layed out.Another area this book excels in is laying out how to examine the texture of the flop. This is similar to the \\"flops you want\\" section of Sklansky's work, but I believe this book does a better job of it.This book attempts to be many things, and suprisingly pulls it off, being both informative and entertaining. This book is well worth rereading and I am looking forward to the next volume in the series."},{"Title":"Play Poker Like Johnny Chan, Book One: Casino Poker","review":"Dont use this book as your BREAD AND BUTTER book. It doesnt show you the intricute parts to playing poker. It goes over specific chunks of playing and theory, this book leaves a lof of gaps in terms of poker instruction. If you have read all of Sklansky's books, then this one might just be an interesting read. But it wont help improve your game much."},{"Title":"Play Poker Like Johnny Chan, Book One: Casino Poker","review":"This book cover the basic rules and strategies of different poker games. Personally, I did not find this book very useful partially due to my participation in many tournaments and cash games weekly.All in all this book is nice to read, great for beginners, and printed on nice material, but I would not recommend for intermediate poker players. However, if you are often beat in cash games or tournaments then this book may be useful."},{"Title":"Play Poker Like Johnny Chan, Book One: Casino Poker","review":"I'd just like to give you a little background so that you can decide if this is the right book for you. This is the first book in a series. It starts out with the information a beginning player needs in order to move from little or no experience to playing in a casino, and then explains the concepts necessary to become a winning player. If you look at the customer images section for this book you can see for yourself what topics are covered. The first chapter is called \\"Hand Rankings\\" and addresses the needs of people who have never played before. The next couple of chapters describe the casino environment and include most of the important rules and regulations regarding playing in a casino. One is called \\"General Poker Concepts\\" and the other is called \\"What to Expect in a Casino\\". If you are an experienced player, you may want to skip this introductory material.The following chapters are devoted to each of the games that are commonly played in the casinos and at tournaments. Those chapters begin with a brief description of the game and then cover what you need to know to become a winning player.Those chapters are:Limit Hold-emSeven Card StudSeven Card Stud Eight or BetterOmaha HighOmaha Hi-lowNo-Limit Hold-emThere are a few other short chapters dealing with such things as bluffing, money management, and tournaments.Because Johnny started out playing in the smallest games available in a casino, has moved up through all the limits, and now plays in the highest games in the world on a regular basis, he understands what you need to know to begin to develop your game. That material is included in this book.Although the information is not meant to be exhaustive, it will give you the pertinent information you'll need to beat most home games and do well in low to mid limit casino poker. The object of this book is to take a novice or moderately experienced player from the beginning stages of play to an intermediate level of play. And although this is not an advanced book, there are many intermediate and some advanced concepts in it. Subsequent books in the series will be more directly geared toward advanced players.We wrote this book as if we were sitting down with you and guiding you along the road toward playing a winning game. We've also tried to include some entertaining stories and give mention to some of the great personalities in the game today.We both believe it is an excellent book and sincerely hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Blaze and the Mountain Lion","review":"This time Billy and Blaze set out west (for a family holiday) and encounter great boy adventures and make a new cowboy friend.Billy and Blaze books teach courage and responsibility and consideration for others.

This particular story has a lot of excitement and danger in it, with a fulfilling ending as Billy and his dependable pony save a helpless calf.Although poorly written, the Billy and Blaze series was fascinating to me as a girl and fed my imagination.

This particular story is about a horse riding pre-teen boy who is on the lookout for a mountain lion who is attacking livestock. The setting is in rural America (probably midwest), and in the 1930's or early 1940's."},{"Title":"Bleep Blop Bloop","review":"This book was given to us. It was being read to the kids each day and they loved it, so a really nice preschool mom, gave them as a party give away. It is our book of choice at bed time. It's a funny and wonderful book, because the repetitive use of the same words can be simply read or interpreted to mean so many different things with different meanings! The sounds of these simple words and the joyous little creatures send shrieks of giggles through the house and always always can pull joy out of the traumatic moments of a 2 yr olds day.

Here's what I suggest for the GMAT:1. Use the Kaplan CD (as cheesy as the presentation is, the tests are very good). I've heard complaints that the prep tests from Kaplan are too hard, and I have to disagree with the point being made by these students. The only way, on a computer-adaptive test, to increase your score is to test using HARDER, not easier problems. I may kick ass at medium level questions, but unless I want a medium level score, practicing at a lower level hurts rather than helps. The Princeton Review Verbal Workout does not come with a CD.2. Ignore the Kaplan book. Use The Princeton Review books (either Cracking the GMAT or GMAT Workouts for Math and Verbal) for tricks and psychology. Try the Official Guide for extra problems and basic review issues (but use as much of the Princeton psychology as you can -- the Official Guide encourages you to do the problems straight, and that's a huge waste of time). The Princeton tests are buggy for sure (Hello! Princeton Review! Fix this!) but are still fairly accurate.3. Take as many practice tests as you can. That means Kaplan, Princeton Review, PowerPrep. Arco, Barrons, Petersons, and Dummies are all awful. Don't bother with their instruction or their tests. On Princeton Review and PowerPrep, knock 30 points off your score, just to be safe.4. Check out your local library. Many public libraries have crazy collections of old, out of print Official Guides, chock full o paper-and-pencil tests going back a good 20 years. By all means, use these -- they're a goldmine of practice questions.Good luck!"},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"I am an engineer, hence strong in the quantitative section of the GMAT, weaker in the verbal section. Or so I thought until I purchased this book.The Verbal Workout book covers all three types of verbal questions (Sentence Correction, Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension). The author leads you by the hand and feeds you with very useful, very applicable information. No fluff and no screwing about, let's just get down to it.The author doesn't pretend to do all the work for the student. In fact, just reading this book will get you nowhere. But after applying yourself to the exercises and tackling some real questions (the GMAT Official Guide is a MUST have to get full advantage from this book) with the techniques provided, you will find an improvement in your scores. I did.The book is well laid out, well thought out and well edited; I haven't found any errors or contentious problems in it yet!This book is a star performer, and I have others to grade it against (Arco's Teach Yourself the GMAT CAT 2000 Edtn, Official Guide, 800score.com on-line guide, etc).Add it to your collection if you're serious about improving your verbal score."},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"I feel so lucky to have found this book. I didn't need to work on my performance on the quant section of the GMAT, so I was specifically looking for a guide to help me increase my accuracy on the verbal section. This book was exactly what I needed; detailed explanations of how to solve verbal problems and targeted practice. I also appreciated the author's cynical approach to the test itself, which I think helped me to relax about the whole thing, which in turn helped me perform better on the test. I'm going to post anonymously, so I guess I can say that my score went up 70 points, and that's without having done any work on quant. This book is easily worth the price."},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"Without doubt, Princeton Review has the developed the best approach to taking the GMAT Verbal section. This book is a microcosm of their expensive test-prep course. So if you wish to build up your verbal and critical reasoning skills this book will prove invaluable. I looked at other test-prep books, but PR was the only one that got me to understand what the critical reasoning questions were really asking. Thanks to PR my verbal score rose from the 65-percentile to the 93-percentile."},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"I bought both the Kaplan Verbal book along with this one to study together. One, to be able to compare the strategies from the 2 companies; second, to get a really good &quot;workout&quot; to improve my score on the verbal section. What I found was that while the strategies between the two are similar, the Kaplan book gave more questions to practice with than the PR book did. However, the PR book definitely gives a more comprehensive grammar lesson than Kaplan does, and it also gives examples of &quot;ETS tendencies&quot; which is very helpful. All in all, if you're looking for a good english lesson review, this is a great book. But if you're looking for a &quot;workout&quot;, go with the Official Guide or the Kaplan book."},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"I was having difficulty getting the verbal parts down tight. This book lets me DRILL, which is the way I learn best. If you need to increase your verbal score on the GMAT, and you're still below the 85 percentile, this book can probably help you move your score up. It's sure helped me"},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"This book really covers the types of questions to look out for and the answer choices to avoid. I find the book to be very adept at improving the average student's Verbal score.However, this book is not a Verbal cure-all. Do not expect to study it thoroughly and suddenly start acing the Verbal section. The best it can do by itself is improve your score, whether marginally or substantially. But for me, it has been a substantial improvement.There are some parts of the book that really yearn for more, such as the Reading Comprehension. There is a great mutual feeling among virtually all standardized test takers that RC is the most challenging section, and therefore should require the most thorough and in-depth review. Sadly, this is just not the case in Doug French's book. The RC review is approximately the same length as the other sections. It really needs to edited, updated and improved.Otherwise, the remaining sections of the book prove to be very formidable. If you keep in mind that this book is not a cure-all, then you should find the book to be very appealing."},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"First, if you are unfamiliar with the GMAT, here's a quick overview of the test: The GMAT consists of three sections: one verbal section, one math section, and the essays. In the verbal section, you'll have 41 questions consisting of approximately equal parts of reading, grammar, and something GMAT calls \`critical reasoning.' You will see three or four reading passages (like those on most standardized tests), some grammar questions (which require you to figure out what is the best way to put a sentence in English), and some critical reasoning questions, which are basically logic questions.The GMAT, like the GRE and the TOEFL, is an \\"adaptive\\" test. This means that the test is designed to feed you questions that it has determined to be at your level. For example, your first question will be a medium difficulty question; if you answer that one correctly, you'll either receive another medium-difficulty or a hard question. As you continue to answer questions correctly, you'll get hard questions on the test. Conversely, if you start to miss questions, you'll get easier questions. This new format may not seem that important, but in fact, it is important to consider this when you are talking to other people about the test. Essentially, almost everybody who takes the test will say the same thing: \\"Whew! That was hard!\\" The test is hard because the software is giving you hard questions. So, when you read other reviews of GMAT books and questions, you need to keep in mind that people are commenting on the level of difficulty of the practice questions in different books compared to their GMAT, and your GMAT will likely be different. So, in a word, it's important to get a book with a wide range of questions of differing difficulty levels.Here's what you'll see on the GMAT: On the math section, you'll see 37 questions. You only need to know algebra and geometry to answer these questions, but some of them are pretty tricky. There is no trigonometry or calculus on the GMAT. Some of the questions that you will have to answer are \`data sufficiency' questions. These questions present you with some information, and you have to decide whether a math problem can be solved with this information.Finally, the GMAT requires you to write two essays; one of them is a standard essay, and the other one requires you to analyze the reasoning of an argument (most schools pay more attention to your verbal and math scores than they do to your essay scores, though). All in all, the test will take you at least three and a half hours to finish, pretty long for most of us!!Now, about this book. This is a good book to help you raise your score on the Verbal Section of the GMAT, but it could be better. This used to be the only GMAT book targeted specifically at raising your score on the Verbal Section, but Kaplan has recently come out with their version, which is about the same price, but has over a hundred more pages of material; between the two, I'd probably go with the Kaplan, but this one is good, too.This book is clearly targeted at the large middle segment of test takers, i.e., the bulk of the bell curve. If you are at either extreme, i.e., scoring below the 30th percentile or above the 80th percentile, this book probably won't help you much since it does not explain the harder GMAT verbal questions; i.e., the ones you are missing. The book does, however, have a nice reference section with the most common grammar rules and idioms tested on the GMAT.For this large middle range, however, this book is enough to show you what you will see on the test, and if you're the type who doesn't like to leave anything to chance, this book will make a strong addition to your GMAT preparation library."},{"Title":"Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)","review":"If you are picking between PR's and Kaplan's workbooks, go for Kaplan. You can read my review on Kaplan's workbook (just click on my nickname and you'll see that review along with others), so I won't comment much on that book in this review.Issues with PR's Verbal Wrorkbout:1. Question quality - I have seen a lot of GMAT materials and sometimes questions are not very close to the authentic gmat questions. This time, they are quite far. The greatest difference comes in Critical Reasoning. Very often the logic is quite off and confusing. The explanations are helpful, but for a person who is very familiar with OG and PP, the difference will be obvious immediately.2. Question Difficulty - PR is known for easy questions; this book is not entirely easy, but the hard questions are unreasonable; GMAT logic is very limited - it does not go more than 2 two speps. PR on the other hand makes questions either too easy or too complicated, and neither is good. Reading overall, is fairly easy.3. Tricks the magic tricks. Yeah, right. PR is famous for its &quot;magic tricks&quot; that don't really work on the real test but work flawlessly in the practice books. Many of the questions are tailored to fit the special rules PR makes up. Some tricks are legitimate (such as GMAT never puts minorities or women in poor light); others are common sense (don't go for extreme answer choices), but a lot overemphasise tricks over understanding the grammar, logic, and reading methods.4. This book has fewer questions than does Kaplan's Verbal Workbook.5. It spends a lot more on blah, blah, blah, which really does not stay in the memory; could be more condensed.6. Paper quality is poor; it is printed on the really cheap recycled paper and does not help studying.Good things:It has a bigger section on grammar than Kaplan, however, both books are not enough if you are an international student. The grammar covered in both books emphasizes mostly style (parallel constructions, etc) and does not go through the basics of subject verb agreement, adjective rules, modals, or subjunctive. If you are non-native English speaker, get a grammar book - many of the TOEFL books have fabulous grammar sections. I can recommend one, but it is out of print (1995 edition of Cliff's; the 2000 edition is not good, however).

After reading Mother in the Middle and all the studies and facts they presented, I felt like a experienced mother had taken me under her wing and shared truth -- clearing up all the other arguments.

Listening to the original cast LP and CD over the years, I found it to be a light, fun, bouncy musical, even though some serious topics are addressed.Now, reading the book, I realize (and remember) that \\"Company\\" is much darker than it seems on the surface. This comes through in the scenes and dialogue, not so much in the songs. For instance - Harry and Sarah's sparring, Harry's drinking, Peter's propositioning Bobby, Joanne's propositioning Bobby. This certainly doesn't detract, but rather adds a new dimenstion, and it makes for a different listening of the soundtrack.Also, it's nice to have all the lyrics in one spot.

Greenberg does an excellent job of suiting the tenor of the verse to the dramatic occasion, ranging from low comical to sublime lyric. Whereas the majority of previous English translations tend (mistakenly) strive for a uniformly &quot;elevated&quot; tone, Greenberg's translation gets the nuances right. A central idea running throughout Goethe's works is that in any comprehensive formulation of life, extremes must be united. The range of poetic styles in Faust--from high to low, comic to tragic, beautiful to sublime, &quot;volk&quot; slang to epic vaunt--also follows this general rule, and again Greenberg's sensativity to this range is wonderful. While the other translations are not bad, if you really want to experience the fantastic emotional-intellectual rollercoaster ride of Faust, this translation does it best."},{"Title":"Faust,: A tragedy","review":"This is an excellent translation of an amazing book.Not only does Greenberg's translation rhyme (as opposed to the free-verse versions of lesser translators), but it's a great deal more intelligible to modern American readers than the other translations I've read.

The pictures that accompany the text are often confusing and do not interact well with the written word. (Not to mention the fact that all people represented in the art are white.)

In 123 pages, Rach, a former editor of BIRD TALK, covers a wide range of topics, from the history of the budgie as a pet to teaching it to talk. She covers health problems and how to prevent them, proper nutrition, cage size, taming a new bird, and grooming. The section on parakeet behavior was, for me, the most entertaining, as Rach describes the gestures and habits common to most budgies and what each means. The color photographs scattered throughout are mostly unneccessary, but they break up the text. (Most people aren't interested in seeing a person covering a cage.) The pictures of budgies themselves are worth it, however, especially since most people reading the book will already be enamored of this acrobatic pet.Well-seasoned budgie owners and breeders won't find much new here, but newcomers to bird ownership will be delighted.

Rach has included a short history of this little Australian parrot including a discussion of the variants bred in England and America. Budgies in the wild come in a few colors, but the colors of the varieties are numerous. Apparently, Budgies are like popcorn, its hard to have only one, so if you are thinking of building an aviary full of Budgies, get THE PROPER CARE OF BUDGIES -- a more comprehensive book than Rach's --- that includes a more in-depth discussion of genetics and breeding.Rach offers much practical information on the caging, feeding and care of \\"pet\\" budgies, including a few medical tricks, such as how to give your bird an oral medicine. Speaking of the photographs (there is one showing a Budgie receiving medication from an oral syringe), many were produced by Renee Stockdale, whose photos show up in other books on Budgies and Parakeets. Although Rach says Budgies should be housed in cages with bar spacing 7/16\\" or less, I noticed the same cage with bars \\" apart are shown in many of the photos, so either the photo editor was careless or Rach did not edit the book.I enjoyed reading the text and looking at the photos, and recommend this book as the one you will need unless you are becoming a breeder.

Life on the trail isn't easy ('natch), but they do manage to make it over the mountains where they join a small settlement in northern California. Caleb plans to raise sheep - that is until Lucy receives word he's dead after an Indian attack. Widowed at sixteen and mother to two young children (her own daughter Beth, plus Abel, an orphaned half-breed she adopted), Lucy gets herself a herd of sheep to raise (that's where the nickname Pastora comes from). After gold is discovered in '49, she's got enough smarts to realize those miners need warm clothes from her wool, and she partners up with a friend from the wagon train to open up a dry goods store.Life in a gold camp isn't the best environment to raise children in (especially Abel who can't stay away from the gambling dens), so Lucy and her partner close up shop and move it to San Francisco. Business at the new store booms, but Lucy hungers for greater financial security, and with a financial panic hitting the town it seems investing in the world's oldest profession is the most lucrative (she thinks she can keep that secret from family and friends - hah!).\\"You touch something filthy, the filth rubs off on you. That kind of money's tainted.\\"Lucy may be down, but she's not out and she's got an empire to build. If you're familiar with California history I suspect you have an idea where things go, and those who aren't don't need a book report length recap of it all. Pastora doesn't quite come up to the awesomeness of The Proud Breed, Lily Cigar and Calico Palace, but it still was a still a highly enjoyable read, and lots of fun new factoids for this history geek. Emperor Norton was one I hadn't heard of before, and added a nice touch of levity to the scenes he appeared in. Just one cautionary warning, although Lucy does end up having a romantic relationship, that's a minor element to the entire story and doesn't happen until well into the second half. If your tastes lean more towards romantic historical fiction, this book might not be the best fit for you."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"I read this book when it first came out, thirty years ago, and I'd forgotten most of the details. But I remembered enjoying it a great deal, so I set out to find it again, and Inter-Library Loan came through. (They usually do.) It's only 250 pages, a pretty fast read -- and now I know why it had stuck with me all these years.Brian Chaney is an epigrapher in Hebrew and Aramaic documents, translator of a recently discovered scroll at Qumran which has upset a lot of people. He's also a demographer and futurist and has written a report for the government laying out probable trends for the near future. (The story begins in 1978, which was also the near future for Tucker, who feared the repressive trends he himself observed in the late Sixties.) Chaney gets drafted for a secret project run by the Bureau of Weights and Measures (a nice touch), which has managed to build a forward-traveling time machine. He and his two colleagues -- a no-nonsense Army major and a freewheeling Navy commander -- will journey to the end of the 20th century to see if those trends have panned out, to bring back information to allow the government of 1978 to lay its plans to deal with future problems. But the President, naturally, sets the target of the preliminary field trial at 1980; he wants to know whether he's going to be reelected. Oh, yes, the politicians will never hesitate to take over science for their own ends, and Tucker knows it. Then there's Katherine Van Hise, known as &quot;Katrina,&quot; who is more or less the managing director of the project at the local level. Chaney is very attacted to her, and so is Commander Saltus. And so they make their jumps, singly and one at a time, to 1999 and to 2000 and to sometime in the 2020s (I think) . . . and nothing is as they thought it would be.This is an intimate drama of Armageddon in Illinois, a reduction of global catastrophe to manageable proportions. The style is quiet and perfectly straightforward, the imagery is both subtle and apocalyptic. And the three time travelers -- and Katrina -- will turn out to be unexpected heroes.Arthur Wilson Tucker, known throughout science fiction fandom as &quot;Bob,&quot; was not a scientist like Asimov or Benford. He was, in fact, a motion picture projectionist from Illinois who wrote mysteries and science fiction stories and novels on the side, beginning in 1941. This book and 'The Lincoln Hunters' are certainly his best (and best known) work, but there was another whole side to him -- the raconteur and noted wit who hung out with the &quot;ordinary&quot; fans at WorldCons, and who held forth at hotel room parties on the benefits of bourbon (&quot;Smoooooth!&quot;), and who cheerfully distributed business cards with only his name on one side and the words &quot;Natural Inseminations&quot; on the reverse. (I still have my card from MidAmericon in 1976.) The fans loved him and he loved them. In fact, Bob Tucker was the first Fan Guest of Honor at a WorldCon (Torcon in 1948). And when the room parties burned themselves down to glowing coals in the small hours, you could find him on someone's balcony arguing literature and political theory and social dynamics as astutely as any Oxford don. He had a longtime interest in Near Eastern archaeology which is obvious in this book. I expect most younger sf fans have never heard of Tucker, and that's their loss."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"In idle moments, I occasionally think how much fun it would be to travel to interesting times and places from our recent past - to New York in 1929, to London in 1940 or to San Francisco in 1967 - to walk around, read the paper, and look and talk to the people, just to see how they dressed and what they thought. The future, not so much. The future is scary. As Dr. Zaius said to the Charlton Heston character in the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" from about the same era this book was written, \\"You may not like what you find.\\"It's safe to say that the time travellers in this book don't like what they find. This book was written in 1970 or so, and most of the action takes place from 1978 to roughly 2000, but you can read it either as an alternative history or as a cautionary tale, because it seems like a pretty realistic way for the United States to come to an end. If you look at it as a alternative history, it's also somewhat amusing. Tucker writes that in 1980, the weak and ineffectual incumbent president defeats an actor, in what turns out to be one of the last elections. That's kind of the opposite way things turned out in our world.The book starts in 1978, a world in which the United States has been in constant warfare in Southeast Asia since 1965. There is unrest in the cities, and the economy is bad. The three time travellers jump forward two years to 1980, to find that things have started to unravel, and then separately to around the turn of the century, when it really hits the fan, to the aftermath, and finally to the Year of the Quiet Sun, when it's all over. Even the summers are colder.As another reviewer said, what makes this so effective is that you only see glimpses of the larger picture. You flash forward to when the country tears itself to pieces, then hear fragments of the larger story from one of the survivors. There's also some nifty foreshadowing and a feeling of doom pervades the novel. Also, if you're interested in such things, you can find a few ominous parallels of the 1978 America Tucker portrays with today's world, although I suppose you can always find parallels if you look hard enough.I gave it four stars because the first half of the book feels a little padded as Tucker sets the stage. But the last half of the book is nearly perfect; well written, frightening, and above all, grimly realistic. Highly recommended for fans of post-apocalyptic literature."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"Year of the Quiet Sun is notable as the novel which won the first place Campbell Award in 1976. While not as well known as the Hugo or Nebula, the Campbell award is quite prestigious, and is chosen by a jury based on literary excellence, not just popularity.Despite its award, Year of the Quiet Sun is not very well known. It is interesting and well-written, but it's particular plot hasn't aged well, and it contains things which may seem anachronistic or politically incorrect. A major thematic element is race, especially the divide between blacks and whites in America. When Tucker wrote this book, he projected the difficulties of his turbulent time into the future and predicted things would get worse. He describes race riots in Chicago of the late 1990s which result in the black parts of the city being barricaded and completely segregated racially. Black militants and white U.S. soldiers prevent either side from crossing over.The picture portrayed of black militants, and their violent hatred of whites, is particularly ugly. This is in no way a racist book, but it confronts these issues head on and is certainly politically incorrect by today's standards.Dating it perhaps past the point of continued popularity is the fact that the book is about time travel, but the time travelers only journey about twenty years into the future. Thus, they visit a time which is already past. The world war instigated by a Chinese-Indian-Arab alliance and the subsequent collapse of the United States has, of course, not happened, but one can still read this as alternative history.The out-of-date events didn't really bother me, although the idea of time travelers from the 1970s boldly going forward to the year 2000 did strike me as amusing.The main character is a civilian scholar and renowned demographer who has published a controversial book about the origins of the Bible's Book of Revelations. This creates some tension between him and the two military men who work with him on the government's time travel reconnaissance project.The book contains a rather unusual time machine (it must be plugged into an electrical source), some military action, speculation about the near future (now past), a compelling romance, and lots of interesting discussion about society and world politics.While I'm glad I read Year of the Quiet Sun and consider a worthwhile work of science fiction, this is not a book I would strongly recommend as a &quot;must read.&quot; It may appeal to some readers for historical reasons or because of its specific topics. This is a very well-written book, which continually presents unexpected but logical surprises. Its time travel plot is very original, with twists and developments I haven't seen elsewhere. Nevertheless, there are many books available which are more important classics or simply more enjoyable for contemporary readers."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"Dateline 1978. The US Bureau of Standards has developed a Time Displacement Vehicle in the style of HG Wells' famous Time Machine. The president has issued top secret orders that a small group of three scientists be sent forward a scant 20 years to apprise the government of the day of the critical issues it would be facing in the decades to come. Clifford Simak praised the novel as being frighteningly possible. He suggested that he would now be frightened to open the morning's paper for fear that Tucker's powerful novel of a world turned very, very ugly would be truly predictive. Certainly today's readers will be breathing a sigh of relief that the world is not quite the place that Tucker suggested it could be but any thinking reader will acknowledge that it could have easily turned out in exactly the fashion a darkly, deeply pessimistic Tucker suggested.While paying due attention to the standard sci-fi difficulties of time travel paradoxes, \\"The Year of the Quiet Sun\\" is more by way of a post-apocalypse novel or perhaps an alternate future history novel that deals with rather scary stuff - atomic retaliation, the unseemly expropriation of science for short term political gains, and widespread atomic fallout combined with the results of racism literally run riot! While it is disheartening to read this kind of bleak futurism, it is perhaps marginally cheering to contemplate that courageous novels like this or John Howard Griffin's \\"Black Like Me\\" may have been, at least in part, the reason that what we now see in the 21st century is different than Tucker imagined.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"Written in 1970, this pessimistic time travel novel, a Hugo Award finalist, begins in 1978 when Brain Cheney is more or less drafted into a mysterious government project. Chaney is a Biblical scholar of sorts whose book debunking certain ancient scrolls has irritated many Christians around the country but he is also a professional demographer and has already produced one report for the government predicting how current trends will impact the near future. The government believes him to be perfect for this new project. Who better to send into the future in the new time machine invented by the Bureau of Weights and Measures than a man experienced in predicting that very future?Interestingly, Brian Cheney and the two military officers drafted into the project with him travel only as far as twenty years into the future, to the turn of the new century, because government officials are so concerned with what they see as a dark future for the United States that they hope to learn enough from the time travel to change that future. Today's readers, of course, have lived beyond the years visited by these time travelers so their adventurous trip into the future has become our past. As a result, The Year of the Quiet Sun reads as much like an alternate history novel at times as it does as a story of time travel.Cheney, the only civilian time-traveler of the team, has little regard for politicians and resents the way that the President and his staff order that the first trip into the future be only to 1980 so that the President can determine whether or not he will be re-elected. The three travelers, who can go into the future only one-at-a-time due to the limitations of their vehicle, get that information for him but they also return to 1978 with news of the tremendous unrest and violence that is already impacting the future of America's major cities, especially Chicago. It is when they are sent forward to 2000, and just beyond, to learn the effectiveness of the President's attempt to save the country that the novel really takes off.The second half of the book centers itself around realistic military skirmishes between government troops and the rebels who are intent on overthrowing the government with help from the Chinese, but it also details the evolving relationships of the three time- travelers and the head of their project, the beautiful Katherine with whom two of the men have become particularly smitten. Readers who may have found the pace of the book's first half to be a bit slow in its set-up of the second half action will find themselves well-rewarded for staying with the book to the end. Tucker's vision of the horrible future that could have resulted from the radicalism of the 1960s and early 1970s is a horrifying one.Tucker even saves a nice little surprise for his readers until near the end, one that more astute readers than me may figure out earlier, but one that made me laugh out loud at its cleverness."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"Published in 1970, this gripping novel projects a near-future U.S. facing intense racial strife and a rapidly deteriorating international situation. A secret military project recruits historian and Biblical scholar Brian Chaney to join two officers in a survey of the near-future.The future scenarios imagined in this novel are long out of date, but the fundamental ideas of the story go much deeper than that, and it remains compelling even if you know the ending. The real surprises have more to do with characters and their relationships than with specifics about how things might have looked in the early 70s. I just finished reading this for the third time (in 2010) and it remains every bit as compelling as it was in 1971, when I stayed up all night reading it in one sitting. Strong, subtle science fiction that showcases the best SF of the period.If you like time travel stories, and enjoy a piece that's detailed, believable, realistic, and above all, features strong, three-dimensional characters, I highly recommend this Campbell award winning, long out of print novel."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"I read this startling, original and realistic-feeling novel in the early 1980's and was absolutely enthralled by it. The main reason for my excitement was that its subject matter was, and may still be, a curious rarity in science-fiction literature: a graphic investigation of the future of race relations in America. I just don't remember any other science-fiction novels that that dealt with black/white issues, and I've read lots of science-fiction. A few novels by other major SF writers such as Robert Silverberg's \\"Tower of Glass\\", or James Blish's \\"A Case of Conscience\\" approached the subject obliquely using characters and situations that treated the subject in a metaphorical, indirect way, but Mr. Tucker's \\"The Year of the Quiet Sun\\" jumps right into the middle of a futuristic race war in a fearless and blunt way that was quite challenging for me to consider. Also, this novel has one of the most unexpected surprise endings I've ever read in any literary genre. It's a face-slapper, a head-banger, a shattering stroke of inspiration, and it delivers a impact that deepens and transforms the meaning of everything that went on in the book up to that point. This is \\"serious\\" science-fiction imagined in a social context that thrusts it way above science-fiction stories that only speculate about technological issues. What a bold and provocative film this would make, especially in the era of Obama! \\"The Year of the Quiet Sun\\" (a sublime, beautiful, poetic title, don't you think?) is fine thing, a twilight thing; bleak, grim, yet dramatically compelling, and offering characters whose inner lives, passions, and conflicts are easily recognizable and worthy of your instant empathy. It'll stay with you, for sure."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"Time travel ranks as the most difficult of science fiction genres. Though there are numerous stories featuring characters voyaging into the past to change history or venturing into the future to see what will become of humanity, most break down on various points of logic. As a result, in spite of the numerous novels, short stories, movies, and television series which incorporate time travel into the plot, there are only a few in which it is done well enough to deserve to be remembered.Wilson Tucker's novel ranks among the few in this category. In it, a demographer and biblical scholar is recruited to join a government team surveying the future. As they do so, they witness a deteriorating world torn apart by racial and political strife thanks to weak and egotistical leaders. Here Tucker establishes time travel using a series of consistent rules that work very effectively, allowing him to focus on the plot and characters. These are the true strengths of the novel, for while the future he extrapolates seems laughably implausible thanks to the luxury of hindsight, it is just the background for a poignant inquiry into the fate of society as seen through the lives of five very different people. This results in a thoughtful tale that is a must-read for any fan of science fiction, one that demonstrates how best to tell a time travel story that works."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"There are phases of science fiction in a reader\`s life--young adult adventures of power, violent and/or sexually explicit \`edgy\` books and movies, highly-technical explorations of where our scientific knowledge might take us--and the sad truth is most SF fans never graduate beyond the gosh-wow wish-fulfillment stuff. For me, I can appreciate the fun stuff, but my lack of interest in technical matters keeps me away from hard sf. Wilson Tucker\`s YEAR OF THE QUIET SUN can be described using the Trekkie/Dr. Who fan\`s scariest word when it comes to SF--challenging. It is indeed a quiet tale, but I didn\`t find it talky. I put it up with EARTH ABIDES, as both are serious tales about where our future might take us, and neither author gave a damn abour laser guns and chase scenes. Both cared about people, in the true sense, and if EARTH ABIDES is about ecololgy, YEAR is about society and race, and how intimate human relationships birth larger societal issues. It is a book I think about often."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"This tale of a super-secret time travel project in America of the near future (1978; the book was written in 1970) is a pleasant enough description of how the nuts and bolts of such a project might work. But the plot is merely an excuse for a hellfire and brimstone sermon of the abyss that America and the world are about to drop into. When they jump forward to the year 2000 and beyond, the time travelers discover that the Vietnam war (?!) has escalated into a land war with China, which has led in turn to race wars in America and nuclear holocaust all over the globe. There is supposed to be a parallel with the ancient apocalyptic scroll which one of the travelers has just translated, but the connection is nonexistent except as a boogeyman waved by the author. The characters are paper-thin types who have no interesting roles to perform (a gun-mad, astrology-struck army officer, a beautiful but efficient female supervisor, a timid scholar of Aramaic). Worst of all, the time travel gimmick goes for nought, as there is no perceptible effect of the terrifying reports that they bring back upon the suicidal actions of the U.S. President and the top military leaders. (A single line on page 240 says merely that after reading the reports, the President \\"seemed unable to control himself and unable to do anything right.\\") The book is a jeremiad by the author, predicting (in 1970) the imminent collapse of his whole society, without any attempt to use the fiction as a logical argument for such. Tucker has used time travel to much better fictional purposes in ^The Lincoln Hunters^ and other books; here, he wastes it."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"An involving story that cuts no intellectual corners, but is still quite easy to read. Ultimately, I believe this story deals with man's understanding of history as a mechanism; as a river of people rolling through the backdrop of the universe, with a structure and rules that man can attempt to understand and influence (perhaps vainly). The characters are understandable and easy to identify with, and they spend most of their time doing what people spend most of their time doing: flirting with the idea of love."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"[Minor Spoilers]Year of the Quiet Sun by Wilson Tucker is a sci fi adventure that unfortunately didn't really get going until page 75 or so! The characterization was slow and yet created an intriguing narrator, Brian Chaney, an archeologist of sorts who is controversial (yeah, a controversial archeologist, go figure) who is brought in as part of a special team to travel through time.Plots & Characters:Except for Brian and Kathryn (one of the people in charge of this time travel project), it's hard to care for the rest. We don't really know much about the rest of the team except in a superficial way. And the political scene is vague as well. We spend pages on the Congressional Record and other statistics. Sigh.Many pages are spent meeting his military buds on the team, the lovely Kathryn and how corrupt the government is, its current secrets and what's going on in the Asian war theater. Apparently Tucker is predicting what if Vietnam continued and how the president and Congress are heading towards corruption.That's fine, I mean authors have used science fiction as a back drop for their own theories be they political or whatever. I was not expecting a race war to occur somewhere in Chicago! The men go forward in time two years and see things are getting bad: riots, a takeover of Chicago by the poor and desperate, and a president who cares more about re-election and has a major ego problem.Bottom Line:The ending was disappointing. I was expecting Brian to come through but that did not really happen. There were a few surprises regarding Brian that helped save it for me. But would it not have been cool to have him return to the present, stop the riots and the insane government and save the day?Oh well!"},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"A TDV (time displacement vehicle) is invented and tested, and in the 1970's it is ready for human test runs. Brian Chaney is a futurist and historical researcher. He is selected, as are two members of the military. They each are recruited by a beautiful woman, who is the director of the project. The project is ordered to proceed into the near future, 20 years or so, at the request of the President of the U.S. The President is interested in future politics, and his place in it. That part of the story seems a little stereotypical, even for politicians. The idea that a President would choose that as a reason for the project, instead of a myriad of other plausible and still self-serving reasons he could have chosen, seemed a bit too easy.The project proceeds, and unforseen circumstances create a tragic crisis for the team in the future. That part of the story is well-told, and there is a definite emotional impact felt for the characters in the end. Along the way, however, are mostly uninteresting or implausible developments. The future depicts race riots in Chicago, and an attack by China on our mainland. Within about 30 years, the U.S. is reduced to a country struggling for survival. A romance theme is attempted, but is never developed enough to be effective.The writing is mostly adequate, occasionally simple, and shines only briefly with the last few pages. Time travel is an old and often used theme for science fiction, and the reasons are plain. It can be interesting, captivating, and create wonder. There are many fine examples in the genre. There are a few standouts, and this one is in with all of the remaining ones."},{"Title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun","review":"'The Year of the Quiet Sun' is a time travel story set in 1978 in which the time travelers travel forward to the next millennium.

Majic Eyes Only deals with 74 cases of alleged UFO crashes and retrievals that have been secretly managed by government agencies and military services in the U.S., and other major countries.Ryan Wood provides, for the first time, a detailed listing of the most well known crash retrieval cases and the evidence supporting these. He lists these in chronological order starting with the alleged 1897 Aurora crash in Texas, and ending a hundred years later with an alleged UFO crash on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland in 1997. He discusses the pioneering research of Leonard Stringfield, the first major UFO researcher to compile evidence of UFO crash/retrievals. Majic Eyes Only will help researchers working on one or more of these cases to make cross-comparisons, identify new evidence, and to develop an analytical framework for assessing the available evidence.Wood's primary contribution is in compiling the best available evidence for 74 alleged UFO crash/retrievals in an easily accessible format for researchers and novices alike. His most important scholarly contribution is to provide an analytical framework for rating the various categories of evidence cited in support for each of the UFO crash-retrieval cases. He explains his framework for effectively rating cases in terms of their authenticity by examining seven distinct categories of evidence: \\"witnesses\\"; \\"sources\\"; \\"zingers\\"; \\"content\\"; \\"chronology\\"; \\"no anachronisms\\"; and \\"forensics\\" (p. 14). He assigns each of these categories a \`weighting factor' that multiplies the evidence found for each category. This evidence is assessed on a five point scale in terms of most credible 5, and the least credible 0. All this amounts to a theoretical maximum of 125 points for the evidence concerning a particular UFO crash/retrieval in terms of the seven categories. This is very helpful for developing differing levels of authenticity for the available evidence for any particular UFO crash/retrieval case.Wood gives the \`witnesses' category a \`weighting multiplier' of 3.0 which means that if there are a number of direct eyewitness accounts seeing a UFO crash/retrieval, then this could be assigned the maximum five points for the category. If on the other hand there are only second hand testimonies, i.e., others relating what direct witnesses had seen, this could be given a ranking of say 2 points. When the points for that category is multiplied by the \`weighting multiplier' of 3.0 that would yield 15 points for a number of direct witnesses and only 6 points for second hand witnesses. A similar process occurs with each of the categories so one in the end can tally the total points from the different categories of evidence out a theoretical maximum of 125. According to Wood, cases that have a high level of authenticity occur when \\"all the investigative channels and ideas have been pursued, and with each test the case or document has shown to be authentic or nearly problem free (p. 15). In contrast, cases with low levels of authenticity arise when \\"all investigative avenues have been pursued and show little or no sign of internal consistency\\" (p. 16).Wood analyses documentary evidence for the creation of an Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit established to deal with UFO crashes and retrievals. He conclusively establishes that the IPU was an organization that existed, though its precise mission is still contested. Similarly, Wood discusses projects Moon Dust and Blue Fly, and their relationship to official Air Force investigations of UFO crashes and retrievals. The IPU therefore emerges as the predecessor of the Majestic-12 control group created by President Truman in 1947.Most significant of all the documents discussed in the book is the Special Operations Manual (SOM 1-01) that was leaked to the UFO community in 1994. It outlines procedures for personnel participating in various aspects of UFO crash/retrievals. The SOM 1-01, allegedly published in 1954, outlines such technical procedures as \\"recovery operations\\", \\"receiving and handling\\", \\"UFO identification\\" and even a guide on \\"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\\" (Appendix). The author's father, Dr Robert Wood, a former aerospace engineer with McDonald Douglas, analyzed the authenticity of the SOM-01 by investigating the various type fonts, syntax and printing procedures used in preparation of the document. He concludes that the SOM 1-01 is \\"a rock solid production of circa 1954\\" (p. 267 ). This leads to the conclusion that SOM 1-01 is in fact an authentic document outlining the procedures used by official personnel covertly involved in UFO crash/retrievals.Ryan Wood does not pretend that all the evidence he has put into his book is conclusive, some of it requires further investigation and some may ultimately be shown to have little substance. He concludes that while \\"some of the preceding cases fail the test of completeness and strain credibility, the number of fertile cases, which will undoubtedly grow as researcher continues, is larger than many realize.\\"(p. 244). It is in laying the analytical framework for assessing these \\"fertile cases\\" and in listing the best available evidence for each of these cases that Wood most succeeds in his book. My suggestion is that in a future edition, Wood applies his analytical framework to each of the 74 cases so a quantitative score can be reached that provides readers an easy guide for identifying the most persuasive, to the least persuasive cases. This will assist both in future refinements of his analytical framework and debates over the available evidence on UFO crash/retrievals.Wood has provided an invaluable guide for how one can approach the complex arena of UFO crash/retrievals in an analytically rigorous manner. He provides a fascinating compilation of raw data that invites exopolitical analysis of the government and military procedures invoked for UFO crash/retrievals. Majic Eyes Only will appeal both to the expert UFO researcher, and the novice stepping with some trepidation into case studies of UFO crash/retrievals. This is one of the most important books to emerge in UFOlogy and will serve as essential reading for many years to come.Michael E. Salla, PhDwww.exopolitics.org"},{"Title":"Majic Eyes Only","review":"This book goes far, far beyond the typical UFO books which dwell on lights in the sky or someone's autobiography. Even if only a small fraction of the reported UFO crashes are true this is still worth the read. Not to be read once, but perhaps several times then to be used as a reference in any future research, the book has \\"meat\\" and substance.One of the many high points of this book is a copy of the citation award given to Harry B. Cooper, father of Tim Cooper by Gen. Curtis E. Lemay. The award cites Harry Cooper for his exemplary knowledge in support of the Air Force UFO program. This citation and a lot more make this book a non stop thriller and a must read for anyone seriously interested in the UFO phenomena; you won't be sorry you did."},{"Title":"Majic Eyes Only","review":"From the Preface, Forward, Introduction; to the pages of the Index, this book pulsates with the intensity of the research and the integrity of the author. Ryan Wood writes very readable account of 74 previous UFO crashes and the treatment of the revelations with intelligence and courage. I, for one, do not see how anyone can read this book and come away without the conviction that we most certainly are not alone.The nice part of this is that a person of ordinary circumstance and average intelligence can read it and understand. Authors of UFO genre merit our respect and gratitude that they have placed their necks on the line to get important information before the public. It has been said that extraterrestrials are 25,000 years ahead of us on the evolutionary scale which should give any who considers it pause. Look back a hundred years ago, and then look back to the 16 hundreds--What happened to the Indians when an advanced society colonized this continent; yet the ETS have not attacked nor made any overt actions that they intend to.We have used their technology for our benefit--most of which went to the military and the industrialists, who got respectfully more powerful and richer. That much of an increase in knowledge without a subsequent evolvement in their humanity makes us all vulnerable to people who might want to take that power exclusively to themselves. Our government was founded on the principle of freedom of speech and the press--which makes us all more knowledgeable--yet that freedom has been denied by deception, intimidation, threats to non-governmental-non military-non armaments manufacture. This has been going on for more than 50 years and many have been murdered because of it--that is what the dedication of this book refers to--because someone dared. Ryan Wood has dared. Support his efforts. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Majic Eyes Only","review":"I am definitely on the side of the fence that favors the existence of UFOs, so I was really looking forward to seeing what this author had to say. I thought the organization of this book into case-by-case examinations of a large number of crashes individually was excellent and I found a lot of the arguments and evidence in the book to be thought provoking.I was left scratching my head, though, because the writing itself is difficult to follow. That's the reason for the low score. Reading this book is a trying experience. I kept having to reread sections to keep track of names, acronyms, dates, etc. I think the author may have been aiming for a scholarly tone, but ended up with a convoluted text that will turn off a lot of readers. I also would have preferred larger photos so I could read the documents that were presented as evidence.The book is worth reading if you are trying to decide your opinion about UFOs. But the text would have benefitted greatly from a good editor."},{"Title":"Majic Eyes Only","review":"The title of Ryan S. Wood's book \\"Majic Eyes Only\\" was intriguing to me and I looked forward to reading it. This subject is quite controversial, yet if any of it is true it would change our whole concept of life.My interest in UFO's was prompted by two separate incidents. The first was viewing a series on UFO's on the \\"History Channel\\" and the second was the so called \\"Mystery Missile Launch Observed off California Coast\\" on November 11, 2010. Being a dubious person on the subject of UFO's the answers coming from our government and military as to what it was left them stumbling all over the place initially for an explanation. In this day and age something video taped and witnessed by hundreds off our coast in broad daylight, a possible National Security Threat, and no immediate answers.Ryan Wood is quite forward that the cases he presents may not have sufficient evidence to be conclusive. However, in the introduction he presents an \\"Authenticity Class\\" he used to judge the cases and which the reader can use to come to his own conclusions. Note, not all cases pass the test.Ryan Wood's book while presenting only 74 cases chronicles sightings of UFO's beginning in Aurora, Texas, USA April 1897 to Isle of Lewis, Scotland Oct 1996. For a book published in 2005 one wonders why it stopped there.Of special interest are some of the best documented and heard of cases such as Kecksburg, Pennsylvania USA December 1965, Berwyn Mountains, North Wales January 1974, Shag Harbor, Canada Oct 1967, Chihuahua, Mexico August 1974 and of course the famous Roswell, New Mexico USA July 1947 incident.For example the Chihuahua case involved the recovery of a downed UFO by a US team in Mexico. After an alleged crash in Mexico of a UFO tracked by US radar high altitude over flights of the Mexican recovery team indicated their convoy carrying recovered material or craft was stopped and not moving in a desert area. Human bodies were visible outside their trucks. A US recovery team was dispatched and recovered whatever the Mexicans had in the convoy and brought it back to Atlanta, Georgia. The question remains was it some sort of contamination that killed the Mexican recovery team and if so how safe is the recover material in the USA.Wood also covers the role of Majestic 12, also known as Majic, the code name of a secret group that was allegedly formed in 1947 by an executive order of President Harry S. Truman after the Roswell incident to look into UFO reports. This group is composed of high level government officials, select scientists, and high ranking military personnel. This agency is a major issue in the ongoing UFO conspiracy covers up theory that persists to this day.Personal note: A curious question on the reported evidence of recovered material from many of the crash sites. While many cases UFO's are reported as having crashed and there being a debris field or a damaged vehicle, why is it we have within many of these reports material being indestructible, bouncing back to original shape after being crumbled and twisted? Or even better yet we are unable to cut recovered material but still there is debris at crash sites and damaged UFO's? So how does a UFO create a debris field if the material it is made out of appears to be indestructible? No one to my knowledge has ever addressed this inconsistency.Ryan S. Wood has presented cases in his book that do not answer any questions; I came away with more questions. But I believe that is the purpose of his book, to make us want more answers to those questions only the government can rally provide. Meanwhile Wood leaves us wanting more, answers. He presents the cases in a well thought out manner that gives the reader a place to review and get some basic knowledge on UFO encounters. There are some editing issues, but very minor ones. I recommend this book to those who have a passing interest in UFO's and to those who want a reference to some interesting cases. After this read UFO's by Leslie Kean."},{"Title":"Majic Eyes Only","review":"You folks out there who are not quite sure about what you have been hearing concerning UFOs, really need to read this very interesting reading.

All true, and these points are well argued and well presented.However, there is one glaring fact that is not addressed: that all of these wonderful things built and brought to Africa and Asia (at European expense) were created FOR the Europeans, and were designed with the intent of suiting the needs and wants of the European powers - roads, canals and ports, for example, were built exclusively for the extraction of raw materials in the quickest and most expedient manner possible - without thought or concern for the indigenous people. The same is true with the hospitals, schools and universities, civil service, and other social and political institutions.While admitedly this book is an &quot;apology&quot; for European imperialism, it is nonetheless a marvelous read, its point of view well argued.

He invites us to stroll with him through the countryside, discussing the mythology, superstition, and the science of England's aquatic fauna. It is an unrushed journey, though we often arise at sunrise, and the author introduces us to many of the local inhabitants. Indeed, if our fishing is successful, we might exchange our catch for the song of a pretty milkmaid. The Compleat Angler is a brief book, and Walton's intent is to hook the reader, and encourage him to try fishing for himself: \\"I do not undertake to say all that is known...but I undertake to acquaint the Reader with many things that are not usually known to every Angler; and I shall leave gleanings and observations enough to be made out of the experience that all that love and practise this recreation, to which I shall encourage them.\\" Interestingly, Walton starts off on the defensive, since the fisherman's passion was even then caricatured. By the end the reader has joined the \\"Brotherhood of the Angle,\\" making artificial flies and enjoying the poetry of fishing: \\"The jealous Trout, that low did lie, Rose at a well-dissembled fly.\\" To the modern ear Walton's literal belief in naturalists' old wives tales may seem humorously anachronistic, and it comprises a remarkably large part of his affection for his subject. We are also frequently reminded of the book's timeline with comments such as \\"...the Royal Society have found and published lately that there be thirty and three kinds of Spiders,\\" while we now know that there are thirty thousand species of Arachnids. And the Brotherhood of the Angle is a genuine fraternity to Walton, \\"...I love all Anglers, they be such honest, civil, quiet men.\\" The prospective reader must also be disabused of the misconception that Walton was a purist for artificial lures; he strongly recommends worms, minnows, and live flies. In Walton's watery world there is no dry humor, only fresh. Following his description of the twelve most effective artificial flies he says, \\"Thus you have a jury of flies likely to betray and condem all the Trouts in the river.\\" And here he compares the beautiful coloration of a living trout to...well, you'll see: \\"Their bodies [are] adorned with such red spots, and...with black or blackish spots, as give them such an addition of natural beauty as, I think, was never given to any woman by the artificial paint or patches in which they so much pride themselves in this age.\\" At the risk of taking some of the surprise out of the book, I here present a sample of Walton's fishing secrets: \\"Take the stinking oil drawn out of Polypody of the oak by a retort, mixed with turpentine and hive-honey, and anoint your bait therewith, and it will doubtless draw the fish to it.\\" I would guess that Walton wasn't much of a cook, however, and I do not recommend his recipe for eel (partially skinning it, packing the viceral cavity with nutmeg and anchovy, cutting off the head, slipping the skin back over the body, and sewing it together where the head formerly was, then barbecuing it on skewers). Walton's affection for fish and fishing extends beyond the aquatic nobility of trout and salmon, to the often ignored commoners: gudgeons, sprats, bleaks, herns, tench, roach, umber, loach, and sticklebag. And as for the importance of fishing in Walton's world: \\"I envy not him that eats better meat than I do, nor him that is richer, or that wears better clothes than I do; I envy nobody but him, and him only, that catches more fish than I do.\\""},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation : being a discourse of fish and fishing for the perusal of anglers","review":"If you don't know about this famous book by the inimitable Walton, you have a lot to look forward to. Purporting to be an account of a 5-day fishing idyll (when gentlemen were gentle men, and the English countryside was at once bountiful and near to hand), it is in fact a deeply engaging nostalgia trip into a never-never land of pastoral bliss -- an enduring cult classic having no exact parallel in world literature.To say \\"evocative of simpler, happier times\\" is to barely hint at the near-mystical fragrance of this enchanting volume. Three high-spirited protagonists (\\"Piscator\\", \\"Venator\\", and \\"Auceps\\"), devoted to three rival outdoor avocations (fishing, hunting, and falconing, respectively), meet on a \\"fine, fresh May morning\\"; ramble across the countryside in search of lively fishing and hearty times; sing, banter, and versify; recount ancient wisdom (of often dubious validity) regarding the habits and temper of over a dozen local fish species; and encounter a classic sampling of innkeepers, milkmaids, gypsies, and various other idealized rural types. This is a refuge book for quiet evenings, one of those unaccountably transporting narratives of which no charmed reader has ever wanted to reach the end.Some history: stolen in parts from precedents written as far back as 1450, Walton's work is nearly as early as it could be and still be readable without a line-by-line explanatory gloss (\\"compleat\\" is about as arcane as it gets). First published in 1653, there have been well over 100 editions in print. Some of the earlier ones contain Lang's sensitive and informative 28-page introduction to the author's life, the structure of the work, and its publishing history. Noteworthy are the 80+ illustrations produced by Sullivan (again, available in some of the older editions and their reprints), which are unselfconsciously exquisite: naively rendered country scenes and character sketches; finely wrought studies of dry flies and of the various species of fish mentioned in the book; and ornately framed images of famous fishermen \\"taken\\" from the evidently superb engraved portraits of Major's 1824 edition.The author was a minor legend in his own time. Held in the highest regard by all who knew him, this \\"excellent old man\\" suffered many tragedies throughout his long life (from the public murder of his beloved king to various family deaths and personal debilities), but he never lost his rare sweetness of temper. He wrote numerous other treatises, but \\"The Compleat Angler\\" early on rendered him a literary immortal."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation : being a discourse of fish and fishing for the perusal of anglers","review":"I'm flyfisher in Korea.

A lovely, idealized, Arcadian sort of England comes to life, and it is a very nice place in which to dip your mind a while."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation : being a discourse of fish and fishing for the perusal of anglers","review":"This is surely one of the earliest books available to the modern angler. But it's worth distinguishing 'anglers' from 'fishermen'. I take 'anglers' to be people who go after fish for fun or sport or pleasure and 'fishermen' to be people who go after fish for work.The first thing to be said about Izaak Walton's book, is that it is a play followed by a text book. The second thing, is that it's in a foreign language even to the English, because it was first published in 1653 when the author was 60. A ripe old age in England in those days.Walton was essentially a biographer. He got paid for it - often commissioned as a good artist might. He wrote 'The Life of Donne' - a poet who even I've heard of. He's alleged to have been a prosperous merchant, but it doesn't really matter. Great angling writers like Richard Walker were engineers. Old school writers like George Skues, were public school educated solicitors in London practices who took the train to the chalk streams of Winchester in Hampshire at weekends, tying flies as they went.The play concerns three people who meet by chance and get into conversation about their interests. They're travelling at a walk, and so they lighten their journey with convoluted conversation. Before long, it develops into a bit of a competition. Walton is the angler (Piscator). Another gentleman is keen on falconry (Venator) and yet another is keen on hunting (Auceps).If you tire of 17th century banter, skip forward to the chapters on each particular species of fish, which will ring true immediately. To me it's a revelation that these friendly old fish will still fall for the same tricks as Walton was playing on their ancestors over 350 years ago."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation : being a discourse of fish and fishing for the perusal of anglers","review":"This book is to fishing as military music is to music. True, THE COMPLEAT ANGLER does discuss the various aspects then current in England, but any focus on fishing was secondary to giving a combination of practical advice, pastoral fantasy, and good-humored piety. The book is a dialogue with 3 speakers: Piscator (the angler), Venator (the hunter), and Aucer (the falconer). Frequently, Walton abandons the dialogue and simply presents Piscator giving some very long instructional speeches on a plethora of topics ranging from angling to cooking to just about anything else under the sun. Walton is not bashful about inserting poetry of Raleigh, Donne, Drayton, Herbert, and many others. Piscator is not simply the champion of angling; he is pious, a moralizer, a gourmand, a singer, and above all, a lover of the lovely British countryside. Further, he is unflaggingly polite and upbeat. His duty to God is never more than one sentence from his tongue. He drops quotes from the Bible the way a Vegas gambler drops chips at the blackjack table. Since Piscator was so clearly drawn as the prototypical Englishman, it is no surprise that all Englishman saw in him more than a bit of themselves and correspondingly loved him. Non-English readers are often puzzled as to why he was so widely read. First, even non-fishermen can share in the joy with which he expounds the mysteries of angling. Next, he is a genuine lover of country sights and sounds. Finally, he embodies the temperamental qualities on which the English place such huge store: he is kindly, tolerant, patient, one who interferes with nobody and asks nothing better than to be allowed to enjoy his hobby in peace. His style of writing includes a fondness for writing a balanced, parallel sentence with much frolicsome humor. THE COMPLEAT ANGLER is a work full of digressions and a fondness for the fabulous natural history derived from Pliny the Elder, so much so that we might wonder whether so credulous a man could be a trustworthy biographer. Yet, it is this unsophisticated and uncritical inclusiveness of vast masses of unrelated and unverified data that constitutes one of its great charms."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation : being a discourse of fish and fishing for the perusal of anglers","review":"The Complete Angler - Izaak Walton and Chalres CottonThis book deserves a place in a collection of great angling books, such as those of John Geirach, Henry Middleton and Scott Waldie. It is really two books and an odd sort of middle section on property rights and fishing (funny how some issues have not changed much since the late 17th century). It has some wonderful discourses on not just fishing but the lifestyle and philosophy of fishing. There are some sections and descriptions that can be tedious but they minor compared to the overall wonderful dialogue of the majority of the book.The first section is written by Izaak Walton and, to me, was Canterbury Tales-esque, is it's older English language (which is entertainingly preserved) and its format. Three travelers - a fisherman (angler), hunter and falconer meet. In the course of discussing the merits of their activities the angler convinces the hunter to come along fishing with him (after seeing a hunt with hounds). Over the course of a few days on the rivers of England, the angler turns the hunter to the quiet joys of angling. He goes through the fish in England and all the baits and methods of fishing for them as well as how to prepare each of them. I had never through of carp of chubs and fish to eat, but after some of the descriptions in this book, I may have to give the a second look someday. The first book is as much of a celebration of the social and contemplative nature of angling as it is descriptions and methods of fishing. Interspersed are encounters with the local farmers, milker and inn-keepers as well as the talking over of the days activities among friends. But the highlight of this first section, and in my opinion the entire book, is the parting words of the angler to the hunter of how angling is a life philosophy that departs sharply from the hustle and bustle of the capitalist life. The first book is replete with references to early Christianity and its admonitions against looking to wealth for happiness.There is an odd middle section about property rights and fishing which serves as a rather odd bridge to Charles Cotton's section. This book focuses on fishing for trout and graylings in a small section of England. If found the wordy descriptions of the flies by month to be tedious and the lack of philosophical discussion of fishing to be a little disappointing of an end."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation : being a discourse of fish and fishing for the perusal of anglers","review":"Five days of fishing along the river Lea which joins the Thames near London is the background on which the cheerful narrative of The Compleat Angler is laid. The splendid civil conversation of Latin named Piscator, Venator, Auceps, Viator, and Piscator Junior is a joy to hear. Shakespeare was just publishing his first work when Izaak Walton was born in 1593 in Stafford. Walton retired in his early fifties and traveled about rural England visiting friends, fishing, and writing in his easy-going fashion. After publication of The Compleat Angler in 1653 he continued to add to it in his leisurely way for the next quarter century. Samuel Johnson praised the book in the eighteenth century and later Charles Lamb recommended The Compleat Angler to Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 'It breathes the very spirit of innocence, purity, and simplicity of heart,' he noted. 'It would sweeten a man's temper at any time to read it; it would Christianise every angry, discordant passion; pray make yourself acquainted with it.'The Compleat Angler is a true classic of English literature that owes it's esteem not to advice about fishing but to Izaak Walton's pre-occupations and exquisite manner. Subtitled The Contemplative Man's Recreation the pages glow with delight in the hills and dales, woods and streams of the beloved countryside. Walton conveys a message of meek thankful fellowship and peace to all \\"honest, civil, quiet men\\". 'The Compleat Angler is not about how to fish but about how to be,' said novelist Thomas McGuane. 'Walton spoke of an amiable mortality and rightness on the earth that has been envied by his readers for three hundred years.'"},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation : being a discourse of fish and fishing for the perusal of anglers","review":"Whilst this edition/reprint includes the Charles Cotton supplement, the print quality is abominable.

As is the case, usually, when I get \\"hot\\" on an author I grab everything I can get my hands on and read it in no particular order. That is the case here. Terkel, widely known and deservedly so, as the author of oral histories concerning the pressing social issues of class, race and gender of working people (in the main)in America was also in his earlier career a popular Chicago disc jockey concentrating on jazz (and a little blues and folk as they intersected jazz). I had not previously known of that part of Studs' life and only became aware of it through reading his last work, a memoir of sorts but really a series of connected vignettes, \\"Touch and Go\\" (well worth reading by the way as background to his interest in the jazz figures highlighted here). Previously my knowledge of jazz was formed by the likes of Nat Hentoff and John Hammond. Apparently I have to revise this list to include Studs.Why? As a member of the Generation of '68 my tastes were formed by blues, folk and early rock and roll and only incidentally by jazz. However, once one delves into the roots of all of these forms one can only understand the attractions when one sees the influences all those forms had on each other. Without going into a dissertation on the subject (useless in any case) jazz is a core beat that expressed one form of music that had its roots in the South, among blacks and was a reflection of the rural life that was being left behind as America became more industrialized. Jazz is the music of the city, as blues is (before World War II at least) the music of the southern countryside. But enough. Read Studs and you can see how the music developed (and was retarded as well by the rules of racial separation as whites looking for real music, other than the standard fare of likes of the Paul Whitman Orchestra or Tin Pan Alley, fell in love jazz after World War I).Many of the names of the performers highlighted here have are the classic expressions of the jazz idiom. King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, The Empress Bessie Smith. The Duke (Ellington), The Count (Basie), Lady Day (Billie Holiday). Yes this is the royalty of jazz. For those who follow this space you already know of my devotion to Billie Holiday and Bessie Smith. Less well know is my devotion to the \\"king of Swing\\" Benny Goodman of the Peggy Lee days in the 1940's, Dizzy Gillespie of be-bop in the early 1950's and Duke Ellington of the early 1940's. Well, if you want to know more about them read on. By the way. This little book's format is an early example of Studs Terkel's easy style that he would work into an art form when he went full bore at his oral history interviews later. The only fault I would find here is that Studs is a little light on female singers. No Peggy Lee of the Benny Goodman days, no Margaret Whiting, no Helen Morgan, No Ivy Robertson. Oh well, I have always been a \\"sucker\\" for a \`torch singer'. Maybe, Studs, except for Billie, wasn't."},{"Title":"Defense of Hill 781: An Allegory of Modern Mechanized Combat","review":"Pretty good, although recommended only for military professionals or the more advanced military reader; the book is very focused on modern warfare command level issues and so may not appeal to the casual reader."},{"Title":"Defense of Hill 781: An Allegory of Modern Mechanized Combat","review":"This is an interesting book for anyone who sees themselves serving as an Army Officer.

It does a great job of demonstrating how all the pieces have to work together in order to be successful. I think it's important that in this Counter Insurgency (COIN) era we don't forget about large scale high intensity kinetic ops. It's easier to practice high intensity ops and then learn COIN than the other way around. COIN relies on common sense, small unit leadership and understanding 2nd and 3rd order effects; but high intensity requires lots of technical training.

McDonough's educational monologue about modern mechanized warfare is still an outstanding read for anyone interested about what life would be like in an ACR against an equal and determined opponent. This work is an updated version of the military classic 'The Defense of Duffer's Drift'. Col. A. Tack Always is tasked to lead a mechanized battalion at the US Army's NTC to prove himself worth. Each chapter describes one battle against a roughly equal opponent. The point of this text is largely educational - mistakes are made in the early battles, but each time the Col (and the reader) learn valuable lessons that are put to use in the next battle. Overall this is an outstanding work and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the tactics or history of mechanized combat.Most of the other reviews are written by soldiers. I am not and never have been in the military, but have an interest in military affairs. If you want to know what combat in a mechanized battalion would have been like against the Soviets, this is about the best book I've found. Presumably this is a fair characterization of what mechanized combat would have been like in WWIII in Europe, and if so it would have been fast-paced and extremely lethal on both sides. Additionally, this is a story foremost about leadership - the skills and character required to lead a mechanized battalion. The amateurs are interested in the tanks and APCs and the tactics. For the professional, it is overcoming the sleep deprivation and the fear to make confident decisions (even when you don't know what the hell you are doing), to learn from one's mistakes, to understand your subordinates (know their strengths and weaknesses), and to get back up after you've been humiliatingly knocked down.This is a no-brainer - if you have even a passing interest in mechanized warfare (either professionally or as an amateur), you aren't going to find a better way to spend $15.

Louis Liggett started the company in Boston in 1903 and they compounded drugs back then, as aspirin was almost the only thing available in pill form. When I was in my young teen years, the only thing I could swallow was Carter's Little Liver Pills. I still can't get the generic Calcium down!The Rexall products were all high quality and inexpensive. Then the drug manufacturing companies came along and, after 75 years, put them out of business. That's why prescription medicines are so expensive today, and why we have to depend on them. The generics are worthless as far as I'm concerned as they are not regulated and not the same as brand names -- no way! If they were, they would cost more. Everyone knows you get what you pay for.On radio in 1937 there was a Rexall Magic Hour. In 1949, they presented the 'Phil Harris/Alice Faye Show.' It included a full cast with two young girl singers and ten men doing sundry things in addition to the two stars. Something like Garrison Keilor's 'Prairie Home Companion' show.In early television, NBC sponsored the half-hour program, 'The Rexall Theatre' on Sunday nights during the summer months which starred Pat O'Brian as your corner drug store pharmacist. The had a 'talking penny' in some of their ads. Comedian Louis Nye advertised their products on t.v. with the motto: \\"All for One and One for All.\\" Edgar Bergen and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, appeared on the cover of 'The Rexall Magazine.'The streamlined Rexall Train criscrossed the United States from Boston to L.A. and served most states (exceptions were Nevada and West Virginia) but skipped Knoxville for a route going from Chattanooga to Nashville to Memphis. We had the Southern and L&N; railways for this area; the ticket shown was similar to mine every summer to Washington, D.C. on Southern Railway. We still have an active freight railroad in Knoxville, locally owned and making noise day and night. Sometimes, it wake me up as I sleep with my window open as I did in the old days. It works out of the old L&N; terminal renovated for the 1982 World's Fair.In place of Rexall, we now have Walgreen's; the thing I dislike the most about this firm is the problem of \\"substituting\\" for the medicines your doctor prescribes -- not generic, but something totally different with unnecessary ingredients added. This could cause harm to a person's health. There are a handful of small locally owned drug stores, Long's in west side of town being the most popular. In Pulaski, Reeves's on the Square will still sell a nickel coke. Gregory Macdonald wrote about it in one of his books, A WORLD TOO WIDE.

For perceptiveness, accuracy and scientific understanding of the human process of handwriting, he is still 100 years ahead of most current texts. He explains why comparing single letters and words to each other is an invalid and often misleading method. In fact, if the \\"expert\\" is hired to do so, it can be used to prove that the true writer did not write the forgery and that almost any alternative innocent person did write it. Hardless had an advantage we do not have, since our ball pens do not leave the many tale-tell signs a nib pen using water-based ink will leave, such as pens employed in India 100 years ago.

I know that this is one of the \\"bibles\\" of psychopharm and thus to speak ill will of it is probably unheard of. And I know that Dr. Schatzberg is one of the top leaders within the world of psychiatry, psychiatric treatments and psychopharm.2. But this is a book review and thus here are my bottomline thoughts:a. I like the size of the manual; much more useable than the textbook.b. The content is... semi-bad. If you actually read the book, you'll quickly realize that this is a book (frankly like most other textbooks) where the overall foundation is the same the very first edition, with a few words, facts, data points, changed to reflect newer information. And I can appreciate the impossibility of re-writing the book for each new edition, but this is perhaps why all my attendings always recommended against reading textbooks because even they're supposedly \\"new\\", the reality is that the majority of the information is rehashed data. I can spend pages going over examples of where the text within this book doesn't reflect current thinking... to the point where one starts to wonder if it's even worth reading this book.3. If you want the most generic text that goes over psychopharm, this is probably worthwhile getting. But if you expect to get up to date, clear and concise psychopharm information (as you would get if one were to listen to a lecture via Dr. Schatzberg), then forget it.

I cannot imagine a life without poetry, and the voice of jani johe webster is now added to the voices of the Immortals. Her voice, unmistakable in its stark simplicity, penetrates the soul of our existence. The collection is divided into three parts. First is \\"silhouette\\": the dark vision of the underside of life, and third is \\"soul\\", which offers glimmers of hope and emergence without compromise.Dividing these parts is truly the most brilliant prose poem I have ever read, \\"the weariest river,\\" a title borrowed from A.G. Swinburn. The voice here is prophetic:\\"there is a cry Where are you? and silence breaks the mind -- a snake coils round the heart and orange-red dragons hiss in the face ... and we are Cassandra born -- we speak the words of thunder and read the words of the stars -- but we sit alone like Niobe surrounded by the death of our dreams.\\"it is the hour of winter.***\\"but somewhere between the then and the now -- the there and the here -- we discover self -- and if this self -- between the letter and the no letter -- turn out to be a carnival monster -- between the highball and the \\"did you hear?\\" turn out to be a grotesque caricature -- and if there be no self to discover -- but rather a collection of aped masks -- fastened to a dangling puppet -- what then?\\"we all have to make this search, do you think, before death nudges us for the last time?\\"For seventeen unrelenting pages the voice of thunder carries us down the weariest river and to a transcendent space; the images which pound us also liberate us with their truth and explosive authenticity.All of the poems in this book capture the silhouette of the soul: they are visions of what it means to be fully alive."},{"Title":"Silhouette of a Soul","review":"This poignant collection of poetry has touched me as few others have. The vivid imagery with which the author paints renders these poems so alive to the imagination; and Webster has offered a brilliant and penetrating view, through her lens, into my life, and life in general, experiences, and relationships (including with oneself), and the ways in which they influence who I am today and am becoming. She confronts the difficult times head-on, equally as well as the joys...Her lines, in an economy of space on the page, linger for a long time in the air, ripe with meaning and possibilities; I found myself stopping to think several times within each poem to explore the myriad layers of meaning and understanding. Sitting down with this book and a cup of tea makes me feel as though I am sitting down for an illuminating discussion with a good friend. Highly recommended for any person who would like to make the journey of the soul."},{"Title":"Silhouette of a Soul","review":"A poignant portrayal of a delicate, sensitive soul who feels deeply, loves truly and grieves sadly.With an extraordinary economy of words, jani johe webster starts with the commonplace, then cleverly shifts focus for a penetrating insight into her heart.

I prefer the main character to be heroic is some aspect. While it's great that Emma is smart,capable and has amazing resources, its disconcerting to have the supporting role be so superior and more functional. I get the social commentary that government employees are sub-standard intellectually and morally, but feel strongly that the main character should be heroic, or at least not weak and indecisive. Joe does more harm to incidental characters and never protects anyone he puts in danger. What's that about? We should admire him for feeling guilty?

And in Folkston, Georgia, a place at least sophisticated enough to have its own website (I looked), he has a woman in her mid-forties slumping around in a \\"housedress\\" (does ANYONE North or South wear those any more?) and a younger woman who is so ignorant (or should I say \\"iggerant\\"?) that she has never seen or heard of an alligator logo on an upscale shirt but apparently thinks it's a cute tribute to the Okefenokee Swamp.Less stereotyping please!"},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Two suspicious, semi-principal characters become mysteriously wealthy in the early Sixties.

In the case of The Inside Ring, however, you'd be dead wrong--the ride just keeps getting hairier as the story progresses.Investigating the assassination attempt at the behest of Speaker of the House is attorney Joe DeMarco, a gifted troubleshooter whose byword is discretion. Although a viable suspect has already been identified, Speaker Mahoney is privy to inside information which suggests that there was more to the shooting than is readily apparent. Poking into the matter, DeMarco uncovers some troubling facts concerning Secret Service Director Patrick Donnelly and Agent Billy Mattis, a member of the unit assigned to protect the President on the day of the shooting. Backed up by a unique support system, Demarco doggedly pursues the truth, placing himself in jeopardy.Although marred by some of Lawson's lazy habits (he's fond of describing characters as looking like one movie star or another), The Inside Ring is a great read, a book that combines action and humor to great effect. With a plot reminiscent of one John Grisham might cobble together, and a villain seemingly imported from one of John D. MacDonald's Travis MacGee books, Lawson's first effort provides a great jump off point for a series, which, judging from the publicity materials, was the author's intent. Readers will certainly clamor for future installments from Lawson, a welcome new presence on the thriller scene."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"From the adrenalin-charged Prologue, where a sniper takes three shots at the President of the United States, wounding him, and killing his best friend and a secret service agent, Michael Lawson's \\"The Inside Circle\\" provides a roller-coaster ride of a riveting read. This suspense thriller has a tautly written storyline involving political corruption, blatant abuse of government power, cover-ups at the highest levels, murder, incest, and a lurid gothic tale of a megalomaniac who rules his turf with an iron fist.The sign on lawyer Joe DeMarco's office door, reads \\"Counsel Pro Tem For Liaison Affairs, J. DeMarco.\\" The title was the invention of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, for whom Joe works. His job description reads \\"get it done guy.\\" He is Speaker John Fitzgerald Mahoney's heavy, the man to go to when problems need to \\"be resolved\\" in a manner which cannot be associated with the Congressional offices. When Mahoney orders DeMarco to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Andy Banks, our appealing protagonist learns that Banks received a warning note concerning the assassination attempt days before the event occurred. The note was immediately passed on to Secret Service Director Patrick Donnelly, who obviously did not act on it. Banks asks DeMarco to investigate a secret service agent for possible complicity in the crime. The deeper Joe digs the more suspicious, unsubstantiated \\"non admissible evidence\\" he discovers. And none of the information points to the suspect who supposedly fired the shots - the man who conveniently committed suicide before further investigation could be conducted.DeMarco is a terrific character, and his wit, (the author's really), honesty, resilience, along with the quirky crew he brings into the case to assist him, make the novel more unique than it would be ordinarily. After all, there is usually a glut of well-written political thrillers on the market. Joe's fact finding takes him from Washington, DC, to Georgia's Chattooga River, and finally, to a southern Georgia county which encompasses a big part of the Okefenokee Swamps. We travel with him through as many twists and turns a plot can take and still be navigable. I really enjoyed this chilling debut novel, loved the humor, and highly recommend it!JANA"},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Michael Lawson has invented Joe DeMarco. Son of long-dead Mafia hit-man, DeMarco is a lawyer who can't land a job with a big-name law firm because of his father's reputation. This is an unfortunate plot device since we all know the children of major crooks of all kinds are highly employable in our society. But Lawson needs this hook to hang DeMarco from as becomes apparent in the telling of the story.Rejected by polite society, DeMarco is employed by the Speaker of the House. See? I told you the children of crooks are highly employable. DeMarco operates as a fixer for the Speaker.So when an assination of the President is attempted, the Secretary of Homeland Security turns to the Speaker for assistance in ferreting out the truth of the dastardly deed. See, the Secretary can't go to the FBI or Secret Service because they may be involved in the plot to kill the President. The \\"inside ring\\" refers to the circle of Secret Service agents closest to the President. Since the Secretary of Homeland Security was tipped in advance of the plot --- and ignored the warning --- he fears that the Secret Service is up to no good. The Director of the Secret Service is a close buddy of the FBI boss, so they're suspected as well.Thus does lawyer Joe DeMarco single handedly set out to get to the bottom of the evil cabal.Yes, the story is thin. But it's fun. Lawson is quite inventive and conjurs up a Southern baron who makes Faulkner's folks look normal. The characters don't have much depth, but Lawson does an excellent job with dialog. Lots of quick thinking, lots of derring-do and an assortment of weird living things not seen in most zoos.All in all, a fun, enjoyable read and not a bad mystery as well.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Someone recently told me that it seems as if half the people in the world have written mystery and suspense novels and the other half wants to. My response: bring it on! The more the merrier. It's always a pleasure to encounter a new player, particularly one who comes right out of the gate with a confident work containing intriguing characters working their way through a complex but navigable plot. THE INSIDE RING by Michael Lawson fits that description, and quite nicely.The novel begins with a hunting trip. Actually, it's a special hunting trip, an annual event that involves the President of the United States and his best friend, bestselling author Philip Montgomery. This particular hunting trip, however, ends a bit differently. Shots ring out, the hunters become the hunted, and when the smoke clears the President is wounded, and Montgomery and a Secret Service agent are dead. A few days later a suicide victim leaves a note seemingly confessing to the shootings. But not everyone is convinced. General Andy Banks, the Secretary of Homeland Security, received a cryptic note shortly before the incident warning that the President's Secret Service escort --- the inside ring --- had been compromised. Banks passed the note on to Secret Service Director Patrick Donnelly, who ignored it. Banks now feels guilty and decides to further investigate the matter, which is now officially closed, on a clandestine level.Joe DeMarco is a fixer. He takes care of problems for a client of one: John Fitzgerald Mahoney, Speaker of the House. Mahoney calls on DeMarco when a situation comes up that needs to be quietly resolved without any footprints leading back to the Speaker's office. Mahoney lends DeMarco out to Banks to quietly investigate the shooting. DeMarco is used to relying on his brains more than his muscle, quietly applying leverage rather than fisticuffs to resolve problems. Fortunately he has some unofficial backup in the person of the enigmatic Emma, a mysterious, powerful and dangerous woman who may, or may not, be a retired government operative.DeMarco quickly learns that his questions are making some very powerful people extremely unhappy, and when he finds himself in the middle of a deadly gunfight, he is convinced that he is on the right track. DeMarco's investigation takes him on a dark and dangerous journey into the deep South and back across the decades where he uncovers the real reason, and the people, behind the Presidential shooting --- and inadvertently discovers an unknown piece of one of the 20th century's most enduring mysteries.DeMarco is an interesting character who is wise enough to know his limitations and isn't afraid to ask for help when he needs it. Lawson, given the nature of DeMarco's work and his position, will have a broad canvas to work from in future novels. And the presence of the ubiquitous Emma won't hurt, either. Recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Washington 'Insider' thrillers with a sense of humor are in short supply. Luckily, Mike Lawson's debut novel fills the hole perfectly.The Inside Ring is a fast-paced book that pits the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, FBI, and Congress against one another in an effort to uncover the truth behind an attempted assassination of the President. The narrator, Joe DeMarco, is cut from the same vein as Sean Drummond from Brian Haig's novels. He has an acerbic wit and the ability to piss off anyone that's in a position of authority. One of the featured supporting players, Emma, is worthy of her own series if Lawson finds the time.This book was one of the best thrillers in a long time."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"With The Inside Ring, Michael Lawson has quickly established himself as an author to be reckoned with. This book is heavily plot-driven and involves a bold assassination attempt on the President of the U.S. and the private investigation into the incident. This book is filled with action and suspense and will keep you glued to your seat, especially during the last 100 pages or so. The main character, Joe DeMarco, is a lawyer on the staff of the Speaker of the House who is put in charge of the investigation. DeMarco is a likable and interesting character despite a sordid family past and will, undoubtedly, be featured in future books by Lawson. The other characters are not particularly well-developed but are still interesting. The fast pace of this book, however, will likely allow you to (mostly) overlook this shortcoming. While not everything that happens 'rings true', Lawson writing style is very entertaining and easy to follow. The Inside Ring is highly recommended for your next beach-read or plane trip."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"The other Lawson book I read, Second Perimiter, was pretty good, so I got this earlier book - That was a mistake. Maybe he was just learning his trade on this one, but the hero, DeMarco was doing things like refusing to arm himself or take simple precautions when he knows his life is threatened. Later, we have the scene where he is talking to a woman at her remote house when Surprise! the bad guy and his elderly boss suddenly join the conversation. They were not heard driving up or walking on the porch ? That was too much for me and I tossed the book."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read Lawton's three Joe De Marco books in reverse order so came to this one last although it is the first one.De Marco is basically a trouble shooter for the off the record and dirty little jobs needed by the US Speaker of The House (quite a character in the books by the way).Here De Marco (aided by the ruthlessly enigmatic Emma) is asked to look into a Presidential assassination attempt and soon finds himself out on a limb with little support as he finds out enough to make him a target himself....This is a great little series of books, it rises above similar thrillers because of the characterisation and an undercurrent of humour that balances the action. Another interesting point is that the lead character is no gung-ho action man and he often blunders into things.Well worth seeking out."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I don't read a lot of thrillers and even more rarely anything with a political bent--but Lawson actually avoids politics and focuses on storyline and the mystery. His tough guy isn't typical either--he doesn't smoke cigars and fall into bed drunk every night.Unlike a few other commenters, I found the sidekick characters fully developed and enjoyable--no cookie cutters here. Emma, especially, has her own interesting story, and Lawson does a good job of telling it without letting Emma take over the story. I also found the main character intriguing with hints of past, unwanted ties to the mafia, and family troubles making the guy very human.The story starts out with a bang, slows for the introduction of the characters, then begins the tangle of mystery. It all comes together nicely in the end. Any violence is handled without gore and showmanship.This is a good weekend read, quick and interesting."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although I think the secondary characters could use a little more attention, the primary ones are well drawn and believable. It's a well-turned plot, though I wish everyoine involved: author, editor, and whoever wrote the jacket blurb, would have been a little more circumspect with clues. One reviewer complained of southern stereotyping; I say: barely. I lived in the area for a couple of years, and the description sounds eerily familiar to me. I had an owner of an extensive marina complex tell me once, \\"I AM the law on Magnolia Point!\\" (geographical name changed.) just like Taylor in the book. Out in the country the way \\"things work\\" is accurately described. And sorry, but people DO use \\"Y'all\\" in the singular. Perhaps they shouldn't, but they do. In any case, since there is now a sequel, we know DeMarco survived. I'm looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was my first Mike Lawson book and the writing is very vivid and exciting. The characters are well defined and situated throughout the book so the reader does not lose sight of who the players are. There are sections of action as Joe DeMarco, a lawyer working for the Speaker of the House, goes about investigating some unusual aspects of a recent attempt on the life of the president. Of course his investigation is sort of \\"off the books\\" and because of that he gets into a few tight situations as the story unfolds. And DeMarco himself is a colorful character because of some of the skeletons he has in his closet from his well known family's prior business dealings.There's just enough mystery to keep the reader turning the pages. At no point in the book did the story drag or seem to stall. There are few clues though as to the outcome until the reader really gets into the last fifty or so pages when the chase is on for the reasons why an asassin tried to kill the President of the United States. The final plot outcome is kind of a shock when the true motive and explanation of the crime is revealed.The book is one that I would easily suggest to any reader of mystery and thrillers. I found the lack of clues a bit puzzeling, but that peaked my curiosity as I kept reading. One by one my suspicions of why there was an asassination attempt were dashed away until near the end of the book, but again that made the book even more interesting to read. If you want to read a different writing style in mystery books you might consider getting a copy of this one."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Inside Ring is the first Joe Demarco book, about a \\"fixer\\" or \\"bagman\\" for a corrupt speaker of the house of representatives.

Demarco, the hero, is lovable, and street smart. He sort of stumbles his way to discovering answers. But the best thing about Mike Lawson is his great sense of humor. This \\"thriller\\" is laced with hilarious jokes. A great, quick read.

But, one that given the current state of affairs, could be considered remotely probable. Tred lightly if you are not a fan of the current political culture. While not overtly displaying his political views, the undertones are apparent.The main character's life and resulting personality and quirks are completely revealed, and the secondary character is left mysterious enough to entice into his second book, where more of Emma's story is revealed. Be sure to slow down with the introduction of a new characters so as not to miss where he/she fits in the story. Most of these are tertiary enough to fit into only this book, but I found myself re-reading passages to make sure I had all the peices together correctly...only because I couldn't stop reading and in my haste may have gone too quickly.A great first book by the author and prequel to his second which is equally as good.

DeMarco is employed by the Speaker of the House to investigate the assassin attempt of the president.DeMarco, knowing people who serve justice with complete reckless abandonment to law -- such as his lesbian friend Emma -- hires these bandits to round up information while trying to lie low underneath the government radar that wants to quash all secrets with guided missiles.Joe DeMarco -- who was put in the basement of the White House along with the maintenance crew to signify his small significance in the White House -- is the hero that doesn't set out to be a hero. He's the one that ends up doing the job regardless if he wants to do it or not. Reminds me of Postman (Kevin Costner; great movie).The story is good -- there is quite a bit of action, comedy, and Mr. Lawson understands sequence. The characters are decent. More time was spent with the plot than characters, which is fine, if that's what you enjoy. And most of his descriptions are good, but some are just a little bland.Overall, it was pretty impressive for a debut novel.

The assassin escapes, but a few days later in Maryland, Harold Edwards commits suicide leaving behind a note claiming he was the assassin.Banks tells Speaker of the House John Fitzpatrick Mahoney what happened and his belief there is more to the story besides an unemployed angry machinist.

DeMarco quickly hones in on Agent Billy Ray Mattis, but someone kills the prime suspect. DeMarco follows Billy's trail back to Georgia, but finds high placed individuals want to make him gater bait before he can learn the full truthTHE INSIDE RING is a terrific suspense thriller that starts off literally with a bang (the presidential assassination attempt) that turns into an exhilarating action-packed investigative tale. Readers will be hooked as DeMarco peels away the deceptions as if he is cutting up a Vidalia onion. If readers had to select only one thriller, Michael Lawson's tense deep and refreshing tale is a great choice as corruption is everywhere permeating everything including the sacred INSIDE RING where agents prime mission is to die for Eagle One not kill Eagle One.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"The book jacket tells us that the author lives in the Pacific Northwest, and is at work on another Joe DeMarco novel. Such is the way franchises are established these days. This next novel will be the second of the author's career; \\"The Inside Ring\\" is his first. It establishes a good foundation of characters and settings that likely can be expanded for at least several more yarns.The principal character is DeMarco, who does political odd jobs for a wily old pol who happens to be Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. DeMarco is escaping not only a bad marriage to a bad woman, but a family legacy in organized crime, which gives him an interesting foot in two different camps. His boss is another well-sketched character, dealing (literally) in backroom manuvers and intrigues that seldom see the light of public scrutiny. Also residing partially in the shadows is Emma, DeMarco's lesbian friend who lives in the world of government spooks and has at her disposal a network of irregulars to do various sorts of dirty work.The plot of this first book is not masterful, but it is clever. It appears that a disgruntled individual took some shots at the U. S. President (who is a presence but not a character in this story) and missed, killing some other folks, before capping his failure with a suicide and a confession. There is reason to believe that there is more below the surface of this attempt than meets the eye, and DeMarco is directed to poke around. He's not quite up to the task, but manages with luck to survive several harrowing experiences and bring the truth to the semi-light.The style is breezy and engaging, and the story moves nicely. The author manages to mix in some levening doses of humor, fortunately without having to turn DeMarco into a wise guy in the traditional sense. Some of the dialogue is a bit stilted to the point of being off-putting, and the author needs to learn to tone down the attempted use of dialect, which comes across as ham-fisted.All in all this is a decent first effort worth the time to read it, and one that probably will incline readers to at least browse the next Joe DeMarco novel when it hits the bookstores."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Not bad for a first time novel, but there is plenty of room for improvement....especially in development of the characters and action as it springs forth...a good story (Apparent Assassination of the President by an \\"Insider\\"), but it lacks the page turning urgency of a Flynn or DeMille novel...Still, a good first effort and worth the read...Michael Lawson is a writer to keep an eye on, but he's not there yet."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"When Nancy Pearl recommended this writer, Mike Lawson, by comparing him to Ross Thomas, i immediately ordered the book.

All of Mike Lawson's have both."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is one of those books where the US and UK covers are completely different and although the US cover probably divulges more of the plot than its UK counterpart, the UK cover is probably the more dramatic of the two.I quite often find that political thrillers, whether English or American in origin, can be a very difficult, consuming struggle to read and it can almost be a relief when the end is in sight. Not 'The Inside Ring' however, I think that Mike Lawson got this one almost spot-on, with just the right mix of political jargon and departmental detail, traded off well with some great violent action and personal dialogue chapters.Lawson has brought together a fictional political event and expertly interwoven the story around that of one of the world's most infamous political tragedies of modern times, into a seamless and continuous, well plotted storyline.Joe DeMarco, is a nondescript lawyer, trying hard to shake off his father's reputation, which has kept him side-lined for much of his career. Suddenly he is charged with digging into the past to come up with some answers of national importance, but his search finds him way in over his head and potentially in great danger, as he uncovers political corruption and abuse of government power at the highest level, which leaves the two main National Security agencies, trying to bring each other to their knees.The resulting cover-up, with the incident being very much packaged into a tidy parcel and dealt with in-house, leaves a trail of destruction, which leads all the way back to a battered and bruised DeMarco, who once again finds himself left on the outside of 'The Ring', looking in!!De Marco's character, although quite well developed, for this, his first mission, could nonetheless be built upon even more, to expand his personality for future stories, but for plot twists, action and political treachery, this is a great first novel."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Humor and reasonable action carry the day. I especially like the hero's dependence on an older retired woman to save his butt. Good deal."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked up this book because of all the good reviews I've read on Amazon. Homeland Security Secretary Andy Banks receives a note on Secret Service letterhead stating that the President of the United States is in trouble; the inside ring has been comprised. The inside ring consists of the Secret Service agents who are guard the president the closest. The warning letter does not garner much interest until the President is shot at while vacationing. The President's best friend, author Philip Montgomery, was killed, alongside another Secret Service agent, and the President wounded. Banks decides to have Joe DeMarco investigate the note more closely, even after the suspected assassin has committed suicide.At first, I have to say that I didn't like this book at all. I didn't understand DeMarco or his friend, Emma. Their personalities were kind of plain, and Lawson's attempt at humor didn't work very well. When the action started picking up, however, I was glad I didn't drop the book in search of something else. The plotline and ending was definitely unexpected, and while the characters could be better developed, I did end up enjoying this book."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Another good action-packed Lawson thriller, this is #1 in the Joe DeMarco series. I read #3 first, so I knew Joe was going to be okay in this book. Lawson is a very clever and inventive writer and takes the Washington conspiracy thriller up a notch higher than others who write in this genre.DeMarco has a very unusual \\"support system\\" - people whom he has met along the way who owe him favors and are glad to help when called upon. One thing I really like is that DeMarco is not portrayed as a superhero....he is just a normal guy in some abnormal situations. One thing I do not like is when an author interjects political views in a novel and Lawson did this a couple of times.The bad guys in this book are really bad, in fact they are evil; the plot is complicated and ingenious; and the solution to the mystery completely measures up to what came before it.There were some people who suffered in this book because of DeMarco's ineptness, but I think Lawson corrected this flaw in later books."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was an enjoyable debut. The main character is Joe Demarco, a son of a long-dead Mafia hit-man who is employed by the Speaker of the House to investigate and fix problems. This book deals with a failed assassination attempt on the President and Demarco's attempts to get to the bottom of things.This book is not a realistic political thriller. You'll be disappointed if you're expecting something like Richard North Patterson. THE INSIDE RING is more like an fast-moving action story with a lot of humor in it.I found this book very readable, and I liked the main character, who is refreshingly human and far from perfect. This book is relatively short and can be read in one or two sittings. I recommend this book for people who are looking for a good beach read."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"A fast paced story with no let-up but far too many stereotyped characters.

The story get's caught up in the cliched (or vivid as the book jacket tells us) characters and dwells far too long on the evil Max Taylor.

Mahoney orders Joe to find the truth behind an apparent attempt to assassinate the President of the United States. An assailant wounded the President and killed both the President's best friend and a Secret Service agent. Although the authorities have identified an alleged suspect in the shooting, questions still remain. How did the attacker penetrate the tight security surrounding the President? What was the motive for the shooting? Most intriguing of all, who sent a note to the Secretary of Homeland Security, Andy Banks, warning him in advance that someone would try to kill the President?The \\"inside ring\\" refers to those elite Secret Service agents who are closest to the President when he is on the move. They are expected to sacrifice themselves, if necessary, to protect the President from harm. Joe decides to investigate the Secret Service agents in the inside ring, and his inquiries ruffle the feathers of some highly placed and politically powerful individuals. Patrick Donnelly, the director of the Secret Service, is furious. He wants the investigation closed, insisting that it is absurd to assign blame to any of his agents.\\"The Inside Ring\\" is an exciting and fast-paced novel of suspense. Joe DeMarco is, in many ways, a breath of fresh air. He is the son of a mobster, but hates violence; he is as inept with his fists as he is with firearms. Nor is Joe a great success with the ladies. He has an ex-wife and no steady girlfriend. In thrillers of this type, the protagonist is often a superhero who cradles a semiautomatic in one hand and a gorgeous blonde in the other. Joe is smart, tenacious, courageous, and honest, but he is not very effective with weapons or women. He is a person that the average reader can root for.Another intriguing character is Emma, a former member of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a friend of Joe's. Although she is attractive, Emma is no bimbo. She is a fiftyish woman who has been there and done that. She has access to classified information and has a whole cadre of ex-cops, ex-soldiers, and computer hackers on hand to do her bidding. This fearless and formidable woman, who is extremely comfortable with firearms, provides Joe with the resources that he needs to go up against some fairly sadistic villains. It's a nice twist to give a prominent role to a middle-aged female protagonist with both brains and toughness.Michael Lawson's story, although convoluted and not entirely realistic, is involving, suspenseful, and entertaining. Lawson has a breezy style, and I enjoyed the smart and humorous dialogue, delicious political intrigue, and chilling action sequences. \\"The Inside Ring\\" is an auspicious first novel by a promising author."},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"\\"Eagle One is in danger... the inside ring has been compromised.\\" So states a note delivered to the Secret Service Director, Patrick Donnelly, who promptly ignores it. Now the President's best friend is dead and the President is wounded.Attorney Joseph DeMarco works exclusively for the Speaker of the House, John Fitzpatrick Mahoney, quietly cleaning up potentially embarrassing situations. Mahoney sends DeMarco to Andrew Banks, the current Director of Homeland Security. Banks is in possession of the mysterious note and hopes DeMarco can uncover evidence about the guilt or innocence of one of the Secret Service agents in the President's inner circle, Billy Ray Mattis. From the start, DeMarco is in over his head, but Mahoney is adamant, expecting a blow-by-blow of every conversation. When things heat up, DeMarco enlists the aid of a Washington friend, Emma, a woman of extraordinary talents, possibly a former DIA operative, with access to protected resources and the attitude of a Washington survivor. As it turns out, Emma is DeMarco's most valuable asset in a series of harrowing adventures.When DeMarco has sufficient information to involve the resources of the FBI, he and Banks are ambushed by top officials in the administration, determined to hold to the current explanation of the assassination attempt, a lone shooter who kills himself, leaving a suicide note. Faced with the stubbornness of the Attorney General, the FBI and the Director of the Secret Service, DeMarco and Banks hit a wall. Undeterred, Mahoney pushes DeMarco into even deeper waters than the Washington bureaucracy, down south in Georgia, the home of the questionable Secret Service agent, Mattis.The cast of characters is endemic to place: in Washington, DC, the sharks are well-fed and pompous in the exercise of authority; in the south, things are more elementary, the small time graft of neighborly politicians, the strong-arming by locals because the boss owns the county; and there are generic killers-for-hire, men who carry out their missions without moral constraint, soulless pawns who murder for the highest bidder. In each of these arenas, the author navigates with ease, skillfully portraying Washington powerbrokers and those who do their bidding, as well as the honorable men who work for the good of the country, undermined by the machinations of those in high places; then DeMarco surfaces in an entirely different world, quiet, beautiful country where evil wears a friendly face but is no less deadly, subject to a master of deceit who manipulates the powerless and takes what he wants with impunity.Atmospheric and riveting, this terrific book jumps out of the gate and never loses pace. The obvious is turned inside out as the plot winds in a serpentine path to a nail-biting ending. The characters are completely realistic, especially the overwhelmed DeMarco, who finds himself out on a limb with slick Washington vipers and literally lost in a gator-infested swamp in Georgia, pursued by an ex-military sharpshooter working as a Park Ranger and a silent Indian with dead eyes. Life goes on as usual in the Okefenokee Swamp, \\"strong things killing weak things, fast things eating slow things. All things screaming in the dark.\\"The bottom line is the same, whether in the nation's capitol or in a rural county where a rich man wreaks revenge for a poverty-riddled youth, an entire town forced to do his bidding. The corruption is the same, absolute. In a devilishly complicated plot, the tentacles of greed reach back in time, to a long, lonely road in the middle of nowhere, resurrecting the past as an avaricious secret is born.

But I just couldn't stomach this one. Everyone from south of DC is portrayed as straight out of \\"Deliverance.\\" The idea that some of them might be civilized, educated people who live in something other than shacks in swamps is inconceivable to the author. In fact pretty much all the characters are shallow stereotypes, and the plot did not interest me or ring true at all. And I work in DC and encounter clueless bureaucrats and inter-agency infighting daily. This book has zero basis in reality.Note to Lawson: yes, we say \\"y'all,\\" on occasion, but it's SECOND PERSON *PLURAL*. \\"Y'all want some coffee?\\" MIGHT be said by a waitress to TWO guys sitting at a counter, but NOT one.

His 'hero' is Joe DeMarco - a lawyer by trade employed ostensibly by the Speaker of the House as a fixer. Joe leans on lobbyists, points wayward staffers back in the right direction and discreetly looks into marital affairs and problem children. To Lawson's credit he is an ordinary guy - no super human feats of strength, no off the charts IQ.DeMarco is also the son of a now decreased mob enforcer. Graduation from law school with a mob associated past brought few job offers. But the Speaker of the House, for reasons he doesn't discuss, offers Joe a chance to be his 'arms length' aide.There is an attempt on the life of the President, and while the President survives a close friend and one of his Secret Service agents die. The Secret Service and FBI quickly locate the shooter and close the investigation. But the head of the Department of Homeland Security has evidence that things are not so cut and dried. The House Speaker, Mahoney loans DeMarco to the Homeland Security chief to look into the shooting.Joe finds himself stepping on high powered toes for what he believes to be a wild goose chase. But events lead him to believe things are not as they are represented. Reluctantly he pushes on in the investigation.Lawson's first effort shows promise and DeMarco is a likeable, believable guy. Other characters (obviously written for a long series) are odd ball, flawed and interesting.

I feel like I know him personally. He's a guy that you can't help but to like for when you need him he'll come. Trouble seems to find him no fault of his own. Its drawn to him like a magnate. He doesn't search for it; he doesn't have to it is dropped right onto his lap and says \\"here I am\\".Joe was first introduced to me through a free e-book download The Inside Ring by Mike Lawson. My first impression of this guy is he's not very smart. His father worked for the Mafia but his father protected him and didn't want him to become part of the crime family.Joe is somewhat street smart and to look at him you would not want to mess with him for he has an appearance of a Wise Guy. A good looking Italian with dark hair broad shoulders and great physique. But Joe's looks precede him, he is kind, gentle, and loves his country. However, don't let his looks fool you, he can take care of himself. He is an attorney but doesn't practice law. Someone who knew someone got him a job at the Capital.Joe looks into things. He is somewhat a negotiator, investigator, and a carrier. He does odd jobs for Congress. His boss is the Speaker of The House John Mahoney. And when John asks him to check into a situation he hesitantly does it with no questions asked, that is sometimes. No one knows who Joe works for; he doesn't appear to have a boss. He is lost in the paperwork in the accounting department with no direct link to any particular employer. No one checks it because his office is in the subbasement of the Capital building with no windows. An insignificant employee with a GS-13/14 pay rate and its directly deposited into his bank account. He lives in a moderate home in an average neighborhood and drives a Volvo. He is an insignificant employee! At least that is what everyone at Congress thinks.Joe DeMarco's first series opens with an attempted assassination to the President of the United States that goes array. General Andrew Banks, the Secretary of Homeland Security, had received a note that the President's life was in danger and he didn't do anything about it. He wasn't sure if this was a hoax and/or if the Secret Service was aware of it. How could someone get so close to the President? And where were the Secret Service? It is their job to protect the President. In fact according to the video it looked as if the Secret Agent actually bowed low to let the bullet pass. It almost hits the President but instead it kills the writer Perry Montgomery. General Banks looking at the video is alarmed and does not know what to do so he calls the Speaker John Mahoney asking him to look into it as a favor but not to stir the pot. For this would look bad for General Banks and his Homeland Security team! So the Speaker calls Joe and wants him to check if the Secret Service were aware of this assassination attempt and what did they do about it. Just do some snooping no big deal...Joe thinks that this is way out of his league. He investigates little stuff minor things not assassinations especially towards the President. That's FBI matter and for him to begin snooping could get him into a lot of trouble even killed. Those politicians who don't like the Speaker will begin to snoop and will find out that he's on no one's payroll. He could lose his job and where could he get a job? He's the son of Mafioso, even though his father is dead by the hands of another organized family member, he's potential employers would frown at the thought. And he would not work for organized crime it's too dangerous.Joe finds himself in a middle of a cover up beyond his dreams and needs to seek the help from the mysterious Emma. Emma had worked for the government and though retired she is gone out of town for long periods of time. Emma knows a lot of influential people and some scary characters. And Joe knew from the early start of their relationship not to ask questions. He wasn't interested in beginning a relationship with Emma for she is gay and has a partner. However, when Joe finds himself in a situation he can not control or dangerous he searches for Emma. Emma KNOWS people!!!Joe's life is never the same. His life is in danger getting way over his head and people are trying to kill him. Agency's like the FBI, CIA, Homeland Security, and Secret Service do not like outsiders snooping into their affairs especially a punk like Joe DeMarco. But the Speaker pushes Joe and wants him to find out what is going on!!!!Note: This is a great beginning to this series and each series gets better as you get to know this great character Joe DeMarco.The Inside Ring: A Joe DeMarco Thriller"},{"Title":"The Inside Ring: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I ordered the third book in this series for 99 cents with the Kindle Daily Deal and enjoyed it so much I went back and ordered this one.

Due to his prodigious output, there are literally thousands of his works in existence and they frequently appear at auctions and art galleries. I doubt anyone would say that Emile Gruppe's work is in the same league as Sargent, Bellows, Hopper, Eakins, Bunker, Homer or Mary Cassatt but, at its best, it captures the feel of the day and is charming and colorful. The title of the book, \\"Brushwork for the Oil Painter\\", is really just a pretext for writing another book about how to paint in oils outdoors. Sure, he tries to tie his comments back to that theme, but the most useful parts of the book explain his materials and approach to constructing a picture. He explains his \\"limited\\", pure color palette (a warm and cool of each primary), and how to convey depth and light as well as several tricks of the trade. Close ups, with call outs, describe various brush stroke and other techniques. The book is loaded with photographs of his paintings; many are quite different than his prototypical ships at docks in Gloucester. I've seen so many of the \\"ships at the docks\\" paintings that it was fun to see other subjects and some of his rarer, earlier works. I bought the book without having seen it and I was pleasantly surprised by its usefulness. The only negative is that some of the photographs and close ups are black and white which sometimes makes it take a little longer to figure out what he is getting at. On a personal note, I thoroughly enjoyed his brief descriptions of his interactions with Charles Hawthorne, John Carlson, Robert Henri and Harvey Dunn. In closing, at the end of the book, there is a selected Bibliography. Since people reading this review are probably interested in learning how to paint, and I think the list is very good, here it is: George Bridgeman's \\"Life Drawing\\", John F. Carlson's \\"Landscape Painting\\", Gruppe's \\"Gruppe on Painting\\" and \\"Gruppe on Color\\" (I have not read these two), Charles Hawthorne's \\"Hawthorne on Painting\\" and last, but not least, Robert Henri's \\"The Art Spirit\\"."},{"Title":"Brushwork for the Oil Painter","review":"This book was printed many years ago, but is still valid today.

Together, they embark on a journey to bring them closer to each other and themselves.Their road trip takes them to Mexico, which offers them a gateway to creative and emotional freedom. What they find instead is anger and resentment against them, not as people, but as Americans. This bitterness and hostility comes from all angles; fellow tourists and locals alike, are ready to confront the America imperialists who are the cause of all the world's woes.In an attempt to escape the onslaught, Nick and Sarah travel further and farther away, until they land at a quiet beach-front guesthouse in Esmeralda, a beautiful Yucatan enclave. Their hosts, the Von Tollmans, are German ex-patriots, and committed to living lives which excludes involvementwith polluted people and societies, while living off and tending to their land, which caters to this eutopic lifestyle.Quickly immersed in the owner's fight to save their land, highly coveted by greedy local and foreign businessmen alike, Nick and Sarah become deeply entrenched in the political forces that will soon destroy their personal undertakings and ambitions. The only problem though, is that Nick and Sarah find themselves on opposing sides.Al, the guesthouse handyman, has his own questionable and sordid agenda. Al, almost sociopathic, begins finding conflict in his own seemingly non-existent moral makeup, while Nick's morals slowly dissolve in an aborted attempt to save his relationship. Sarah and the Von Tollmans, in doomed attempts to maintain their ideals, become prey to the social and political conspirators.And there the book takes us: down a windy road filled with intrigue, personal digression, moral conflict and disillusion, that soon involves local thugs and drug smugglers, the Mexican and American governments, and the personal and cultural agendas that ripen the conspiracy plot.This is a story of disintegration, personal dilemmas and fears,emotional disillusion, and human ambition, both altruistic and sordid. It is a macrocosm with archetypal characters living in their own personal microcosmic world. Each suffering from their own human frailties, and subject to personal fears, they are lost and disconnected. The characters exemplify qualities that supersede nationalism or xenophobia; they are basic and base, each confronted with their own truths and lies, and the bitterness of their own futility.A great read.

In reading it, you feel like you're finding out secrets about your friends, colleagues, neighbors and fellow humans-secrets you really hoped weren't true. There's Karl, a seemingly kind old German hippie who's created his guesthouse utopia in the Yucatan, a retreat among the lush tropical flowers and gentle surf; there's his handyman Al, the ostensibly harmless beach bum dropout and scrappy ex-pat who picks up work in whatever country he finds himself; there's the brothers, a couple of colorful corrupt local officials. Enter tortured Nick from L.A., tormented by his unfinished novel, and his young idealistic wife, Sarah, who wants to save the planet, do the right thing, be good. Sound enticing? Sound too good to be true? Oh it is, and Nicholson masterfully, with impeccable timing, plots a story of one eerie revelation after another, until you literally shudder at the monstrosity of the human heart. Mexico is the perfect setting for such a tale, too, with its pretty surface that hides all the demons of globalism: corporate violence and profiteering, drugs, shifty ex-pats, hapless \`good' Americans and Europeans who drive the engine of evil with their denial and mass consumption of drugs and resources. We are all part of the problem and have to face it, because in this book-and maybe this is the larger message-the heroes and the villains are the same people. Tough medicine. But empowering too. This is an important and profound book, and Nicholson's mind and writing are like a sharp knife-beautifully clean, relentlessly sublime and ruthlessly frank. She'll cut you, but the scar will be something you're glad you have and a reminder that good writing is an awesomely powerful way to communicate hard truths."},{"Title":"The Road to Esmeralda: A Novel","review":"This book found its way into my Amazon.com inbox after *The Tribes of Palos Verdes*, Ms. Nicholson's first novel, came into my mind \\"out of nowhere,\\" seven years after I read it.

I like to read things in little pieces. I like to be able to put a book down for 72 hours, pick it up again, and resume the dream with minimum brain boot-up time. (I suspect this comes from my own experience as a technical editor.) When I flipped through the pages of this most recent novel, I saw that it is written in the same structured way as *Tribes*. It is also divided into parts, code named by colors of the spectrum as the wavelength increases. Cool! This reminds me, for some reason, of Solzhenitsyn.The book's main protagonist, Nick Sperry, is a \\"frustrated male drunk in the tropics.\\" Ms. Nicholson sure got that tune right! (Here is a female author who knows how the male mind works, at least when it is not operating properly.) The other protagonists all have serious problems, too, with the most eccentric of the lot, Karl, evidently the least insane. The interaction among characters is balanced, and flashbacks are well done. As a non-fiction scribbler more comfortable with manipulating equations and generating schematic diagrams than visiting with the muses of fiction, I have the profoundest respect for Ms. Nicholson. She's one of the best authors I have ever stumbled across.And now, a warning! If you want an uplifting book, this is not it. It starts out dark, and gets darker all the way. Is there a \\"moral\\"? Maybe. One might read politics into it; one might see it as xenophobic. The ending goes \\"over the top.\\" However, it is by no means an impossible scenario in this paranoid new world. But let's not kid ourselves. Many factors contributed to the ruin of Nick Sperry, but alcohol abuse was the root cause. If there is a message here, I suspect it could be, \\"Stay sober when traveling in foreign countries.\\""},{"Title":"The Road to Esmeralda: A Novel","review":"This isn't the usual type of book that I would read and in fact I found it incredibly boring for the first hundred or so pages. What kept me reading was the way the book was written rather than the plot itself. Simple sentences had so much meaning and depth, it really made me think. As the novel moves on and some plot finally begins to develop I became intrigued in the characters. Throughout the book I was not able to take sides with one character over another. Yet, I kept reading because I wanted to learn more about each one of their attributes and the reasons of why they did certain things. I was more interested in the character development rather than the plot to be honest. In fact the ending really fell flat."},{"Title":"The Road to Esmeralda: A Novel","review":"I started the book because I like Mexico stuff. However I discovered shortly that I couldn't bond with the characters. So I eighty-sixed it. It could be a very good book. Or not. What was really cool was the blurbs on the back cover. Jerry Stahl used \\"riveting,\\" \\"searing\\" and \\"wire-taut\\" in one sentence. Wow! Stokes Howell used the word \\"hallucinatory.\\" (I guess since he used it Jerry couldn't.) The picture of Joy in the back reminded me of that girl in the French movie that found that box of old toys. A little older though, obviously."},{"Title":"Alcoholics Anonymous","review":"The first 164 pages have saved millions of lives including mine.

There's a spontaneity in Mr. May's portrayal of passionate couples, but what's more amazing is the intimacy infused in his work through extreme angles, creative cropping and the depiction of depth and movement. I enjoy this book more every time I pick it up.I'd say that \\"Couples\\" falls squarely between the refined artistry of Patrick Demarchelier's \\"Photographs\\" and the joyfully haphazard presentation of Sante d'Orazio's \\"A Private View.\\" Mr. Demarchelier is unsurpassed (my opinion) in \\"nailing\\" a photo: perfect pose, perfect angle, perfect exposure, perfect everything. Mr. d'Orazio does a great job of chronicling a glamorous and fun lifestyle. Whereas these two artists (both masters) still leave the viewer somewhat at a distance from their subjects, Mr. May brings us right into the photo with a perspective that can only be had from an involved point of view. Sometimes we're spying ... undetected; other times, we're right in the scene ... point blank, yet ignored; still others, the subjects are looking right at us ... caught in the act. There's movement, there's action, and everywhere there's the sense of erotic touch. Sheer brilliance. The chemistry (yes, those pheromones) of physical attraction is on virtually every page, but nothing about the photography is \\"dirty\\" or \\"in your face.\\"Save for the thickness (it's not), \\"Couples\\" is a large format book with coffee table dimensions. The 100+ photos range from 3\\" x 5\\" all the way up to fully both pages of the open book. There seems to be an overall randomness to the ordering, front to back, although there are many groupings (with titles) in place to portray photographic \\"suites\\" of a suggestive nature. Not surprisingly, the couples are all gorgeous. Not one looks at all posed, i.e., the spontaneity of the photo shoot(s) comes across very strongly. These had to be the most enjoyable gigs for everyone involved.\\"Couples\\" is recommended for lovers of love, as well as lovers of great b&w; photography."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Not just as a study of black white photography. The power of emotion these photos emit is staggering. I bought it while getting over divorce, so the palpable emotion felt between subjects of May's pics was unbearable. I wept flipping thru it. Really strong."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"We reviewed this text together as a (heterosexual) couple and both highly recommend it to all who have an interest (or think they might have an interest) in erotic art. All of the images are wonderfully conceived and beautifully reproduced in an oversized hardcover format. After reviewing this collection, it is easy to conclude that Mr. May invented the art of erotic photography. The staging of each detail in each image is absolutely perfect and the erotic tension between the models drips from the pages. An absolute \\"must have\\" for any collection of erotic art and the essential first step for any couple beginning an exploration of erotic imagery."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I'm really glad to have bought the book, it's wonderful and exceptional. Exceptional because it shows amazing high-quality erotic images without being pornographic at all. I can only recommend this item! Stefan Mays other books are also worth looking it. I love them."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"This is a great book, I highly recommend it. I had looked at the book in a local bookstore months prior to purchasing a copy. At the time I felt the $60 or $70 the bookstore was charging was too much to pay for the book but after leaving the book there I was still thinking about it and felt the overwhelming urge to go back to get the book. When I went back they were sold out and I was told it is out of print. I searched online to find used and collectible copies for hundreds of dollars which I Was unwilling to pay. I found this copy on Amazon and was very happy. Upon arrival I opened the book to find a print wrapped in paper inside the front cover as well as the photographer's signature on the cover page. The photos are so compelling. Black and whites are so crisp, they are very pleasing to the eye. The couples have chemistry between them that comes alive on each page. The stories are so vivid and clear."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I don't care if he's a world famous photographer with a starry portfolio - these photographs are not inspiring nor inspired. They are ok, but nothing particularly touching, nothing that strikes a chord with a real person. The models have cliche looks and somewhat exaggerated and strained bodies. And say what you might about the beauty of the female form and black and white film, but his lens is more objectifying and, well, pornographic, than artistic on the female bodies. He is best suited for photographing celebrities for MAXIM."},{"Title":"The Shamanic Drum: A Guide to Sacred Drumming","review":"In response to the phenomenal resurgence of the drum nationwide, Michael has completely revised and expanded the 1991 edition for all those folks discovering the power of drumming. This useful book reveals profound teachings about shamanic drumming, which is a time-honored method of healing and helping others. Trained as a ceremonial drummer in the Mongolian and Native American shamanic traditions, Michael presents the first practical guide to applying this ancient healing art to our modern lives. Through a series of simple exercises, lessons, and rituals, he teaches you the basic shamanic methods of drumming. The focus is on creating sacred space, invoking the powers of creation, journeying, power practice, initiating change through intent, power animals, windhorse (personal power), geomancy, drum therapy, drum harmonics, drum circle dynamics, archetypal healing rhythms, and the universal rhythmic phenomena that come into play whenever we drum. Whether you are an accomplished percussionist or a total beginner, this user-friendly book will help you harness the power of drumming.Reviews\\"The Shamanic Drum expresses things as they are, and it's indeed true that the drum and the proper ceremonies are the way in which we balance and harmonize the energies of the Earth, its creatures, and our relationship with all realms.\\"-Dhyani Ywahoo, author of Voices of Our Ancestors\\"A clear and practical work.\\"-Julia Cameron, author of The Artist's Way and The Vein of Gold&quot;Apprenticeship would be the ideal way to learn shamanic drumming, however most of us will never be fortunate enough to have this experience. This book is definitely the next best thing.&quot;-Lisa DiPlacido, review editor for Friend's Review."},{"Title":"The Shamanic Drum: A Guide to Sacred Drumming","review":"Michael Drake has written a sensible guide to taking a traditional shamanic journey with measured drum beats to a alternate reality where, with practice, one can meet one's spirit/animal guide. He describes with obvious deep knowledge how to use and care for a drum that will act as both a vehicle to journey and as a healing tool.I got the impression from reading The Shamanic Drum: a Guide to Sacred Drumming that the author genuinely loves his relationship with sacred drumming and wants to share this timeless knowledge. His methods are completely safe. He states what I've found to be true: one always has one foot in this world as he/she journeys to another and can 'return' as soon as one wishes."},{"Title":"The Shamanic Drum: A Guide to Sacred Drumming","review":"I enjoyed this short book and found the instructions short, simple and practical and perfect for the novice wanting to experiment with drumming for journeying as there is nothing complicated here. Again, these are brief instructions so don't expect any deep explanations about how to drum or the lore and spirituality surrounding drumming. I purchased the Kindle e-book version since I wanted to read it right away and the price as reasonable. This is more in the neo-shamanism vein. The author incorporates cross cultural beliefs and practices into this book. Along with the drumming instruction the author recounts some of his own journeys. He writes briefly about conducting a drumming circle. There are a couple things I would disagree with. One is his relation of the chakras to colors of visions in the journey. If, for example, your vision contains more violet (crown chakra) he feels it is a higher vibration of spiritual level than if the vision contains more reds (base chakra). Colors can mean many things and also should be taken in one's own cultural context. Drake says himself that visions are colored by our individual experiences and culture so why would you limit the interpretation in such a way? Overall though I enjoyed this book and thought it was a nice drumming intro for novices. I notice there is a instructional CDThe Shamanic Drum Instructional, but the directions in the book are enough to get anyone started as there is nothing particularly complicated about shamanic drumming."},{"Title":"The Shamanic Drum: A Guide to Sacred Drumming","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the imagery presented in this book. The journeys of the soul were mesmerizing. The guidance for drumming was most useful. The songs presented were short, easy to remember, and inspiring. I was a little put off at the end when the author seems to imply that the book is more for the use of Native Americans (although I have some Cherokee ancestry) and not for people of other descents."},{"Title":"The Shamanic Drum: A Guide to Sacred Drumming","review":"I highly recomend this book to all the people that is starting a path in the world of shamanishm. This is an easy but powerful guide to start your shamanic path. The technics in the book are easy to follow and in practice the results are real and very very powerful and interesting.Thank you Michael Drake for this wonderful book that has helped me in my first steps in shamanic practice. A powerful and very real tool to heal one self, the others and this beautiful planet that we live in.Love and light.Miguel."},{"Title":"The Shamanic Drum: A Guide to Sacred Drumming","review":"I expected a book which explained the fundamentals of shamanic drumming but I got much more than that. Just as 'The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' has little to do with motorcycling or maintaining them, this book explains more about Shamanism than it does about drumming although it also does an excellent job of revealing the integral part that drumming plays in Shamanic practice.The author, Michael Drake, is an accomplished musician as well as a dedicated Shaman. He writes in a style that is pleasant to read and connects his points in a logical manner. I would have rated this 5 stars if he had included a CD with some examples of Shamanic drumming. He has released a few CD's but they all include other instrumentation to give them a pop-jazz feeling. I would like to hear only shamanic drumming with no frills which are intended to make it more acceptable to non-shaman listeners.Michael, how about a pure shamanic drumming CD?"},{"Title":"The Shamanic Drum: A Guide to Sacred Drumming","review":"I can't believe I spent good money on this book. It's neither about shamanism nor drumming. The (very little) material about shamanism is just a few quotes from other, better, sources. There is practically nothing about drumming. But if you want to get a New Agey opinion about the colors of your chakras, this is the book for you. Altogether, this book is nothing but a thin collection of shallow New Age platitudes.If you want some good books on hand drumming for non-professionals, I suggest the many fine books by Dworsky and Sansby."},{"Title":"Which is the Apostolic Church?: An inquiry at the oracles of God as to whether any existing form of church government is of divine right","review":"This fairly recent publication is a facsimile of an original publication first appearing in the early 1900's.There are alarming deviations from New Testament guidelines for church structure and leadership manifest in today's Church, particularly in contemporary America. This little offering knits together pertinent Scriptural references in a logical fashion, examines a number of familiar denominations and their respective chosen structures, then references these structural elements to the aggregate Scriptural directive on how the church should be structured and led.Witherow's writing is clear, and the flow of his argument is simple to follow; it is somewhat refreshing to read a presentation of factual material ...there is no opinionating here, just straightforward information. Makes for a smallish book, ha!Witherow wrote as a Presbyterian. As a result, his interpretation of the various Councils attended by the Apostles is viewed as justification for the current Regional Heirarchy in use by Presbyterians; this particular conclusion remains contoversial.But apart from this point, the book is unusually objective, valuable for it's integrity and brevity of presentation, and is a unique reference as a summary of Scripture on this very important topic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Autumn Conquest (Harlequin Presents #273)","review":"The Girl: Sara Elliot is the pampered daughter of a tycoon who has been separated from her husband for 2 years. She loathes the man, and has another hopeful suitor in the wings, but her determination to get a divorce is derailed by the overpowering alpha male's overpowering alphaness.The Guy: Luke Elliot is another tycoon, of what I can't remember (if it was even mentioned). He's built up his empire from nothing and become a pushy, controlling bastard on the way up. He hasn't ever given up on a thing in his life, and even though he's made it clear that Sara is at the bottom of his list of priorities, he's not about to let her go.The Setup: When Sara's father dies, an audit of the books reveals that his right-hand man has been embezzling and the guy absconds with the money. Also turns out that Sara's dad has been keeping in contact with Luke behind Sara's back and given him a majority interest in the company. So it's up to Mr. Wonderful to again take care of totally incapable idiots. As has been his entire lot in life. *sigh* Meanwhile, he's in the middle of a merger that requires the appearance of a loving couple because the other party, while divorced, is traditional and probably wouldn't agree to the merger if he isn't married. Luke says that in a year, the divorce will be hers. (More of a \\"Well, we'll see.\\") But he's betting on Sara not being able to withstand his alpha awesometude in close quarters.I think you probably know how this shakes out. If not, I'll help you back up onto that pumpkin truck you just fell off of.The Good Stuff: It took awhile for this one to get up some steam so I cared about what was going on. Ironically, it wasn't until Luke's family entered the picture that the dialogue had more zip and made Sara more interesting. Prior to that, she was pretty dull and interacted with only Luke and her Other Man, Perry. Me, the category rom family series loather, was glad to see a clan show up. Wonders never cease.My Gripes: There wasn't much subtlety in the flow of the plot. OK, there was none. The plot points were so big and obvious that you couldn't miss them. It was obvious that at certain parts of the story I was being directed to feel a certain way. \\"Why, Sara was just being a spoiled, selfish b!tch! Luke is sooooooo right!\\" and \\"Awwww, poor Luke! He's had to work so hard for so many ungrateful people!\\" and \\"Tee hee! Luke's mommy is gonna be gettin' some!\\" Stuff like that. It seemed all the more obvious, perhaps, because I started picking the structure of the story apart early on due to Lamb's rather obnoxious grammatical style. It's the same gripe I have with Carole Mortimer:*...Perry said teasingly.*...he returned coolly.*...he exclaimed softly.*...Sara said drily.*...she said scornfully.When something like that is repeated ad nauseum, I start to see only that and get yanked out of the story. Sometimes its absence for a page is just as prominent as being used twice in the same short paragraph. It's a pet peeve, but I can't shake it.Luke also does some groveling at the end and I normally hate that because it's so tacked on and lame, but he really had to say something even remotely like \\"My bad.\\" Still, I didn't believe a word of it. It was, as expected, so tacked on and lame.Plus, the whole \\"we must pretend to be in love because So-and-So won't close a business deal\\" ploy sucks. It sucked in Beverly Jenkins' Jewel and it sucks in this one.The rating is somewhere between a 2 and a 3. Eh, so let's say 2.75. Because that grammar quirk really chaps my hinder.Harlequin Check List:* Hero is an excruciating OTT alpha* Heroine is successful, but winds up in business distress & needs rescue* Hero has a Twagic Backstory that exonerates his a**holery and all of his family defends him to the heroine at one point another even though, yeah, he can be frustrating and difficult. But he's earned the right to be, and you just have to understand and accept it!* Heroine's other suitor seems like a nice guy until the plot dictates he be Something Else To Make The Heroine Decide* A family clan is involved in the H/h dwama and take sides/gang up on one party* Hero and heroine are forced to be together because of a contrived situation* A weakness/sensitive side to the hero is revealed at Just. The. Right. Moment."},{"Title":"Autumn Conquest (Harlequin Presents #273)","review":"Sara and Luke were married 2 years previously, but he was a work-a-holic who had no time for her so she left him. Now her father has died and Luke's come back.Sara is a great character in this story. She's not afraid to tell Luke exactly what went wrong in their marriage and she's not afraid to stand up to him.The only problem I had was the ending felt wrapped up in christmas paper for a birthday present. The entire time Luke is blaming everything that went wrong in their relationship on her and her father and at the end he goes a completely different path and says that he was going this path right after she left him. This would have been a very convincing ending to the story if he hadn't spent the entire rest of the book saying 'I'm not wrong, you are'.The writing style was great, and I loved all the characters. The clashing between Sara and Luke was fun to watch and the only thing I would have changed about this book is to have Luke be treated by Sara the same way he treated her during their marriage. But I am a vengeful soul when it comes to this type of story.If you liked this book you might also want to check out Lovers in the Afternoon by Carole Mortimer."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"In this book, the brilliant amateur hypnotist, Molly Moon and her invincible pet pug Petula are back!

Not to mention, she will meet her worst enemy yet, Waqt, a crazy Maharajah. Waqt is trying to change Molly's history, but not for the good. Molly is kidnapped by Waqt's poor, helpless servant and taken on a time travel trip to 1870 India. There she finds out she isn 't the only one who has been kidnapped.

She will need the help of her 4 younger selves, her friends, and all of her hypnotic powers to help save herself and her future.This book is an exciting adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat! Anyone that is yearning for a fun, adventurous story will love this book. However, if you do not like books that have many challenging vocabulary words and many pages then this book may not be for you. Also, if you plan on reading this book you should first read the first and second one of the series because it will be very confusing for you and you will end up struggling with the story. In my opinion this book is for older kids instead of younger ones mainly because of the vocabulary words and number of pages.

Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure is similar to the previous two books in tone and style. It is cute and fun.

My thouts about the book are that it is adventerous and the story does the most fabulos job because it tells about what molly moon does on her adventurs and her journey."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"\\"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure\\" is the third book in a series of adventures about a girl named Molly Moon and Georgia Byng delivers once again.Hynpotic Time Travel Adventure picks up right where Stops the World left off. Molly has found her parents, but finds herself not entirely happy, for Lucy Logan seems to have sunk into a deep depression and Molly feels that her own inadequacy may be partly to blame. She's pondering starting up a hypnotic hospital with her good friend, Rocky, and wonders if maybe Logan should be her first patient. She doesn't have much time to dwell on this, however, as strange things are afoot.Before she knows it, Molly finds first her dog, Petula, kidnaped and then herself. She's whisked back to India in 1870, where a strange man called Maharaja Waqt is upset that Molly has foiled his plans. It seems he's the one that was ultimately responsible for the events of the past book and now, using time travel power, he hopes to erase what Molly's done and further his own selfish schemes. He's largely unaware, however, just how powerful Molly is.This book contains deep thoughts about friendship, self-worth, perseverance and even religion. I found myself really connecting with what Georgia Byng was saying, both about social systems and religion.The Molly Moon books also have pretty well developed characters. While I feel the characters aren't quite as deep and well-developed as those of the Potter series (a very hard act to live up to), you can still connect with them and many of them are just plain cool (including the hippie Forest, who has a much larger role in this book than the previous.)Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure lives up to the standard of the past books and is actually even better. Word has it now that work on a feature film has begun, with David Heyman, producer of the \\"Harry Potter\\" films on board to produce the movie. I can't wait for the next book as well, as the ending of this sets up a great cliffhanger for the next."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"As you saw on the title,I like Molly Moon. If you like adventure,suspense and mystery, you should run to your nearest library and find the whole series. But you have to read the books in order or nothing will make sense. I can't imangine how anyone would not LOVE this series."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"After the exitment and scheme of the first book the third and second books were kind of a let-down.A lot of books do that and I find this book is no exeption. Same old story. Every time you think you have found the power crazed manic , you find out he has a master , a more power crazed manic than him/her."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"In this third book of the Molly Moon series, 11-year-old master hypnotist Molly is recently reunited with her mother, Lucy, after 11 years in an orphanage. Molly herself rescued Lucy from a long hypnotic spell. However, Lucy is not happy; she is full of regret for the years she has missed.Petula, Molly's pug dog, is also a hypnotist. Like Molly, Petula has the ability to stop time. When a suspicious turbaned stranger appears working as a gardener, Petula knows she must protect Molly. But when Molly goes outside, there's a loud BOOM and both the gardener and Petula vanish.Molly confides in her father, her friend Rocky, and her older hippie pal Forest. They can't keep Molly from being hypnotized by the pug-napper, who takes her back in time to nineteenth-century India where she actually sees herself three years younger.Molly and Petula meet the kidnapper's master, Waqt, a time-traveling giant who is angry because he wanted Molly Moon at a younger age --- before she became a hypnotist --- so he could foil her previous adventure in which she inadvertently ruined his plans to make his patsy president of the United States. Waqt's goal is to mine more of the time travel crystals enabling him to travel to the beginning of time, bathe in the light, and become young again. Waqt blackmails Molly (by threatening to turn Petula into pug curry) into time traveling to do his bidding.I delighted in the quirky characters, including the hippie dude Forest and the English-muddling Waqt, and loved the completely original plot in which Molly hopes to rescue several younger Molly Moons. The reader also gleans some fascinating facts on India's sights, history and culture.Although I was slightly befuddled by the time shifts and differing points of view of the different-aged Mollys and Petulas, the action and wry humor kept me reading on to see if and how Molly saved the day. MOLLY MOON'S HYPNOTIC TIME TRAVEL ADVENTURE is technically a stand-alone novel, but I recommend reading the previous books in the series first for the background story --- and for pure pleasure!--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (...)"},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"I just loved this sequel!!

I hope you buy these books and read them because I think you will Love."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"Molly Moon heads on her third hypnotic adventure, this time where time travel plays a crucial role in solving the mystery in this newest book. And yes, Molly does add to her hypnotic powers by learning how to time travel. Molly finds herself in India during 1870, where she meets a most rude and inconsiderate giant (he's actually a very large person, but it would be making him seem like a nice person, which he is the total opposite of) named Waqt, who also brings back three other Molly Moons; the baby, 3 year old, and 10 year old version of this currently eleven-year-old Molly. Waqt has an evil scheme up his enormous sleeves, which I won't tell you but let you figure out for yourself in this compelling third edition of Molly Moon's hypnotic adventure. Molly matures a tremendous amount in this book, which shows that the meek ten year old we met in the first book is growing up to possibly be the world's greatest hypnotist."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"Wow. Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure is one of the first books to prove that yes, sequels can be just as good as the original story. All the way through, the plot is suspensful. You will love the heroes (SPOILER): Forest, the young Mollys, Rocky, Amrit, Ojas, and of course, Molly, along with a host of other characters, both good and bad. Waqt is the terrible, yet loveable villian of Molly's third adventure. Each and every one of the characters has a fully developed personality that everybody can relate to...from Amrit's keeper to Molly herself. Filled with fun, laughs, and edge-of-your-seat suspense, this book is sure to be one you'll remember.amanda j., age 11"},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"Molly Moon is back and this is the best yet! It's my absolute FAVORITE book! On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 50! I love that there is a cliff hanger at the end. Byng introduces new characters that are very unique, like an elephant. I've realized that in every book she gets a new power, this time it's time traveling.

Bought all for my 9 yr. old and have enjoyed reading them too.Hope there will be a fourth installment."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"The first book was thrilling and a feel-good story about a rather lucky orphan. The second book was a nice sequel to the first, where Molly takes another trip to Hollywood and gains a new power. But by the third book, it gets old. The orphan we knew and loved is now replaced by some superhero-type person. I would suggest only reading the first and second book, and then assume that Molly Moon lives happily ever after with her parents."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"The first two Molly Moon books were really great, they grabbed me in and held me until I was done with every single word in them. By far, the first two books were my favorite in the world. I was really excited to read the third book, hoping that it would be just the same. But Nope, that isn't what happened at all. This book turned out extremely slow and boring. Even reading the book made me feel lethargic. It draggged along, with maybe one cool thing per. chapter if you were lucky. It was definetely the worst Molly Moon book so far, not really worth reading. But, if you really want to see how bad it is (I know I would), then you should get it. Then you can write a review for it on Amazon.com, and say how much you hated it! Happy Reading - I wish you luck, whoever is brave enough to read this boring book!!"},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"These books by Georgia Byng are some of the best out there! Molly and her pug, Petula, are 2 characters that you care about and who's adventures are always interesting.This time around things are a bit different as we have time travel added to her group of hypnotism skills. Not quite sure how hypnosis can cause time travel, but either way, it's up to Molly to save the day!I highly recommend this book. It is intelligent and doesn't talk down to kids. In fact, I found a particular section of this book very interesting in the way it discussed the hindu religion and differences from other religions."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"Once again this book is great for 7-10 year olds. My granddaughter has become an avid reader due to this series of books. Full of imagination and very captivating."},{"Title":"Molly Moon's Hypnotic Time Travel Adventure","review":"After reading the first 2 books, I had high expectations for the 3rd book. When I began to read it, I did not feel hooked onto the book at all. For the first two books, Georgia Byng always kelt you on the edge of your seat. You would think that you knew what was going to happen-- and then, BAM!-somthing else would happen that was unexpected.But, in the third book, I found that the book did not have this charasitic of the reader being pulled into the book. If you have read past Molly Moon books, then you might not like this book at much as the others."},{"Title":"Sunrise (Living in the light)","review":"This book gives not only great comfort to the bereaved, as well as the dying but also give knowledge of what happens to our spirit after leaving the body.

It covers the whole gamut and prepares your mind for the practical and more in depth steps relayed in his other books."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"I practically snatched this book off the shelf at the local bookstore, since I'm a true fan of Barbara Walker's treasuries but always looking to expand my horizons. I'm afraid it's a bit of a disappointment.Color photos are nice, but getting creative with yarn colors for these pattern swatches was not always a great idea. Tweedy yarns as well as bright-colored yarns (e.g., many of the bobbles which are done in bright red) make it difficult to see the texture; and a large number of the lace patterns, some of them very poorly lit, are shown in light-colored yarn on a white background. I keep finding myself unconsciously tilting the book trying to get some shadows so I can see what the pattern actually looks like.Another major problem is that some of the symbols in the charts are not listed in the \\"Chart Symbols\\" at the back of the book, and some are just wrong. There are at least two \\"mystery symbols\\" appearing in the charts. Several patterns which I know are using twisted (or crossed) stitches show cable symbols instead. (\\"Mock cable,\\" pattern #23, shows cable symbols - how is it a mock cable if you're actually using a cable??)As another reviewer noted, many of the patterns in the \\"Fair Isle\\" section are not actually Fair Isle. The selection of actual Fair Isle designs is rather scanty.Last and probably least, I wish there were more commentary on the patterns such as Barbara Walker gives, regarding the qualities of the fabric, suggested needle sizes, applications, etc.I give the book 2 stars only because there are several patterns in it which are new to me and I will probably use. (Unfortunately one of those patterns, #25 \\"Celtic vine,\\" is one of the charts with mystery symbols, although I think I can figure it out in this case. A beginner definitely could not.)"},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"This book has both plusses and minuses. It seriously needs a copy editor. The illustration on page 207 does not accurately depict the stitch diagram. Many of the stitches listed in the intarsia section belong in the Fair Isle section, and vice versa. (Fair Isle is unique in that it allows only two colors to be used at a time, whereas intarsia can use any number of colors at a time.) Some of the lace illustrations can barely be seen. They should have either been put on a darker background, or they should have been knit with a darker material. As is, they are nearly-white on white, and it is hard to see the detail.On the plus side, the book is well-organized, most of the illustrations are above the norm for books of this type, and some of the patterns are new to me, though I own several other books of this genre. The ring binding is a big plus, aiding in keeping the book open to the desired page as one works.Incidentally: the pattern on page 207 would be a great use of scrap yarn, and any number of rows could be used for the middle section of each stripe, aiding one in using up nearly the very last inch of material before moving on to the next scrap."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"I was very impressed with the collection of stitch patterns in this book. As a advanced beginner knitter, I found much of them inspiring, particularly those displayed in the cable section.I only wish it had diagrams or better explanations for a few of the chart symbols in the back. I had to reference a completely different book to understand how to do some of the stitches in patterns."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"Loving stitch pattern books, I bought this one sight unseen and while not thrilled, I am satisfied. The book is in color, always nice with stitch patterns books, and is well-organized and easy to use. It was nice to see sections on Fair Isle, Intarsia and Sequins &amp; beads. Each section has it's own color &quot;tabs,&quot; and there are thumb-nail photos of swatches of all the patterns at the beginning of the book, making it easy to browse. While I miss the discussion of the fabric the pattern produces (as in Barbara Walker's &quot;Treasury&quot; books), finding the type of yarn used in the photo swatches printed beneath them was a consolation. Note that all of the directions are charts (I know that is problem for some people, I've found that it just takes getting used to and has the benefit of giving you some idea of where you are going on the more complicated ones). So why don't I use it more? Probably just a matter of taste and undeveloped skill. I haven't found a pattern in it yet that inspired me to use it. Still, it's a welcome addition to my collection."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"This is not so much an instructional book as it is a design aid. I am kind of a novice but I can read knitting patterns and I like designing my own projects sometimes instead of just copying everything out of knitting books. If you are looking for a how-to-knit book this isn't it, but this is a great pictoral reference of many different stitches that can help a knitter design their own projects or test out newly acquired knitting skills in different patterns. I enjoyed the setup of the patterns, although it is unorthodox, and I thought the setup of the book itself was great. I cant wait to learn all of these interesting stitches, particularly the cool Victorian looking lace patterns!"},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"I am not new to knitting but fairly new to designing myself. I have found this book a great resource for adding details to my sweaters and socks. Not having worked from a lot of graphs, I easily caught on the the concept and loved it.

However, and this is a big however, I was very disappointed to see that there were no diagrams of how to actually do the stitches. The Crochet Stitch Bible by Betty Barnden does both."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"My mom got me this book as a Christmas present. It has some really beautiful patterns with pictures of exactly what they're going to look like, however, as others have said, it has some problems.I'm a beginner to intermediate knitter and have never worked from a chart before so I had to do a good bit of research online to try to figure out how to use the charts since, as others have said, some of the symbols aren't represented and there really isn't a good explanation of how to read the charts in the book.After my research, I was ready to try the Raised Rib pattern on pg. 75. I tried this pattern, I think, 4 different ways and pulled it out & started over before I finally figured it out. From what I read online, charts should be read right to left for odd rows & left to right for even rows. After looking through some of the simpler patterns, I realized that her charts are all right to left for every row.Once I figured that out, I started making some great headway. Perhaps this info may help others here who have had problems with the charts in this book."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"While not as extensive as some multi-volume stitch collections; this book is a handy and indispensible reference. The stitches are organized by type, thumbnailed for quick selection, and photographed adequately. The instructions are easy to follow."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"This is a delightful little book. It is especially nice in actual use because, while it has a hard bound cover, it has a spiral binding inside which opens the volume out flat for viewing. I also appreciated the photo index of stitches in the front. It permits the user to compare several similar patterns at once. The index arranges selections in sections listed as \\"knit and purl,\\" \\"ribbing,\\" \\"cable,\\" \\"bobbles,\\" \\"lace,\\" \\"fair isle,\\" and \\"intarsia.\\"The system of presenting the pattern instructions was a little confusing at first. I am more accustomed to the old system of \\"knit 2, purl 2\\" etc. The book presents the pattern in graphic form. You see the pattern as it would appear from the front, but the knit and purl designations change their character every row. Essentially while a dot may represent a purl in one row, it may represent a knit in the row above it. This confused me for a while. After using the system for a pattern, though, I started to make sense of it.The methods of illustrating vairous techniques--knit three in the same stitch, for instance--required a frequent referral to the key until I could remember it, but this is no different from the pattern key that is often included in many common sweater patterns.The illustrations featuring the sample knitting are lovely--I should knit that evenly!--and delightful just to look at on their own. The fair isle and intarsia patterns were especially lovely. My favorites were the \\"Interlocking Swirls\\" on p. 207, the \\"Inca Stitch\\" on p. 201, and the \\"Snowflake\\" on p. 203.A nice little book"},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"THE BOOK IS WELL CONCEIVED, AND EASY TO FOLLOW, HOWEVER, I'M NOT GIVING IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IS NOT FOR THE BEGINNER KNITTER, INSTEAD OF EXPLAINING THE STITCHES STEP BY STEP, GIVE YOU CHARTS TO FOLLOW AND FOR THE NOT SO EXPERIENCED KNITTER THIS WILL BE SOMEWHAT CONFUSING, BUT FOR THE ONES WITH MORE EXPERIENCE, AND ABLE TO READ CHARTS, BUY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"The book has many beautiful patterns.

But I've been knitting for 40 years and have been looking stitch patterns up online when I need them. That often led to a lot of guesswork and I thought a dictionary would be handy. The pictures and the charts seemed so clear cut that I picked this as my first stitch dictionary purchase.I'm guessing no one ever tested these patterns for the author. The key for the chart symbols is in the back of the book - so one has to flip back and forth to look up symbols that are not frequently used and memorized. I also found that some of the charts are incorrect. I tried 3 times to do the moving cable with rib structure on page 92 - and finally decided on another pattern for the small piece I was working on. I am positive I followed the chart properly. I even looked up every symbol in the back of the book and made a \\"cheat sheet\\" of the symbols just in this pattern. But even while I was knitting it, I knew it couldn't possibly come out like the picture. I'm sure I'll figure it out now that I'm sure the chart is wrong - but I wasted a lot of time thinking I was doing something wrong.Still I think I will have a lot of fun with the patterns in this book. I knit for charity a fair bit and many of the patterns are a bit plain and boring to knit as well as boring to wear. I am looking forward to changing things up."},{"Title":"Knitting Stitch Bible","review":"This is a handy little book. It contains a decent amount of stitches, not too much, it's good for a beginner. It's layout is super friendly, great pictures and nice graphs. The fact that is small and ring bound makes it even more practical.

I have to say that if you are a beginner, this is NOT the book for you. I've never been all that big on \\"Charts\\" so this is going to be an adventure. I have already gotten a bit of a headache from trying to \\"uncode\\" some of the Patterns. I agree with the woman that commented about some of the Lace Patterns, they should have used a darker color for the yarn, or the background. I do believe that the advanced knitter that was unable to \\"uncode\\" some of the Chart symbols will be able to, eventually, but only because she stated that she has been knitting for some time. I have also, for about 35 years, but I will say that I believe that I will have my work cut out for me on this one. But then again, it would be boring if it was extremely easy now wouldn't it? (hahaha) IF you are a fan of Charts, and have been Knitting for a good while, I believe that this will be a good addition to your Knitting Library. Some of the Patterns are very pretty, and new to me. For example, I haven't ever seen the \\"Double Moss Stitch\\" worked vertically before. It looks to be very pretty. Thankfully I will have NO trouble \\"uncoding\\" that one. (smile) Like the woman that said that she is used to the \\"K1,P1\\" instructions, I will probably be writting down the Patterns for awhile, at least until I get used to reading the Charts. IF you have trouble reading small print, like I do, you may want to re-think getting this book. The small print mixed with the semi-glossy pages are a bit trying on the eyes, and thus one reason for the bit of a headache I have now. Also, to anyone reading this before they purchase this book, ALL of the patterns are in \\"Chart\\" form. I, being in a bit of a hurry, did not relize that after reading the \\"Reviews\\" that I read. Then again, I only read 2-3...lol. That will teach me to be in a hurry again.

It's possible that if I'd read further, I'd have changed my mind.That said, there were several things that really bugged me:1. The author's condemning attitude toward his critics. It seemed to me he has a willful, prideful attitude that basically says \\"If you don't agree with me, you're of the devil.\\" I've seen this kind of attitude in a charlatan before. It seems to me more than anything else like a refusal to listen to honest criticism, and an attempt to turn the tables on his critics.2. I didn't like the way he was handling 3 John 2. It seems he was reading too much into it -- a subtle twisting of a Scripture.3. He seemed to be heading in the direction of a classic \\"health and wealth\\" gospel. Now, I wouldn't have bought the book if I didn't believe that it's often God's will to heal and prosper us. But this H&W; gospel tends to be out of balance, denying the equally valid other side of the coin.I'm sure the book has truths in it.

It's like everything you ever wanted to know, but didn't know who to ask. As a neurosurgeon, I am well aware that alternative medicine is attacking the medical profession to seek better answers for patients with chronic conditions, persistent pain from scarring and untreatable conditions. Jesus is the answer. The question is why wait any longer? The arrangement of the chapters, which may be your first primer on healing, will take you through an organized process especially if you're looking to get released from your sickness or disease. It works because it follows Biblical principles and takes away excuses that traditionally are hindrances to physical and even emotional healing. The scriptural stories will expand your belief system and your faith because your faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. The healing power comes from the Word of God and this will open your mind as the truth is revealed to you with new revelations. The commentaries captured in boxes are scattered throughout the pages and are worth the price of the book. The total message is easy to understand with a comfortable print, quality paper and a catchy cover. If you take the knowledge presented, make an effort to understand it, you will gain wisdom into these spiritual principles and have the power to receive healing and walk in divine health. If you ever read the story of the Little Engine That Could (I think I can, I think I can) you don't require any further training than this before you begin to read Aaron D.

From Lewis' writing style it is very obvious that he has the scholarship of a semanarian yet he writes with such simplicity that a young child can gain great understanding from it. Living in a world where sickness and disease has become an all to commoplace, it is refreshing to know that there is a voice that is ringing loud on behalf of people everywhere who are sick to rise up a be healed. The chapter entitled Now Faith , The Thief of Religion, and Words Count were my favorites. However, the entire work was written with great flow and consistancy. After you read it I'm sure you will agree with me that God has given us every reason to Walk in Divine health.

Nearly all his books are out of print, so one might assume that the works of Dennis Wheatley are best forgotten. This is unfortunate because, at least with 'The Haunting of Toby Jugg', Dennis Wheatley has produced some very innovative works of horror.'The Haunting of Toby Jugg' is the story of a young man, crippled during the war, being held captive by his guardian. Poor Toby suffers from extremely emotional distress because of his nightly visits by some shadowy creatures. Is Toby going insane or is his guardian behind all this? For much of the novel we don't know. The story has the feel of 'Misery' by Stephen King. It is taut, well-paced ... without excessive mini-lectures on satanism usually found in Wheatley novels.In addition, 'The Haunting of Toby Jugg' is written as series of diary entries. So it has a personal, psychological feel to it much along the lines of 'Dracula' (Bram Stoker) and 'The Woman in White' (Wilkie Collins).Bottom line: works well as a psychological &quot;captive vs captor&quot; novel. Of course there is the sprinkling of Wheatley's absurd satanist nonsense to contend with, but overall the book is a real page-turner. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Haunting of Toby Jugg","review":"I'm a big fan of Dennis Wheatley; the atmosphere in his books are superb, and his characterisation is masterful. Unfortunately, although he sometimes creates amazing plots, many of his books end with an unsatisfying &quot;deus ex machina&quot;. This is one of those books. The ending is not only illogical, but impossible, as far as I can tell. Not to mention the other thing that happens, which I can't tell you without spoiling the book.The rest of the book is fairly exciting and scary. Toby Jugg (&quot;ahaha&quot;) is confined to a wheelchair. He is staying in a remote mansion in Wales (DW seems to be very anti-Welsh, by the way) and gets imprisoned. Then he gets visited by demons, falls in love, etc etc.Not Dennis Wheatley's best book."},{"Title":"The Haunting of Toby Jugg","review":"_The Haunting of Toby Jugg_, first published in 1948 and made available here by Wordsworth Editions Tales of Mystery & The Supernatural, is an occult suspense novel by British novelist Dennis Wheatley that features themes of satanic menace and a group of Satanists behind it. Dennis Wheatley (1897 - 1977) was a British novelist who is perhaps best known for his occult thriller novels. Wheatley was a fierce defender of British royalty, the empire, and the class system and his novels feature characters who also adhere to this particular point of view. In particular, this novel is dedicated to the R.A.F. and features a fiercely patriotic main character, Toby Jugg, who has been paralyzed as a result of being shot down while piloting a plane for the R.A.F. The novel takes place during the Second World War and Wheatley makes frequent mention of both Hitler and the Communists. In particular, Wheatley shows a character who is destined to inherit wealth but who must face Communist agents in league with Satanists. Wheatley's novels also feature a religious theme, and while Wheatley was avowedly Christian he maintained some unorthodox beliefs such as a belief in reincarnation (as expressed by one of the characters in the novel through the book _Winged Pharaoh_ of Joan Grant). Wheatley also features themes of black magic and satanic sacrifice as well as a belief in ghosts and the paranormal. In particular, the main character Toby Jugg in this novel recounts an encounter with a ghost that echoes one of Wheatley's own encounters with a spirit. This novel remains a central contribution by Wheatley and is an enjoyable read among occult thrillers.The novel is laid out in a series of journal entries made by the paralyzed Toby Jugg in a stamp collection book. Toby Jugg is a wealthy heir to great wealth that he will inherit on his twenty-first birthday from his grandfather. He was schooled at a special preparatory school known as the Weylands Abbey, where he was not instructed in religion and brought up in a general atmosphere of atheism, materialism, and liberalism. It was here that he met Dr. Helmuth Lisicky who becomes in charge of his trust and who he will later begin to suspect of satanic activity. While under the tutelage of Helmuth, Toby Jugg runs away and joins the R.A.F. where he becomes a pilot, earning the nickname of \\"the Viking\\" because of his red hair and his fierce combativeness. However, he has been shot down and become paralyzed as a result. The story takes place in a castle in Wales where the paralyzed Toby Jugg is attended to by nurses and Helmuth. Initially Toby Jugg recounts his encounter with a demonic infestation which he believes to be shaped like an octopus that he sees in the moonlight. His nurse Deb and attendant Taffy attend to his needs during the day; however, soon Toby Jugg comes to suspect Helmuth of plotting against him. In the meantime, he has taken a renewed interest in religion and has begun praying. Eventually, he will find it necessary to hypnotize Deb (who turns out to be a communist agent working in England) and Taffy and get them to help him against Helmuth. He attempts to escape the grasp of Helmuth by hypnotizing Taffy; however, he is captured and brought back to the castle. He also manages to notify his uncle Paul (who is on the board of trustees) and his Italian wife Julia about the situation and his difficulties with Helmuth. However, both come down to patch things up between Toby Jugg and Helmuth. Deb is forced to leave and he receives a new nurse, Nurse Cardew, who will become his love interest. In the meantime, Helmuth does turn out to be a Satanist and explains how by joining the \\"Brotherhood\\" Toby Jugg can expect to survive financially and avoid the excessive taxation of his wealth during an era of socialism and the expectant rise of communism. Toby Jugg considers the offer but ultimately must decline because it would require him to sign over all his wealth to the Brotherhood. In the meantime, Helmuth plagues him with an infestation of spiders. We also learn that Toby Jugg's Great-aunt Sarah who is mentally addled has been slowly digging a tunnel underneath the castle to re-capture her \\"Launcelot\\". Further, we learn that Nurse Cardew, who is a devoted Englishwoman, can be trusted and falls in love with Toby Jugg. She also tells him of her theory of reincarnation, echoing the themes of Joan Grant's book mentioned above. In addition, it becomes apparent that Helmuth is attempting to have Toby Jugg declared insane so that he can attain his wealth in that manner. The rest of the story plays out with many surprises as Uncle Paul and Julia come to visit again and a group of Satanists meets to summon forth the demon. Ultimately the enterprises of Great-aunt Sarah may prove fruitful for Toby Jugg.This novel is an enjoyable read and is recommended to all who would be interested in the works of Dennis Wheatley. As with all his novels, the heroes are champions of the British empire while they are plagued by the nefarious doings of the Communists and Satanists. As an occult thriller, this novel is certainly highly enjoyable and recommended on that account."},{"Title":"The Haunting of Toby Jugg","review":"This book is exactly as shown.

But after a promising start, I was disappointed to find this book to be pretty dull and I skimmed most of the last 200 of 300 pages. It's a journal written by a crippled RAF airmen and his rambling discourses are sometimes very boring. The story could have been trimmed by 100 or more pages at least. It's not really a ghost story, either. Not recommended, and hard to understand how it has such a good reputation."},{"Title":"The Haunting of Toby Jugg","review":"I had watched the movie The Haunted Airman which is based on The Haunting of Toby Jugg before I read it.

I enjoyed the book very much even though it was tough to get through in some places. There was a lot of religious talk in it that I personally didn't agree with, but I didn't write the book and I know that I don't have to agree with the opinions of others. Anyway, all in all I enjoyed the book and the interesting twists and turns that took place.

When I was a kid all the old ladies used to like to watch him on TV and say what a nice guy he was. They truly believed he was a bachelor who hadn't met the right girl yet, he took such good care of his mother and he had such a nice personality. Well, Liberace was sick with AIDS when this book was published less than a year before he died. He never admitted being sick -- in fact he referenced the rumors and dismissed them. He told stories of his seduction by women (only), and he showcased his horrendously over-the-top material boy life. He was writing a book about how he wanted to be remembered, with a tremendous amount of spin. It was just the way the old ladies in Milwaukee would have wanted to remember him. Even at the end of his life he was Mr. Showmanship. This book is very amusing and kitschy but it is especially valuable to demonstrate the way the mid-1980s world could deny the realities of AIDS and homosexuality."},{"Title":"The Physics of Sports (Physics of Sports)","review":"This is a collection of articles on the science (specifically physics) of different sports.

There is no meat on this bone! There is no advice on how to really find a supplier and qualify them, and no advice on what type of products to import. From the looks of it he imports pianos. That's fine, but a poor product to start out with!He talks about importing a full container (20 or 40 foot). You are nuts to do that. You need to start with a LCL (Less than Container Load, something like a pallet or two) which has a significantly lower risk. Getting a warehouse right away? Use your garage or an extra bedroom until you get a good footing.He talks a lot about the tools on his website. His website is useless! He has links to eBay research tools that do not work. Also, if you sell primarily on eBay you don't need your own website (at least not at the start).I was amused by a few lines on how you could reduce your costs by flying to China with cash to pay for your purchase ahead of time. This would reduce your invoice amount thus reducing your import duties. Then he says this is illegal and you would likely spend more on the plane ticket than savings on the duties. Huh???? What was the purpose of that?There is maybe three or four pages with a bit of useful information. Overall, this is a train wreck. The people that give this 5 stars and try his \\"methods\\" will likely have a problem.My advice if you do? Start small and keep your risk down to what you can lose. Find a good customs broker in your locale and get some help from them. They are experts at this despite what this guy says.Lastly, he should spend a few bucks on an editor!!

The title is deceptive, as very little of the book deals with building an eBay business. The author's basic recommendations (all very superficially presented) are that you: attend trade shows in China to find products to sell, choose products that must be delivered as freight (your barrier to entry in his scenario is the fact that UPS and FedEx don't ship big things, so many sellers don't want to deal with big things -- me either!), incorporate in Nevada, and lease a warehouse in Long Beach, California. It's a 93-page book, supposedly about selling on eBay; yet hardly any of the book deals with eBay. There's a chapter on developing your corporate identity, but no mention of the logistics involved in getting containers delivered to anywhere but Long Beach. There's a chapter on getting your website up (unnecessary if you're selling on eBay), but nothing specific about an eBay storefront. In the chapter entitled \\"Ebay, PayPal, Escrow, and Your Security,\\" the author writes: \\"Ebay is the subject of many books--4,136 on Amazon, to be exact. Why else do you think I have eBay in my book title?\\" Good question."},{"Title":"The Maui CEO: Import from China, Sell on eBay, and Live Wherever You Want","review":"I found this book to be full of useful information and references. The author covers a lot of topics and if you don't have the imagination to look beyond coffins, then you won't make it in business anyway. I need broad information at this point, not details about one aspect of starting an eBay business. This book give you a lot to think about that you might not otherwise think of."},{"Title":"The Maui CEO: Import from China, Sell on eBay, and Live Wherever You Want","review":"First of all, it's easy to read yet packed with solid business and financial information. Second, Maui CEO is the ultimate expression of buying low and using e-commerce to leverage a small business. There are obviously different ways of going about this, and I think another reviewer misses this point. Using weight loss as an analogy, you can't be successful with Atkins if you follow only the parts that make sense to you. Likewise, if you import via LTL and store the stuff in your garage, you haven't lowered your risk: you've already lost, because you are acquiring your product from a distributor (i.e. not getting the lowest price) and you are selling a product (iPod headphones, or whatever) that does not have any competitive barriers.I like the reviewer using specifics about what he didn't like or believe, but he misses the book's ultimate points on how to buy low. I don't even think a quality Chinese manufacturer will sell LTL quantities anyway.To summarize the book's point in this area, 1) sell items that weigh more than 150 lbs so that UPS can't ship it (to reduce competition); 2) sell items that are more expensive which gives buyers more reason to buy online (like air conditioners or Jacuzzis)--the more money you save, the more incentive buyers have to buy online; and 3) the process of container shipping is clearly spelled out. To me, that's good advice.Unlike today's hot book--The 4-hour Workweek--I believe Maui CEO contains nothing but meat--written in a way that makes fighting the big-guys possible and practical."},{"Title":"The Maui CEO: Import from China, Sell on eBay, and Live Wherever You Want","review":"I was amazed at how much punch this little book packs.

In doing so, he provided answers to decisions to be made and provides \\"why\\" he chose that option over a few others by showing pros and cons - all in very few words.

I think the advice on \\"creating barriers to entry\\" is brilliantly easy to understand and execute to. It is not a \\"how to be an eBay seller\\" general guide, but provides specific advice around picking products that have more limited competition given the logistics of moving that product. For instance, selling large outdoor children's playsets, which can't be shipped by UPS, naturally reduces your competition, so that you aren't among 1000 others selling the same thing on eBay.

But Lily comes across as a shrill bully, and Shana is portrayed as a narcissistic brat. Lily's nemesis, her ex-husband John, is written as such a one-dimensional villain, that when he meets his demise, the reader is left wondering &quot;What took so long?&quot; Equally underwritten is Lily's lover, Richard, who is still pining for her even though six years have passed, and he has been living with another woman for three of them. It makes no sense. Rosenberg simply asks the reader to accept that Lily and Richard are madly in love, and that Richard would do anything for Lily. although there is nothing about Lily's neurotic personality that would back Richard's feelings up.Rosenberg is a talented writer, and I know because I've read better books by her, &quot;Interests of Justice&quot; and &quot;Mitigating Circumstances&quot; being two of them. I like the fact that her heroines aren't conventional rich, flawless skinned heiresses who don't have a problem in the world except for a stalker/in love with another man/can't have a baby/etc. Her main characters struggle with overwhelming problems, like coping with a convicted rapist being on the loose, along with the mundane ones, like not being able to pay the car note or the credit card bills.

She has a deadbeat ex-husband, a troubled daughter, and a stormy past, including some dark secrets that she is desperate to keep hidden. This novel falls short on a number of counts. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are undeveloped and the plot is contrived and unrealistic. Lily's character never comes alive.

Neither Lily's and Richard's relationship nor the various legal plot lines in &quot;Buried Evidence&quot; held my intrerest. This is a thriller that never comes to life."},{"Title":"Buried Evidence","review":"She is considered one of the best prosecuting attorneys assigned to the Santa Barbara District Attorney's Office. Lily Forrester firmly believes in the law and punishment for those who break it. Six years ago (see MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES), Lily and her daughter were victims of a heinous crime until she took the law into her own hands. Lily has never forgiven herself for her actions, but knows she must move on to help her precious daughter enjoy a normal life.When Lily's ex-husband is arrested for vehicular homicide, her life teeters on the brink of disaster. He threatens to reveal what he thinks he knows about that crime she committed six years ago if she does not bail him out and obtain a reputable representative to defend him. To add to her confusion, the man she loves, defense attorney Richard Fowler, is back in her life demanding a future together. Even when her former spouse squeals on her to cut a deal on his charges, Richard remains by her side.It has been too long a time since Nancy Taylor Rosenberg has had a book published, but anyone who loves a terse legal thriller will know she has not lost her magic touch. BURIED EVIDENCE stars a beleaguered heroine in an action-packed story line that starts on page one and never eases on the throttle until the last page is done. Readers will never be sure they know the outcome because the subplots take the audience to and from the central theme with an ease that will leave the audience wondering how the novel will end. Her latest novel has plenty of evidence proving that Ms. Rosenberg remains one of the sub-genre's top maestros.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Buried Evidence","review":"This book was a long time coming for me. It seems as though NTR had not published anything of this type for a while. Although I thought this book had its moments - it really takes an interesting look at both the &quot;police procedurial&quot; and the &quot;victim&quot; side of the laws, including a very interesting turn of events for Lilly's estranged husband- the author insists on MUDDLING this by overdoing it with the interaction between Lilly(the main character) and Shana (her daughter). While I realize that this is one of the main plotlines, the author makes Shana sound like a whiny 5 year old (when indeed she is in college) who cannot function without daddy or mommy.She made the main character (Lilly) sound like a dotting mother, absolutely controlled by every whiny emotion Shana has.Frankly, this whole relationship did not work at all and seriously removed a lot of the pleasure of this book for me.I wish the author would just stick to the legal thriller aspect which, in my opinion, is the only redeeming feature in this book."},{"Title":"Buried Evidence","review":"District attorney, Lily Forrester, has built her career striving for justice, Lily also holds a secret that will ruin her career, and her life.Lily's ex husband, John, has been accused of a horrible crime, and to escape criminal charges he will use Lily's secret as leverage to get him out of this situation.As Lily helps her ex husband (much against her will), her daughter, Shana, will be thrown into the middle of the police investigation...as a suspect, and to make matters worse-a rapist that Lily prosecuted 6 years earlier is now out on the streets, and he is looking to settle his score with both Lily, and her daughter.&quot;Buried Evidence&quot; is a fast moving thriller, that will have readers eagerly turning pages to discover if Lily will triumph over her battles.Nancy Taylor Rosenberg has not written a novel in far too many years, and this anticipated new book was well worth the wait. She has returned with a page turner that thrills and excites, and readers of her novels will welcome the return of Lily, from her bestseller &quot;Mitigating Circumstances&quot;.BRAVO to Ms. Rosenberg for giving legal thriller fans exactly what they crave...a gripping novel from start to finish.A MUST read!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Buried Evidence","review":"There is a lot of criticism of this book from other readers, but since it is a new author for me, I have to say I enjoyed it!! I would suggest to those who have not read this author -- give her a chance!! There are several ideas and plots going on in the book. This book did hold my interest and I found myself coming back to it each evening, tho at times I will admit to feeling a bit of confusion with some passages. If you are an expert regarding legal and investigation techniques and forensic science investigation, maybe you will find this book less than credible. I read it for the enjoyment and escapism!"},{"Title":"Buried Evidence","review":"Every now and then a crime writer comes along that completely blows you out of the water and you ask yourself 'where did he/she come from?' but this is not the case with Ms Rosenberg.This is a story about Lily Forrester, a defence lawyer, who after years of living with her deadbeat alcoholic husband, finally divorces him and leaves her college-bound daughter, Shana, with him. Years before, Shana &amp; Lily were raped and although the rapist was found and jailed, he is out again and on the war-path, stalking Shana (as he knows where she lives!)Lily is coming to terms with protecting her daughter and rekindling the romance that she has with another defence lawyer, Richard.Basically, Lily, Shana, Richard and John (her ex) are very annoying people. Ms Rosenberg has made everyone very 1 dimensional and there are too many questions. If Lily &amp; Shana were both raped by the same man &amp; there he is still stalking them, would you send your daughter off to stay at a friends house (that she barely knows ) so Lily could get some nooky with Richard? Sounds like a great parent! If the rapist is stalking Shana, wouldn't you move out of the same house????Sorry, Ms Rosenberg, I felt this is was just an attempt to cash in on a tired theme.Overall, this is a very average book that will keep you entertained for the time that you are reading it. Don't expect it to be brilliant like anything from Michael Connelly (excellent crime author) but it will give you something to do."},{"Title":"Buried Evidence","review":"\\"Buried Evidence\\" is an extraordinarily poor offering from Nancy Taylor Rosenberg, an author who is capable of better work. The novel is a sequel to her earlier and superior \\"Mitigating Circumstances\\". Unlikeable characters, an absurd plot, amatuerish writing and factual errors undermine what may have been a worthwhile followup.All the characters in this story are selfish, whiney, needy and -- shall we say -- intellectually challenged. None more so than Lily Forrester, \\"brilliant prosecutor\\", protaganist and heroine. Brilliant, but forgetful. She forgets her purse, loses her keys, can't find important papers. At one point -- I am not making this up -- she forgets her lover (another lawyer) is representing a man she's enthusiastically prosecuting for attempted murder. The other characters aren't any smarter.The plot almost defies description. Six years after the events of \\"Mitigating Circumstances\\", Ms Forrester's (now) ex-husband accidentally kills a student. He decides to trade knowledge of his ex-wife's involvement in a murder for leniency. Meanwhile the rapist from the earlier novel is out of prison and stalking Lily and her daughter. Coincidentally her former lover re-enters her life just before dumping his live-in girlfriend. There's also a vengeful cop, a saintly doctor and some dolphins. Or maybe it was vengeful dolphin doctors. You know, I forgot.Over and over again Ms Rosenberg lets cliches and hackneyed phrases tell her story. She repeats events, thoughts and facts. Unnecessary characters are introduced then disappear. Plot threads are strung out and abandoned. Objects mysteriously appear to fill plot holes. For example, after a lengthy passage about how Lily's dilemma over whether to bail her ex-husband out of jail or replace her daughter's car (impounded by the police), we find out Lily has a SECOND car. Maybe she just forgot.The descriptions of police procedures, legal and investigative techniques, forensic science and other matters are not credible. I assume these lapses were necessary to \\"flesh out\\" the remarkable plot. After all, Ms Rosenberg was an experienced investigator for a district attorney's office. She knows better. Unless she forgot.All these elements congeal to form \\"Buried Evidence\\"....My recommendation: Forget this book."},{"Title":"New Complete Book of Home Buying, The","review":"This is a must-read for anyone considering home ownership. I was able to learn many important things as well as pull together what I already knew. In fact I nearly read the whole book the night I received it. The book is also well written as the author is able to keep things flowing."},{"Title":"New Complete Book of Home Buying, The","review":"This book, while thorough in its generalities, is really not helpful to an internet-savvy, mid- to upper-market buyer. Most of the information provided is in the form of anecdotes which are interesting but give little practical advice for someone with more specific questions. All of the advice in the book I had seen online at any number of home-buying sites, so the book was pretty much useless. The other bad thing was the data provided as examples; I think the author kept the data he used from the 1980s edition for home prices! Coming from a larger market (Chicagoland), I found the sales price examples ($150,000 for a four-bedroom?) laughable and the \\"average\\" statistics (there's no way the average size of a house in the neighborhoods we're looking at is over 2,000 sq. ft.) really kind of ridiculous. Overall, this may be a good book for someone in a small market who knows little about home buying -- but probably not appropriate for someone who is buying in an area where the \\"average\\" home price is over $250K. Try Sid Davis's book, A Survival Guide for Buying a Home."},{"Title":"New Complete Book of Home Buying, The","review":"This is an absolutely essential book for anyone looking to purchase a home. Written with just the right touch of humor, the authors offer practical advice written in a manner that does not talk down to the reader.The authors discuss the fact that a home needs to be looked at as an investment, how and where to conduct your search for a house (including the Internet!), the difference between single family homes, condominiums, and town houses, and much, much more!There are imporant Internet resources included in this book, as well as check-list developed by the authors not only for comparing houses, but the life expectency for various parts of the house, as well as comparing loan options.This is a book to be used, not just read. A definite keeper!"},{"Title":"New Complete Book of Home Buying, The","review":"Yes, homebuying can be an overwhelming process. There is a lot that goes into the process that most people don't even consider. This author attempts to make that as painless as possible and gives you detailed information. I bought several other books as well because I wanted to be as knowleable as possible and not be suprised about what may be lurking around the corner. Even though it was not the right time for us to purchase a home I'm glad I had this book to guide me along."},{"Title":"New Complete Book of Home Buying, The","review":"I am very impressed with this book considering I am about to buy a house and was ignorant to the process before reading this book.."},{"Title":"New Complete Book of Home Buying, The","review":"Home-buying book receives critical acclaimBy Robert J. BrussInman News FeaturesConsumer Real Estate NewsIf you or a friend is thinking about buying a new or resale home, first read \\"The New Complete Book of Home Buying\\" by Michael Sumichrast and Ronald G. Shafer with Martin A. Sumichrast. This is, by far, the best \\"how to buy a home\\" book of 2004.The prior edition of this book was published in 1980. Since then, the residential real estate industry has completely changed, mostly for the better.Purchase Bob Bruss reports online.Mortgages are now easily available, even for home buyers with bad credit. Zero-cash down-payment mortgages are obtainable by home purchasers with good credit and good income. But the national median home price has tripled since 1980 to almost $200,000.Co-author Michael Sumichrast was a home builder who later became the chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. Mike is now retired. His son Martin, who was a schoolboy when the book's prior edition was written, is now a Charlotte, N.C., businessman who added research and a younger approach to the book, especially the chapter on Internet resources. Co-author Ronald G. Shafter was a Wall Street Journal reporter for 38 years who covered housing issues.Although this was a team effort, this is still mostly Michael Sumichrast's book.This easy-reading book is filled with practical advice for both first-time and move-up (or move-down) home buyers. Just in case you think buying a house or condo might not be a great investment, take a look at the page 3 chart showing the annual percent price gain for new and resale homes since 1968.The lowest nationwide annual gain was 2.1 percent in 1982; the highest was 14.4 percent in 1979. For 2004, the author-estimated average gain is 10.9 percent. No wonder investors are fleeing the stock market and investing in first, second and rental homes.\\"Today, a record 68 percent of Americans own their own homes, up from 64.1 percent 10 years ago and 42 percent in 1940. More than 80 percent of older Americans own their homes, but the biggest gain in the past decade has been among people under age 25,\\" the authors report.The special touches that add practicality and realism to each chapter are the \\"Mike's favorite story about...\\" features where Sumichrast tells of personal experiences about the topic.Also especially useful are the many charts and graphs, such as \\"how much house can you afford?\\" from Fannie Mae's Web site, which considers family income and mortgage interest rate variables.Throughout the book, the authors add humor to lighten the sometimes-routine home-buying considerations.For example, in the condo and townhouse chapter, the authors explain about the rise and rebirth of condos. \\"The condo concept isn't new. The first written documents for such housing date to before the Roman Empire. Legend has it that even Julius Caesar went out one day and bought a condo unit where, in the sales office, he ran into an old friend who was buying. And Caesar said to him, \\"Et tu, Brute?\\"But my favorite author humor is in the chapter about closing the sale where the authors caution: \\"Calling on lawyers to simplify a complicated legal transaction is like asking Britney Spears to develop a tasteful dress code.\\"Men will especially like the book's emphasis on the home construction aspects. The numerous charts list, for example, home components and quality comparison considerations. The many checklists make it easy to compare one home against another by listing the major home purchase features to consider.Although I thought the chapter on Internet resources for home buyers was superb, when I arrived at the later chapter on home-purchase negotiation strategies, I felt it was equally superior, but in a different way. Don't miss the \\"bidding strategies\\" chart, which explains when to use various negotiation methods.A book reviewer is supposed to find fault with every book. However, this one is a challenge to criticize because it thoroughly explains every important aspect of buying a house or condo.But the book does have an \\"eastern bias\\" because it emphasizes closing settlements where the home buyer and seller meet at an attorney's office to close the sale. Residents of states where banks, escrow and title firms are locations for sale closings will just have to ignore the quaint old eastern customs.Chapter topics include \\"Home Sweet Home: Still the Best Investment You Will Ever Make\\"; \\"Holy Home Prices, or What Can You Afford?\\" \\"Home-Buying Strategies, or 50 Ways to Leave Your Landlord or Your Old House\\"; \\"Shopping on the Internet\\"; \\"Existing Houses versus New Houses\\"; \\"Shopping for a Good Buy: from the Outside\\"; \\"Shopping for a Good Buy: the Inside Story\\"; \\"Negotiating the Best Deal\\"; and \\"How to Mortgage Your Future and Find Happiness.\\"There are several good home-buying books available. But this is the most up-to-date and best one for savvy home buyers who want to avoid costly mistakes. It's also fun and very profitable reading. On my scale of one to 10, it rates an off-the-chart 12.(...)"},{"Title":"God's plan with men","review":"This is a great book love reading it.
