David was given the chance to escape and he didn't let that opportunity get away. David escaped and set out on his long journey to Denmark, when he got there he just try's to learn what life is like outside the camp gates and how to survive in the life as we know it but not look suspicious.David is watching two boys play with there beautiful sister outside a barn. Then they inside the barn and David looks away and thinks about the beautiful girl that he just saw. As he is walking away he here the boys screaming that there sister is in there and David looks back and notices that the barn is on fire! David thinks about what he should do and then he finally puts a wet cloth around his mouth and nose to stop him from breathing in smoke and runs towards the barn. He runs past the crying boys and into the dry, fiery barn, when he gets in he sees that the girl is tied up by rope in a chair with fire surrounding her. Quickly he jumps through the fire surrounding her and cuts the rope with his pocket knife, releasing her from the chair. David picks the girl up and runs through the fire and out the door. When David gets out he notices that the girls father is there and he thanks him for saving his daughter, Maria's life and then he insists that David comes to there house to stay with them , he was excited, for he always wanted to know what a house was like so he said yes.I recommend this book to anybody, girl or boy, mother or father, or even grandmother or grandfather. I am David is a book about living and it showed me how lucky I am to have the things I have and know the things I know. I Am David made me think more about religion because David thinks he needs something to believe in so he worships God of the green pastures and the still waters. If you read this book you will be inspired by David and how he escapes and the changes he faces from his environment at the camp to the outside world. Overall, reading I Am David could make you think about how you do things and change the things you know, I Am David is a great book and I truly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"David is just a young boy, and yet he has never seen anything outside of the prison gray concentration walls he is trapped behind. He has lived his entire life there, with only one friend, and he never knew his parents. When he gets a chance to escape with the help of a prison guard, he takes a chance. In a daring move, he gets over the fence and heads off to an unknown land that he was told to go by the guard. With no map, little provisions, and little knowledge of the outside world, it is just David's memory of stories he used to hear that keeps him going on towards freedom. Traveling through Italy living off of what he can steal, David is faced with several problems. How does he find this country the guard told him about? How will he survive without being captured? David hitchhikes across the boot of the country up to the north. The people he meets can only focus on his eyes, and how painful they look. He makes some friends along the way, and eventually gets a job to buy bread, but he has to keep moving.

He deepened my understanding of men like Karl Barth, Wendell Berry, Thomas Merton, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Little did I know that Stringfellow would keep me sane through the banalities that accompany three years of law school. I recommend this book especially to those coming to the study of law from a Protestant Evangelical or Catholic perspective. Evangelicals, though perhaps put off by or distrustful of his admitted disgust with &quot;proof text&quot;-ing Scripture, will find Stringfellow's demand that they link their soteriological zeal with a radical commitment to social justice very challenging and, if accepted, nourishing. Catholics would do well to heed Stringfellow's call to become biblically literate, so as to enrich and sustain a social justice ethic that too often gets left out of community life. As a law student with an evangelical past and a Catholic future, I can only hope that Stringfellow becomes more widely read."},{"Title":"Nairne's Muskhogean Journals: The 1708 Expedition to the Mississippi River","review":"If you are researching the Upper or Lower Creek Indians or the Chickasaw Indians of the late 1600s to early 1700s, this is a book you simply have to have, so this new edition is heartily welcomed! Thomas Nairne was an Indian Agent devoted to the spread of English culture and goods throughout the southeast. He opposed the Spanish, who had the same goals, and successfully brought many southeastern Indian towns and confederations into South Carolina's field of influence. He was killed at the very beginning of the Yemassee War, in 1715, attempting to diffuse the powder keg of Indian anger at unscrupulous Carolinian traders (which was largely justified), and though it took a while, many of his viewpoints and plans for the Indian trade were eventually adopted by the United States. His map of the southeast, showing locations of Indian towns just after 1700, is, along with this book, one of the most important primary documents of the era.

No one outside of the field of ethnography will be able to comprehend the overpowering amount of ethnographic jargon that inundates Zulakika's work. His work is also delinquent in the fact that very few readers outside of the Basque culture could understand or find the thesis of the work. The reader feels as if he or she is stuck the eccentric mind of a bedlamite, who is rattling off the hagiology of the Basque culture from the Paleolithic era to modern day. The book is structured in what would appear at first glance to be studies of different areas of Basque culture and its relation to the violence that has been occurring in the area; however, the book fails to accomplish this task as well.

I've always thought being deceived would cause displeasure, but Feather of the Breath of God by Sigrid Nunez is a deception of pleasure. The book starts off with amazingly excruciating detail. This detail in the start tended to lose me at times, but Nunez kicks things up a notch towards the end of the read. This introduction of excruciating detail easily redeems itself by greatly enriching the already intense ending of the book. I truly understood the meaning of the first half, by completing the book. This deception of an excruciatingly detailed book, into an action packed story is great.In the majority first of the novel, the narrator divides up her childhood into three parts: memories of her father, mother, and herself. Her father did not have much affection toward the family, leaving the narrator with very little memories. The starvation of memories changes her life, leaving her with the ever remaining mystery of her father. It ends up damaging her life, and helps contribute to her corruption. On the other side, her over-zealous Russian mother dominates the family, leaving the narrator too many memories. This imbalanced and corrupted family ends up corrupting the narrator as well. The flood of memories immersed the reader into the narrator's life and explains her decisions in the second half. At first read this part is very drawn out, losing my interest constantly. Luckily the second half is a redemption of this detail.In the second half, the story is about the reader into her life as an adult, which is fully understood from her corrupt childhood. She dates a Russian immigrant with a family. They connect with each other well, but she ends up leaving him. This exotic behavior sprouts from her exotic childhood. She ends up ruining the family of the man causing fights between the man and his wife. The daughter of the immigrant swears to leave for college as soon as possible to escape her life. The man's family seems to be taking the same course as her family. This parallel of her family and the family she ruins enhances the reading by displaying the brilliance of Nunez.The novel reveals it's intelligence towards the end. This strategy to draw out the beginning worked really well to deceive me. I didn't appreciate this drawn out excruciating detail at first, but now after reading the whole thing I've taken the beginning in a new light and interest. Sigrid Nunez has done a good job with this deception and truly reveals her talent. Do not underestimate Nunez."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"Does the parents' relationship with each other affect the way their child views love? Sigrid Nunez answers this question with someone's life story and how the narrator's background shapes her decisions and personality. When I read books, I look for drama sprinkled into the novel; Sigrid Nunez does something different and puts it all at the end. The first few chapters are like memories of the dead, almost like an elegy for each parent. Sometimes different memories are put together randomly, but they are building blocks of the narrator's life. It is her life story put into memories.The first chapter is about her distant half Chinese, half Panamanian father. He recognizes himself as Chinese even though he lived in China for a short part of his life. Silent to his children, the father does not connect nor share his Chinese culture with his children. The narrator regrets not trying to learn more about her father by asking him about his past or his Chinese culture. Sometimes she did ask if the stereotypes about Chinese people are true, but the father coldly answers, \\"Chinese just like evvybody else\\" and nothing more. The relationship between the narrator and her father made me appreciate my relationship with my dad. After reading about the narrator's \\"missing\\" father made me want to keep in touch with my own.The Chinese father is contrasted with a controlling German mother. She takes care of the children while her husband works. She looks down at her husband and does everything around the house. Because she does not put any Chinese decorations around the house, her husband seems like the only \\"exotic\\" figure in the house. It seems that both of the parents regret having children together. The mother always repeats \\"I should have married Rudolf!\\" while the father does not show love for his children. The love between the parents hit me because I have the same thing at home. I can see my parents in the narrator's parents. Both from different cultures, they have different views on how to take care of the family. In a way my father is like the narrator's father because they both always work and don't really the decisions. Our mothers are both controlling and looking down at the fathers. The love they had before is now lost for one another, but still remains with their shared love for the children. The author does a spectacular job showing that the parents stay together just for the sake of the child.The missing love between the parents affects the narrator's view of love. She constantly tries to fill the void with something else, sometimes not the greatest choice. This book is worth the read to find out what the narrator does to have that love. A person would have to be patient to read the first couple of chapters, but at the end it is amazing. All of the points come together to shape the narrator and her actions. It made me wonder about my future and my decisions from my background. For some people with a similar experience, the novel might make them think about their own lives and how they could deal with situations. For other people, the novel can provide a story about cause and effects, and how one thing in the beginning can turn into something large at the end. The novel suggests that maybe it is nurture that plays a large part in rearing a child."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"We all love watching a slow train crash. A train that's coming over the bend of the tracks and no one can prevent the charging beast made of steel from colliding with whatever is in its path. In A Feather on the Breath of God, Sigrid Nunez begs the questions: Are we destined to make the same mistakes as our parents? Do we carry the sins of our fathers? Will we become that trash crash?As someone who doesn't read many ethnic novels or stories about immigrants, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to follow Nunez's linearity and how her plot appealed to me. The novel follows the life of an unnamed interracial female--daughter of a Chinese-Panamanian immigrant father and German mother--from her young teenage years through her adult life focusing on her whirlwind romance with a married Russian immigrant. With her parents meeting and marrying under unfavoring circumstances, the female protagonist is raised by a workaholic father and an emasculating and dominating mother. Seemingly part biographical of the author's real life, the main protagonist tackles personal demons stemming from the mistakes of her parents.The book is divided into four sections with the first one dedicated to her invisible and perpetually foreign father. Portrayed as unwilling and unable to assimilate, it's up to the reader to decide if Chang's actions make him an upstanding father or stubborn emasculated male. The second section is devoted to her mother, who is the leading voice in the household. Regardless of how rutheless Christa may seem, Nunez offers an explanation and the reader can't help but sympathize.That's one of the beauties of Nunez's novels is that all readers (hardcore or leisure readers alike) will wonder about the characters; readers will seek an explanation. You wonder how they could sustain a family of three daughters under intense poverty.Though some readers may have a little difficulty getting through the first half of the book, take solace that the last half is well worth your time. The anticipation Nunez builds culminates to whether the female lead has a chance to set her own path or is destined to follow the destructive path as her parents. The last chapter is filled with excitement, lust, and a sense of hope for the main character. You root for her as she meets a married Russian immigrant who falls head over heels for her at first sight.Many questions arise for each character in the book and Nunez simply offers up the history of each character. That's another beauty of Nunez's poignant novel: the reader is left alone to judge if one's past can serve as an excuse for one's action. There's truth to every character's development. With the mother Christa, you find that her dominating behavior is the product of her mother's cruel words and non-existent maternal skills. Nunez bears the soul of the silent, hard-working and never present father. Nunez leaves it up to the reader to take in all the evidence and piece together a final picture of each character."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"Heartbreak, heartbreak, and even more heartbreak. A ballerina twirls her way through the heartbreaks of her life: an absent father, a nostalgic, aggressive mother, and a sordid, unhealthy affair with a Russian immigrant. Sigrid Nunez's novel, A Feather on the Breath of God, tells the story of a young girl struggling with her multicultural background (having a Chinese-Panamanian father and a German mother) and the growing pains of a broken family and home. Throughout the book, she strives to battle cultural and language barriers to find a connection to both her parents and to have a relationship with her immigrant lover.Though the beginning of Nunez's novel may seem tedious, the end is worth the wait. The journey it takes to get through this novel is worth the end destination that left me full of sympathy for the narrator. It is important for the end to learn about the \\"unbearably few facts\\" about Chang, the long-winded story of Christa, and the \\"escape\\" ballet gave her. So, don't let the first three parts of the novel discourage you because the buildup of the first three parts is crucial for a meaningful end result. The last chapter ties the whole story together. The narrator explains how her affair with the Russian immigrant, Vadim, \\"holds some answers for me.\\" The ending brings everything full circle and you can find the answer to why it was necessary to undergo reading the first three sections of the book. There is finally insight into the development and formation of the narrator, which her father, her mother, and ballet play integral parts. So, if you do not get through the first three parts, the emotional depth of the book will not be as poignant or as resounding.It is easy to connect to the narrator because of the sympathy that you initially feel for someone that lives through her experience. I couldn't help but root for her and hope she makes the right choices to be happy. But, as the story progresses, I saw how much of her past trauma and her broken childhood seeps into her adult life and how much it really impacts her. As a reader, I felt even more sorrow for what the narrator goes through as an adult and how damaged she is as a person. Although the first three parts seemed a little dragged on, I did not abandon the narrator or her story. What I eventually realized is how much the beginning and the middle parts builds up to the end, creating a heartbreaking story that moved me."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"A feather on the Breath of God- Sigrid NunezA story that is more like a diary into the life of the last born of a Panamanian/Chinese father and German mother. Complications of cultural identity arise within the story for the narrator and her family. Although the narrator grew up with three ethnicities, none of the cultures was enforced in her family. Her father lost his Panamanian culture, and was not fully into his Chinese culture and her mother was full German but she wanted her daughters to learn English and become American.The story was broken up into three beginning chapters. Each chapter is geared toward a specific subject, father, mother, and ballet. Each playing their part in the book which is explaining her interactions with all three. The interactions are the relationships that are non-existent, normal, and love. Three chapters seem to be longwinded but each having a meaning for the book specifically the end of the bookThe first three chapters may seem useless and irrelevant and such a long read. The three chapters seem as if it's making no sense, not seeing where the story is getting to. But if you just wait until the ending where everything ties in together and everything within the story will make sense.

She constantly deals with how her genes, her parent's cultures, and her upbringing in America have come together to form a cultural identity. As the daughter of a Chinese-Panamanian father and a German mother, the speaker grows up with two distinct cultural influences. She finds herself pulled in different directions, unsure of what aspect of her should define her cultural identity more, or if it is possible to find a balance between them all. The speaker also reexamines her relationship with her parents and her obsession with ballet through nostalgic memories and insight. Through her writing, the speaker comes to terms with her parents' unhappy marriage as well as the notion that her love of ballet stemmed from a desire for perfection and escape from her dysfunctional family. The reader will find that Nunez spins a memorable story that thoroughly engages the reader, and is a must read for anyone interested in issues concerning immigration, multiculturalism, coming of age in a culture that rewards beauty and thinness, identity, and international relationships."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"There were many reasons I felt I had to read this book (my interest in writers even vaguely Latin American being one of them) and I am glad that I did.My favorite part was definitely &quot;Immigrant Love,&quot; the last section of the book, where the narrator has an affair with a Russian immigrant. &quot;He has no curiosity at all about me. After all, I am only a woman; facts about me can't be very important.&quot; One of the most honest portrayals of the complexities of human relationships that I have ever read. As a dancer, I found &quot;A Feather on the Breath of God,&quot; the third section, interesting and surprisingly foreign to my own experience, but none the less enriching to read. The novel's spare structure makes you feel the necessity of every word on the page."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"The protagonist writes from the perspective of a childhood bound by the separate histories of her parents: a Panamanian-Chinese father who is sixteen years older than her German mother when they meet on V-E Day in Germany, later moving to America with few financial resources. Two daughters later, they marry and the third daughter, the narrator, is born. After the workaholic father's premature death, the German-born Christa becomes the focus of the next part of the story. Christa is an enigma, a beautiful woman who spurns the interests of men and the friendships of women, proud of her English skills, albeit with the occasional slip of the tongue (\\"They stood in a motel for a week\\"). This cross-cultural family remains essentially unassimilated, moving from project to project in New York. Plagued by periods of rage and depression, Christa's home holds no warmth, the daughter stepping lightly through her mother's moods.Drawn to the ballet at twelve, the girl adores the combined smells of sweat, rosin and Jean Nate: \\"Everything about the world of ballet responds to the young girl looking to escape real life.\\" And for a time, this is heaven. The authoritarianism is familiar, but in ballet it has purpose, a means of transcending the small world of the projects. Ballet celebrates the female, is dominated by her ability to enact precise turns and intricate moves. Of course, the almost boyish figure of a ballerina activates a horror of pounds, eating disorders feeding on the paranoia of weight gain: \\"In dance, pain was often inseparable from desirable feelings.\\" Although the narrator doesn't claim an eating disorder, this flirtation with dance is but one more chapter in her life. Eventually, she is teaching an ESL class to immigrants and has an affair with a married Russian, Vadim. Her lover shoots up heroin, but that is preferable to the violence incurred when he is drinking vodka. This phase is short-lived, if unexplained, the protagonist headed toward the next chapter.There is no beginning, middle and ending to this fiction, merely a sequence of events. Nunez is what I call a patchwork writer, relying on anecdotes to move her tale along, but without a passionate commitment. Uses a cast of assorted immigrants to spin out stories, the author fills the years as the girl grows older, but she hides behind this ploy, her identity cleverly obscured by the characters. Nunez supplies the facts (and quotations), as well as the answers to endless rhetorical questions, but that bone deep honesty that allows me to love a writer's work is missing. How much more powerful would these immigrant tales be if Nunez allowed herself to truly inhabit these characters?

Sigrid Nunez's novel is uniquely mesmerizing and had a firm hold of me throughout the entire read.The beauty in this novel is crafted in the character development and is divided up neatly into four sections. The novel opens up with an unnamed female protagonist who begins by painting the story of her hauntingly sad father, Chang, a Chinese-Panamanian immigrant. The reader is immensely aware of the loss of connection that the protagonist experiences with her father and makes you question if his own unwillingness to assimilate is the direct cause of the type of relationship he has with his daughters. The next section is starkly juxtaposed with the story of her mother, Christa, a German immigrant. She is ruthlessly opinionated and is clearly the one ruling their home. Nunez sheds light on the parents' unpromising and ominous marriage and how that ends up playing an important role in the novel. The story fluidly flows incorporating the domineering, selfish and emasculating Christa and the passive, quiet and absent Chan. It illustrates how these two people help shape the teenage years of our unnamed protagonist and how this spills over into her own adult life when she impetuously marries a Russian immigrant. No matter where you are in the novel, Nunez has a way of playing with your emotions and making you sympathize with every character.The last two sections are filled with love, lust, hope and heartache, but in a very satisfying way. The suspense of whether the protagonist's past will anchor her demise or will she be triumphant is subtly inserted throughout the novel by Nunez. Using the historical background of each character Nunez masterfully creates these poignant characters that not only become alive in this novel but she allows the reader to get lost in the complexity of their character and forces us to question whether fate is a result of our family's own shortcomings.The novel takes starts off slow and takes a little bit of time to pick up steam, but I promise you the ride is well worth it. With this novel being part biographical, Nunez exposes a vulnerability expressing how the protagonist challenges and overcomes the sins of her family. I enjoyed being lost in the novel and was thoroughly satisfied by how everything came together in the end. A must read that you will have a difficult time putting down."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"Love, hate, adultery, identity struggle, controlling mother, and distant father: these are just few of the many things that make this book what it is. However, this is the single most important thing that can be taken from this novel: how an individual is raised as a child can have a great impact on the kind of person he or she becomes as an adult.An extensive novel about the diverse background of a girl with many different cultures, A Feather on the Breath of God explores the adolescence of an interracial girl and the struggle she goes through to be her own person. The novel is separated into descriptions of each of the girl's parents and herself. Her father is characterized as a reserved man with few words and actions, while her mother as a proud, German woman without a comforting bone in her body. The narrator is portrayed as a young girl with an identity crisis, not knowing whether to associate herself with her father's or mother's backgrounds and cultures. She falls in love with the art of ballet and focuses on this passion to distract herself from her unavoidable, dysfunctional family. The last section of the novel describes her as an adult, falling in love with a married Russian man and how she goes forth handling their flawed relationship.Structured as a conglomeration of anecdotes rather than a single, continuing plotline, A Feather On the Breath of God unfortunately did not move me as much as I hoped it would. I can relate to the narrator because she has a strong, opinionated mother like I had, but I could not deeply connect with the novel on a personal level. Although, I found it extremely beautiful that the narrator realized her passion for ballet and admired her devotion and dedication to the art. I would not pick up this book for entertainment purposes; however, I understand that it is a novel of deep, profound meaning and I respect its literary prestige. Purchase this book if that is what you are looking for."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"As a disgruntled, pretentious college student, I am particularly hard to please. A Feather on the Breath of God is no different. I have generally mixed feelings about the book. It is divided into four sections, each about a different facet of the main character's life, ranging from her childhood to her lovers. It begins with an introduction of her silent, diligent father Chang. She describes him as someone almost cultureless, \\"not like everybody else.\\" The entire house was cluttered with objects connected to Germany, her mother's homeland. The book progresses to the protagonist's experiences with her mother Christa, which I'll talk about later. After the protagonist leaves the household, the narrator tells of her passion within dance and her experiences with fate. The last section talks about her relationship with Vadim, from Russia with love.For their intended purpose, the chapters do quite well at bringing their point across. The narrator has a poor relationship with her Chinese father. Her mother is a crazy psychopath. The narrator loves to dance. That's all fine and dandy. What wasn't so compelling was the repetitiveness of the second chapter. I felt the nostalgia and love the mother expressed about Germany was one-dimensional. It did not need excessive description, nor did it require a disproportionate number of examples of said trait. The writing portrayed the mother in a very negative light by the way she dominates the household and seemingly doesn't contribute anything but her heartfelt anger about all things not German. The author does a good job writing a realistic portrayal of complex characters, where there is still a bit of ambiguity. Nonetheless, I felt like the second chapter did not work for me, mostly due to its repetitive nature.The last chapter was a surprising find. There are few novels which I am deeply immersed into a story enough to keep turning the page. This last chapter was one of those moments. It does a good job combining themes from the last three chapters into the protagonist's interaction with Vadim, who has said, \\"We don't have sex, we only have children.\\" He says this only to be sardonic, with unusual idiosyncrasies and beliefs, such as his translation of the golden rule: \\"Today I am unlucky. Tomorrow it is someone else's turn to be unlucky.\\" I believe the people around you say more about you than anything else, and I believe Vadim's unique personality and peculiar wisdom spoke volumes about her character. The character accounts were splendid, and that's what made the last chapter worthwhile. Still, the rest of the novel was pretty dull, so if you can stomach it, you'll find a great story in the final section of the book."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"Forgotten father, malicious mother, deranged daughter, and the ludicrous lover.Whether or not there was much written about each character in the novel, the importance was how impactful it was to our protagonist, the \\"deranged daughter.\\" She grows up in a housing project in New York, escaping her tattered, broken home physically and mentally by running towards her dreams of becoming a ballet dancer only to face failure. We run with her through those dreams, though, and face with her the realities of what we call \\"life.\\" But is she even living anymore? Our heroin reflects on her relationships with those who were supposedly the most impactful in her life, her Chinese-Panamanian father and German mother, connecting her upbringing with a Russian immigrant she had grown to love.Although Nunez could have easily expanded on the mysteries of our protagonist, she had chosen to refrain from getting into the specificities of feelings and reactions to traumatic incidents and situations encountered in her life. Furthermore, instead of storyline, we receive anecdotes which are more or less comprehended, because she is, after all, reflecting. These anecdotes are the pieces to a puzzle that gets put together at the end, a math equation of broken home + broken dreams = a woman who attempts to find something in someone even though she has no clue what she's searching for.All in all, I can't say it was the most heartfelt novel nor did I sit there at the end saying to myself, \\"most amazing book ever!\\" But strangely enough, it left me stunned in realization that I have had, over the past twenty-one years of my life, a similar relationship with my own father as the heroin had with hers: silent and subtle. Because of this novel, I ended up in a two hour conversation with my father for the first time since I was a little girl, talking about God knows what. Perhaps the book possessed some sort of magical power filled with lines like \\"my father not as one who would not speak but as one to whom no one would listen\\" that pushed me to save the relationship I still have before it was too late. Simply put, that small portion of the novel moved me enough to make movement.Perhaps the book as a whole isn't quite the attraction, but what Nunez lacks in character development and a strong storyline, she makes up in crafty language."},{"Title":"A Feather on the Breath of God: A Novel","review":"Sigrid Nunez's A Feather on the Breath of God tries too hard to be a memoir. Although every detail in the book, from the story to the feelings right down to the synopsis on the back cover makes the book seem like the personal confessions of the author, I was disheartened to find out it was not. The beginning chapters of the novel, which should be better described as a work of fiction, is quite plausible, with the narrator reflecting on her own past and the patchy relationship between her and her parents. I was expecting a continuation of true events from the first three chapters, but I had mixed feelings about the conclusion, where the events the narrator experienced suddenly took a surreal turn. Overall, it seemed as if the book suffered from an identity problem: although it was trying to recount an experience about identity (which is a major theme in Asian American literature) the story was in the most important places dramatized to an almost uncertain extent. Instead of enhancing the novel, it took away the believability of it, leaving a work with much more to be desired.The parts I felt were quite commendable were the first three chapters, divided between the narrator's experiences with her father, her mother, and later in life when she was training for the ballet. Conveniently, each chapter was titled with the name of the parent, except for the titular ballet chapter, which definitely adds a sense of muted artistic creativity to the book. These chapters, although slow, sets the foundation to understanding the narrator's actions in the rest of the book, especially the final chapter. Her relationship with her parents is accurately described, both in terms of evidence and tone. For example, the reader can deduce that her relationship with her father is cold and isolated from both what she described him as and how she described him. The narrator often revisits how he kept himself isolated, even from his children; \\"He had his own separate closet... he was small... he could be cruel.\\" The combination of the cold description and how she described her father gives the reader a chance to feel what she was feeling. This unique way of joining the tone and empirical observations also occurs when she describe other characters.Even though her style can definitely be lauded, it is her decision to make the rest of the story unreal that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the book. It might have been an effect of trying to market the book the book to attract more readers, but I would have much more preferred if her conflict was something more common and more plausible as her own experiences. The final chapter, which is the most entertaining and most provoking, follows the narrator's journey into the open world. She stays with a Russian couple, whose relationship mirrors her own parent's rocky relationship. She has this unconscious guilt of watching a sinking ship, knowing exactly how that relationship would end, but doesn't really try to fix it. Although the incompatibility of people is a common theme, it is the additional details which explains the Russian couple's apartness that make the final part quite implausible. I will spare mention of the graphic details, for the sake of the book, but I must mention that at least to me, it was quite shocking to read about those events and see how the narrator would not react in a way normal people, even normal strangers, would. Although the novel is quite artistically written, I would have to warn against this book as it did not fit my expectations."},{"Title":"Live on Stage!

It is not the \\"teacher's edition\\" of a student text.

A definite &quot;must read&quot; for anyone with a heart for Christian missions."},{"Title":"Living on the Devil's Doorstep: From Kabul to Amsterdam (International Adventures) (International Adventure Series)","review":"This book is part of YWAM's International Adventures series and deals with the McClungs' mission to Western travelers in Afghanistan and subsequently in inner city Amsterdam. Originally published in 1988, the volume offers current updates to Floyd McClung's biography (at p.[202]), but does not explain why he left Amsterdam for Colorado in 1992 to found All Nations Institute, or why he assumed the pastorate of Metro Christian Fellowship, neither of which would appear to be following C.T. Studds' desire \\"to run a rescue shop/ Within a yard of hell\\" (see p. 201). It is certainly McClung's right to follow wherever God has called him, but some explanation of this mission change in the new edition might have been useful.McClung's account of his Afghani experiences (at pp. 15-97) supplements the book he co-authored with Paul Conn, Just Off Chicken Street (1975) and provides a useful, if slightly external, view of the Hippy Trail which ran from Europe to India in the 1970's (see p. 22). Like so many earlier missionary accounts, the book is useful as an anthropological/sociological account as well as in a religious sense.The second half of Living on the Devil's Doorstep (at pp.99-201) deals with the McClung ministry in Amsterdam. This was initially established to reintegrate converted travelers into Western society and to prepare Christian volunteers for the outreach process (at p. 97), but it led to a series of outreaches, including work in the city's red light district. Again, a unique view of this area is offered, although, as noted above, the story of this particular ministry remains incomplete.Samuel Pyeatt Menefee"},{"Title":"Living on the Devil's Doorstep: From Kabul to Amsterdam (International Adventures) (International Adventure Series)","review":"I love reading a variety of Christian books.

This book is not only a good introduction to the beginners' mind it was a great introduction for two cultures.

Japan, in general, is not a boastful society - and understands that progress is made after a lot of concerted efforts and acknowledging that the beginnings are simply this - a beginning.I have had the great fortune to have spent 7 years in Japan and have witnessed this wonderful culture at work.

I think this mental adventure cascades itself onto the society and their collective consciousness in many ways - and if you have an interest in attempting to discover some of the underpinning thoughts of the Japanese, this book may be a great read.If you are going to Japan out of interest for their culture this book may be good. If you are keen to enhance your focus as someone in martial arts it may also be good. If you are keen to lean about Zen Philosophy than this is obviously a relevant read.

It happened to be at a time when I was about to start a run of a Rossini opera, which is a very particular musical style requiring the players to play on the front of the beat with extremely precise articulation and unity (musicians are called upon to be able to control their timing by as little as one millisecond), and hold their focus for the duration of nearly three hours. This can sometimes lead to a lot of physical tension, exhaustion, and mistakes, or result in a less enthusiastic performance from the group as the task seems insurmountable. Learning from this book the technique of setting up your shot and it &#34;happens&#34; at the right time, I was able to shift my focus forward to setting up each note and &#34;letting it happen&#34; at the right time on the front of the beat. For thousands and thousands of short notes that each had to be (in theory, at least) precisely placed over the numerous performances, I found the sum of all my training and 35 year performing career comes down to putting it all on THIS eighth note, setting it up to do its part in telling the story. When I dedicated myself to it, I found I could hear a lot more of what my colleagues were playing, and be much more reliable to them, and I felt relaxed and free from worry. Large-scale performances are a pretty cool exercise in group dynamics, and there is a delightful synergy in dozens of people coming together to tell a story. Different than, but remarkably like, practitioners of kyudo coming in from all different careers and walks in life, and reaching new heights of personal achievement through an ancient form of archery."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"It has been 50 years since I first read this classic as a college student, and It took decades before I was able to internalize many of it's lessons. The book describes the experiences of a Westerner, Eugen Herrigal, and his experiences while a professor in Japan attempting to learn something of Zen Buddism through the study of archery. Each reader takes what they learn in this book through their own past experiences and perceptions, so I've found that others with whom I've discussed this book have often argued about the authenticity or accuracy of the presentation of Zen Buddism given here. I have to take issue with that.I came to this book as a memoir, not an instruction manual. I respect the experiences of the author as his own, and I was intrigued with the way in which he interpreted his experience for the Western reader. This is not a \\"How To\\" or a philosophical treatise, it is a very linear description of the experiences of a Westerner who decides to master the art of archery, and proceeds as a true memoir in providing the author's experience. There is no right or wrong here folks; this is his experience, his truth, his \\"take away\\" from that experience. He does not attempt to \\"explain\\" Zen, he simply details his journey as a beginner in the study of archery, his initial frustration with, and final acceptance of, the methods of his Zen Master. I was able to travel along with him and his slow progress in learning some profound lessons, yet he never \\"went native\\" on me as so many authors on this subject do; he never lost his ability to think and write as a Westerner, understanding the cognitive blocks that the reader has, and respecting them as he tries to describe the slow evolution of his perspective on competition, mastery, and ego.And so finally, I can tell you the profound lesson that I learned, and it is my lesson so it is not subject to anyone's acceptance or rejection, it is only something that I have found to be so helpful in my prosaic Western life. I have learned that I must not only master the techniques of a craft, whether poetry, painting, or even archery, but I must go the next step and internalize them so that the proper (meaning most effective) techniques are effortless, and the element of ego is removed,i.e. I no longer 'watch myself' doing things (my ego judging my performance), I simply DO them, and do them in such a way that I respect the forms with which I work. So there you are, this may not be Zen, but it is what I learned and profited from in this book.The bottom line here is that I have followed the author on his journey and in doing so have learned things of value while being immensely entertained and enlightened as I followed his chagrin and frustration as he grappled with concepts that were familiar to neither he nor I. I could easily identify with his challenges as he was as logical, linear, and sequential as I, and as he adapted, I was able to adapt and even to expand and improve my understanding of myself. And become pretty good at both carpentry and cooking."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"The arrow finds the target before it is released.This is nothing like western analysis or linear thinking."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"I was left with the distinct feeling of having just completed a long journey after finishing this 80 page book. I have been practicing (traditional) western archery for over a year now and I completely agree with many of the tenets of archery that Master Kenzo Awa spoke of. I took up archery because I was interested in the idea of letting the arrow go versus the common mentality of shooting the arrow at the target and this book reiterates that kind of thinking.I have never undertaken Kyudo so I cannot speak to the accuracy of what was written, but I do know that many of things written by Herrigel, such as breathing exercises and being surprised when you release the arrow, can applied to western archery. I found the author's prattling and difficulties a bit irritating but it is understandable due to Kyudo's complexity. However, I was left skeptical with the author's understanding of \\"zen\\", and while he mentioned this idea of the \\"Great Doctrine\\" (of archery), I could not find his definition anywhere.At the end of this text there are a few pages dedicated to archery's relationship to swordsmanship which I understand but felt it was incongruous with the overall feeling of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"Professor Eugen Herrigel, a German-born professor of philosophy, taught at Tokyo University during the interwar period. During his stay in Japan he became fascinated by Zen Buddhism, then little known in the West, and undertook to study the art of archery with Bowmaster Awa Kenzo, who taught archery not as a technical skill but as a form of meditation practice.I have read that Kenzo was not a Zen teacher and that this book misrepresents Zen, but I respectfully disagree. Zen has permeated the Japanese fine arts for centuries, and Kenzo's lessons express Zen, regardless of his formal status in the Zen community. Others have criticized Herrigel for coming at Zen obliquely, through Kyudo (the art of archery); again, I respectfully disagree. Zen is not just a segregated \\"practice\\" of chants, incense and sitting meditation, it is living life itself, fully. Hence, cooking, cleaning, eating, archery, or even motorcycle maintenance can be Zen practice if done with mindfulness.Herrigel was writing long before any idea of \\"Zen\\" entered into the general Occidental mindset. Indeed, Herrigel's book title has inspired hundreds of copycat \\"Zen in the Art of . . .\\", \\"Zen and the Art of . . .\\", \\"The Zen of . . .\\", and \\"The Art of Zen in . . .\\" titles.While there were other Western (and transplanted Eastern) exponents of Zen in 1948 when Herrigel's book appeared, Herrigel's book became the first \\"Zen bestseller\\".Much of this short (90 page) book discusses the No-Mind necessary to successful mastery of any art. Since Herrigel is attempting to express what is essentially inexpressible, the book's language (in English translation) seems both esoteric and arcane in its utter simplicity.For all its brevity, this is a dense book, and an interested reader will return to it many times over many years."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"This is a very honest book about the experiences of the author.

My review is written with photography in mind, though the principles discussed in the book can be applied to many arts.If you have an interest in photography, should you read it?Here are a few quotes from this little book in which I have taken the liberty of replacing archery lingo with photography lingo:1. \\"...fundamentally the [photographer] aims at himself and may even succeed in hitting himself.\\"2. \\"Do you know why you cannot wait for the shot and why you get out of breath before it has come? The right shot at the right moment does not come because you do not let go of yourself. You do no wait for fulfilment, but brace yourself for failure.\\"3. \\"If [the photographer] is to fit himself self-effacingly into the creative process, the practice of the art must have the way smoothed for it. For if, in his self-immersion, he saw himself faced with a situation into which he could not leap instinctively, he would first have to bring it into consciousness.\\"If these ideas interest you, then this book is for you.

Herrigel, upon arriving in Japan, undertakes the study of Kyudo- Japanese Archery- under a master, who explains to him both the practical and spiritual principles of his archery style. The book takes one through Herrigel's practice, his insights, and finally his tests for mastership.A good book, if a bit thin (a bit over 100 pages) and Herrigel's romanticism and use of western terms might put off some readers, but overall a quality presentation of one westerner's experience with Kyudo."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"My martial arts instructor has many books that he allows his students to take out. Some of them he recommends, others he recommends quite strongly. ZEN IN THE ART OF ARCHERY, however, is the only book which he actually handed out to every member of the advanced class. Clearly there is something he wants us to know.The book revolves around Herrigel's attempt to understand Zen through the practice of kyudo (Japanese archery). Although I am no expert in either Zen or kyudo, I think he does a pretty good job. The concepts that Herrigel communicates to the reader are extremely esoteric and I found them easy to grasp through this slim volume. However, reading the book solely as a story about one person's search for Zen is to read the book far too narrowly.The concepts that Herrigel addresses are universal concepts. They are not strictly religious (Zen), martial (kyudo) or even Asian (Japanese). Any substantial activity, be it learning kyudo, becoming a chess grandmaster or practicing to become a classical pianist, requires one to reach beyond psychological and internal barriers. This is what should be taken from this book.During Herrigel's study, he focused not on the target, but on himself as the archer. The struggle was both an internal one, including physical aspects such as breathing properly and relaxing, as well as a refocusing of his mind, such as NOT focusing on the ultimate destination of the arrows he was shooting. The transcendence was within Herrigel himself.This lesson is applicable to numerous situations across cultures and across activities. ZEN IN THE ART OF ARCHERY provides a good example of this phenomenon but not the only possible example. Read more broadly, this book provides anyone undertaking a long and arduous activity a simple framework for reaching beyond those plateaus that we all frustratingly find ourselves on from time to time. I recommend it on that basis."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"The most prolific book one could read to illume the mysticism of zen.

I sympathize with the author complaining to the teacher, &quot;But it's taking so long!&quot; It took years for him to become a Zen master in archery. I think a good, if oblique, companion piece to this book is THE USER ILLUSION, that explains how the mind works in a conciousness-vs.-unconsciousness way. We have tens of thousand of bytes of information entering our brains every second, but our consciousness only registers up to only 30 bytes! That's a lot of information being absorbed by our subconscious! What the Zen discipline does is try to open up the mind to working with all those subconscious bytes. The week I write this (Aug. 23, 2000) the &quot;New Yorker&quot; has a good article by Malcolm Gladwell about when pro athletes choke. Basically their conscious minds take over too much.

I especially like the part where the Master determines to try to see the westerner's point of view in order to help his pupil learn, so he gets a book of German philosophers, but gives up in disgust, noting that it's no wonder the man who concerns himself with such things can't shoot an arrow straight!"},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"An excellent introduction to Eastern philosophy, if not for the fact that the book is a novella in its length and therefor easy to focus on. Many books attempt to express the art of Zen in everyday tasks, but do so through a perspective that roots itself in the West and not the East. Herrigel does not attempt to bring Zen to the reader. We are brought to it without our knowing, much like the arrow which finds its target.The author is able to transport the reader to a Japanese archery range through prose that places the bow in one's hand and mind. The descriptions are powerful, yet subtle. You see the target. You can feel the taught string yearning to be set free from your grasp and let fly the arrow to its home. Herrigel translates Zen philosophy into the actions of your hands, that are linked to your mind, that is linked to arrow, that is linked to the target, and back again. It is this innocuous connection to everything outside the body that Herrigel aptly writes in a way that almost indirectly explains what Westerners have attempted to define in innumerous ways, but never quite understood."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"...and went back to university archery class and immediately shot a perfect round the next day.

It was J.D. Salinger who brought me to it. And the central idea that he taught from it was the art of 'aiming without aiming'. Or rather how wrong and forced effort which is wholly concentrated on ' result' and 'result' alone (i.e. hitting the bullseye) leads to missing the mark.The great idea of this work is the idea of a kind of practice which leads to effortless effort, to a 'hitting the mark' without aiming , to somehow allowing one's own inner powers to be in harmony with the task one is doing. To let the whole of one's being flow into the activity and with it as one.With this in mind I years ago wrote a small forgotten work 'Zen and the Art of Swimming' . I also practically ' felt the reality of the main idea ' of this work in surprisingly a ' basketball game ' Here it was not one individual but a whole team of flowing and moving right, only to have this of course be broken by the other- sides time- out.There is a way of doing a thing in which we are so wholly within it that enjoyment naturally comes to us.This is the 'Zen ' I understand as central to this book."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"I grew up with my father very active in Zen archery, and have been practicing meditation myself for about one year now. (Readers familiar with the Zen arts understand that this is a pitiful drop in the bucket; in his account, Herrigel spends that long learning to hold the bow.) Zen Buddhism is, by definition, a problematic subject to describe in words or in print. Herrigel seemed cognizant of the irreconcilability of the language of philosophy with the reality of Zen, but he did his best nonetheless. It also suffers from its status as one of the first Western works in its field. Some of the language is dated and anachronistic: e.g., \\"The Great Doctrine\\". These small criticisms aside, I would overwhelmingly recommend this book anyone with the slightest interest, not only in religion or philosophy, but in athletics or the arts. However, those coming from a background in Western religion or philosophy, no matter how sophisticated, may not know what to do with this book. In fact, such knowledge may impede the reader (p. 48):\\"He [Herrigel's sensei]...tried to work through a Japanese introduction to philosophy in order to find out how he could help me from a side I already knew. But in the end he had laid the book down with a cross face, remarking that he could now understand that a person who interested himself in such things would naturally find the art of archery uncommonly difficult to learn.\\"\\"Zen and the Art of Archery\\" is not intended as a comprehensive overview of the Zen tradition. It is probably not the place to start for those that are completely unfamiliar with Zen, kyudo, Buddhism or Japanese culture. (I'm at a loss to recommend any one definitive work, but the works of D.T. Suzuki and Huston Smith come to mind.) What it is, is a fantastically written account of one man's historic experience as one of the first Westerners to study the Japanese art of archery. In proper Zen style, it is succinct; I read it in one hour-long sitting. It is packed with all manner of brilliant insights. My copy is virtually illegible from dog-earing, underlining, and note-taking. If you have some contextual knowledge of the aforementioned subjects, read this book immediately. If you don't, I might suggest that you hold off; it might strike you as so much \\"mystical mumbo-jumbo\\", as it did to my father (who subsequently dedicated his book--One Arrow, One Life--to Herrigel)."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"Though the personal path in kyudo of Mr. Herrigel is very interesting, this book does not teach as well as newer books do.

I wished I could travel to Japan and learn from a master.From where I sit now, I'd have to acknowledge that this book is more a description or a memoir, rather than an actual guide.

He is able to get a master of archery to teach him after searching for a mechanism to learn Zen principles. As a Westerner, he has a number of problems creating the right mental mindset that would allow him to understand Zen and release himself. But through years of perseverance and continued study, he finally learns the principles and experiences the Zen of becoming one with the bow and target.It's an interesting look at how Zen principles can be applied to any activity. If you've never been exposed to any Zen philosophy before, you will probably struggle with much of the seemingly nonsensical statements you'll encounter.

I suggest it to all my saxophone students. One of my all-time favorite books!"},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"To those who already practice Zen Buddhism, this book will seem awkward. To those nonpractitioners who would like to understand how to practice Zen Buddhism, this book will be a delightful enlightenment -- especially valuable to those who live outside of Asia. Eugen Herrigel takes on the almost impossible task of describing in writing something that has to be experienced to be understood, and is remarkably effective.The author spent six years in Japan just after World War II, and decided that he wanted to understand Zen Buddhism. He was correctly advised that Zen needed to be experienced as the path to achieving that understanding. Several possible areas were suggested, from sword fighting to flower arrangement to archery. Because he had experience with rifle target shooting, the author chose archery. He was fortunate to be taken on by a Zen master who normally refused to teach Westerners, because they are so difficult to teach.As a typical high-achieving Westerner, Mr. Herrigel wanted to make rapid progress and to achieve conscious competence in archery. His instructor wanted him to achieve unconscious competence based on experience and build from there into spiritual awareness. This conflict in perceptions created quite a tension for both of them. This tension was ironic, because the purpose of Zen practice is to achieve the ability to be strong like the flexible water. Tension is the enemy of that state of being.Mr. Herrigel also learned from attending flower arranging classes from his wife, who was studying Zen in this way. He also benefited from finding some wonderful commentaries on sword fighting as a path to Zen that are included in this book. These are more eloquent than Mr. Herrigel, and he chose wisely in saving them for the end.I suspect that this wonderful book will mean the most to people who have regularly practiced either meditation or Eastern-style breathing. Having followed both kinds of practices for the past six years, I found it was easier to relate to the Zen concepts in that way than through trying to imagine myself performing the archery described here.By the way, this archery is not at all like what you did in camp as a youngster. It is both much more stylized and difficult. Think of it as being more like a Japanese tea ceremony than like Western-style archery.You will love the many descriptions of how Zen masters helped their students learn through experience rather than lecturing or demonstrating to them endlessly. Mr. Herrigel makes a good point concerning how Japanese teaching in these ancient arts has remained the same, while newer subjects are taught much differently.Some of the most beautiful parts of the book are the explanations that employ natural metaphors. The concept of the Samurai is explained through the fragile cherry blossom, for example, in a way you will not soon forget. The metaphors used in the archery are also very compelling and vivid. They spoke very eloquently to me, especially about how the shot is &quot;released.&quot;I got a lot personally from this book in reconsidering how I could and should step back more often to &quot;go with the flow&quot; of the moment rather than trying to orchestrate everything very rationally. The book made me much more aware that I operate in both styles, probably too often in the totally preplanned rational one.I am also reminded of books about golf that I have read that cite similar principles for becoming more competent. I also remembered how all of my best golf shots have come when I was totally egoless. That lesson was very profound for me. I wonder what will happen in other areas if I follow that lesson, as well.If you have never tried meditation, I encourage you to experience this if you find this book interesting. That will probably be your best way to begin to explore what is described here. Naturally, if you can find someone to teach you one of the Japanese arts, that will further expand your soul.A good Western-style book to help you rethink your approach to life that parallels this one in many ways is The Art of Imperfection. The title is a misnomer. What we often think of as perfection is really the height of imperfection, as the author discovered when he began substituting his own methods for those of his Zen master.Aim straight for yourself!"},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"If one desires to pursue the path of enlightenment under Zen, one must select as a vehicle one of the Zen arts - archery, swordsmanship, brush-and-ink, the tea ceremony or flower arranging. Eugen (pronounced OI-gen) chronicles his struggle to overcome his &quot;much too willful will&quot; and master the bow. This interesting story is very moving, educational and inspiring, while never becoming heavy as it easily could have under less skillful authorship.The ultimate challenge Eugen faces ends up being the smooth release of the bowstring and arrow without conscious intent, &quot;like the ripe fruit falls from the tree&quot;, &quot;like a baby's hand releases one object to grasp another&quot;, &quot;like the bamboo leaf slowly bends under the weight of the snow, then releases the clump of snow without thought&quot;. Eugen, during a summer sabbatical, develops a &quot;technique&quot; that he believes will solve this problem and nearly gets himself thrown out of the program for &quot;offending the Spirit of Zen&quot;. There is also an interesting account of an after-hours meeting where his teacher gives an amazing demonstration of quiet mastery in order to raise Eugen's morale and level of understanding.There is much that this little book has to offer and its message will live in your heart for a long time."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"Before I begin, I would like to mention that I have been a student of Zen Buddhism for some years and have also been a kyudo practitioner for some time. Thus, I think I can speak a little from both sides.I shall first state that this book is truly an inspirational account of Mr.Herrigel's own personal, spiritual journey and should be recognized as a good read. It is also a good starting point for a Western beginner of Zen Buddhism as it gives him/her a glimpse from a Westerner's perspective.Having said that, Zen in the Art of Archery has some fundamental problems and errors that misrepresents both Zen Buddhism and kyudo.It might surprise some readers to learn that it has been severely criticized by modern teachers and practitioners of kyudo.To start with, as stated in the book, Herrigel has only one intention of learning kyudo-to become a Zen mystic. Thus his heart is not in kyudo at all. Just as one should do zazen for the sake of zazen one should also do kyudo for the sake of kyudo. Herrigel came to study kyudo with his cup half-full.Next, one must also know that Awa, Herrigel's teacher himself has never been a Zen practitioner and has never done a formal Zen training at all, which is all-important for someone who wishes to understand Zen. Awa, while a fantastic archer, has also been regarded as highly unorthodox in his teaching and views and one should thus not equate his teachings to be the norm of kyudo and Zen.Another glaring problem is that Mr. Herrigel himself does not understand Japanese and relies on an interpreter, Mr. Komachiya. Mr. Komachiya has himself wrote that he has taken liberty in explaining some of Awa's words to Herrigel.One of the most important part of the book, the Target in the Dark, highlights this problem. The careful reader will realize that in the entire episode, Herrigel is trying to understand Awa without an interpreter at all. One can easily speculate the misinterpretations that might have taken place. Another famous incident is where Awa supposedly says, \\"It Shoots\\". Scholars of both Japanese and German have speculated that what Awa meant was that \\"It just happened.\\" Meaning that he was lucky. For those looking for a more detailed criticism, one should read Yamada Shoji's excellent essay, The Myth of Zen in the Art of Archery.My contention in this review is not to debase Zen's relationship with Kyudo. Indeed Kyudo is heavily influenced by Zen and one can absorb traces of Zen in the practice of Kyudo. But one should also try to read this book with an open eye and should not treat this book as a reliable, definitive account of both Zen and Kyudo."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"This is an unpretentious,no-nonsense narrative about the author's initiation into the art of archery and, ultimately, into the concept of Zen Buddhism. It speaks in plain language and tries to avoid mystical jargon. Ironically, it is also a story of self-perfection - ironically because Zen Buddhism teaches the abandonment of the idea of a &quot;self&quot;.There are many ways one may go from this book: One of the main themes of Zen in the Art of Archery is &quot;art becoming artless&quot;, which is also at the core of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's bestselling study of creativity in &quot;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience&quot;.Someone who is interested in the spiritual qualities that (sometimes) come with the practice of martial arts might like to read &quot;Iron and Silk&quot; by Mark Salzman - don't expect anything holy or warrior-like, though.Zen-Buddhism is covered in countless books. One of my favorites is Alan Watts's &quot;The Spirit of Zen&quot;. A rather unorthodox, funny, skeptic and disrespectful look at Zen Buddhism can be gained from Janwillem van de Wetering's trilogy &quot;The Empty Mirror&quot; (my favorite of the three), &quot;A Glimpse of Nothingness&quot;, and &quot;Afterzen&quot;."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"&quot;Zen In the Art of Archery&quot; is, hands down, the absolute worst book one could possibly read if, by reading it, one hopes to get a clear understanding of what kyudo is.I am the translator of the article &quot;The Myth of Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; by professor Yamada Shoji, mentioned upthread by another reviewer. Professor Yamada is an experienced kyudo practitoner. I also have been practicing kyudo for 30 years, 11 of them in Japan under the tutelage of some of the most senior instructors in Japan.To put it bluntly, Herrigel got everything, and I mean everything, wrong. He himself only practiced kyudo for three years, if his translator Sozo Komachiya is to be believed (he started in 1926 and returned to Germany in 1929). He spoke no Japanese. He was himself a mystic (or he wanted to be one, anyway) intent on understanding Zen, not archery, and he had very definite pre-formed ideas about what he was looking for and what he believed Zen, and, by extension kyudo, to be. Given such a situation, the impending disaster was a forgone conclusion. Even with the best instruction he would not have understood kyudo.His book is very seductive, filled as it is with tantalizing mystical stories about a seeker on the road to &quot;enlightenment&quot;. So, it will appeal to romantics who have no experience in either Zen or kyudo, and it has been my experience that the book indeed appeals primarily to such people. It is instructive to note that those people who have experience in either discipline are quick to point out how thoroughly Herrigel bollixed it up.I began kyudo under the influence of his book, and it was only after many years that I fully realized exactly how pernicious that influence was. I strongly urge those people who are interested in kyudo to never read it or only to read it after they have been practicing kyudo for a long time under competent instruction. To read it with the intent of forming an informed opinion of kyudo is not only inadvisable, it is positively dangerous.Read &quot;Kyudo: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery&quot; by Onuma and DeProspero instead. It is as good an explanation of kyudo as Herrigel's book is a bad one."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"If one desires to pursue the path of enlightenment under Zen, one must select as a vehicle one of the Zen arts - archery, swordsmanship, brush-and-ink, the tea ceremony or flower arranging. Eugen (pronounced OI-gen) chronicles his struggle to overcome his &quot;much too willful will&quot; and master the bow. This interesting story is very moving, educational and inspiring, while never becoming heavy as it easily could have under less skillful authorship.The ultimate challenge Eugen faces ends up being the smooth release of the bowstring and arrow without conscious intent, &quot;like the ripe fruit falls from the tree&quot;, &quot;like a baby's hand releases one object to grasp another&quot;, &quot;like the bamboo leaf slowly bends under the weight of the snow, then releases the clump of snow without thought&quot;. Eugen, during a summer sabbatical, develops a &quot;technique&quot; that he believes will solve this problem and nearly gets himself thrown out of the program for &quot;offending the Spirit of Zen&quot;. There is also an interesting account of an after-hours meeting where his teacher gives an amazing demonstration of quiet mastery in order to raise Eugen's morale and level of understanding.I had read the book several times and decided to get the tape to listen to while driving. Ralph Blum's sonorous voice is perfect for the reading and I enjoyed listening to the book as much or more than reading it. There is much that this presentation has to offer and its message will live in your heart for a long time."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"For me this book is first and foremost about Zen. Students of Japanese archery can come to it to take their craft to another level but for me the archery is just a mantle for the teachings to sit on. I've been studying Zen for ten years or so, and have read many great works on the subject. This book was a gentle reminder, ushering me back onto the path. It's wisdom can be applied to almost anything. For a more in depth look at some of the discussions in this book, see Suzuki's Zen and Japanese Culture.One reviewer, with whom I disagree, says that this book is not a valid source of Zen because the master archer in the book had never \\"studied\\" Zen. I think he came in touch with the Zen Mind through his art. The Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng had never \\"studied\\" Zen either and came by his enlightenment through living life and carrying fire wood. \\"Studying\\" Zen, in terms of following the rituals of an institution, can be formative but is not necessary. Zenmind existed long before the Zen religion.So whether you're studying Japanese Archery or looking to deepen your awareness of your own art (I study painting, music and Tai Chi), this book can help if you're ready for it."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"Zen and the Art of Archery is certainly a valuable book, but, in my opinion, it has been given inordinate attention by many reviewers on this site. Although it is valuable to an unspecialised reader, it is not a valuable resource for learning about Zen in Japan.The best reviews I've read on Amazon about this book have been the extremely positive ones and the extremely negative ones. Each has a sort of understanding of the book that is valuable. The positive reviews of the book emphasize the importance that has had to specific readers. Herrigel's understanding of the \\"artless art\\" has been valuable for many artists in the West, and understandably so - the mysticism described in Zen in the Art of Archery doesn't exist in Western society in quite the way the Herrigel describes it. Zen in the Art of Archery is valuable because it reintroduces Western audiences to mystical understandings of the world which we have lost touch with as our society becomes more and more secular. As someone who played piano for 9 years, I can say from practical experience that an understanding of the piano as a purely mechanistic tool is, at a certain point, an impediment to excellent playing. As another reviewer has noted, a more nuanced, metaphorical understanding of the piano is crucial to playing well. Regardless of whether the piano is just a physical tool, a pianist should not have this attitude. Zen in the Art of Archery helps us take a more \\"mystical\\" stance towards aspects of culture that are often described mechanically.But the negative reviews also point out something valuable in our understanding of this book. Although the book has become extremely important in the West, it is a very poor introduction to Zen, except insofar as Zen is a tradition which involves some amount of mysticism (but how much is open to dispute). It is also a poor introduction to the Japanese understanding of archery as understood when the book was written. I highly recommend the article by Yamada Shoji, \\"The Myth of Zen in the Art of Archery,\\" available for free online, which lays these details out in great detail. The trouble is simply that the book does not describe Zen in Japan, and the connection made between archery and Zen is historically sketchy.Part of this trouble is with Herrigel, part of this trouble is with his archery teacher, and part of this trouble is with the translator that Herrigel employed (as Herrigel could not communicate with his teacher). To summarise their relationship, Herrigel was a German philosophy professor with very little knowledge of contemporary Japan, interested in learning about a mystical tradition. To phrase it slightly more strongly, Herrigel was searching for mysticism, and determined to find it. He had no background in Zen, and very little understanding of Japanese culture, and the fact that he stresses the connection between Zen and archery underscores this - at the time of the writing of the book, most Japanese people considered archery to be an activity for recreation or for exercise, and not spiritual practice. The mystical elements of his training were further emphasized by the translator employed to help him communicate with his teacher. Despite his best efforts, the translator was forced to translate certain terms ambiguously, and much of Herrigel's understanding of the \\"mystical\\" nature of his training derives from these misunderstandings.Finally, Herrigel's archery teacher, Awa Kenzo, was hardly typical among archers or archery instructors in Japan. Although his teachings might have value, they can hardly be considered to stand for the views of Japanese practitioners. It is also worth noting that Awa Kenzo had no formal Zen training, and his usage of religious language reflects the importance of Buddhism to Japanese culture rather than to archery.I am not sure if I can recommend this book. While it does give valuable advice to artists and valuable information to people interested in mysticism, it does so in a way that perpetuates stereotypes about \\"the mystical East\\" - stereotypes that are false and somewhat insulting. And, despite being titled Zen in the Art of Archery, it is written by someone with very little experience with Zen, who was taught archery by someone who also had no formal training in Zen."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"I'm shocked at the mean spirited, narrow minded attacks on this book from the few self righteous intellectual bigots who have posted reviews here.This inspiring account of Eugen Herrigel's encounter with Zen through the art of Zen archery is such a rare example of beauty and wisdom expressed in a truly humble, poetic manner. I've read lots of Zen literature and while there may be some inconsistencies with orthodox views on Zen philosophy and practice, beauty and truth are beauty and truth no matter what package they come wrapped in.If you insist on only accepting enlightenment when it conforms to your preconceptions or your intellectual prejudices then you've already circumvented the process before it's begun.The fact that this book has had such an immense impact on so many lives, including my own, for so many years speaks volumes about the profound truths that it encompasses in it's modest dimensions.Thank you professor Herrigel wherever you are in the ethers for this extraordinary gift."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"The task Professor Herrigel set himself was to experience true Zen, he did this without realising that abandonment of self was a primary objective. In other words the pratice or the decision to undertake anything very much is a step into the unknown even when the person involved never considers the possibility of his very self undergoing radical change, somehow one believes &quot;I&quot; will always remain afterwards. Little by little Herrigel underwent powerful changes in his Zen experience which literally must be undertaken in an authentic way ie by the sort of practice having no limits or bounds, a wholehearted approach somewhat alien to most westerners. The book is an honest and clear account of his experience in japan and is somehwat akin to that of Jan Whilhelm van de Wetering in &quot;The Empty Mirror&quot;, humourous experiences such as when the master wishes to find out more about what he does and in this way try to understand why the practice of archery is so difficult for him : exclaiming after he reads a philosophy book that &quot;no wonder you have so much difficulty&quot;, adds to the humanity of the story. Although a small book it is rich in personal experience and a treasure of a book which can be read again and again to revitalise one's own practice. It is also far more readable than his other books which are full of difficult philosophical concepts and lack the depth of humanity shown in this one. The book stresses what must be said again and again, Zen is about doing rather than knowing (in the conventional sense) and Herrigel realises that only in the practice of Zen rather than just reading about it can it be truly &quot;known&quot;. He also demonstrates the great challenges to be faced in this practice especially as regards the conflicts which arise between the &quot;artless art&quot;, Zen, which is free of thought and that of his profession which is never free of the constricting domain of thought. A superb book which never fails to inspire."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"Golf and Archery as practiced by the Zen masters are among the few sports in which the participant releases a shot without looking at the target.

Frequently assigned reading to students of the arts (pick one); I disagree with most of it.With Zen in the Art of Archery Eugen Herrigel has secured his place among the great allegorical philosopher/comedians. Chevy Chase is in good company. Artists, as much as art, must be understood in perspective. Unlike Eugen Herrigel, Chevy Chase and his genre did not spend most of their adult life teaching philosophy in Tokyo between the wars. Professor Herrigel (or &quot;Master&quot; Herrigel as I am sure he would prefer) was German, and it is through a mid-nineteenth-century western perspective that he attempts to open our minds to a greater understanding of Zen Buddhism. Like other allegorical philosopher/comedians he has chosen sport as a metaphor to hasten our understanding. Two generations later Chevy Chase would do the same with golf. Golf was not popular in Japan between the wars so Professor Herrigel was faced with the limited choices of floral arrangement or archery as his allegorical theme. As the title to the book suggests: he chose archery. (His wife chose floral arrangement, but gender distinctions were more predictable between the wars.)Archery has been around for at least 15,000 years. Mankind utilized it to hunt and fish with and to also kill other human beings with in the practice of that most exalted art form: warfare. But archery it is and Professor Herrigel utilizes the synthesis of archer-bow-arrow-target as an effective literary device by which to explain essential principles of Zen Buddhism and how one can, by seemingly indirect paths, come to be one with the universe. Zen in the Art of Archery was published in 1953 and unfortunately Professor Herrigel reached the highest state of consciousness conventionally accepted in western society in 1955 when he died at the age of 71. His death so soon after the publication of this work probably denied us its logical sequel based upon his experiences during the war years following his return to Germany after years abroad in Japan. It might have been called Zen in the Art of Rocketry. (&quot;As the ascending V-2 rocket approaches the zenith of its arching ballistic course over the gently lapping waves of the English Channel, the minds of the rocket scientists, warhead manufacturers and children at play in Coventry at once become one and the rocket is thus involuntarily compelled to its target as if a greater force were at play.&quot;)The author &quot;for the sake of comparison,&quot; concludes the book by &quot;cast[ing] a glance at another of these arts, whose martial significance even under present conditions cannot be denied: the art of swordsmanship.&quot; [p. 68] Cannot be denied? Tell every child who has seen Star Wars that it really is true that the way to total consciousness is to engage in mortal combat and simply &quot;let The Force be with you.&quot;My quarrel with Professor Herrigel is obviously with his choice of metaphor and not his message. To paraphrase one World War II fighter pilot, the medium could have been &quot;kinder and gentler.&quot; Such was the comparative message I took from the movie Caddie Shack. Was not Ty Webb's (Chevy Chase) masterful instruction to the young caddie precisely what Professor Herrigel teaches us: &quot;Be the ball.&quot;The Zen Master teaches us, or so we are informed, that before we even pick up a bow (and by extension this is equally true of a club, bat, pen, brush or clump of clay), we must learn to breath properly. Now this is interesting. Breath control is critical to many undertakings: all sports, both the act of procreation and childbirth itself, oration and song, meditative thought and scuba diving -- just to name a few. Breathing, if the brain is functioning properly, is an involuntary act. Breathing occurs in both the conscious and unconscious state. Stresses in the higher brain functions will almost always cause disturbances in breathing patterns. (Anxiety, fear, or worry for instance will cause suppression of normal breathing, changing its patterns and manifesting itself in the form of frequent sighs or hypertension.) Stresses in the lower brain functions will cause similar disturbances, often with more serious consequences. (Blunt trauma, toxic drugs and organic brain disease will often repress breathing altogether.) So breathing is important and it is important that before the painter paints, the writer writes, the foul shooter shoots, or the pilot lands, it is best to stop banging one's head against the wall, breath naturally (really naturally), and try to &quot;unabsorb&quot; oneself from everything except the task at hand. (Mastering breath control was invaluable to the Kamikaze pilots -- an outgrowth of the ancient Samurai -- of World War II. If the pilots became gripped with fear, they would often hyperventilate and either overshoot their target or crash into the sea before their predestined evaporation into their holy part of the &quot;Great Doctrine.&quot;)The Zen Master teaches us that we are surprised by the strength of the grip of the infant to whom we offer our extended finger (this is undoubtedly true in not only eastern culture and western culture but all cultures in between, beneath and above), and we are struck by the inexplicable effortless of the baby's release, which is only possible because the baby does not think, it simply does. So it is with many athletic endeavors and we are taught thusly: relax your grip and let the club, bat, racket or what-have-you, do the work. But this grip thing attaches too much importance in the archer-bow-arrow-target synthesis to the bow and arrow components. It is sort of hyperbolic buck passing to the instruments themselves. (Have you ever seen a frustrated tennis player throw a racket to the ground as if it was the rackets fault?) This &quot;be the ball&quot; stuff cannot be understood in serial parts; the whole literally is greater than the sum of the parts."},{"Title":"Zen in the art of archery (A Vintage book, V-663)","review":"This slender book tells the story of Herrigel's efforts to learn about Zen, through the practice of archery, when he lived in Japan. In essence, he learns that he must clear his mind of all external clutter until all that exists is the bow, the arrow and the target. But the process of learning this seemingly simple lesson is continually stymied by his stubborn adherence to Western ideas.This is a pleasant enough little book, but one problem with this and with the exaltation of Zen in general is that Westerners routinely do exactly what practitioners of Zen do, without making such an elaborate production out of it. There is a great scene in John McPhee's A Sense of Where You Are : A Profile of William Warren Bradley, when Bradley is just lighting it up in the NCAA tournament and he feels like he's hogging the ball, but he's so hot that his teammates just keep giving him the ball.

It is a powerful book that is as much about human psychlogy as it is about anything.it is a must read and must be experienced to be appreciated but that being said let me elaborate on some of the topics in the book.The bow is difficult to bend and so one must practce again and again to bend it. That is just one task of archery that is broken down in Zen archery training. Instead of the initiate begining by shooting an arrow at a target, every step of the task is broken down and each practiced until each is perfected.This I would call the \\"neurotic\\" side of Zen. For by one interpretation neurosis that is not unbriddled or pathologic is necessary in the careful preparation for tasks.Too many (especially of my generation) see Zen as an \\"anything goes\\" phiolosophy which is in my mind far from the truth.So after the repitition of each of the various indivual parts of the process of archery is repeated over and over. The archer is finally ready.

The confounding realisation that all effort is false, whereas no effort can lead to superhuman feats of accuracy.

For a Westerner, the tale is imazing. As a woman, I was dumb-founded by the sentence given to an entire family by the Moroccan Royalty for a crime that none of them committed. The book really opened my eyes about the differences between democratic societies and those ruled by royalty dictators. This is a book I always recommends to others to read."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I've read a number of novels this summer and I would have to say that this book was the best one. The story was so interesting, it was so hard for me to put it down. If you have the chance, please read this book. It's a book that touches the heart...and the soul."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is one of the most wrenching tales of human rights abuse I have ever read, and I have read many.The author's father, Gen. Muhammed Oufkir, was a high-ranking, wealthy, and widely-feared minister in the government of Morocco who had been convicted in France of masterminding a political murder in the &quot;Ben Barka affair&quot;. Years later, in the event that preciptated the story in this book, Oufkir attempted to kill King Hassan II of Morocco in a coup that failed. For this crime he was subsequently murdered. (One would say &quot;executed&quot; except that it was without benefit of trial.) Had matters ended there, it would have been a tragedy for Oufkir's family, who were totally innocent of involvement in their father's affairs, but the events would have largely been forgotten outside of Morocco.However, things did not end there. King Hassan II was apparently not satisfied with Oufkir's death, because he subsequently ordered Ofkir's entire innocent family -- wife, daughters, sons (including a 3-year old) -- to be rounded up and imprisoned (also without benefit of trial), along with a couple of supremely loyal family friends/staff who insisted on accompanying them to prison.At first the imprisonment was physically bearable; but over time they were transferred to more and more squalid conditions in ever more remote locations. They were eventually forced to spend almost 20 years as prisoners, more than 10 of them totally incommunicado, in solitary confinement, in complete darkness, in rat-and vermin- infested cells, on a starvation diet, with no medical care, and under conditions that can only be described as mental and physical torture.During all that time the prisoners, including the mother, the author (who entered prison as a teenager) and the others all the way down to her youngest brother (who entered at 3), aged, grew, and matured mentally and physically, even as their mental and physical health was slowly ruined to the point that they all became suicidal. Imagine what this must have been like for the youngest!The story of their escape from these hopeless conditions via a tunnel, and their return from the near-death status of the &quot;disappeareds&quot; to international cause-celebre, is nothing short of miraculous. The escape of Papillon from Devil's Island pales by comparison. This book is totally absorbing and impossible to put down. You must read it.It is a serious and important book, and there are too many good things to say about it in this short review. The writing is disciplined and controlled, in an angry but not vengeful voice.To me the most profound theme is the evil inherent in the concentration of arbitary power in the hands of a despotic man who could commit such an atrocity. There is no legal or moral code left on Earth that visits punishment for the crimes of the father on the innocent wife, children, and friends as well, let alone punishment that is this terrible and extended.Did I mention that the author had actually been the adopted daughter of the very same King Hassan II responsible for all of this?All Moroccan's should be ashamed of their King Hassan II after this book. Let us hope it will help lead to a revolution in the governance of that beautiful country."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. I couldn't skip a word. Malika Oufkir is such a remarkable human being and her story is an inspiration to us all. It's one book that I plan on reading again it was so good."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"like a cinderella tale told darkly in reverse, this riches-to-rags saga of this moroccan family thrown into prison exile for the crime of being related to the man who failed in his effort to overthrow the king works on many visceral levels; the book's charm and haunting beauty resides with the narrator; her aching soul, her powerful sense of observation, her near total recall, her steadfast attachment to survival through two decades of cruel punishment, lends this &quot;as told to&quot; biography a melodrama and tragedy without comparison. one tends to think what her life would have been otherwise had she not been imprisoned. one anti-caveat: don't let oprah's endorsement make you dismiss this book. malika oufkir's story will sear your heart, stamp your brain with her pain and enduring strength of character."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a difficult book to write a review for, because even though I sympathize with the Oufkir family and cannot imagine what it must have been like for them, I came away from the story really disliking Malika, the author.I have no doubt that she and her family suffered the atrocities she describes in the book, but I quickly became irritated with her, because she insists on portraying herself as the person who kept everyone together and sane, and every idea or plan they had (whether for escape or just for simple survival) came from her. It's almost as if, without her, the others surely would not have been able to deal. I became bored with the one-sidedness of the story, and I fully agree with other reviewers who said they would have liked to have had the others who were imprisoned with Malika tell their side of the story as well.We don't get enough background on the father, General Oufkir, either. He worked for the king as one of his generals, then turned his back on him and plotted to kill him, so it's obvious he lived a rather...colorful life. I would have liked some info on the shady stuff he did for the king. Even though Malika was young at the time, I'm sure she probably could have dug up some of this information before writing the book. Maybe Malika didn't want to go into her father's wrongdoings, for fear that this would have made her less sympathetic, but I think it would have made her more sympathetic had she been a bit more straightforward about who her father really was and what his job entailed. Nothing in her book expresses regret over the fact that she lived a privileged lifestyle because her father worked for the king doing his dirty work. None of that is her fault, of course, and I still believe it was an incredible injustice to punish these innocent children for what their father did. I would just have liked a bit more honesty about it all.All of this, however, does not take away from the fact that this is an amazing story about human resilience and the will to survive. These people were unfairly imprisoned and left to rot, yet they managed to come out of it alive. It is definitely a story that needs to be told, and a glaring example of how absolute power is never a good thing."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's thrilling, sad, actually very sad, unfair but teaches us about how not to give up even though the circunstances are terrible.Malika was the daughter of the Prime Minister of Marroco and then the King who was a good friend of her father adopted her to be with the King's daughter Lalla Mina.So when Malika was 18 she went back home with her family and two years after her father was accused of trying to kill the King, so Malika's father was executed and she and her family were sended some time after to a prision and and then to another and they had to suffer lots of things like hunger, humiliation and a kind of life that wasn't human.I strongly recommed this book I've only described a short part of it but i'm sure you'll love it. And once you start reading it you won't stop until you finish it, actually I read it in 2 days because it was so good."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is the first truly amazing book that I have read in a long time. After reading it, I wanted to change the way that I lived &amp; acted. The strength &amp; will to survive that this family had is like nothing I have ever seen in my life. I could not put the book down. It had so many different aspects to it: it was funny, serious, heart-breaking, political, and a happy ending. I've been to Morocco &amp; after reading this book, I look at it in a whole new light. I still cannot even begin to imagine experiencing the things that her family went through. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. After reading, it will change your life &amp; not many books can claim that."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"One reader has given this book one star; that is much too extreme. Poor writing is also a comment; I would say it is good, but certainly not great. I believe emotion got in the way of some of the mechanics of writing yet this is a fine story that does get confusing at times. The royal treatment in the beginning juxtaposed with the status of a criminal the rest of the way through the story gives a riches to rags flavor. There is tragedy and raw survival and during the escape section, real excitement that everyone should find well worth reading.One also better understands the social and family relationships of the middle eastern society as related in Stolen Lives which is very different from the West."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I thought this was an incredible story and I enjoyed it thoroughly. And it gives me one more reason to be thankful that I live in the United States. However, not being a critic for writing skills, I did think this book was poorly written. Sometimes I would read a sentence and think, &quot;huh?&quot; And it didn't necessarily flow all that well either. At one point she was talking about something that happened when she was 18 and then shortly thereafter, she was 16 years old. But again, it was an interesting story."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"There is nothing \\"gripping\\" about this book. The beginning of the book, the tale of life with the King, is interesting. Once the family is arrested and incarcerated, it becomes boring beyond belief - and this is the part of the book that should be riveting! Instead, I found the narration totally self-centered and the \\"story\\" absolutely colorless. I quit reading about page 138 (just after the escape) because at that point I could have cared less what happened to this family. The travesty is that these events were real and I should feel outrage and compassion for this family. Instead, I'm annoyed I spent money on this horribly written/edited/translated book!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Stolen Lives had me from page 1 until the very end, I literally couldn't set it aside! Not usually one for an Oprah book selection, I took a chance since this is a true story. I've found that by reading Malika's story and realizing that she and her family made it through, I can do anything I set my mind to. All through the book there are great parallels to practically anyone's life and struggles. Malika Oufkir's writing style is easy to read and captivating since it tends to remind you of sitting down with an old friend over coffee as they confide long hidden secrets. After only a few paragraphs, you'll find yourself deep inside beautiful Morocco experiencing palace life, lonliness, the joy of freedom and youth, disaster, imprisonment, and the triumph of familial love and the human spirit. This book is a must-have for you home library!!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"It takes more than surviving a harrowing experience to inspire a good book. The situation this family endured deserves better treatment than it gets here. Malika Oufkir's view of the social and political scene, which could have offered brilliant insight into a world hidden from our view, was that of a naive and uneducated teenager: uninformed and self-centered. Perhaps this is the result of being imprisoned in a desert for 20 years. Besides its disappointingly limited scope, an inept author was chosen to collaborate on this project. The writing of this first-person narrative was trite. Instead of being captivated by this family's plight, I found myself playing a distracting game of count-the-cliches, with at least one on every page. Good books combine a fascinating story and brilliant command of the written word. Neither element is evident here."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book reveals the amazing capability of the human will to live. There were several points in the book when characters either attempted suicide or assisted in the suicide of a sibling. The most touching episode is when the youngest sibling attempts suicide at the fragile age 7 with hopes that the King will release the rest of the Oufkir family after learning of the little one's death. Despite these hard times they make the best of their 15 years without daylight by presenting humorous plays, narrating stories and goofing around in their dreary cells. Their hardships make us question the luxuries we tend to seek and the many facades we posess. The book forces us to realize that life and what we have today cannot be taken for granted - regardless of name and fame."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir's book tells the story of high privilege and bitter starvation.She was adopted by the Moroccan king and educated as a court princess with all the luxury she could dream off.She gives us interesting and valuable information about life at the Moroccan court and in the king's harem.Unfortunately, her father, the second mightiest man in the country, staged a coup to kill the king, most probably to install a military dictatorship and not to put the king's son on the throne, as the author pretends in this book.When the coup failed, her father was summarily executed and his direct family sent to prison, first in a guarded house and then in isolated cells on a diet of rotten eggs.Malika Oufkir tells us pregnantly how she and her family could survive in this rather complete isolation: by staying in contact with each other and the outer world (through a hidden radio and more or less human guards), by doing sensible things (educating the younger children, telling stories), but most of all by dreaming of an escape.The last part of the book reads like a thriller.This book is a very impressive tale about human survival."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I found this book very interesting and gripping. I admire Ms Oufkir's strength, sense of humour and spirit. It is a good book to read regarding human dignity. However, there are a lot of things which are very contradictary and rather unbelievable. I suspect the author is hiding something and may not be telling us the whole truth. The book could be better written. Ms Fitoussi is not doing justice to Oufkir's experience."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir's account of the twenty years of her life spent in jail was captivating and apalling. This memoir was excellently written, as it had the power to inspire and intrigue me. The tradgedy that she revisited through her writing was horrible beyond any description, yet she wonderfully and powerfully described it. She shows impressive writing skills, and through them her incredible character and the unbelievable horrors that mankind is capable of. &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; has inspired me to become involved with the international protection of human rights, and also has made me realize how many superficial concerns and luxuries we needlessly, and unfortunately, feel we need to dedicate oursleves to."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I wasn't even aware that human rights violations existed in Morocco until I read this book. Malika Oufkir was separated from her family and raised in the palace of the king of Morocco at age 5. Malika was separated from her family, because she was seen as an ideal playmate for the king's daughter who was about the same age. She lived a pampered life with servants. However, Malika dreamed of freedom and suffered from profound loneliness. She got so lonely to the point where she tried to committ suicide as a child. She was imprisoned at age 18 with her entire family after her father General Oufkir attempted to kill the king Hassen II in an effort to depose him.Deprivation was a fact of life. They lacked everything from adequate food, books, health care, and even human contact. One sibling suffered from anorexia. Another sibling suffered from epileptic fits. It was Malika who took care of everyone who got sick. The youngest of 7 siblings was deprived of everything being only 3 years old when imprisoned. The family even experienced solitary confinement for long periods of time.I was amazed at how well Malika and her oldest brother Raouf educated their younger siblings early in their incarceration material was taken away She taught her young siblings how to read and write in French, Arabic and English. Brother Raouf helped with math and geography. They entertained themselves by making up stories and putting on shows for one another. They made toys for the little ones of wood and cardboard. They used Tide detergent to wash themselves with.The Oufkir family escaped from jail and such poor conditions in 1987 after 15 years. They were to be imprisoned again in a nice house but still surrounded by guards for more 5 years. I learned from reading this book that true freedom does not always mean a change in surroundings. True freedom happens when people are free to choose how they want to live their lives. This is an excellent read."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I found this book a compelling read from the story of her life as a member of the royal family living in the luxury of the palace and harem, to the horrible imprisonment. It's hard to imagine so many years of a terrible existence, and that they weren't reduced to madness. I was amazed that they found something to laugh about, and to use stories and games to keep themselves going. This is truly an example of the resiliency of the human spirit and a loving family. Get out the tissues, because you can't help but cry for this family."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is one of those books that everyone should read. It teaches a valuable life lesson about resilience and the strength of the human soul, and it also teaches us to be thankful for the everyday things that we take so much for granted.The bad reviews of this book were most, as far as I can observe, based on people's expectation that this would read as a novel, with a straight time line, neat plot twists, happy ending, etc. Keep in mind that this is all coming from the authors memories of these events, and of course at times they are not in order, which is to be expected in a work of this type. The fact that she was able to complete this work at all is amazing."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book has changed me in a profound way. I can no longer enjoy the ridiculous excesses and luxuries to which we Americans have become accustomed without thinking of the sufferings of the Oufkirs. After reading it, I am both uncomfortably aware of and eternally grateful for the simplest of freedoms and blessings that we enjoy in the United States. Malika Oufkir tells her horrifying story with honesty and courage. You will feel every emotion imaginable as you read this book. It is a must read."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"First of all, I do not want my negative review of the book and my following statements to be misconstrued as support for the inhumane conditions that Ms. Oufkir and her family were exposed to. However, not everything in the book is so accurate. My personal problem with it is when she talks about her family's conversion to Christianity because they felt that the \\"Muslim\\" God had abandoned them. This can confuse people at best because Muslims have the SAME God as the Christians and Jews. Sorry, Malika, God didn't abandon you, people did. Secondly, it is worth mentioning that while obviously General Oufkir was her father and she quite normally has affection for him, he wasn't the best of people. He tried to assassinate the King of Morocco! If he had succeeded in dethroning the King, Morocco would have probably become a military dictatorship, much to the detriment of its people and economy. Yes, it's sad that General Oufkir's wife and children had to pay the price for his actions, but keep in mind that the King's own children would have been killed if his coup attempt had succeeded! So it isn't as though he was a saint and King Hassan was a monster.My third point is, to all of those who commented on how Amnesty International should investigate into human rights violations in Morocco and elsewhere, there's no need. Look right here in the U.S. People are rotting away in jail here, too. So fix your own problems before you try to fix anyone else's."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book had a lot of hype but falls short of drawing me into the main characters. It reminds me of the old TV series, &quot;Dragnet.&quot; Just the facts Maam, just the facts. Malika is moved here, there, suffers this and suffers that..then moves again...Their imprisonment is horrendous but the author goes from fact to fact and doesn't let me into the soul of Malika. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"The first thing to look for when you want to read a book is the credibility of the author. And unfortunatly in this case the author has no credibility. Malika Oufkir had without a doubt been traumatised by her experience to a great extent. She portrays herself as a victim and tries to get the sympathy of the reader. I was born and raised in Morocco and familiar with the story of this family. The author omits to mention in her book who her father really was. General Oufkir tried to overthrow the head of the moroccan government but his attempt failed. ...."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"The only pertinent question being :Who cares ?If the adopted &quot;Royal&quot; family needs to make a few bucks these days, ever heard of a job ?"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I strongly disliked this book because of one main reason...there was alot of false information. She makes her father look like a hero when really he was a villain...not neccesarily for attempting to assasinate the King who might I add provided anything his children and wife could possibly want but because of this: The reason I know this is because I am from Morocco and yes my family lived through this event. What happened was that Malika's father General Oufkir was not a very good man, had killed several people in the name of the king and had enjoyed it. There was a scientist that worked for the king that proposed to pay the citizens a certain amount of money...the king didn't like this so the scientist went to france and began a plot to kill the king, he wanted a sort of communist government. So anyway, general oufkir goes over to france and brings the scientist back to the king. The obvious solution was to kill the scientist (to the pleasure and doing of oufkir) by dipping him in hot acid (talk about humane) A few years later Oufkir plotted to assasinate the king and he too was executed. Thus his family was thrown in jail. No i dont think it is great that they were but hey worse things have happpened so get over it and move on...fyi a platypus could write better then malika oufkir. So now you know...General Oufkir was a villain not a hero, The king may have been a tyrant but he got his way and he is dead now anyway... and Malika needs to get over her \\"ordeal\\"."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is the most incredible book that I have read, for as long as I can remember. Malika Oufkir, her siblings and her mother, spent twenty years in prison for a crime her father committed. It is amazing that this happened within our time. This is the ultimate story of survival. Although it seems that it would be depressing, it is written with such clarity that I actually felt uplifted."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I don't have much time for reading, so I choose the books I read carefully. This was well worth my time. I couldn't put the book down. While Ms. Oufkir recounts her family's life of 20 years in prison for the sins of their father, if the reader has any awareness of self, of human compassion, you will be moved beyond any words I can write here. This book will make you think about your own life, what's important and what isn't, and put in perspective all the senseless minutia we spend our time obsessing about. Without your freedom, little else matters. To have not seen daylight for years, to live with meager rations of food (and I use that term loosely), to spend childhood without the things we have come to accept, and more accurately expect, (toys, holiday celebrations, Sesame Street, a bicycle), weighs on one's spirit. But somehow this family drew strength from each other, never gave up hope, and miraculously made it out. Sadly, there are others currently in the same predicatment as the Oufkir family, only we haven't heard there stories. Let this book serve as a jolting reminder of the human injustice that exists not 1,000 years ago, not 100 years ago, but TODAY all over the world."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Yes, it could have been written, and yes, she lived a life of privledge in her formative years, but the fact remains this was NOT of her choosing. To live through this incredible ordeal and survive it is awe inspiring. It is so hard to imagine these things happening in our lifetime; but they do. The fact that Malika Oufkir had the courage and insight to write about what she and her family endured pays homage to the human spirit. I think about this family all the time and wish them peace. The book moves slowly in the beginning, but is a real page-turner after the story gets started. I highly recommend this book to those who love stories of the strength of the human spirit. God bless the family!!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"What an amazing story, even more so amazing is that it took place in my lifetime. I laughed and cried while reading the book. Truly one of the best this year."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is one of the most compelling books I have ever read and I am a voracious reader. You live the story right along with the family and it really captures your emotions. It was with GREAT sadness that I finished this book. It was written with such style that I felt like I was a part of the story. I recommend this book highly to all!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I won't go into too much detail but must agree with those who thought that the story had potential but the book was poorly written and edited. But I can't honestly blame the writer. Millions of poorly written books are submitted to publishing houses each year. It was up to the editor and publisher to really go to town on this book. It's possible they improved it from really bad to ok to print, but like other reviewers, i could hardly get through this for my book club. I felt like i was reading the diary of a middle school aged girl! Furthermore, Oufkir is clearly repressed or supressing her own feelings. Her explorations of her feelings were surface at best. I didn't feel any depth of emotion on her part, whatsoever. She also comes off sounding smug and superior, when I imagine she may not be that way in real life.Had this not been for my book club, and had i not had integrity to finish it so i could fully trash it at book club, i would not have gotten past page 35."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"The author began her life as a child of privilege in Morocco; she lived as an adopted daughter of the king having nearly everything she wanted - except her family. Although she knew the royal family loved her, they were not demonstrative and she didn't receive affection from her family because she so rarely saw them. She compares the isolation of palace life to her future confinement in exile.True, the story doesn't elaborate on the political situation which resulted in her family's years in prison, but the story is told from her perspective, what she knew, when she knew it. Occasionally she includes facts which she learned later.Sometimes she seems impassionate with respect to the horrendous conditions which her family experienced during their nearly 20 years of exile. I feel this is in part a product of the emotional disappointments she experienced in her early years at the palace. Also, depersonalizing the situation became a survival strategy for the family. This detachment is reflected in the tone of her writings.This is a very human story about an inhumane situation. I found it amazing that all of the family members and their two friends were able to survive such deplorable conditions."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I was a bit confused in parts of the book and sometimes bored. I felt like I really never knew the people in the book, especially Malika, but it was still a very interesting book, just not told very well. The book had such potential. It was a lot or boring descriptions of her encourters with the King and her relatives, but I really did not \\"feel\\" her anger, her pain, her happiness. A lot of the time, I was confused! I felt like reading it was chore, but I am glad I read it. I feel a new sense of family and determination in difficult situations (no where near as difficult as Malika's though). I would give the book a five, if it was not soooo poorly written."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a very well-written account of a fascinating life. The story really stuck in my head. To live through such torture and still be able to have a positive outlook is remarkable. Somehow they managed to write this in such a way that it does not have any overtone of self-pity. I've recommended this to several friends who have also enjoyed it very much. It helped me renew my sense of how blessed I am to live in this country."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"My friend loaned me this book, and I devoured Malika Oufkir's story in 2 nights of reading. I couldn't stop turning the pages of her life. I felt as if I were reading a friend's personal diary of happiness, laughter and luxurious times that turned to gut-wrenching, horrific and eventually awe-inspiring events.Not only did I learn of a family's personal 20-year tragedy and their search for freedom, but I also vastly improved my knowledge of Moroccan and French customs/lifestyles during the 60s-80s. I came away from this book with an enormous appreciation for the seemingly little things in life that in reality are luxuries in disguise. Buy this book. I promise you will not be disappointed by what you receive in return."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I picked up this book in the original French while in Nice last year and found the story so intriguing that I finished it in only three or four days--amazing given that French is not my preferred language to read in!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a story that is told in the first person by the most inane, self-centered spoiled woman who has ever considered the undertaking. It is like listening to the story of a 12 year old brat who inserts themselves as the most important player in every moment of every life around her. The first half of the book could have been wonderful with insight into culture and life inside the palace, but instead it is one egotistical inane tale after another that serves almost no purpose except to relay to us how wonderful she is by how much attention and spoiling she receives due to her beauty, wit and charm. Life in the palace is an afterthought, the culture is an afterthought. You have to figure out what you can from the limited background in her constant me me me, and everyone thought I was wonderful when I, and wasn't I cute and cheeky when I.... It almost drove me mad.Not only is the story teller obnoxious, but her tales lack credibility on every level. The contradictions are constant and blatant. She complains they locked all nine of them in two rooms with no electricity- but there is a refrigerator (electric?) which is in the kitchen, next to the livingroom where they put on shows down the hall from the two bedrooms that are really just \\"tiny alcoves\\" (although each large enough for nine straw mattresses to lay on the ground and they chose to all sleep together in one, how small could these rooms be?) and another small room at the end of the hall that holds their 20-something Louis vitton suitcases full of Gucci suits... They are locked up imprisoned, and barely fed but are taken to the local village for two hours each day where the ladies bake them delicious pies and celebrate their arrival- as is their due. She claims she chooses to stay at her \\"prison\\" each day instead of going, but that's not the point. There is no medical care available- only aspirin, and in the next breath she speaks of prescription drugs for her sisters epilepsy.She's overwhelmingly melodramatic- she talks of two suicide \\"attempts\\". One where she cuts her finger and rubs dirt in the wound so it will become infected and kill her (while she lives in a palace with its own hospital mind you, and nannies and teachers and governesses who mind her- and get this- SLAVES). You figure it is a child's attempt for attention until in the next paragraph she takes the time to assert to us these were serious attempts to take her own life! This book is one more childish attempt at attention getting, just like her two \\"serious\\" suicide attempts. I hate to say it, but by the time bad things start to happen to her, you almost can't wait.I am sure it was a horrifying experience, but rather than tell what I am sure is the moving truth of this family's horrifying ordeal, this books fails to mask the fact it is the blatant childish melodramatic hyperbole of a spoiled brat from solely her perspective where she is always the hero, the leader, the strong one, the smart one, the most beloved, the only one who can take credit for her entire family surviving because she is so beautiful and charming and clever blah blah blah. She doesn't tell you how she bolstered everyone, she just says she did, that it was all her. There are no heartfelt conversations, no touching moment- just that she saved the day...again...and wanders off into the next story. Its gross. My friends and I refer to the book as \\"Paris Hilton goes to Marrakesh\\". I would like to find a more serious work that deals with the subject that includes some geopolitical and cultural information as well. I think that would be moving and interesting. This book is neither."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"While I quickly read this book, I was left feeling strangely unemotional about it. Initially, I attributed this to the rather poor writing, which I may be tempted to blame on the factors of it's being an &quot;as told to..&quot; book, as well as a translation. While I have no doubt that Malika and her family were unjustly imprisoned for twenty years, (there could never be a just reason for imprisoning children) in often truly wretched conditions, there is much of the story that has many contradictions and inconsistancies, that you begin to wonder. I wish more time had been spent detailing certain things which would have given them more credibility-such as the method they used to communicate with each other while in separate &quot;cells&quot;,(while the writer took the time to describe it, I was unable to visualize it even after several readings) how they managed to keep the radio fuctioning, how they were able to pass so much material back and forth to each other between cells.What I began to understand after reading a bit of biographical material on both the King and her father from differing points of view (ie. obituries of King Hassan II from the Washingtom Post and from a worldwide Socialist newspaper) were that both men were tyranical and powerful/power hungry. And these are the men that Malika had as father figures. This combined with the fact that Malika was imprisoned when she was still an adolescent led me to realize that emotionally she has truly never left her adolescence -that intense period of self-absorbption, and egocentricity.(As the mother of a 16 year old, I live with it daily). And as Malika has said of her self-&quot;I was a spoiled brat&quot;While this is the story that is being told by a 40 year old woman, emotionally, Malika has never left her adolescence."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"A vapid stream of consciousness. Not only is the story shallow, the writer didn't even make an attempt to make it interesting. One sentence the vapid protagonist is whining about life in the palace, the very next sentence, \\"(w)hen we were 12 we all had our ears pierced . . .\\" I quit caring about this bimbo early in the book. There is no continuity in the story. Someone must have paid big payola to get this drivel onto the NY Times best seller list. A complete waste of trees."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a book that on its face held a lot of promise. Any story in which a mother and her children, as well as faithful family retainers, are unjustly imprisoned in squalid conditions for twenty years for an ostensible crime committed by the familial patriarch would certainly be of interest. Wrong! This is a tepid and disappointing book, poorly written and, most certainly, poorly edited. It is so filled with contradictions and inconsistencies, as to create somewhat of a credibility gap for the reader.The story revolves around the Oufkir family, who were, at one time, a prominent, highly respected, and well known Moroccan family. Their story is told by Malika Oufkir, who is the eldest daughter of the late General Oufkir, who was executed in August 1972, immediately following an aborted attempt to assassinate King Hassan II of Morocco, for whom he was the Minister of Defense. General's Oufkir's treasonous action was the catalyst for the tragic turn of events that were to engulf his family.After the aborted coup, the General's immediate family was placed under house arrest and four months later, along with two loyal family retainers who volunteered to share their fate, were whisked away to the first of several desert prisons that were to house them for the next fifteen years.As Malika tells it, hers was initially almost a fairy tale story. Brought up in luxurious surroundings, she suffered early heartbreak when, at the age of five, she was separated from her family and \\"adopted\\" by then King Muhammad V, so as to be a live in playmate for the King's daughter. This adoption is never really explained, and one has no idea what her parents thoughts were on this issue. Malika lived in the Palace in the lap of luxury for many years. As a teenager, however, she moved back with her family, where, there too, she continued to live a very privileged life, steeped in luxury and money.After the Oufkirs' circumstances changed, theirs is truly a tragic story. There is little doubt that the conditions in their desert prisons were deplorable and squalid. With inadequate sanitation, insufficient food, no medical care, or educational provisions, the family was truly living a life of privation. Cutoff from the outside world, as they were, they truly were disenfranchised.Their escape from their last desert prison, an escape which brought their plight to the consciousness of the public, was amazing. But for their escape, there is no doubt in my mind that they would still be languishing in a desert prison today, barely alive, if not already dead. I salute their determination and ingenuity in making a desperate break for freedom.The problem lies in the telling of the story, which is so poorly told. Many things are left unexplained. No effort is made to ground the events that led to their family's downfall in a historical context. Whatever Malika said seems to have been what went into the final draft of this book, even if she contradicted herself a page or two later, which is the main problem with the book. There are so many inconsistencies with what Malika herself says, that the discerning reader is left to question much of what she represents.Malika comes across as a somewhat self-absorbed, vapid woman to whom fate dealt a harsh and unusually cruel hand. Her self-absorption is most evident in that she barely acknowledges the sacrifice of the two faithful family retainers, who voluntarily shared their fate, nor does she discuss the impact that this had on them. It is also a little disconcerting that more does not come through about the perceptions the other family members had about this hellish experience. Their insight might have provided a little more balance and interest to the narrative. In the hands of a good writer and excellent editor, this book might have withstood scrutiny and met expectations.Sorry, Oprah, your book club selections are usually excellent. This one fails to make the grade."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"What an amazing story, despite been well written or not, it is worth reading. I could not put the book down.

I couldn't stop reading it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, my first thought upon reading STOLEN LIVES was how no one would read this book if it was fiction. It is not fiction. It is fact, every horrifying detail. Malika Oufkir was adopted by a king and raised as a princess. Yet, due to political turmoil in her native Morocco, this general's daughter (and the rest of her surviving family) find themselves imprisoned in a series of desert jails. From the palace to the prison, through no fault of her own, is the path of Ms. Oufkir's life. She tells this tale without pulling any punches and the reader finds herself experiencing what this unfortunate woman (and her family)was forced to endure. And endure she does. Not only does she endure, but she finds the strength to write this magnificent heartfelt book. Read STOLEN LIVES.

Also,difficult to believe, but a bit boring."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Stolen Lives is a masterpiece of a tragic variety. It highlights the fall and rebirth of a powerful Moroccan family under the dictator King Hassan II. This well-executed voyage though lives tragically stolen from innocent people is a harrowing dose of reality. This work showcases the feeling of imprisonment in a way that I have never experienced before. This book disturbingly shows the atrocity of living under a dictator and suffering his selfish wrath. This family, devastatingly has everything torn from them, for the sins of their patriarch. However, they manage to retain strength and courage as a family. It is beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. The strength of family and the will to be free are poignant in this remarkable read. This book is especially wonderful for younger readers who have not experienced any semblance of true tragedy in their lives. It gives a look into the real and unsheltered world that others have survived."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir became a princess. Her story takes us into the normally inaccessible eidos of the Islamic Moroccan royal family. The consequent oppression and the resultant rush of freedom delivered to her as an immature teenager brings us to the middle of the book and the beginning of the twenty-five years of imprisonment she, her mother, her siblings, and two female relatives endured for the crimes of their patriarch, General Oufkir. I remain puzzled by certain behaviors--the irrational internal assurance they continued to have for the release that never came, the reason why they never resisted, or why it wasn't mentioned if they did. The hunger strikes they held intermittently through the years only seemed to injure themselves, not affect the King with sympathy, yet they continued with this tactic. They eventually escaped. Her tale of the days before their recapture is the best written section of the book. She never blames those who wouldn't help her, but she convinces the reader to. This book deserves reading and an honest try at understanding Malika Oufkir and the Moroccan culture that delivered her into the world."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I honestly didn't finish this book.When I purchased it, I just knew it would be the type of tale that would leave me horrified and full of indignation at the injustice.The story is definitely one that needs light shone on it, but the writing was SO awful that I simply could not continue to read the book.I'm not a terribly discerning reader. I love books of all kinds. I'm not one of those snobby literature geeks that can't bear to read a page-turner because it would just be too trite. Yet even I couldn't get through this book.This story really should be re-written by a better author."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"...I wish it were written better. This is an incrediable story which shows what happens when unaccountable lunkheads get to run a country. The Oufkir family overcame so much to escape from their unfair imprisonment, it truly is an amazing story. But, someone that went through such misery in their lifetime deserves a better editor. The whole first two-thirds of the book breaks the first rule of writing: &quot;show, don't tell&quot;. I wanted some dialogue, some insight into the other people in her life, some wrapping up of loose ends. I wanted to know more about the politics of the coup. There's one sentance in the book about how she was (nearly?) engaged?! It would have been nice to know a little more about this huge piece of information. I could go on and on. Still worth reading, all political prisoners should write books that become best sellers."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a true account of a family from Morocco who are imprisoned for twenty long years after an attempt to execute the king was led by their father. The story is told through the eyes of Malika Oufkir, the eldest daughter. The family endures such brutal abuse both physically and emotionally that it is miraculous that any of them survive it. Malika and her mother are two of the strongest people I've read about in quite some time. Throughout the ordeal they keep their spirits up for the young children and only cry when no one else can see them. They teach the children several languages, math and most importantly the love of family. They entertain them with stories and plays and remind them of the importance of creativity. When they finally escape their desert jail by digging a tunnel, we see the turmoil that still exists long after they are free of their constraints. This true account really is evidence of the strength of the human spirit to endure and live on. To see such violation of the most basic human rights is a travesty that should always remind us that injustice should never be tolerated. I only hope that Malika and the other members of her family along with Achoura and Halima find the peace that they so deserve. Their courage is moving beyond any words."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"2.5What happened to Malika Oufkir and her family was absolutely horrendous. It's difficult for most 21st century minds to comprehend imprisoning families for the sins of the father (literally) and the 'prison' conditions described in the book. And this all happened a couple decades ago! The way this family persevered and survived, both physically and mentally, is uplifting. The stories that Malika would invent and tell her family comes to mind.Unfortunately, this book was not that well-written. In fact, I was bored several times during the long chapters leading up to the imprisonment. I think this story deserved much better."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book was a real eyeopener as to how the rest of the world, outside the united states, conducts their human affairs. It was a real look into the struggles for freedom and democracy and the consequences of fighting for them.

Page turning"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Have you ever been stripped from your life, your family, and your freedom? Most of us can proudly say that we have never been subjected to this kind of torture, but for one girl this was all to true. Malika Oufkir was at the tender age of five when she was asked to live in the Palace with the King and his court and to become the princess' \\"play mate\\". This was not common at all for these times in Morocco, so that is why it was such a privilege for her to be hand picked by the king, but on the other hand she was being stolen from her family. As the years went on she became accustomed to palace life and grew to like it there, so when she returned to her real family she has some adjusting to do. Not long after returning to normal life Malika's father was accused of attempting to over through the king and his policies. He was immediately killed and the whole Oukfir family was taken into custody by the King and placed in a deserted fort. Here they were still able to lead somewhat of a normal life, they were able to keep many of their nice clothes, furniture, and were treated well and feed normal food. After years there the family was moved to a desert jail where they endured what no human should ever endure. They were all separated into different cells, fed only dirty water and bread, beaten and kept from any form of sunlight, condemned to waste away in their cells. This would surely drive any person insane, but the Oufkir family was amazingly strong, they even created a phoning system so they could talk to each other every night. At this point in the book it was hard to put it down, with every page you would discover a new invention the kids had invented and, remarkably, kept hidden from the guards. With every chapter that passed, I realized more and more what a impressive, motivating, innocent and yet incredibly strong family this was. The book continues on to reveal how three of the kids escape and are fleeing from town to town attempting to find someone they know who is still alive, or who will not turn them into the police. One can only imagine that feeling: knowing that you have no one in the world to trust and having to watch your back constantly. Their story does not end there, the book continues to describe how the family was considered heroes for surviving such conditions, and yet the King placed them under house arrest again! After everything settled down the family then had to face probably their biggest challenge, returning to normal life. But what is normal life? They had to re-teach themselves how to trust, love and life, they no longer knew the meaning of the word freedom and didn't like how it had treated them in the past. This book is one that will leave a lasting impression on you. It will pull at your heart and stay on your mind, it will make you mad, sad, and yet amazed all at the same time. \\"Stolen Lives\\" is a definite must read!!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is one of the most gripping stories I've encountered in a long time; thought provoking.

I had no idea things like this where happening especially now. You'll be drawn in the painful world that is Marie's life, I found myself willing her strength and praying for their escape. This book would appeal to many ages although younger children may not fully grasp the meaning behind this event. Also the main character and champion of this novel is a female there are aspects that will appeal to guys. I loved following her pampered childhood especially her time in the palace; finding if extremely interesting. All together I would recommend it to everyone.

The book had all the ingredients for a splendid read, beautiful heroine as narrator to boot as well, (and a recommendtion from Oprah!).I came away from the book with the perception that the narrator (malika) was haughty and self-absorbed, not quite typical of your long-suffering prisoner. This however might be the one good point of the author, as she showed the true colors of its characters.There are big gaps in the story, mainly where there is an opportunity to associate blame on the narrator or her family, Malika only chose to show us the good side of her family and her life, and then the abject torture that they were put through. This of course, is natural human tendency, and perhaps a writer with more knowledge of both sides of the story could have given the readers an interesting spin.There are several unanswered questions that the reader will have after reading this book, which is annoying, more than an invitation to thoughtful discussion. More importantly, a lot of characters are not followed up on in the book, which would have personally been more intersting to me, like lalla Mina, the title characters &quot;step sister&quot;. Still, for those of us who clamour for a glimpse into the veiled worlds on the east, this book gave some good descriptions of what life is like there, from the eyes of a privileged girl who saw both the best and worst that life can offer in Morocco."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir's father was a bad man. As the brutal king's top enforcer and chief of Morocco's internal security, he made a living by crushing Morocco's dissidents with imprisonment, torture and murder. For this, he and his family were rewarded with enormous wealth and privilege. He eventually tried to seize power from his royal benefactor, but failed in the coup attempt and was, as might be expected, executed. Malika, a spoiled rich girl, went to prison for her father's deeds.Did Malika reflect, during her dark years, on the irony of her fate? Her father destroyed the lives of innocent people; then her own life was destroyed because of his actions. Her father's murderous deeds propped up the king's tyrannical rule; and Malika and her family fell victim to the king's unchecked power.But this is not the story Malika tells us. In her version, her father is an innocent and the king is a bogeyman. She does not admit that her fairy-tale palace childhood was bought by the blood of Moroccons her father killed. Nor does she have a shred of sympathy for his victims -- people who, lacking her lucky attributes (the famous last name, palace upbringing, attractive face and foreign benefactors), never were rescued, never became cause celebres, never were feted on Oprah. Malika's pity is only for herself.Please, readers: see through Ms. Oufkir's stunning egotism and revolting hypocrisy. As a child, Malika may not have understood that her father made a living as a torturer and killer. Now she certainly does. Additionally she is most definitely aware that her rescue from prison -- her benefactors, book deals, and celebrity -- are all perks of her position as Mohammed Oufkir's daughter.I would have liked to read a book by a different Malika Oufkir: a spoiled party girl who became, through long imprisonment and hardship, a thoughtful person devoted to justice. (I am thinking of a certain popular, flirtatious teenager in Amsterdam 1940 whose noble character was forged during her years of imprisonment.)Unfortunately, the real Malika Oufkir has no interest in justice and is not much concerned with truth. What she wants is an audience that will throw roses, applause, and oodles of pity at her feet, while she struts and pouts in her rhinestone tiara. Oprah, what were you thinking?"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Honestly, I was bored for the first 50 pages and I must have put it down several times.

Her father is executed and her and her family are sentenced to pay for their father's treacherous acts. They spend twenty years. This book focuses on her palace life inside the harem, prison life, and escaping the disease-infested prison. This book is quite touching and almost brought me to tears at one point, even though the point of the book is not to make you feel sorry for Malika and her family as stated in the introduction. This book is a collaboration between Malika and Michele Fitoussi, and was first record in French.

No one denies that. But this account of their ordeal missed the opportunity to make their pain known to the world.Never did I feel the suffering come through the pages of the book. Never did I feel what it was like to be there. The pain must have been dreadful, but the shallowness of the presentation made it very forgettable.I don't know if this presence was missing because the events were dictated to the writer, and therefore lost in the second person, or if they were lost because Malika Oufkir didn't tell the story in her native language. The pain that came through most clearly was the pain the family felt *after* their jail release, during the time of house arrest. I felt their pain at having missed out on so many years of their lives, but not at the great injustices meted out to them.I'm afraid that with such shallow accounts of their imprisonment, many people will not feel a strong motivation to speak out for human rights abuses, such as theirs."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Compelling, but very very tiring to relive this horrendous ordeal.Many of my questions remained unanswered at the end of the book.However, I am compelled to read this once more to see if I missed something.Sometimes unbelievable, but I believe the author is true to her beliefs."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"While I found the plot of the book to be very engaging, I was disappointed with the writing.

The story is of the Oufkir family and how they were held prisoner by the Morrocan government after their father attempted to assinate King Hassan II. The conditions they endured for the twenty years they were held captive were horrendous. Yes, the story is a depressing one, but you can't help appreciate in the end,what this family endured and how the bonds of love can get people through the most trying of times. I found the novel was hard to get into initially, but give it a chance. It picks up toward the middle and becomes very engaging for the remainder. It will leave you feeling a little richer and a little more appreciative of your own life."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I can see why this book is being peddled to a western audience. We in a democracy are more likely to be outraged at an entire family being held responsible for the actions of one member. In other parts of the world, a family like the Oufkirs who benefited royally from the father's power will of course be brought down with their father. It is not clear what Oufkir's father did, besides the attempt at a coup, but I feel like that information is necessary to understand this story, and Malika does not provide it. Overall, I don't find Oufkir's story terribly credible. There are too many contradictions. For example, in one sentence she says they got to spend times out in a court yard together all day, and in the same paragraph she says family members for years only saw each other by reflection of water in a shared gutter. Elsewhere she claims she and her brother seduced two people on a train to help them in their escape; this after saying her brother had three teeth and a mouth full of abcesses and that she herself was so swollen from malnutrition that she could barely fit through the escape tunnel, and that they were dressed in years-old rags... From Malika's laughable self-aggradizement throughout the book, I wonder if she doesn't suffer from some mental disorder. Malika does acknowleged and understand that she was just as imprisoned in her first 18 years of life as she was in the second half, but notice she only considers the second half that she supposedly spent in prison as &quot;stolen.&quot; She doesn't seem to have much of a problem with the ridiculuous level of wealth and privilege she had in the first 18 years in contrast to the poverty in which the majority of her countrymen were living in at the time. I found this book poorly written and an insult to rational minds everywhere."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Interesting story but who in the world edited this? The average sentence had 5 words in it and the prose, if that's what you could call this atrocity to the literary world, was suited to a third grade level. The author would also refer to events that hadn't happened in the story yet - apparently assuming that you were already familiar with her tale.This book was painful to read. How do you suggest a book for discussion that has no literary genre, no vocabulary, no plot, etc.? It's easy to understand now why it was the first time I was able to walk into the library and pick a hot 'best seller' right off the shelf."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"First, I will admit that I am ignorant about the historical basis of this book. Also, if all that is described truly happened, it is of course a terrible and inhumane thing. The book, however, is so poorly written and rife with contradictions, it makes it difficult to believe that this is an accurate account. For example, the author describes the physical condition of herself and her siblings at the time of their escape as near death, starved, diseased, etc. Yet they manage to tunnel out of jail with a spoon and their bare hands, run for miles from their captors, and make their way to relative's home. (?) The photographs taken at the police station upon their capture show five healthy visages. (?) The author also portrays herself as the only reason she and her family are alive today. She gives virtually no credit to her siblings or the faithful family retainers who shared their fate. Finally, she does not seem to have been transformed from her experience. She is the same self-centered, bratty, spoiled teenager whe was when she was imprisoned.

I always thought that if people are in jail, there is a good reason for it. But here you see that a 3 year old boy is jailed for 18 years and there is no excuse for that.Even though this is a horific story being told, it left me uplifted. I can only believe that the author is still deeply in shock to be able to have told this story and have left out what must be some very gruesome details.I've seen her on 60 minutes and on Oprah and I am in awe.

She spoke with great calm and dignity, and with very little anger or rancor towards those who were responsible for the loss of twenty years of her life. She says that having spent most of her life as an onlooker, there is a &quot;sheet of glass&quot; between herself and the outside world.&quot; I think this explains her calm demeanor.Malika was a happy-go-lucky 19 year old party girl in Morocco, having lived in the palace as the &quot;adopted&quot; companion of the king's daughter. Suddenly she, her mother, a cousin, a former nurse, and her five younger brothers and sisters were imprisoned because of her father's actions. Their once-elegant world shrank ---the next 20 years were spent in several prison sites in southern Morocco where they were basically forgotten. They were the &quot;disappeared&quot;.General Oufkir, the power-hungry head of Morocco's notorious security forces, had operated with King Hassan's knowledge for many years. When he finally turned on the king, he was caught and executed. His family members were considered &quot;criminals by descent&quot; and found themselves at the mercy of their jailers, of disease and vermin, and of hunger.Even after they managed to escape and appealed to the media (after 15 years of imprisonment), the Oufkirs were held under house arrest for four more years, then denied passports for another five years.This is a story that should be read widely and discussed at length. How these people survived (some more intact than others) is a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit. How they got through each day, how Malika taught the younger children, how they bargained for survival.....the trials they endured were and are unconscionable in the civilized world.Although her book is poignant and heart-rending, it is never hysterical or melodramatic. It should embarrass the Moroccan government, but that is not why Malika wrote it. She says that &quot;vengeance would be meaningless in our case. Is there anything that can give back your childhood, your youth, your life?&quot;"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Stolen Lives chronicles the life of the Oufkir family, told by Malika Oufkir.

The King places the family under house arrest and eventually they are taken off to a remote prison in the most appalling of conditions.Malika does a wonderful job of describing their ordeal and how the family made it through these terrible times. I felt like I was right there in the dirty cell with them. I felt for all of the family and Malika's storytelling it was made this book. However there were some missing pieces to the puzzle. First of all, it is never made known as to why the General (Oufkir) would attempt to overthrow the government. There is no information on the political system of Morocco, so I am just left confused as to why the General did it, considering his families outcome. Also, once the Oufkirs escape from Bir-Jdyd, there seems to be a lapse in time once they are at the house with the garden. Malika doesn't describe what happens in those years, it just seems like there was alot of the same things happening. Maybe that is the case, but I just didn't feel like there was a significant synopsis from the house arrest to their final release years later.All in all, I would definitely recommend this book to others. I was shocked to find that a family was actually forced to endure the punishment of their father and couldn't believe something like this could happen in this day and age. It goes to show you anything is possible when dealing with other human beings. That being the negative side of the coin, the positive side is the human spirit that does eventually triumph. I am very happy that the Oufkir family is finally free."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"An incredible story of the human spirit and its ability to withstand tremendous adversity. Stolen Lives is a nonfiction account of a Moroccan family imprisoned for twenty years after a failed royal coupe orchestrated by the father. The Oufkirs, once prominent members of the Moroccan government and royal court, were banished by the King to a desert prison after he had their father executed. While imprisoned, the family endured horrendous mental, emotional and physical abuse. After fifteen years of desert isolation, the family masterminded the greatest coupe of all when they escaped their captor's jail by digging a tunnel using the most rudimentary of tools (hands, spoon, sardine lid). The chapter detailing the escape was the most well written section of the book. Suspenseful and engaging, the escape read like a superbly crafted fictional piece. Unfortunately the action was real, the characters flesh and bone, their suffering authentic.Stolen Lives is a testament to the vitality of the human spirit, and the grace of a loving God. It speaks to the love of family and friends and its ability to sustain us at our lowest points. I was overwhelmed by the loyalty expressed by Achoura and Halima. The Oufkirs were forced into exile by the King, Achoura and Halima chose exile in support the family they loved. That's a choice not many would make. I applaud and honor them for their commitment. This story is one that will join many others in the annals of human rights violations. It adds to the collective suffering of the world and should serve as a reminder that injustice anywhere is indeed a threat to justice everywhere. That power in malevolent hands spawns corruption. Hurrah! Hurrah! to the Oufkirs! May your courage and strength be contagious."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"What Malika Oufkir and her family went through is horrifying, unjust, barbaric, and it is almost difficult to believe that any one of them survived to tell the tale. But that she is able to describe it so hauntingly and even beautifully - to convey the hopelessness and hope, the physical changes, the emotional torments, the hunger and deprivation, the fear and courage - that they all endured during 20 years in prison helps give their story more power and allow for a glimpse into an unimaginable existence.Malika Oufkir's father was a powerful military man in Morocco, so much so that he was close to the king and even sent Malika to grow up with the princess in the palace for much of her childhood. His involvement in a bloody and unsuccessful coup led to his death and the imprisonment of his family for 20 years - Malika's mother, her five siblings and some servants - in increasingly harsh conditions until their escape and eventual release. For Malika, a young woman with dreams of a film career and a life of extravagance - clothes, travel, servants - the change was a dramatic one, while for some of her younger siblings basically grew up in the prison. At first, the family is able to bring their fine clothes and books with them, but by the time of their final move, they are starving, suicidal and almost broken in spirit.The most fascinating aspects of the book for me were the ways in which the family copes, the ingenuity they use to communicate, survive and escape, and how they had to adjust upon returning to civilization after their escape and release. Malika has a lot of bitterness, obviously, toward the royal family but also toward those who deserted the family once they were arrested - given the political climate, it does seem perfectly understandable why people would shy away but then again so,I suppose, does the family's sense of betrayal. The book's power is diluted somewhat by being filtered through Malika's perspective, colored as it is by her emotions such as the belief that a higher power ensured their survival. Malika admits to growing up incredibly spoiled with a sense of entitlement; unfortunately, her consciousness of the wrongs her family suffers does not seem to be applied to others, such as slaves, servants or other political prisoners.Yet Malika's somewhat conflicting traits serve to underscore the strangeness and complexity of her life and situation, going from such extreme luxury and favor to such unbelievable deprivation. In many ways, locked away from the world as a young woman, she seems to have remained in late adolescence in some fashion. In conjunction with her bizarre experiences, this gives Malika a unique voice for what is in many ways a heart-breaking but triumphant story, one that should not be missed."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"There is no doubt that Malika Oufkir and her family suffered in those 20 years in prison, but there is another side to this story that should not be ignored. As a Moroccan-born French citizen and contemporary of Malika Oufkir, I too grew up in Morocco during those years and witnessed the life of the typical Moroccan citizen in contrast to the powerful and corrupt elite milieu which she grew up in.Ms. Oufkir obviously suffers from dillusions... She generally brushes aside the fact that her father, General Oufkir, was a ruthless killer himself. The Ben Barka affair is nothing but the tip of the iceberg, and while nothing was ever proved, it is generally accepted that he was the one behind the 1971 attempt on Hassan II's life at the palace of Skirrat, as well as the 1972 attempted downing of the Royal Air Maroc Boeing 727 by Moroccan Air Force officers flying F4s out of the former American airbase in Kenitra.She absolutely ignores the corruption that her father was deeply involved in. She proceeds to explain that &quot;her parents were not ostentatious&quot; within two sentences of describing the &quot;modest&quot; family home which her father had purchased &quot;on his Army Captain's salary&quot;, including a swimming pool, private cinema, 10 car garage, private guest quarters, and more, in a country where the 1999 per capita GDP is under $3,600 (a marked improvement over the 1997 figure of $1,246). A home such as this would be considered a mansion even today in a wealthy economy such as the US so imagine what it must have been in relation to typical &quot;modest&quot; housing in Morocco 40 years ago. Certainly not within reach of the typical Army Captain.It is interesting and entertaining reading but should be read with more than an ounce of healthy skepticism."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a very powerful book! I had to keep reminding myself while reading this book that not only was it true, but that it happened in my lifetime... and not that many years ago! It was difficult to comprehend that someone (a despot like King Hassan II) would lock up a family for the crimes of their father.I don't know how the Oufkir family survived such an ordeal, and for twenty years. I am sure that the writing of this book was somewhat therapeutic for Malika. I hope that the rest of her family is able to benefit from this story being out in the open. The world has benefited from hearing this story - it is important that we are made aware of such atrocities that are taking place in today's world.I am grateful to be living in a country where I don't have to worry about such terrible things happening to people! The world, now that we know about such atrocities, must do all that we can to see that such terrible things as happened to the Oufkir family never happen again!Thank you Malika Oufkir for the strength to survive such an ordeal, and then the incredible strength to recount it!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"When I had finished reading this book, I naturally felt sympathetic for what this family experienced. Twenty years were taken from them as they were incarcerated in an assortment of facilities. Some of these jails were very accommodating, providing food, entertainment, visits to the city and visitors. In the later years, their confinement was more severe in general.What began to disturb me were the unanswered questions I could not help but contemplate. While no one would question a daughter's love for her father, his responsibility in the coup attempt was not explored in greater detail. I felt she was beginning to question the flagrant life style and rule of the King, but politically, justification for her father's behavior was sadly lacking. It is quite noble to take the rap (20 years) for your executed father's sins, but dreamy reminisces of how her father spent the afternoon with her doesn't justify the sacrifice her entire family suffered for his actions.Far more appalling is a culture that condones the ruling party to abuse young women and girls and take them as sexual toys and playthings. This revelation is far more compelling to the reader as she accounts for the shocking conditions that take place behind palace doors. Stealing young children away from their family simply as playthings for the \\"royal child\\" is disgusting. Grooming children to sexually cater to \\"the king\\" is worse than disgusting. The exhibition demonstrated by the rich is beyond belief in comparison to the stark poverty of the country's peasants. The recollections by the author of her early years and the lifestyle her family enjoyed is just frankly obscene. Actually, I give her credit for her honesty, but I couldn't help feel that she would go back to it with no hesitation had the opportunity arose.In these difficult days lately, when one hears of Muslims criticizing Americans for their extravagance, I admit it is very difficult for me to restrain my irritation since reading this book."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir is a household name among those who watch Oprah Winfrey's show. &quot;Stolen Lives,&quot; the story of the Oufkir family's imprisonment by the government of Morocco, was chosen as an Oprah Book Club selection and it is now a best-seller. Malika Oufkir's story is a fairy tale in reverse. She started life as a pampered princess. The King of Morocco took her into his care at the age of five, and she was brought up as a spoiled young lady, with every luxury at her fingertips. In 1972, everything changed. Oufkir's father, a trusted and powerful aide of the King, was arrested and executed after an attempted coup. In retaliation for her father's act of treachery, Malika, along with her five siblings and her mother, were imprisoned by the king for twenty years.Oufkir wrote this book, which details her life before, during and after her family's imprisonment, with the help of a Tunisian writer named Michele Fitoussi. The writing is not particularly strong. &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; is often disjoined and repetitious and the characterizations are shallow. Although it is under three hundred pages, the tepid writing makes it seem longer, and the narrative drags at times. Oufkir's messages are hammered home repeatedly. She rightly emphasizes that we should appreciate the &quot;free&quot; things in life, such as our liberty, our ability to see a sunrise, and the love of our family. Oufkir also strongly criticizes the repressive Moroccan regime, whose human rights abuses are similar to those of other repressive regimes in many parts of the world. Malika attributes her family's miraculous survival under often squalid conditions to divine intervention as well as to her family's ingenuity, love and tenacious desire to live. The best parts of &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; are Malika's descriptions of how her family improvised while under extreme duress. They rigged up a primitive communications system when they were in solitary confinement, they constructed toys out of scraps for Malika's little brother, and they even put on theatricals to amuse themselves. Although &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; is often depressing and it is inelegantly written, this book demonstrates the unshakable will of human beings to survive under the most horrendous conditions."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Starts out as a wonderful depiction of a girl's life of luxury and comfort and leads into a life full of sorrow, brutallity and unimaginable suffering. Throughout the book, you find an incredible way of retelling real life events that are funny, amazing, terrible and brutal.

At all times, you feel like she is next to you telling you her story.

This is a story of survival, of determination, love, respect, and a strength of will in testing one's abilities. Malika takes you into her world, being vulnerable, soft and yet with such strength. The daughter of General Oufkir, she and her siblings suffer the consequneces that were given because of her father's attempt to assasinate the King. From a small country of Morrocco, with fragility, she tells of her love for her country, her King, her family, and her life before and her life after as she struggles to keep her and her family safe from enduring twenty years in a desert prison. It is a truly touching story. I recommend this book to anyone who is inspired by true stories, survival, and most especially, those who love to read about the strength and bond between a family and their country. It's not about the bitterness of suffering but through one woman, a story that gave her a voice, a strength of character and will. Enjoy."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"After reading this book, I must admit that I was unable to view my life in the same way as before. I even discussed the book with friends after reading it, feeling a responsibility of sorts to pass along the unbelievable messages contained in this book. When I think of all the things that I let get me down during an average day (i.e., not enough money, my teeth aren't white enough, etc.), I feel ashamed. As the author points out, she and her family are not the only ones held against their will in this world. There are many, many people brutalized all in the name of power and greed worldwide. I must say that reading this book helped me to get perspective on my life and enjoy a sense of true gratitude for what I have. The book is worth reading without a doubt, although I was left with the feeling that more details could have been provided in many parts, particularly the latter portions of the book where a lot of events are wrapped up in a mere few pages.

This is a compelling true story. It outlines the life of Malika Oufkir, daughter of Moroccan general Oufkir.Malika Oufkir has lead a unique life. Her story does not begin with imprisonment. It begins with being taken from her parents at age five to live in the palace. She becomes the adopted daughter of the ruling monarch, Muhammad V of Morocco. Although it is never fully explained, it appears that Malika is brought to the palace to be the companion for the king&#65533;s daughter. She is distraught; her parents acquiesce. It is the first lesson in the power of the monarchy. Muhammad V dies and is replaced by his son Hassan II. You might expect Malika to be returned home. But no, Hassan might be offended if the it appears that the Oufkir family thinks less of him than of his father. And so, Malika stays in the palace. But this is just the beginning.Eventually, Malika returns to her family as a young adult. Later General Oufkir, Malika&#65533;s father, who is also a high placed advisor to the king, leads a coup d&#65533;etat. He is killed. Now the family&#65533;s story of imprisonment begins.The King has the family removed from Rabat by police. Throughout the story, the police, and army are used to keep the family imprisoned. Some knew the general and were sympathetic to the family. Others had lost family in the coup d&#65533;etat and were filled with hatred. The conditions for the family were continually reduced, until they were put in solitary confinement for seven years. The treatment of the Oufkir family reads like a Nazi concentration camp story, with brutal guards, arbitrary punishments, malnutrition, and the loss of humanity. Remember that their crime was being the family of General Oufkir. The youngest child at the time of their arrest was three!There is an escape that reads like fiction. The country is put on high alert while the police search for the four Oufkir children who managed to dig a tunnel to escape. It is only through contact with the French press and the outside world that they are finally saved. Even then it takes seven more years (with the family under house arrest) before they are finally allowed to leave the country.I find that I agree with most of the negative reviews. The book is poorly written, and poorly edited. There are contradictions, and incomplete explanations. It is confusing. It was originally published in France and this book is a translation from French. These shortcomings are annoying. But this is more than a story of a family who has been through a rough time. It is a chronicle of human rights violations that occurred in the last quarter of the 20th century. It is a story of people who &#65533;disappeared&#65533; and lived to tell about it. This was worth a better effort by the co-author, who is supposed to be a professional writer, and the editor, who should have done a better job. Even with these serious shortcomings, this is an important story, and an important book. It is recommended."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Stolen Lives chronicals the life and imprisonment of the Oufkir family. Malika, the eldest child, details the horror that she and her family endured for twenty years.The Oufkir's were a prominant Moroccan family, they had ties to royalty and were known in many political arena's. When Malika's father, Muhammad Oufkir, is implicated in an attempt to murder the king, lives forever changed.This was heart-wrenching book to read. It is difficult to believe that this level of autrocity could occur in our modern times. The Oufkir's endured twenty years of torture, abuse, and inhumane conditions. The strength and resilency of the Oufkir family and individual character was prevalent throughout.This is a book that should be shared. It will awaken your emotions, leave you sleepless, and have you questioning why. I applaud Malika Oufkir for sharing her story with the world."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Stolen Lives is by far the most inspirational books I have ever read. It is based on a true story and that's what makes it so amazing, because someone actually went through that hell. Malika Oukfir re-lives her story through this book. Her childhood was actually very luxurious but when her father is found guilty of treason, Malika and her family are imprisoned. Twenty years of their lives were held in numerous jails. Some jails were okay but most of them were horrific to live in, especially the one that caused pure starvation and cruel living arrangements. My heart went out to Malika and her family because throughout the whole process they managed to stick together and fight their way to freedom. I definitely recommend this book if you're interested in a real life story that is inspirational."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Because of her father's treachery in attempting to assassinate the king of Morocco, Malika, her mother, her siblings and two family friends are imprisoned in the desert. For years they live in tiny cells infested with bugs and mice who battle them for their near-starvation rations. Finally they make a desperate move to tunnel out of their prison and alert the international news media of their imprisonment, which puts sufficient pressure on the king to free them.Malika's life wasn't always so bad, though. In fact, when she was five, the king adopted her to live in the palace as a companion to his daughter. Although she missed her family and felt trapped in her life as royalty, Malika was well fed and well brought up and had all of the luxuries life could hand out to a child. This makes her subsequent imprisonment all the more shocking, especially as it is at the hands of her adopted family.I found this book a bit scattered. The author would state in passing something she would then address later, which gave me the feeling of a great deal of jumping around. She also tries a bit too hard to make a connection between life in the palace and life in prison, which I thought was more than a small stretch. Although the author argues that she was never really \\"free\\" to do what she wanted while living with the royals, what child ever is free to do what he or she wants? There were few incidents of her being treated cruelly while growing up, and she wanted for nothing, yet she tried to paint herself as a poor sad little child. This tended to make me feel less sorry for her, rather than more.The part of the book dealing with the family's prison life was horrifying almost beyond belief, yet was dealt with in such a casual tone of voice that I found it hard to get as outraged and sad as I felt I should have been. Something about the tone of the book just didn't strike the right note with me."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir's childhood was one of luxury and indulgence as the informally adopted daughter of King Muhammed V of Morocco and companion to Princess Amina. That life was gone in an instant when Malika's father, General Oufkir, was implicated in an abortive coup against the regime. The General was summarily shot; Oufkir's wife and six children -- the eldest, 19-year old Malika, and the youngest a baby only three - were rounded up, placed under house arrest and then dispatched without legal recourse to a series of remote desert prisons, each more isolated, squalid and inhospitable than the last.Their jailers had their instructions: \\" Subdue the Oufkirs. King's orders\\".\\"Stolen Lives\\" is Malika's story of 15 years incarceration in some of the worst hell-holes on earth, where the family endured cold, near starvation, vermin, petty jailors, disease and despair. Realizing that they would never be released; that they would die there, forgotten, the now grownup children dug a tunnel, using little more than their bare hands, and four of them escaped. Pursued by police and rebuffed by old friends, they reached Tangier and broke their story to the foreign press. Eventually the authorities were embarrassed into freeing the entire family.This is a story of ingenuity, perseverance and unbelievable courage in the face of horrific odds. The events described are beyond shocking; it is considered inhumane to confine animals or the worst criminals in such conditions. It is unspeakable that these acts were perpetrated on children, and incredible that they survived.What kind of regime imprisons children for the sins of their father? \\"That kind of thing can't happen here\\", you say. After all, \\"Liberty\\" and Freedom\\" is enshrined in our Constitution/Bill of Rights.But it can and does, although the difference may be only one of degree.You need look no further than March 2007, and the case of Kevin, the 9-year old Canadian-born son of Iranian parents. The family (with admittedly stolen documents) were held in a US detention centre, ie., cramped cells in a former medium security Texas prison, for over a month after they were taken off a Canada-bound plane which had been forced to land in Puerto Rico due to an on-board medical emergency. Kevin got the attention of the media & an appalled Canadian public (well, some of us were appalled) when he sent a desperate letter to Canada's Prime Minister, pleading for release.Canadian Immigration may have been embarrassed by adverse press coverage into offering temporary asylum to the family; the Bush Administration, it seems, is impervious to embarrassment.I urge you to read \\"Stolen Lives\\". This book shines a small light on the abuses that are inflicted routinely on the innocent and helpless in places that we may know only from the six o'clock news. But it might also lead you to reflect, as I did, on recent limits that our governments have placed on human rights (no doubt the King of Morocco was fearful of his safety too), and to ask whether our guarantees of freedom and liberty are worth the paper they are written on."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book is one of my favorites because the story really makes you introspective about your own life.

That is exactly the feeling I was left with, even though the story of the Oufkir's survival under the most horrendous conditions is quite compelling.The fault might lie with the publisher's desire to keep the book at a certain length, and also the failure of the editor to excise some of the overly-long descriptions of particular events.The translator's style however, does not take away from the importance of telling this family's story. The most interesting parts are Ms. Oufkir's remembrances of her life before the terrible turn of events took place that changed hers and her family's life forever.I strongly feel that Ms. Oufkir could write another book that delved more deeply into her life inside the palace walls.

This is the printed condensation of their amazing survival.Malika Oufikir, aided by writer Michele Fitoussi, recounts the plunge from the heights of an extremely privileged, if secluded, life, mostly lived at the Royal Moroccan court, and a life which later landed herself and her family into gaol, in 1972. A drastic change for everybody -but \\"drastic\\" is almost a diminishing adjective for what they went through-, including the two family retainers who had volunteered to share their fate. This was the result of a failed military coup against King Hassan II, led by Malika's father, General Oufkir, who was shot immediately after. Wife Fatima and their six children, aged between 19 (Malika) and 3 and a half (Abdellatif) were sent to prison. Deprivations, humiliations, isolation -even among themselves, they were not allowed to see each other for many years- lack of hygiene, food, water, medicines and contending their space with various rodents, cockroaches, scorpions, in the chilling cold or the most stifling heat, inability to see the light -they were kept in almost total darkness-. Up until the day when, 15 years later, with the resilience of the totally desperate, some of them managed to escape, Malika included. The tale of their evasion is chilling from beginning to end. But it also led to the liberation of the others left behind. Nobody could believe that the Oufkir children had reemerged from nothingness, but they managed to alert the relevant authorities, international press and word went out. They were all subsequently moved to a different location where they were still imprisoned but at least with more dignity -if one may use this term in the circumstances-. This went on for another 4 years. And then... freedom finally knocked at their door. Almost twenty years had gone by.Forget for a minute about politics, religions, different countries, traditions, beliefs. Sufferings do not bear different classifications depending on whom we are, what we do. To suffer is to suffer, anywhere on this planet, and no one is immune. But. To pay up in such dramatic way for something beyond your control is just inhuman. Malika's voice, plain yet effective, summarizes details which induce cringing sensations.Some reviewers comment on Malika's self-centeredness, sensing a certain degree of superiority, no doubt deriving, in my opinion, from the imprint of her privileged upbringing, which might have added a somewhat unsympathetic nuance to the story. Others remark that there are inconsistencies. It is true in some instances. From a personal point of view, I myself never quite understood why Malika was adopted into the royal family. It could be Moroccan customs or traditions of which I am not aware, but it was never really explained.But. Never mind. Let's face the facts, get to the gist. Prisoners for twenty years for something they didn't commit? Children raised into squalor and fear, without an ounce of dignity? Let us keep things into perspective and grant Malika and the others the deserved praise for enduring their adverse fate and unfathomable conditions, never letting go, organizing their great escape against all odds. Without her, who dug and bled, bled and dug for months, relentlessly, this could not have happened, and none of us would have read this book.A single, soaring voice raising above a twenty-year-long cry in the dark, reminding us that for one who manages to survive, many other faceless, nameless beings perish silently, in many different countries, for many different reasons, their weeping unheard, obliterated by enforced silence.Read this book and count your blessings."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book touch me so much i every it so much.

If I divide the text into .7 line segments and read one segment a day, it will take me 7300 days, or 20 years, to read the whole book. That is an excruciatingly long time, longer than I'd care to imagine."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I am very disappointed in some of the reviews that I have read about this book; thank goodness they are the minority. Yes, I agree that it was poorly edited, and the story that was being relayed really could have been told better. It disturbs me that some of the reviewers almost appeared to attack the author. This lady is not an author/writer; she's no Stephen King or Dan Brown. Those authors have the advantage of fiction on their respective sides. Malika Oufkir had no such advantage. She is a survivor who had to actually live the hell that she describes in her book.Imagine being a political prisoner - your only crime being that you were related to someone who either did something terrible against the country or \\"allegedly\\" did so - you are living in conditions of squalor. Your captors want you to die, but don't want to necessarily pull the trigger. You are starved, not allowed outside, not allowed to see or feel the sun, and deprived of the most basic information such as the date and time. You watch your sister pick the rat droppings from pieces of stale bread before \\"happily\\" consuming it. You watch your three-year old brother's life as a political prisoner. That's what you lived for most of two decades. Finally, years after being released, you get the courage to tell your story so that the world has a chance to know what you have been through, and that political imprisonment is not the cake walk or country club behind bars that it has been touted through the years. For months, you fight through the tears and the recollections of the circumstances and events that above all, you mostly want to forget. Then, proud that you were able to clear that final hurdle, you read the book reviews on Amazon only to find that one reader finds the book \\"difficult to believe\\" and even \\"boring.\\" The nerve of some people to sit in their air conditioned homes with their refrigerator and freezer full, to sit at their computer with access to the world, to not be able to look past the flaws of the book to see the real story. If this was fiction, I could see the criticism, but given the storyline and the simple fact that it was fact, I simply cannot justify attacking the author about the quality of the book. Her experience has forever changed her and her reaction to life itself.Bottom line - this was a riveting story that could have been a riveting book. I give the story itself 5+ stars. I hope Ms. Oufkir and her family are proud that they survived such an incredulous nightmare. I was left wanting more information, but I personally feel fortunate to have received what information I got; Ms. Oufkir didn't have to put her ordeal in writing. The editing gets one star. The editor and publisher failed Ms. Oufkir and should be ashamed that her story was not given the very best attention to detail. It almost seems as though the book was rushed to go to print, and Ms. Oufkir's story suffered the consequences. And that is a real travesty."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I found this story to be an inspirational account of a young girl's struggle from the palace to a jail cell. The orginial controversy of punnishing children for their father's actions developed the story into a thrilling drama. It was a compelling and gripping story, but they way it was written was a little off. Some of the sentances were difficult to read because of the way the words were written. I did not like how the writer kept jumping to the past and present to explain events. This made it confusing to determine what details were current and which already occured."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Many to whom I have recommended this book found the first half a bit tedious; I found it fascinating.

What is missing is an introduction that explains the context for this incredible story--what was going on in Morocco at the time? why did the coup attempt occur? what were the issues with the monarchy? The actions of the King are inexcusable, but why did he do what he did? I'd love to know."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Stolen Lives is an as-told-to book that has been translated from the French into English, and it reads like it. The prose is clunky and inelegant, and if the story wasn't so powerful, this would be a book to skim through and toss. But the story is powerful.Malika Oufkir was adopted by the King of Morocco as a companion to his daughter when she was 5. She lived among the palace harem, in an almost indescribably elegant setting and had the benefit of a private education, tutored by the Princess's own tutor. When she was a teenager, however, all that ended. Her father, General Oufkir, was executed for attempting to assassinate the King. Malika, along with her mother and her five brothers and sisters, was sent into exile. As the world forgot about them, they faded further and further from view. Each time they were transferred, they had to make do with ever shabbier treatment and conditions. By the time they escaped, they had been locked in solitary cells and been fed on scraps of rotten vegetables...and then they were recaptured.Transcribed just two years after Malika was able to leave Morocco for France, Stolen Lives reeks with the power of her anger. At times, though, the anger got in the way of the story she is trying to tell. Michele Fitoussi, the Tunisian-French journalist who wrote Malika's story, did a mediocre job of editing, highlighting the outrage rather than Malika's family's extraordinary resilience."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I very much looked forward to reading this book after seeing Ms. Oufkir on &quot;Oprah&quot;, but after finishing the book, I am left withmany questions and more than a fair amount of skepticism. Ms. Oufkir's descriptions of the brutal conditions she and her family endured sent chills down my spine, but at the same time, raised my antenna in terms of authenticity. So many things seemed utterly implausible, such as her description of their starved, emaciated bodies digging their way to freedom using only the lid of a sardine can and a spoon handle, and then being too &quot;bloated&quot; to fit through the tunnel they had dug. At one point, Malika's brother molds a &quot;fake&quot; gun from a mixture of flour and other materials, swearing that it passed for real. She describes her torn, swollen, and bloody feet in one sentence, and in the next, she is donning a pair of high heeled sandals. This family spent more sleepless nights than would be humanly possible to endure- staying awake to avoid the rats that crawled all over them, but miraculously never bit anyone. I now intend to do my own research regarding the historical accounts of the political climate in Morocco during this time. Too many questions remain unanswered, primarily why this punishment was chosen, and why their plight was ignored by international human rights organizations for so long. Taken with a very big grain of salt, however, this could be an interesting read."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews and Ms. Oufkir's discussion on the Oprah Winfrey Show. I don't feel that it is necessary to discuss what this book is about but it left me with wanting more and a with more than a few questions on my mind. I sympathize with the family and understand how difficult it must have been to live under the rough conditions after living such a life of luxury. However, I finished this book in anticipation of a discussion of why General Oufkir felt the need for a coup. I kept reading only to understand - What were the differences between father and son such that General Oufkir protected the father and attempted to oust the son?Perhaps I was a spoiled by the historical themes intertwined with the main story in the Poisonwood Bible but I expected more on the political climate. I believe it would have helped the reader understand why the family was subjected to the torture that they endured for such an extended period. It would also give the outside world an idea of the cultural and political differences between the US and Morocco.It was a decent book but I probably would have felt better borrowing it from the library or a friend - free."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"A remarkable memoir written by the daughter of a Moroccan general who was foiled in an attempted takeover of King Hassan II. In retaliation the King imprisoned General Oufkir&#8217;s wife and their 6 children for 20 years.Malika tells her story with all the intensity of a doomed soul that has been blessed by a second chance. Her life in prison had become a black hole of suffering and torment, neglected and half starved, she lived with the threat of rats, scorpions, diptheria, typhoid and succumbed to a case of peritonitis that left her in a coma fighting for her very life without medical intervention. She started to believe she and her family were indeed protected by a mysterious presence.In their fourteenth year of imprisonment an escape plan is formulated that leads the reader to share in the intense joy and trepidation that the author must have felt, a light loomed at the end of the black tunnel that had become her life.This is the first non-fiction Oprah selection, and one of her best choices ever. It makes a statement about human rights that will never be forgotten by the reader. Hopefully it will reach out to the four corners of the globe and make a difference in the lives of others. I am awed and amazed by the coping strategies and psychological triumph of the human spirit over what appears to be such a hopeless situation. Much happiness to you Malika Oufkir, you have certainly earned it..."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"She went through hell. Yes! She showed tremendous courage. Yes! But in the telling of this book the scenes, characters, events, timeline and happenings are jumbled up in a childlike rendition of a most difficult life in captivity. This book reminded me of a 5th graders reading assignment. Malika's focus is not so much more than \\"am I still pretty\\" while in her various jails. Some of the stoty makes no sense ( the hidden radio hookup between cells) along with many other events that are difficult to believe."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a book that on its face held a lot of promise. Any story in which a mother and her children, as well as faithful family retainers, are unjustly imprisoned in squalid conditions for twenty years for an ostensible crime comitted by the familial patriarch would certainly be of interest. Wrong! This is a tepid and disappointing book, poorly written and, most certainly, poorly edited. It is so filled with contraditions and inconsistencies, as to create somewhat of a credibility gap for the reader.The story revolves around the Oufkir family, who were, at one time, a prominent, highly respected, and well known Moroccan family. Their story is told by Malika Oufkir, who is the eldest daughter of the late General Oufkir, who was executed in August 1972, immediately following an aborted attempt to assassinate King Hassan II of Morocco, for whom he was the Minister of Defense. General's Oufkir's treasonous action was the catalyst for the tragic turn of events that were to engulf his family.After the aborted coup, the General's immediate family was placed under house arrest and four months later, along with two loyal family retainers who volunteered to share their fate, were whisked away to the first of several desert prisons that were to house them for the next fifteen years.As Malika tells it, hers was initially almost a fairy tale story. Brought up in luxurious surroundings, she suffered early heartbreak when, at the age of five, she was separated from her family and \\"adopted\\" by then King Muhammad V, so as to be a live in playmate for the King's daughter. This adoption is never really explained, and one has no idea what her parents thoughts were on this issue. Malika lived in the Palace in the lap of luxury for many years. As a teenager, however, she moved back with her family, where, there too, she continued to live a very privileged life, steeped in luxury and money.After the Oufkirs' circumstances changed, theirs is truly a tragic story. There is little doubt that the conditions in their desert prisons were deplorable and squalid. With inadequate sanitation, insufficient food, no medical care, or educational provisions, the family was truly living a life of privation. Cutoff from the outside world, as they were, they truly were disenfranchised.Their escape from their last desert prison, an escape which brought their plight to the consciousness of the public, was amazing. But for their escape, there is no doubt in my mind that they would still be languishing in a desert prison today, barely alive, if not already dead. I salute their determination and ingenuity in making a deperate break for freedom.The problem lies in the telling of the story, which is so poorly told. Many things are left unexplained. No effort is made to ground the events that led to their family's downfall in a historical context. Whatever Malika said seems to have been what went into the final draft of this book, even if she contradicted herself a page or two later, which is the main problem with the book. There are so many inconsistencies with what Malika herself says, that the discerning reader is left to question much of what she represents.Malika comes across as a somewhat self absorbed, vapid woman to whom fate dealt a harsh and unusually cruel hand. Her self absorption is most evident in that she barely acknowledges the sacrifice of the two faithful family retainers, who voluntarily shared their fate, nor does she discuss the impact that this had on them. It is also a little disconcerting that more does not come through about the perceptions the other family members had about this hellish experience. Their insight might have provided a little more balance and interest to the narrative. In the hands of a good writer and and excellent editor, this book might have withstood scrutiny and met expectations.Sorry, Oprah, your book club selections are usually excellent. This one fails to make the grade."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir went through hell and back. She almost didn't make it back, though. The story is sort of a memoir of the twenty years she spent in a desert jail. Instead of the \\"from rags to riches\\", its the other way around. She grew up a spoiled, little rich girl, living with the King Hussian in his palace. Than, for disobeying him, she's sent off with her family to a desert jail. I don't wanna ruin anything, so that's all I'll mention about the plot. The writing in this book is not very good at all, but you can't expect it to be a masterpiece from some one who lost many years of education. In all, it's worth reading if your interested in the plot, or you're a huge Oprah book club fan. Otherwise, forget it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This was such an engrossing journey (not just a book)! I am hoping the movie rights are bought!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I enjoyed reading the book for the 4th time already. I am amazed by this family's strength. I find it shocking that the many times I was in Morocco during her incarceration, no one ever mentioned her name. A friend who is Moroccan and lives in Rabat told me many ppl were afraid of King Hassan and only pretended to love him. I told him I was glad I lived in a country where we are free to express our opposition to anyone; within reason. I carefully viewed the photos of Ms Oufkir as a child and she bears a very strong resemblance to King Hassan. I am curious if she is actually his biological daughter along with Abdel, the baby in the family. My friend said Malikas mother was having an affair with the king and that is part of the reason General Oufkir wanted him dead. It kind of makes sense, but the general also seemed power hungry.What no one ever mentions is the fact that the king was a pedophile if he was screwing girls as young as 12, maybe younger. Good heavens! That is horrible, but he was also a modern day slaver and their decendents are still slaves in the palace today, so the legacy of slavery continues.How could this man have been so cruel, so evil and so vindictive esp toward children? What is not really explained is his hatred toward Malikas mother and why the king blamed her for encouraging her husband to overthrow the king. Was there a love affair between them? Or a sexual relationship that she could not refuse since he was the idol?I wonder how many illegitimate children this man had? I am sure the concubines and slaves also gave birth to his children. What happened to them?What will change within the kingdom with the young king? I met a man in Rabat named Imadi who knows Princess Salma. I wonder what kind of influence and impact she will make?I cannot believe the horror this family has endured, but God, Jesus Christ, the real true and living god has seen them thru, whether they realize it or not.What a story and what a storyteller.I will pray for her and her family, but I wonder how many more are out there. Obviously, the king had planned their torment for some time and then he kept f*&^ing with them with lie after lie and game after game. He was the Master of the Game, but evil will not flourish in the long run.Praise God, the king is dead."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"It's a great story to write a book about, but the rhythm of the sentenses and structure are not smooth."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a powerful.. powerful book that will grab you and not let go.

Perhaps they just chose the wrong translator. While the writing certainly isn't top-notch, this is a memoir- a genre that rarely sees excellent writing.The story is interesting. Reading about the palace life was insightful (assuming it was fairly accurate) and it creates an excellent contrast to the dreary life she lived in exile with her family.Even though the author and her family managed to survive and seem to have strong will-power, I still did not like the author. She comes across as a self-centered woman who has a very high opinion of herself. Unfortunately that makes me wonder how accuarte her story really is. While it certainly is unjust to be imprisioned for someone else's actions, I wonder how bad her plight really was."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Well, I was very excited to read this book &amp; learn about Malika's imprisonment. I find it inspiring to read about people who have such courage &amp; stength. The book didn't quite measure to my standards though. First, I felt the story could have been better told if it was told as a &quot;story&quot;. It was to some extent, but not quite, because she was narrating and not just leting the story come about. Second, I guess it was just hard to feel a lot of pity for her, after reading about the hollocaust &amp; other cases of more &quot;extreme&quot; punishment. Don't get me wrong, a great injustice was done &amp; it's horrible, because these people are scarred forever. But especially the first few places they were held, wasn't quite like the prison I expected. It was more of a house arrest. Also, it did leave you hanging- why did her father start a coup?? It was an alright read. It was just hard to stay interested at a lot of points. However, I wish Malika &amp; her family all of the justice &amp; happiness they deserve."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is NOT the kind of book I usually like, and in fact I tried to skip over large parts and cast it away many times initially. But once I realized what cohesiveness and love this family had for each other, I couldn't 'abandon' them! In fact, it reads like a suspense novel in many ways, and even when it gets extremely bleak, Malika manages to give hope behind the despair.I highly recommend this book both for the personal travails of this family, and for how much regimes that suppress freedoms can crush individual humanity. As one reviewer said, this isn't even the worst of what happens in such countries.I object to the reviewers who say Malika is too 'self centered'. Such comments show how little empathy they have for this wretched family. It was evident that Malika was trying everything she could to keep her family together. This is called heroics, not self absorption. I have some sympathy with those who found the book difficult to read. It took about a chapter before it became compelling to me. I discount, however, those who condemn books as 'poorly written' despite their ability to draw people in and tell a captivating story. Malika did this here, and did a splendid job."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir is the oldest child of assasinated General Oufkir of Morocco. She spent the earliest years of her life as the adopted daughter of King Muhammad V, adopted to be the companion to his own daughter. After the King's death, Malika remained in the royal palace under King Hassan II, but as a teenager, ached to be reunited with her true family and finally left the palace. Not long after, her father, the General, was involved in a coup to overthrough the King and was killed for his treason. Malkia, her mother, and the rest of her siblings along with two family friends were then jailed for the next twenty years as political prisoners - their only crime? Being the family of the General.For the next twenty years, the Oufkir family was left to die in desert jails provided with little to no contact with the outside world, and sparce food, most of which was spoiled and rotten. They remained close to each other inventing ways to mentally survive captivity. This novel details the most inhumane forms of imprisonment, and leads up to their daring escape and ultimate freedom.No one can fail to be moved by the horrendous experience the Oufkir's suffered. This narrative exposes the unfathomable treatment that they, and undoubtedly other political prisoners, suffered at the hands of King Hassan II. What is particularly upsetting is that these conditions existed in recent years - not long long ago in ancient times where levels of humanity might not be assumed. But they were not given their freedom until 1991. It is outrageous to discover that Moroccan citizens endured this torture in the 20th Century and that still today, many are among the \\"disappeared.\\" Unfortunately, where this book fails is the tone that it takes in conveying the story. The writing is very matter of fact, devoid of emotion, and does not do justice to the underlying story. The story turns the pages, not the writing. At times it borders on bland.I recommend this book for the tale that it tells, not the manner in which it is told.

Her descriptions of the landscapes and prison environments are excellent."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Imagine; at age five having all the luxuries available to a princess and having a king treating you just like a daughter. Malika Oufkir, the adopted daughter of Moroccan King Muhammad V and then King Hassan II, had almost everything she could ask for in her childhood years. Following a political coup, which her father played a role in, Malika and her family were stripped of all luxuries and imprisoned. The childhood portion of the book is a little too in-depth, the appalling imprisonment years were over in a flash, but while the book keep the audiences' attention throughout; this story had the potential of being a whole lot more interesting.The book is broken down into clearly defined parts-the childhood years, the imprisonment years, and after. The emphasis is on the childhood years; this major portion of the book details most of Malika's moves and thoughts throughout her time at the palace and her rebellious period back at home. Stolen Lives contradicts itself in some instances especially in the childhood years. Repeatedly the author's use the metaphor of the palace being a prison is contradictory to the accounts of a happy Malika having fun with the princess and getting into trouble like any normal child does. The fact of the matter is, is that Malika had a lot of freedom-her punishments for misbehaving were not as severe and she was \`allowed' to speak very freely, and at times disrespectful, to the king with minor or no repercussions. There are several more contradictions throughout this book such as loving, in her own way, the king, yet calling him her jailor.The childhood years section went on and on to the brink of becoming tedious, yet never managed to become boring because of all the escapades, that although were irrelevant to the imprisonment years kept the making the book hard to put down. There were times in the section that I could imagine myself doing some of the very same things-the clubs, etc.-and there were times that I could sympathize with the hardship of separation from your family. Malika does a good job to explain all of her escapades and anxiety that allows a tenuous understanding of what was going on in her mind, and a means for the audience to relate to her childhood and rebellion years.The imprisonment portion of the book moved by very quickly and lacked an in-depth description that would make it more appalling and more easily understood. The narrative of the different prisons and situations went so fast it was hard to keep up where they were, and who was in charge, and what were the conditions. The way the authors describe the conditions it seems like only a few years have gone by, when is really was twenty years that went by. It is hard to grasp that the little boy is now a man, and that Malika is not a rebellious youth anymore. This part had the potential to be a very strong part detailing the atrocities that occurred during these twenty years, and how people blindly followed the king's instructions. It is amazing that such a powerful tale was not written to its full potential.The author had plenty of information to work with and yet, the weak part of the book was an area that should have been a very powerful part. Although it is lacking in some parts (like the description of the prison years), overall this story of one family's life in prison is very emotional. It fulfills what the authors wanted to do: evoke a strong emotion about the atrocities that happened to innocent women and children because of something that they had no prior knowledge of and were not involved in. That is what this story is about and it does a very good job at evoking strong emotions that make people realize that there are injustices in this world that can and do happen."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Anyone who says what this reviewer said is simply mean and heartless. They were not reviewing a book, but instead taking out anger on people they don't even know. Who cares if that stuff about Malika Oufkir's father is true? That is no excuse for what happened to her family. And what happened to her family is one of the worst things that could happen to somebody. Maybe if veiled4azawajal was imprisoned for twenty years, eating moldy, rotten food, living with rats and vermin, bathing in Tide, and lying in bed constantly, unable to move, then they could understand that you can't just &quot;get over&quot; an ordeal like that.No, this book is not a greatly written book if someone is talking about good writing in the usual sense. However, this is a wonderful book. It is amazing that Malika Oufkir would be able to bring herself to discuss truly horrible and painful details. But it is a good thing she did. Any normal person that reads this will see that the human spirit can prevail and that people can survive unimaginable horrors. Malika Oufkir and her family are amazing.

Her youngest brother is only 3 years old when imprisoned, and after 20 years, when they are released, he knows nothing of the world.

Years later, in the event that preciptated the story in this book, Oufkir attempted to kill King Hassan II of Morocco in a coup that failed. For this crime he was subsequently murdered. (One would say &quot;executed&quot; except that it was without benefit of trial.) Had matters ended there, it would have been a tragedy for Oufkir's family, who were totally innocent of involvement in their father's affairs, but the events would have largely been forgotten outside of Morocco.However, things did not end there. King Hassan II was apparently not satisfied with Oufkir's death, because he subsequently ordered Ofkir's entire innocent family -- wife, daughters, sons (including a 3-year old) -- to be rounded up and imprisoned (also without benefit of trial), along with a couple of supremely loyal family friends/staff who insisted on accompanying them to prison.At first the imprisonment was physically bearable; but over time they were transferred to more and more squalid conditions in ever more remote locations. They were eventually forced to spend almost 20 years as prisoners, more than 10 of them totally incommunicado, in solitary confinement, in complete darkness, in rat-and vermin- infested cells, on a starvation diet, with no medical care, and under conditions that can only be described as mental and physical torture.During all that time the prisoners, including the mother, the author (who started as a teenager) and the others all the way down to her youngest brother (who started at 3), aged, grew, and matured mentally and physically, even as their mental and physical health was slowly ruined to the point that they all became suicidal. Imagine what this must have been like for the youngest!The story of their escape from these hopeless conditions via a tunnel, and their return from the near-death status of the &quot;disappeareds&quot; is nothing short of miraculous. The escape of Papillon from Devil's Island pales by comparison. This book is totally absorbing and impossible to put down. You must read it.It is a serious and important book, and there are too many good things to say about it in this short review. The writing is disciplined and controlled, in an angry but not vengeful voice.To me the most profound theme is the evil inherent in the concentration of arbitary power in the hands of a despotic man who could commit such an atrocity. There is no legal or moral code left on Earth that visits punishment for the crimes of the father on the innocent wife, children, and friends as well, let alone punishment that is this terrible and extended.Did I mention that the author had actually been the adopted daughter of the very same King Hassan II responsible for all of this?All Moroccan's should be ashamed of their King Hassan II after this book. Let us hope it will help lead to a revolution in the governance of that beautiful country."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I finished this book in two evenings, whereas it took me so many weeks to wade through Ahab's wife (see review posted 6/30/01). And it certainly holds firm to the &quot;truth is stranger than fiction&quot; adage. It is almost inconceivable that these kind of sadistic, politically motivated crimes against humanity are going on daily in our world and that is certainly an issue that needs more attention.Although I was riveted, repulsed and astounded that anyone would be able to survive conditions of such deprivation for such a duration, I wanted more. I could've easily read another 150-200 pages.I do not feel the book was particularly well written and long periods of time were glossed over: for example, the last three years of their captivity was pared down into a few pages and the level of demoralization was not extensively elaborated on. Three more years is a lot of time, even though their conditions had improved to livable. I did get the sense that Malika was numb to all that she had endured or perhaps just sick of reliving it. Certainly the most exciting section was their escape and recapture and there was no way I could put the book down during all of that. That is one of the factors I feel constitutes a good read and why I have given this book a fairly high rating.However, I want to know more about how they all have reconstructed their lives to live in some semblence of normalcy after such an ordeal. I want to know if Raouf ever got his teeth fixed and how they all restored their health. What's King Hassan II up to these days? I want to know more about Malika's life today, her days in Paris, her marriage to Eric. Perhaps that also is a sign of a good book to me....tell me more, don't leave me here. How can I help so this kind of thing can't happen to anyone else? This book had a chance to motivate many of us to action but I do feel it fell a little flat at the end."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I enjoyed it completely, especially knowing it's not just some make-believe tale.

I just recently returned from Morocco, and while there wondered how many such prisoners are still lingering in the country's prisons. The people of Morocco and kind and friendly, as a whole friendlier than in most countries I have visited. Not once did I hear an unkind word or saw a grumpy face on people I encountered. Absolutely lovely. With that in mind, in the story of her 20 years of imprisonment and the subsequent \\"Freedom\\" describing the return to life outside a prison system, the kindness and forgiveness she expresses are much easier to understand."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika speaks to the world in this heart-wrenching account of her life. Her story is one of courage and the ability of the human heart to triumph over the worst of situations. Malika endured terrible hardships and lived in unspeakable conditions. Yet she survived and her story is one to be heard."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oukfir's powerful true life story of her life as a princess followed by her life as a prisoner held my interest entirely. She details her experience in vivid detail, up until her last 3 years of imprisonment, which are less descriptive. Malika inserts her commentary throughout, so there's the effect of watching a movie with a narration about how an event shaped her life or how she's changed since then.The first part of the book details Malika's upbringing as an adopted princess in the Royal Palace at Rabat. It's unfathomable that when the King Muhammed V asked Malika's mother, (a married woman who could afford to raise her daughter and apparently loved her), if he could adopt 5 year-old Malika, she automatically said yes and left her with the King that afternoon. But this was a society where women were raised to be subservient to men, and no one said no to the King. King Muhammed V treated Malika like his own daughter, as did his son Hassan II (with a few notable exceptions) who became King a few years later. This section also includes fascinating descriptions of the lives of the King's 40 concubines, who at one point pedal bicycles behind the King in single file. Life as a princess may have seemed like a fairy tale with fabulous food, expensive clothes, horseback riding, and a private cinema, but Malika desperately missed her mother and her family. Ironically, for 20 years from age 18 to 38, she would be imprisoned with her mother and siblings.As a teenager, Malika returned home to her family, and lived the life of a wealthy student, which included international travel, partying at posh nightclubs with celebrities, and shopping extravaganzas. The good times ended when an assassination attempt was made on the King, her father was executed, and Malika age 18, her 5 siblings aged 3 to 16, her mother, and 2 family friends were sent into exile without a trial for what they were told would be 2 weeks, but turned out to be 20 years. The conditions of their lives in several prisons became increasingly wretched and difficult to read: rodent and flea infested cells, rotting food, slow starvation, illnesses, zero reading material, and thoughts of everything they were missing out on. But the love of the family, their sense of humor, their sense purpose in devising and implementing their escape plan, Malika's imagination in inventing a fictitious soap opera to entertain the family, and their ingenuity to make the most of their meager resources, helped them survive. Some of the things they invented in prison reminded me of the professor's inventions on Gilligan's Island! It was also interesting to read about the guards, some of whom were ashamed of what they were doing, while others were \\"just following orders.\\" If not for their meticulous escape plan and mailing of pamphlets detailing their ordeal, the Oukfir family would likely still be in prison.The book is worth reading on many levels. One learns about:* Human coping and dignity under the most challenging circumstances.* Human rights abuses that still go on to this day and the effectiveness of international pressure in making a difference.* A culture unfamiliar to most readersAlso, this book helps one gain renewed appreciation for things we may take for granted such as a simple meal or hot running water.My only complaint is I wish Malika had included more about the post-prison healing process of her family. Thank you Malika for sharing your story."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I read this book after seeing Malika on Oprah. I am not a book club reader, but received this from my son(8 years old) for Mother's Day. It was hard to get into this book at first, and it is very jumbled as it is told directly to a woman from Malika. It is obvious she is recalling experiences that were extremely painful. This has made me realize that we are very fortunate individuals in America, we live lives of freedom. I cannot imagine life as it was for the Oufkir family. They had stolen years, decades to make up for. What a tragedy, and horror to live with forever. I will pass this book along as it made me appreciate many little things I have taken for granted. It is a great book, horrible lives."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book definetly was well worth reading. It made me sit and think of what i was doing when this women and her family was sitting there in a prison with no hope.

Unfortunetly this is a true story and because of that it hits you even more. I enjoyed this book and hope to see the Oprah interview if it comes on again."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"For Malika Oufkir, childhood was not about Popsicle stands and late games of tag. Instead Malika was introduced to the politics in which she was a victim of. At theyoung age of five, Malika was adopted by King Muhammad V. Though her true familywas competent in her care, the King gets what the King wants. For years Malika lived inthe splendor and disrespect of the palace. She was given material goods to her heartsdesire, yet she could never find the love that she needed. Nor did she understand why herprevious family would so easily give her up.This irony in her life was subsided by the attempted assassination of the King. Herfather, General Oufkir (A well respected, and highly successful military man) put the callout for Muhammed V's head. With no knowledge of her fathers actions, Malika, hermother, and five brothers and sisters were sent to prison. Malika's father, wasconsequently executed.Prison was at first easy to swallow. Malika's family was allowed to bring severalarticles of their fine clothing, as well as books and toys. Yet as their situation worsened,these privileges were stolen along with their basic human rights.Malika's family was moved into a desolate desert prison. Here they were treatedhorribly. Malika's account gives the reader a detailed image of the conditions in whichshe lived.Unable to go on, and starved of life, Malika helps put her family members out of theirmisery several times. Cutting at her siblings wrist with any sharp object she may find,Malika realizes that they must escape for good.Her determination and triumph is the basis for a excellent story about the mistreatmentof humans. This book is a reality check for anyone who has not been opened up to thedeterioration of human morals in this part of the world."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"\\"Stolen Lives\\" is the story of Malika Oufkir, the daughter of a close aide to the King of Morocco who is forced to live eleven years in the king's harem and then two decades in prison for her father's treason. She and her mother and siblings are sophisticated, wealthy, and attractive when they are locked away, which helps to kindle the young reader's sympathy. This book was written after Oufkir fled to France and told her story to co-writer Michele Fitoussi. The story is compelling enough, filled with fantasy worlds of unimaginable wealth, it is tragic enough as a beautiful family is tossed into jail for no legal reason, and there is the redemptive conclusion as they escape and reflect on the strength of the human spirit. It's all perfect grist for a storybook for adolescent girls. Fitoussi's prose is as breathless as any romance novel. The plotting is a thin chronology with facts quickly forgotten and no pesky political explanations to set up the context. The characters are all transcendently beautiful. Not much substance for a critical reader -certainly not enough to merit a book club discussion- but lots of faraway starry-eyed romance for a teenager."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I initially liked this book, but had some reservations. I could not put my finger on it until recently and that's what persuaded me to write this review.Initially, I found myself unable to seperate the forrest for the trees of my feelings about this family. One feels empathy for this family, but the real horror of this story is not how badly treated these women were, but how little concern they had for anyone but themselves. The whole book was solely about how badly they were treated in exile as compared to the life of luxury they had to start with. And then they complained how badly their former \\"freinds\\" treated them when they escaped. It may have been callous treatment, but what did ANY of members of this family do to relieve the suffering of anyone else when they had all the opportunity in the world? The answer is never. They were self indulgent, insulated and uncaring benificiaries of a corrupt regime until they themselves were at the mercy of this self-same regime. No tears were shed by me.And that's why I have little sympathy for a family that betrayed their friends (her father via the coup) and who then were surprised that they were treated harshly after the fact. The women did not care their money came from the sweat off other's misery (the vast population of the country) and then were chargrined to find that no one was really willing to do anything to get them out.Overall the book was decently written, but their plight really does not make me upset. Many others suffer worse indignities and nobody gives a damn. Millions can starve to death, some never knowing the feeling of a full stomach for one day in their lives, and we all read a book about a wealthy family reduced to poverty and imprisioned?Because of the seemingly absurd riches to rags storyline, this is the only reason this book gets any attention. If you have ever lived in a third world country, outrages of much larger scale occur daily.I finished the book feeling glad they survived their ordeal, but realized that I feel worse for the untold millions who never get a chance."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"i found this book very interesting, it is actually a chock for me to discover that such cruelty exists especially in a country that i really love; my home land: Morocco.

I actually felt as if i knew these people all my life.I highly recommand this book to everybody. The whole world should know about this story.it is a real story about very strong and interesting people. This book taught me a lot about life, humanity, strength and survival."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I appreciated Malika Oufkir's book very much. I have to wonder though, with the reader from Olympia, Washington, about some of the information Oufkir includes. It somehow seems disconnected at times. I also wonder why her father, well-connected and wealthy, jeapordized his family's lives with his attempted coup. The writing, as well, seems &quot;rough&quot; at times. I am very interested in Morocco and have traveled there. I do have great sympathy for Oufkir; I just wish the book were better written and more clear in the details. The poor woman, though, was probably in a state of constant shock due to the terrible conditions, and her recall probably IS uncertain at times."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"\\"Stolen Lives\\" needs to be evaluated on two different levels - the moving tale of a family imprisoned under the worst conditions for 20 years and the way this amazing story has been memorialized by Malika Oufkir and Michele Fitoussi. The subject is engrossing and important, but the book itself is not well-written. This accounts for the disparity in ratings that the book has received.It is fascinating to read about Malika'a unique and frequently heartbreaking life. The eldest daughter of a Morococcan general, she was taken from her family and adopted by the King. Western readers will find the tales of her life in the royal household surprising and enlightening. Not only was the lifestyle outrageously lavish, it was also consisted of customs and traditions that are completely different from our own. Malika was allowed to return to her own family as a young teenager. She only had a few years to get to know her father and enjoy life outside the confines of the palace. Her father before General Oufkir was implicated in a coup attempt against the King and was assassinated. The rest of the family - Malika, her mother, her oldest brother, three young sisters and three year old baby brother were summarily imprisoned. For twenty years they lived in increasingly brutal and inhumane conditions, persecuted by the King for their father's crimes and forgotten by the world. Thanks to their uncommon courage and ingenuity, the family was able to survive and eventually escape. It's not easy to read about many of the horrors and indignities that were heaped upon the Oufkirs, but it's important that the world know about their story.Unfortunately, the book is not worthy of this amazing story. It was written by Malika with the assistance of Michele Fitoussi. The first problem is that the book does not give sufficient background about either the history of Morrocco or General Oufkir's powerful role as one of the King's chief aides. Those unfamiliar with Moroccan history will frequently find themself at a loss for context. Second, given that this is Malika's first person account, it necessarily is a very one-sided version of history. Not that I doubt her version of events - I just would have preferred a more complete and well-researched book that included not only Malika's story but also those of her siblings. Malika frequently portrays herself as the backbone of the family, the strongest member who kept them all from succumbing to madness. This very likely is true, but it would have a much greater impact coming from someone else. Finally, the writing style is very repetitive and immature. While Michele Fitoussi is very sympathetic to Malika's story and deserves much credit for persuading her to tell her story, I have no doubt that a more objective and skilled writer would have improved the quality of the book immensely. Hopefully a serious scholar will undertake a complete telling of the Oufkir's story. I, for one, will be anxious to read it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Now I have some idea of what it is like to go to hell and come back alive. Shattered, but alive. Malika Oufkir's autobiography, co-written with French journalist Michele Fitoussi, is extraordinarily candid for someone who has been in prison most of her life.She and her family have experienced crushing, soul-suffocating oppression which has left severe, permanent damage on each member. While their lives have improved, to a certain extent they will all stay locked in time.It is nothing short of a miracle, therefore, that someone who has been so repressed, can find the courage to reveal themselves with such frankness.Stolen Lives is a truely unique story of the survival of the human spirit, a suspenseful fusion of fairytale, horror and thriller. It was one of those books I couldn't put down.After I read the book several months ago, I interviewed Malika Oufkir for several stories I was writing about her. She wavers between fragility and toughness, she is both young and old, compassionate and passionate and displays great courage as well as great fear.Malika has paid an unusually cruel and high price for her freedom of expression.Before reading the book, it would benefit readers to do some background reading on events in Morocco which led to the incarceration of the Oufkir family. There are various sites on the Internet detailing the 1972 attempted coup d'etat by Malika's father, General Mohammed Oufkir. Also, reading on the structure of Moroccan society would be useful to understand what it was like to live under the iron-fisted rule of a feudal monarchy."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"After reading all the previous reviews I don't have much to add to the fact that it is an excellent read. I watched the 60 Minutes interview of Malika Oufkir before I read the book and the name seemed very familiar to me. It took me a while to realize that I had read about General Oufkir's coup attempt in a semi-fictional novel : The Spy Wore Silk by The Countess of Romanones Aline. Since I feel a sense of unfinishedness among some of the reviewers, I would like to recommend the above book for people who would like a better idea of who General Oufkir was and just how big a betrayal of his king his coup attempt was. Of course this in no way justifies the imprisonment of his family. But I do think that the two books should be read together to get a better view of the context in which the incident took place, and an outsider's view of the Morocco of the time. The author of The Spy Wore Silk is an American married to a Spanish Count."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book describes in detail the pain and torment the Oufkir family suffered for over twenty years.Malika was adopted by the king and raised like a princess.When her father tried to assassinate the king, he was murdered and his family would suffer the consequences. Malika's brother was only three at the time and her sister also suffered epilepsy.They were kept in isolation,starved and denied their freedom.They had no choice but to eat the molded bread with rat droppings and rotten eggs that turned green.When the guards realized the children liked pigeons,they would cook them two at a time to torment them. Their love for life is what kept them sane throughout all those years.They were robbed of their youth and freedom.Malika tells her story as if it happened yesterday.Her strength is admirable and you could feel her pain as if you were there.You experience her emotions throughout the book and become attached to her. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.I read the book without putting it down until my eyes hurt.I never lost interest and felt so much compassion towards Malika and her family."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"No matter what flaws it may have, this book is well worth reading. Published during the life of King Hassan II, who imprisoned the Oufkir family, the book itself is an act of courage and defiance. It is a story that the family was threatened not to tell, and France is geographically close to Morocco.To better understand the book, it helps to learn a bit about the history of modern Morocco (or to have been there) before reading. Michele Fitousi does not add background information to the Oufkirs' story. Differences between the Berbers (indigenous to the area) and the Arabs (7th century arrivals,most of the ruling class) are important. The role of General Oufkir (a Berber) in restoring Muhammed V to the throne after the successful overthrow of the French colonial government, and the general's disillusionment with the corruption and disregard for the common people shown by Muhammad V's son Hassan II make the attempted coup d'etat more understandable. Both also illumine the spectrum of public responses to the Oufkirs' tragedy. The troubled but close relationship between 20th century France and Morocco is also important.There is nothing to add to what others have said about Oufkir's profound journey into the core of the human soul. She has the perception to tell us all what she found.Reading this book, one understands how Hassan II earned the face his photographs show in the last years of his life.Bravo, Malika!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a book about the effects of imprisonment on the human soul and the eventual triumph of resistance over oppression. Written in simple journalistic style, the narrative reads like a novel but unfortunately represents a harrowing true account of survival. Malika's life changes in one moment from that of a spoiled rich jet setting adolescent to that of a prisoner who must suffer not only deprival of freedom and basic human comforts and necessities, but also contact with fellow family members imprisoned in isolated adjacent cells. The radical change in lifestyle is all the more stiking since it follows a description of her unique childhood experiences as a princess, an adopted daughter of the monarch raised in the palace. The profound injustice of the situation is especially appalling when one considers their innocence in being held accountable for a political crime allegedly committed by the assassinated father, a General. The victims, his wife and children who range in ages 3 from to 20, are committed to live a life of deprivation and endless imprisonment by a despotic Morrocan monarch as punishment for this coup attempt. The book is a powerful way to experience loss of freedom vicariously and from a safe distance and to understand its immediate and long lasting effect on individuals. The title epitomizes the irrevocable loss of life experiences suffered by its victims who on leaving imprisonment must begin life as middle aged or young adults with a 20 year hiatus. The book is touching and deep. It makes one understand the importance of organizations like Amnesty International in at least attempting to make a difference."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book is about a woman's life as an insider to Moroccan Royalty. The story is told in the first person, and reads as a running commentary on the incredible story of her adoption by King Muhammad V of Morocco, and her growth into adulthood as a victim of a failed coup attempt by her father; a general in the Moroccan Military and close adviser to the King. Her story takes you from grief she feels being torn from her natural family and especially her mother, to be adopted by the King. She describes the spoiled world of a would-be Princess, and her life in horrible prison conditions. A study of extreme contrasts in lifestyles.I found the story to be fascinating, the imagery of a world unknown in Western culture. The emotions both touch and repel. I found her attitude as a Princess in the palace to be disturbingly egocentric and spoiled, contrasted by the strength and courage she demonstrated while looking after her family in prison. The depictions of the prison life, with the rats, roaches, sand fleas, and other poor conditions made my skin crawl while reading.My only criticism of the book is that the editing is a bit choppy. The story is so compelling, but it struggles to flow seamlessly from event to event often causing me to go back a few pages and see if I had missed a transition. While this was frustrating at times, the emotional contents of the story overcome any weaknesses in writing style. Some may even enjoy the journalistic approach.I would recommend this book; it is an incredible journey."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I found that once I picked up this book, I was unable to put it down.

I would recommend this book to anyone who does not believe that tragedies and triumphs like this are no longer in existance. My heart goes out to the Oufkir family."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"The first word that comes to mine when I think of this book is astounding. This story is told by Malika Oufkir, the oldest of the six Oufkir children that were imprisoned along with their mother and two confidants after their father was assasinated following a failed coup attempt against Moroccon King Hassan II. What makes the story so fascinating is that Malika was an adopted daughter of throne. King Hassan II father, Muhammad V, had adopted Malika Oufkir at the age of five to be a sister/playmate for his daughter Lalla Mina. And now at the age of 18, it seems that Malika's royal status no longer has any meaning when her birth father commits heresy against the throne. The atrocities that this family had to endure was enough to drive any normal person insane, but this family persevered in the face of death threats, starvation, plagues of many different rodents and insects, and devastating illnesses. And to believe this happened from the 70's until the 90's. This is a wonderful read, it moved me to tears and several times to laughter. 6-16-01"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I saw an interview with Malika Oufkir on Oprah Winfrey's show and was so taken by her courage, her incredible spiritual strength and the unbelievable horror of her tale, that I felt I had to read this book. I found it to be an inspiring testimony to the human spirit but also an honest account of the terrible toll of this family's ordeal, leaving one brother &quot;a permanent child&quot; in Malika's own words, a brother who found adjusting to a normal, free life nearly impossible and who is still suffering the effects of his imprisonment.For their part, Oufkir and her sisters were left suspicious of men, emotionally scarred by what they survived...and yet they also managed to find the strength to serve as witnesses to their injustice and to find the courage to speak out. This is one of the most inspiring true-life accounts I've read in the last year and one I'd put on any &quot;must read&quot; list. If you dont know the details of Oufkir's story, here's a brief summary: At the age of 5, Malika Oufkir, eldest daughter of General Oufkir, was adopted by King Muhammad V of Morocco, a man who wanted an available playmate for his young daughter. While in the palace, Oufkir led a life of a fairy princess, in total luxury --- until her father was found guilty of treason as part of a coup to overthrow the new regime (led by King Hassan II). Malika's father was executed and she, her mother and her brother and sisters were immediately imprisoned. From one day to the next, Oufkir went from luxury to a struggle for her very existence, living in conditions that you can't believe until you read about it. There were times when one or the other would try and commit suicide (her brother when he was only 7) or be forced to eat food drenched in rat urine. And yet they DID persevere and manage to escape to tell their tale. Please don't assume that the grim details in this book (and I won't pull any punches; there are parts of this book that are difficult to read0 take away from the inspiration to be found here. After finishing this book, I actually felt uplifted and was amazed that I did, buoyed by the fact that this family went through such horror and yet managed to find the courage to survive - and then to tell about it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Readers who might feel disappointed by the scarcity of political, historical, and social analysis in Stolen Lives should perhaps consider that Malika Oufkir wrote it as a witness account of her own life. She interprets this life through the eyes of the child she was when growing up in the royal palace, then through those of a somewhat rebellious adolescent, and finally through the lens of a prisoner in King Hassan's jails, where she spent 20 years deprived of educational and social tools. Still deeply marked by her years as a captive, she only left Morocco in 1996 to settle in France. Rather than a critical study, this book was meant to be an autobiographical relation of the trajectories of a woman and her family in particularly dramatic circumstances.Neither is this book a personal diatribe against King Hassan. On the contrary, for those who are aware of other details in the King's life, such as Malika Oufkir who knows more than she is willing to share in public, this book is remarkably measured and honest in its descriptions of the narrator's perceptions and emotions. Her focus is not the King's private life, which could give rise to juicy gossip. Malika Oufkir has too much dignity to stoop to less than commendable tactics of revenge.As for her escape in 1987, though sensational, it is not implausible. Other prisoners all over the world have managed to escape their jails, some to overcome even harsher and more challenging circumstances. Bravo to Malika Oufkir and her family for their resolve and their ability to survive! And bravo to Malika Oufkir for finding at least a tiny dose of the happiness that was so absent from her earlier years."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"When I read this book, I felt that I should never complain about anything again.

Soon, at the age of 19, she along with her family, consisting of her mother and five siblings were arrested and jailed for 15 years out of which 10 years were in near solitary confinement. Their ordeal reduced a bit after Malika and there of her siblings managed to escape the prison by digging a tunnel and succeeded in bringing their existence and the inhumane treatment mated out to them to the notice of the world through one of the French radio channel. This resulted in their continued confinement, not in jail, but under house arrest. It is after 20 years, whole of her youth, that they were freed from confinement and she could leave Morocco in 1996.4. It is a personal account and as such tends to over-emphasis few things, as it happens in all personal accounts. But the quality of the narrative is sterling, humane aspect of the story is moving, the treatment that was mated out to this family and the resistance they put up are worth reading. All in all one feels sorry for such sheer waste of beautiful youth of so many young children (six to be precise) for no fault of theirs. Well, one can only say that to some extent democracy is better then all these Monarchy.5. Some of the things worth mentioning are: -(a) That such thing happened in our lifetime, in civilized and(b) modern world, makes you feel ashamed.(b) The horrible treatment that was given to them is repulsive. Which form of justice it is to punish the family members for so-called crimes of the head of the family.(c) Another important point stands out that if a family sticks together, they can withstand / overcome all odds / trials. That's how they managed to survive and maintain their sanity.6. This one book (originally published in French as \`La Prisonnier' and co-authored by Michele Fitoussi) is worth reading and cherishing as a icon of the triumph of Human mind and soul over strongest adversary."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Not for the faint-of-heart, this book kept me up at night. Though I thought some of the scenes somewhat unbelievable, I can't honestly comment, having never been in prison. That said, I'd highly reconmmend this tale to anyone who likes a good story.Also recommended: Bark of the Dogwood, Fortune's Rock, The Five People you Meet in Heaven"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Quit watching those plastic survival television shows and emerse yourself in this true life story of day by day life on the edge of death .Malika's story telling the world of her family life within the walls of prisons was an inspiration to me to find the beauty and value in the usually overlooked , everyday items.She and her family treasured things that most of us toss out without a thought. Nothing was taken for granted.My sense is that Malika and her family live in the present,always alert and aware of just where they are in this world. I thank her for this reminder to open my eyes to what is around us. She and her family are not\\" on automatic\\" as take each breath.After reading this book, I am more aware that there are so many more political prisoners right now suffering as Malika and her family did. It makes me angry that we let weak and evil people in power. Why do we continue to allow this to go on?"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Stolen Lives would be a great book for a more mature audience. The age group would probably be from 15 and on, because of the graphic details and language. The book starts out with Malika Oufkir being adopted by the King of Morocco because his daughter wanted a live in playmate for his daughter. Malika&#65533;s biological father was accused (and then murdered) because of an accused assassination attempt on the King, and as a result, choose to imprison the whole Oufkir family. They spend twenty years in various jails and experienced unimaginable situations.The book uses literary techniques very effectively. The first technique I found to be in abundance was imagery. I found that this book appealed to the five senses and really gave a reader a sense for the images that were present. The vivid description of what they ate was unbelievable. &#65533;We never had any milk, butter or fruit, except a few shriveled dates and mouldy oranges from time to time. Rotting vegetables, two bowlfuls of flour, a bowlfuls of chick peas and one of lentils, twelve bad eggs, a piece of spoiled meat, a few lumps of sugar, a litre of oil per month and a little tub of Tide-that was all we were usually given.[SIC]&#65533; Another literary technique I found to be very effective were details. The details put into the book support the somber, sad tone of Stolen Lives. They also support the emotion difficulties going through Oufkir&#65533;s head. &#65533;In the dark I could hear my mother sobbing. Alone in her bed, she wept over the loss of her husband more than the loss of our freedom. Her life as a woman had ended at the age of just thirty-six. By dying, my father had condemned her to solitude. During the day she often read the Koran, and I could see from her sad eyes, always puffy with tears, how much she suffered.&#65533; These are only a small sample of the many literary devices used to enhance the book.My emotions were like a roller coaster when I read this book. I was happy at the beginning when the main character Malika was adopted by the king, but I was sad and depressed when the details of the imprisonment were given. The conclusion of the book was rather exciting and shocking.Stolen Lives was truly a wonderful book. The thorough account of the experiences brought a sad memory of Malika&#65533;s life back to reality.The ending was very interesting and brought about more positive events for the family."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Wow! If you were feeling sorry for yourself before you started this book, your life is probably looking charmed by the time you finish it.This is the story of a young Morrocan girl taken from her family at the age of 5 to be the companion of the princess. Raised lovingly by the King and sheltered by the luxuries of the royal palace, she still longed for her own family.Reunited with them at the age of seventeen, she enjoyed two years of happiness before her life would change forever. Her real father, a high ranking military official is killed after a failed attempt to assasinate the King. Malika, along with her mother and younger siblings, is immediately imprisoned. Living conditions quickly deteriorate, as does the family's health.The horror that the Oufkir family endured for 20 years is beyond belief.Imagine eating nothing but moldy carrots &amp; chickpeas, and making a rare treat of &quot;french toast&quot; with rotten eggs and moldy bread.Imagine sleeping on a filthy cot with the corpses of rotting mice inside your mattress.Imagine helplessly watching as your mother and siblings physically deteriorate to within inches of their lives.There you have just a sample of what this incrediby courageous family experienced. In their struggle to survive, they emerge with such an appreciation of the simple things in life.You will seriously reevaluate your priorities after reading their story.Their daring escape will leave you holding your breath with anxiety and worry for their safety.Trapped between loyalty for her real father, and remembering her affection for the King who imprisoned her, Malika's spirit and determination will amaze you. My only criticism of the book is that I wish it ended less abruptly. After dreaming of freedom for so long, I would have liked to hear more about the family's experiences when they were released.A thrilling and emotional page-turner, made all the more compelling because it is a true story!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"The story as a whole was very tragic and I felt for the captives but the writing left a little to be desired. An event of this nature is horrible and for it to last that long is mortifying and a reader should be left with that feeling when they are reading it. Yet, the book lost me about half way in. I kept wanting there to be some human element to the story but it was sadly lacking. It was a quick, blow by blow, run down of 20 years of hell. For readers now seeking to understand life in the Middle East this is the wrong book. It does not go into enough detail about why things like this happen. It is not enough to just reveal that they do. I feel that authors have the responsibility to enlighten their readers with a complete image rather than half of one.Overall it was a good book but I was not overly impressed with the writing style or the text."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book is the true story of a woman and her family being sent to jail for 20 years, in subhuman conditions. I was absolutely immersed in this book and, once I finished it, I wanted more! I started hunting through the internet for more news from the past and updates about this family. My heart is still tender for little Abdellatif, who entered prison at age three and never knew anything else and is now scarred emotionally for life (as are all the rest as well, in their different ways). This is a very moving story about survival, about familily ties, and especially about the courageous nature of the human spirit. I definitely reccommend this book, though beware: some parts may be tough to read for sensitive readers! What I found most amazing is that all of this ocurred in my own lifetime."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"The author starts out by telling of her life prior to the arrest and confinement.

It is very harsh and painful. What I liked about this book is the way she tells her personal life story each and every event that occurred and how it affect her family and herself. Those tortures and pain they all went through together, life lessons, and their courage, bravery, all come together to allow us to realize how lucky we are to be living right now. There are many unfortunate people around the world and yet we are all staring at the computer screen reading this commentary I&iexcl;m writing. We are very lucky and should be appreciating what we have and whom we meet. Life is not always as smooth and great as it can be, it is a bumpy road you can&iexcl;t always walk your way through it without tripping or falling. That is what Ms. Oukfir shows us in this book. As a young girl she was being treated like a royal princess not many girls are lucky enough to have been adopted by his royal highness to be his daughters playmate. Those were happy days in her life where she lived royally, but her life began going downhill when all these different issues occurred. She and her family did not just all give up, even thought at times they were almost going to, points where life was not meaningful anymore, or they thought they did not have hope. However, because they had one another they were strong and continued to conquer each obstacle they meet."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I could not put this book down.

This book would appeal to many ages although younger children may not fully grasp the meaning behind this event. Also the main character and champion of this novel is a female there are aspects that will appeal to guys.

Buy it, read it, cradle it, enjoy it!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Despite a few problems with the English translation (odd use of idioms, out-of-date expressions), and despite some 'lacunae', holes in the story which could have been filled in by interesting details, this book ends up being a very good read. The author, Malika, age 18, is taken, in the 1970s, with her mother, four younger siblings and two other women friends, political prisoners in Morocco, and held in unconscionable prison conditions for fifteen, finally twenty years, ending finally during the '90s. This is unfathomable. They never know if anyone remembers them or cares. Yet these childen (the youngest is 3 at the start) together, by telling themselves stories, acting out plays, teaching each other what they know, passing on sustaining bits of news from a small hidden radio when they were put eventually into separate cells, making use of found herbs and weeds for sandwich fillers, ingeniously creating food dishes that are palatable with ingredients they are given that had often gone bad, treating their illnesses and wounds themselves, Malika creating and nightly telling a long, many-peopled story of kings and knights and intrigues, keep themselves alive. --Despite a temporary group despair, once, in which they all decide to commit suicide, and fail. Having faced death, in poor health and weakened, putting aside their fears of punishment, together they decide to live and strategize so cleverly they build a tunnel at night, each early morning hauling out earth and concealing it, painstakingly covering up and plastering the signs of it (ingeniously with plaster made of Tide and the bits of plaster the guards left to seal up the rats' holes which they kept soaked so it wouldn't harden) so the guards won't find it on their daily rounds, and four of them escape for a few days. Formally jet-setting, party-going aristocrats, after their 15 years away from civilization, the four find themselves in a world they barely recognize (television in color?!) and which is shockingly noisy, bright and complicated; when they attempt to get help, they find themselves pariahs; for the most part, old friends are afraid of having anything to do with them; yet they do get the news of their plight to the outside world and hire a lawyer before being recaptured. (Though 'forgotten', they were already famous; the author had been brought up by the king from age 5 to 16 and treated as a Moroccan princess--and therefore, a different kind of prisoner; their father, who was killed in a failed coup, had been the second most powerful man in Morocco.) Due to the resulting publicity, the King allows the rest out with them but only to retain them all for five years more under house arrest -- finally allowing them as much food as they want, and other things we consider necessities,like real beds and bathrooms and the absence of all kinds of vermin in the living quarters, but still guarded and not free. (Their health has never recovered.) -- Where were their friends during this time and why didn't they help free them? Yet even their grandfather could not find them or send them any more books or letters after the first ten years -- no one knew where they were -- he believed rumors that certain ones of them were dead. And Moroccans, living in a repressive monarchy, dared not speak out. Yet, this real story highlights the lack of courage of very many unincarcerated people everywhere, when it comes to standing up for and risking something in the face of injustice -- it was widely known that this family had been incarcerated; people, on the whole, it seems, just want to be left alone to live their own lives. As a trauma therapist, and having read the statements of the co-writer/interviewer, who says that she pushed the author very hard to remember (the excruciating, frightening details), to the point sometimes of exhausting her, the lacunae are understandable -- it is twenty unbroken years of horror to remember, and the main facts get across. Though I still had so many questions, the rest of the story is detailed enough to have kept my interest thoroughly. Some of the relationships of the prisoners to each other are described, their teamwork and dependency on each other, how the usual modesty or separation of child to parent is erased and all have become equal by the end and say pretty much anything to each other; albeit through a complicated, ingenious makeshift telephone system made up of wires and metal bedstead legs which they pass under their walls into the next cells (and which they dismantle and hide between their legs every morning so the guards won't find it. And what of the youngest, the boy who went into jail at age three? Can we imagine the development of this child who can't remember school, friendships, fresh air, running, playing large, physical games? --The others taught him to read and told him stories in prison, even creating a 'football' out of old rags and teaching him the rules of the game and the current players from the radio, but it seems they may have neglected explanations of a cultural/political nature and protected him a bit too much (his sister is shocked to realize when, as new escapees, she sees his reactions in the busy, complicated, strange new world, 'he is an enfant sauvage!'.) This question also arises: what of hundreds and thousands of political prisoners who are held all over the world for years in squalid conditions and die in prison (as these were meant to do) and are forgotten and have no means to escape? What I am left with most profoundly after finishing this story is the utter daily, endless ingenuity put forth by each of these courageous people given virtually no encouragement from anyone but themselves."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Stolen Lives.\\" I can't imagine losing 20 years of life stuck in one prison situation after another and under such harsh conditions. It is hard to visualize man's inhumanity to man. I was somewhat disappointed in the first part of the book. The story seemed to jump from one childhood event to another and back and forth in time periods. After this part the book moves along in a chronological order and has a great deal of detail and emotion. I think the book does a good job portraying the culture of Morocco during that time period as it pertains to the monarchy and social/political standings."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Actually bought this book after reading at a friend's home and wanted to finish as the content was so good.

I will provide report on that book when I finish it, as even though I am retired, reading competes with daily life, home/land chores, financial chores and sewing - my 1st love since I was about 9-10 years old and took in 4H Club to sew my &#34;Collar and Cuff&#34; sets for my uniform and then all through HS and also sewed as my talent for a Miss ___ in my hometown; placed 3rd, as well as a Store Window Display contest at the local County Fair where I also placed 3rd place and was only 14 at the time, so obviously my quilting and sewing and my clothes pin bags, shopping bags and yardstick holder project take priority."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Unbeleivable!

Deprived of liberty and happiness, prisoners waste away most of their lives, confined to a small space devoid of any luxuries.Any prison time would be terrible, but imagine what it would be like to go jail through no fault of your own. And on top of that, imagine what it would be like to be imprisoned based solely on the wrongdoings of another family member and to have this nightmare occur during the prime years of your life (ages 20 to 40). This is the situation that Malika Oufkir finds herself and her family from roughly 1972 to 1994. In this book, \\"Stolen Lives\\" she describes the agony of spending more than two decades either in jail or under house arrest.This book is written by Malika Oufkir and Michele Fitoussi and it covers the young Malika's life preceeding the imprisonment all the way through the mid 1990's, when she was finally released (now in her 40's) and moved to France. The majority of the book centers on the time spent in prison, and it can get very disgusting from time to time. The co- authors talk about the unsanity conditions, the lack of adequate food and drink, the severe lack of medical care, and other agonies associated with serving a prison sentence in the country of Morocco (the Oufkir family's home country).This book has a few suspenseful moments, reaching a climax toward the end when several of the family members escape by building a tunnel and then proceed to Casablanca where they spend several days running from the law. They are finally recaptured, but placed \\"only\\" under house arrest (not as bad as imprisonment, but still not the equivalent of freedom). After a few years, they are released and allowed to leave the country.This book is non- fiction, but it reads like a book of fiction. It's hard to imagine such a contrived situation like this being reality, but it was. The writing of the material, however, doesn't quite measure up to what I expected. I was looking for a more dramatic book, with personal accounts from each surviver and with more suspense and emotion. The authors really don't write the way a fiction expert would, but they at least succeed at keeping one's interest. I did enjoy reading this book, but I would probably have rated it higher if it was a little more personable (not just on the part of Malika, but on the part of the rest of the family as well) and written in a more suspenseful and engaging way. The end of the book (in my opinion, the best part), where they make their escape, is probably the best part of the entire book and one of the few parts that offers a substantial degree of suspense.This book is included in Oprah Winfrey's Book Club, but it's not quite as enjoyable as she makes it out to be. Still, I think the story and the writing are at least worthy of an average rating. It's not a captivating book by any means (like one would expect with a book written about a prison sentence and escape). But it does keep your attention enough to recommend."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This powerful account might have been more acceptable had the trouble been in another time but to think this abuse occurred in recent years is hard to fathom. I read the story via audio tape from Talk Miramax Books. The reader, Edita Brychta, did an excellent job though it was difficult, for a westerner, to follow all the Moroccan names, names that are unfamiliar to our ears. The story is one that should find its way to the screen for it is a story of hope in the face of desperate times. It is a story of power run wild by throwing innocent people into a dirty, desert prison to let them rot away. One might be reminded of the injustice inflicted up Edmund Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas. In this more recent account the captives were held for some 20 years for something to which they were not a party except by family association. It was amazing to appreciate the depths to which people will go to protect their pride. And more amazing to see how, in the most difficult of times, some people find hope. What I found so interesting was that in order to quell the loneliness of the prison, the author of this account developed a story, one with many characters.. and told this continuing story night after night for ten years without the use of paper or pen...all in her mind. Yes, these folks were all eventually free but the road to that freedom was one that would forever mark their lives. It is a book worth reading if for no other reason that it gives insights as to the horrors that exist in the hearts of mankind."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"It's destined to be a classic, with its extremes of wealth andluxury, weakness and excess, contrasted with deprivation, and formidable bravery, tests of character and spiritual strength in the face of barbaric violence.

Malika deserves her fame, herprosperity from a brilliant and bestselling book that has a long shelf life, and the public acknowledgement of a despot's monstrous cruelty.Of course, it goes on. How many other innocent victims of torture and imprisonment are still awaiting...or despairing of...their freedom? God Bless Amnesty International and people like Malika Oukfir, who are willing to lay their lives on the line, because, make no mistake about it, Malika continues to be a hero by her great Story-telling.

This was royalty!I found myself absorbed in the story and how this woman kept her siblings alive by 'telling a story' to them every night for years while being jailed in inhumane conditions.

She became my own personal psychistraist, if you will.I found myself while reading this book and it was a journey I could not have made without GOD and her story. Reading about her suffering caused me to see myself and all the shallowness, I had allowed to take over my life.I admire and applaud Malika Oufkir for many things, but most of all for not being able to walk from one point to another without appreciating the fact that she can. The biggest lesson I believe I learned from this book is what the cliche &quot;LIVE FOR TODAY&quot; truly means. Most people take it to mean that whatever you want, do whatever you want, and say whatever you want, but the Stolen Lives story says to not just appreciate the wants but the needs as well.GOD BLESSTamara"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book opened my eyes to the sheer freedoms that I take for granted each and every day. The fortitude and love that the family members had for each other was the steel of hope that kept them alive throughtout those wasted and stolen years.For anyone who thinks that their lives has no meaning or purpose, this book will remind you of just how precious life really is."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir's Stolen Lives: Twenty Years in A Desert Jail is her autobiography about the time she, her mother, five siblings, and two close family acquaintances spent in Moroccan jails. The entire family was unjustly imprisoned for twenty years after Malika's father, General Mohammad Oufkir, attempted to overthrow the reigning monarch, King Hassan II. In the aftermath of the resulting coup, General Oufkir was assassinated himself and by association his family was imprisoned, as the King was fearful that they too might be an internal threat to his legitimacy. The resulting punishment meant that the Oufkir family was imprisoned against their will for a crime that they did not commit, which was a human rights violation.In writing down her story, Malika Oufkir set out to make the rest of the world aware of what was going on under the Moroccan monarchical regime. After emerging from her years in prison, Malika feared that her unjust case had been unknown the rest of the world. She expressed a desire for others to know and understand her side of the events so that they could react externally and put international pressure upon the Moroccan regime for judicial reform and fairness, as well as a greater tolerance for opposing opinions. In effect, Malika's experiences from both within prison as well as examining her experiences outside it from free and democratic France make her even more attuned to the problems within her native Morocco. She desires that her writing be a catalyst towards reform.It is obviously very difficult for Malika to write down her prison experiences and reveal herself to the world. What makes this book very special is how she is able to convey this sense of insecurity throughout the book. This is done through her looking back upon her experiences as traumatic. Rather than simply graze over the tough issues that her and her family were forced to confront and endure daily in their prison setting, Malika points to them with a sense of hard-headedness and determination that manages to expose herself from the outside. Despite her determination, the reader is brought into her inner world, along with all of the insecurities and vulgarities that haunt her through the present day.Their time in prison was one in which the human spirit prevailed. There was an overarching theme of persistence among the Oufkir family as they lived with the false hope that the King would realize their unjust imprisonment and would quickly release them. As General Oufkir was in the inner circle of Moroccan government, his family had a false impression of that government, believing it was free and open because they were among the few that received extensive benefits from it. Due to their (former) prominent status, the Oufkirs believed that their imprisonment was only temporary and their state influence would help them in securing their release. With this small hope, the Oufkirs held on to a diminishing belief that they would be released. Throughout, their spirit was kept alive by this, and continued to be maintained through years in solitary confinement, and ultimately provoked them to plot their escape from prison and survival in the outside world.Malika's representation of her time in prison brings to the forefront issues that are common throughout the Middle Eastern Muslim world. Repeatedly throughout the region, a ruling monarch who is insecure with his power controls the government, which means that the ruler will do anything in order to hold onto power and stifle all opinion against him. This is precisely what happened with the Oufkirs in Morocco. King Hassan felt that the Oufkirs, even though General Oufkir was the only family member accountable, were a civil challenge to his power and national control; thus he imprisoned them in order to stifle any further political challenges. Hassan II not only imprisoned the Oufkir family, but also several hundred other political prisoners, whose causes are mentioned in the book's postscript. Therefore, the reader comes to realize that political imprisonment is a dominant problem in the Middle East, with the Oufkir case examined in order for the reading audience to understand and reflect on the problem.Malika Oufkir's biography of her imprisonment is poignant. She is able to recount her traumatic life in vivid detail, not only in a pleasing manner to the reader, but also in a way exposing herself to the horrors she encountered throughout her imprisonment. This is exactly what Malika set out to achieve in writing her biography, and she did so in such a clear and eloquent manner. The reader is engrossed in the story to the point that they have little choice than to show empathy for the Oufkir cause and issue a call for greater human rights and justice, not only in Morocco, but in the rest of the Middle East."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir tells us the powerful and tragic story of her life in the book Stolen Lives. She begins the story describing her life as a princess after being adopted by the king of Morocco. She lived an almost unreal life of luxury while at court. The opulence Malika describes is comparable to the time of Marie Antoinette. From the resplendent court, her life is irrevocably altered when her father fails in an assassination attempt and her entire family is placed in prison including her three year old brother.The family's story is extraordinary. Their triumph of spirit is remarkable considering the duration and horrors which they suffered. We see the importance of unity and belief of oneself and each other. We see incredible love and sacrifice. But we also see how imprisonment can degrade the human spirit and affect the psyche.We learn in the preface of the book, how Malika came to hire Michele Fitoussi as the co-author of her book. Throughout the book, the reader cannot help but wonder why. It is a shame that such an interesting and compelling story was so poorly written. The author fails terribly in her attempt to describe herself as a sympathetic person prior to her imprisonment. The continual jumping back and forth in time is confusing and annoying to a reader. I also wondered if perhaps the translation was poor, because of the use of certain words and general lack of eloquence from a person who entertained her family with her stories in their darkest hour.Another book which may interest readers who liked and appreciated Stolen Lives is In the Time of Butterflies by Julia Alvarez. Readers who appreciate stories about the triumph of the human spirit will enjoy Stolen Lives."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I can proudly say that I am NOT a fan of Oprah and am just as disinterested in her book club. However, my wife encouraged me to read this book and I do not regret doing so. This is a wonderful story of perseverance and strength.

You will be left with an everlastingimage of there lives. I shall never forget this book. And I thankMalika for writing this book......."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"When Oprah first choose this book for her book club I didn't think I would like this but after hearing so many raves and taking a closer look at the description I decided to read this. I am still in awe of how this family survived this terrible ordeal and I couldn't put this book down until I found out what would happen next.This book is about the family of General Oufkir in Morocco and is being told by his eldest daughter Malika. Malika was raised in the palace and adopted by King Mohammed as a playmate for Princess Lalla Mina. King Mohammed died suddenly and his son King Hasan became Malika's adopted father. She left the palace to return to her family when she was 17 and by the time she was 19 she was imprisoned along with the rest of her family because her father had staged an unsuccessful coup. We learn of the unbelievable horrendous conditions these people had to live with, they had very little food and the conditions were not sanitary. They were only given Tide to wash up with and had to use salt as toothpaste. Their cells were infested with all kinds of insects, mice and rats but somehow this family found the will to survive it all.This is a story of survival and courage which will totally captivate you. This book is a fast read because its the type of book that made me stay up late to finish while I was yawning at my desk in the morning. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I found this book very touching one would never think that humans could treat one another like that. It is very harsh and painful. What I liked about this book is the way she tells her personal life story each and every event that occurred and how it affect her family and herself. Those tortures and pain they all went through together, life lessons, and their courage, bravery, all come together to allow us to realize how lucky we are to be living right now. There are many unfortunate people around the world and yet we are all staring at the computer screen reading this commentary I&iexcl;m writing. We are very lucky and should be appreciating what we have and whom we meet. Life is not always as smooth and great as it can be, it is a bumpy road you can&iexcl;t always walk your way through it without tripping or falling. That is what Ms. Oukfir shows us in this book. As a young girl she was being treated like a royal princess not many girls are lucky enough to have been adopted by his royal highness to be his daughters playmate. Those were happy days in her life where she lived royally, but her life began going downhill when all these different issues occurred. She and her family did not just all give up, even thought at times they were almost going to, points where life was not meaningful anymore, or they thought they did not have hope. However, because they had one another they were strong and continued to conquer each obstacle they meet."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This audio version of the book really held my attention !It was very well written, and so interesting, due to the precise descriptions of the characters and events.Malika paints a picture with her command of the English language.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"How does one love and hate at the same time? How does one hate and love their country, their ruler? How does one make up for lost time? How does a person live after being imprisoned in horrible conditions for twenty years? Mdme. Oufkir's theme seems to be that it is near impossible. But can one do it? Yes, she is working on it.This book will speak to those who find meaning in the smaller things still: &quot;two lovers holding hands, a mother accompanied by her daughter, a dog frisking about, a bird alighting on a branch.&quot; Do you find that you are still fascinated by &quot;everyday&quot; things? This book might show you why. Are you a slave to your life? Imprisoned by your job and your responsibilities? Reawaken your sense of the world.This book is about courage, but more so about perseverance and reflection. Feel the need to reflect on your life as well as the life of others? Read this book."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"It is true that it is difficult to empathize with Malika as one might empathize with Nelson Mandela. As you've read, she was the daughter of one of King Muhammed V's most trusted generals. As such she was raised as a royal princess under his successor, King Hassan II. This immediately reminded me of the story of Moses and Pharoah from Exodus. She is the primary playmate of the King's daughter and lives a life of luxury.However, justice and punishment are dealt with very differently in this part of the world, and after Malika's father leads an unsuccessful coup/assassination attempt on King Hassan II, she and her family are imprisoned. It is difficult again to empathize - although they knew nothing of the coup, would each of us trust them if we were the target? They complain of being deprived of luxuries which most of us can only dream about.As they eventually are moved to barracks which are terribly conditioned, totally dark, and are basically marooned there, it becomes obvious to them they are to die there. Despite an escape and recapture, five years later they are freed. Malika achieves ultimate redemption when she is freed, and now lives in France, which had a colony in Morocco for some time.The parallel with Exodus is not perfect, to be sure. However, the 'princess' once expelled, finds herself in her journey through a considerably harsher wilderness and eventually does succeed, along with her family, in reaching their goal of freedom.This book will make you think. Most interestingly, you will realize after noticing that you didn't empathize as much with them as others in their situation, that you may think differently about yourself! After all, does anyone deserve that type of treatment?As you read this book and through periodic reality checks remember that it is true, you will realize that man's inhumanity to man has no end. You will also realize, as I believe Oprah did, that the spirit can overcome virtually anything.This book is not that expensive and I would recommend anyone with even a passing interest read it. It will be worth your while."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book was one of the most poorly written books I have read in a long time. I am still struck by the contradicting information given. Although I do not doubt that this woman and her family may have gone through some oppressive and victimizing experiences, I found myself re-reading and re-reading to verify the contradictions throughout the text. For example, the author stated that they were isolated and did not have contact with the outside world but would state time and time again examples of letters exchanged with family members and friends, on one page the author lost all of her hair from illness and on the next page her hair was at waist length, on another page examples of lack of medical care and on another talk of prescription medications taken, and on one page descriptions of personal items that were confiscated and on the next page the precious items would reappear. I am still amazed and skeptical of the radio that runs on batteries that never seem to run out out of juice in twenty years. I would like to think that the work was poorly written instead of calling the author a liar. However, this oppinion began after completing one third of the book and although I am over half way finished I am struggling to finish it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"didn't finish it because it lost my interest with the way it was written..............poor writing and confusing..........will give it away"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I read this book for bookclub after hearing from many people how \\"wonderful\\" and \\"inspiring\\" it was. Now after just having finished it and knowing that I would be discussing it tonight, I was really concerned. What was wrong with me that the book annoyed me and seemed to me to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever managed to finish. It contained constant contradictions that caused me to begin to question the truth of everything else that was said. The complete disregard Malika showed for the plight of the two retainers who joined her family in prison leads me to see her as a selfish, self-entitled woman. And, did you know that she was the hero of everything? Her family wouldn't have survived without her - according to her. The book might have been better with a more skillful writer, but as it is, it doesn't measure up to the dramatic subject matter. I'm glad I read the reviews here to see that, at least I'm not the only one who feels this way."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Malika Oufkir was born in Morocco in 1953 in a powerful family who had close relations with the King. When she was 5, the King adopted her so that she could grow up as a companion to his daughter, Lalla Mina. She grew up in the palace with her and had the best of everything. The king was also very find of her and she considered him her second father. But over time she started feeling lonely. So one day she asked the King permission to go home. The King reluctantly said yes. The next few years were spent with her own family, with her mom who was a very fashionable lady and who was fond of all good things in life, her father who was climbing the success ladder very quickly and her siblings.But when she was 19, there were political unrest's in the country, there was growing unrest among the people against the King. Amongst this chaos, her father was arrested and executed and her entire family- her mother, her 3 younger sisters and 2 younger brothers were arrested and sent into an isolated dessert goal. The youngest boy was only 4 years old then. The Oufkir family spend the nest 20 years of their life in prison and house arrest.Stolen Lives was so difficult to read. Just imagine those kids growing up in prison, never experiencing normal things and emotions. My heart goes out to the youngest though, Abdellatif. He spent his entire childhood and teenage years in prison. When he was 8, he tried to kill himself. My heart nearly broke when I read that.Somehow he'd imagined, in his little mind that was too mature for his years, that killing himself would be the best way to get us all out of this mess. He didn't want to see us suffer anymore. From that day on, we vowed to spare him. We wouldn't talk in front of him any more, we'd hide our grief from him, we'd invent a fantasy life for him and we'd get him to believe in it.The Oufkir family escaped by digging a tunnel through the prison, another example of how their minds were shaped with intellect even after so many years in prison. If they wouldn't have escaped, they would still be in prison.Stolen lives is not just a story of survival, but that of surviving without loosing dignity. I first saw this book on Amazon while random browsing. So when I saw this in Srilanka I immediately picked it up. But when I saw the seal of \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" on the cover, I had second thoughts. I'm so glad I bought it though.I have immense respect for Malika and her mother for going through what they did. Malika especially, who almost bought up the kids in prison, who made up history, geography and Math lessons for the kids so that they don't grow up uneducated, who along with the others help directed plays and made the kids act in it to break monotony and stop depression from creeping in.I really hope you give this book a chance even if you don't read a lot of memoirs.

She is about the bravest woman I have ever read about who was imprisoned; I know if it was me I would have given up a long time ago and died. Her strength and courage was God's gift.The Moroccan King was revengeful and very cruel; punishing Malika and her family for something that they knew nothing about at the time and had nothing to do with.

I was turning the pages trying to find out what would happen in the end.The first of the book is bittersweet, but has many moments of joy. The second half, however, is a terrible account of incarceration in some of the worst conditions possible.I really liked this book because the story telling kept my interest. The main character of the novel is my only complaint. I know this is her story, but sometimes she seemed like she was telling a story of how she saved her family almost totally by herself. This part seemed a bit contrived since there was eight of them in jail. I think another reviewer said they would have liked to hear more about the siblings and their contributions. I think this is what I might have wanted as well, but seeing this was Malika's telling of the story, I assume she was answering for herself and what she was thinking.Aside from the fact, I found the story very Malika centered at times although there were eight in jail, I can definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Stolen Lives. The ordeal Malika Oufkir and her family suffered is astonishing. It really pained me to read through her true accounts of riches to less-than-rags.

The king of Morocco adopted her at age five, where she was to be raised with his daughter, the princess. Here she also lived in a luxurious palace, ate the finest foods and played with the best toys. It was only a few years later that her father was to participate in an attempt to assassinate the King and in result was captured and executed. The Oufkir family was also punished. The mother and five children, including Malika, were sent to an abandoned fort and desert prison to be imprisoned for twenty years. The only way her family was to survive was by will power, which is what they did. The descriptions of their lives in the confining walls of an almost unimaginable prison cell were breathtaking. For almost a decade they did not feel sunlight or taste any food that was appropriate to eat. At the mere age of three, the youngest brother of the Oufkir family tried to commit suicide. Malika's story was an unforgettable account of a woman who had a will to live her life and see her family do so as well. One can only imagine how millions of others' lives have been stolen and their stories not told. Stolen Lives is an attempt to do just that, Malika's stolen life should be read by all."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a book that on its face held a lot of promise. Any story in which a mother and her children, as well as faithful family retainers, are unjustly imprisoned in squalid conditions for twenty years for an ostensible crime committed by the familial patriarch would certainly be of interest. Wrong! This is a tepid and disappointing book, poorly written and, most certainly, poorly edited. It is so filled with contradictions and inconsistencies, as to create somewhat of a credibility gap for the reader.The story revolves around the Oufkir family, who were, at one time, a prominent, highly respected, and well known Moroccan family. Their story is told by Malika Oufkir, who is the eldest daughter of the late General Oufkir, who was executed in August 1972, immediately following an aborted attempt to assassinate King Hassan II of Morocco, for whom he was the Minister of Defense. General's Oufkir's treasonous action was the catalyst for the tragic turn of events that were to engulf his family.After the aborted coup, the General's immediate family was placed under house arrest and four months later, along with two loyal family retainers who volunteered to share their fate, were whisked away to the first of several desert prisons that were to house them for the next fifteen years.As Malika tells it, hers was initially almost a fairy tale story. Brought up in luxurious surroundings, she suffered early heartbreak when, at the age of five, she was separated from her family and \\"adopted\\" by then King Muhammad V, so as to be a live in playmate for the King's daughter. This adoption is never really explained, and one has no idea what her parents' thoughts were on this issue. Malika lived in the Palace in the lap of luxury for many years. As a teenager, however, she moved back with her family, where, there, too, she continued to live a very privileged life, steeped in luxury and money.After the Oufkirs' circumstances changed, theirs is truly a tragic story. There is little doubt that the conditions in their desert prisons were deplorable and squalid. With inadequate sanitation, insufficient food, no medical care, or educational provisions, the family was truly living a life of privation. Cutoff from the outside world, as they were, they truly were disenfranchised.Their escape from their last desert prison, an escape that brought their plight to the consciousness of the public, was amazing. But for their escape, there is no doubt in my mind that they would still be languishing in a desert prison today, barely alive, if not already dead. I salute their determination and ingenuity in making a desperate break for freedom.The problem lies in the telling of the story, which is so poorly told. Many things are left unexplained. No effort is made to ground the events that led to their family's downfall in a historical context. Whatever Malika said seems to have been what went into the final draft of this book, even if she contradicted herself a page or two later, which is the main problem with the book. There are so many inconsistencies with what Malika herself says, that the discerning reader is left to question much of what she represents.Malika comes across as a somewhat self-absorbed, vapid woman to whom fate dealt a harsh and unusually cruel hand. Her self absorption is most evident in that she barely acknowledges the sacrifice of the two faithful family retainers, who voluntarily shared their fate, nor does she discuss the impact that this had on them. It is also a little disconcerting that more does not come through about the perceptions the other family members had about this hellish experience. Their insight might have provided a little more balance and interest to the narrative. In the hands of a good writer and and excellent editor, this book might have withstood scrutiny and met expectations.Sorry, Oprah, your book club selections are usually excellent. This one fails to make the grade."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I have not done any research to verify if the information in this book is accurate or not.

Her family was being punished for the political actions of her father.Malika is an excellent story teller and has lives on the inside of the royal family in Morocco so it is very interesting to hear details of her upbringing.It is extraordinary to hear of the atrocious jail conditions inflicted on this family that was used to such a lavish existence.

It is an incredible story of perserverance. It is also heart-wrenching and inspirational at the same time."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"READ IT NOW! Once you start this book, you won't want to put it down until finished.Malika Oufkir's first five years were spent with her loving family. The next several years of her life were spent with her adoptive royal family. The King of Morocco wanted a live-in friend for his own daughter, therefore the adoption of Malika was arranged. When Malika was a teen-ager she was allowed to return to her family where she enjoyed being with those she loved. Shortly thereafter, in 1972, her father was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the king. As if guilty by association, Malika, now 18 hears old, her mother, brothers, sisters, and two compatriots were exiled and spent the next 20 years in various prisons.The background leading up to the exile of Malika, her family, and friends was indeed informative and educational. One staggering event in this story is that even though the parents agreed to the king's adoption of their five-year-old daughter solely for the purpose of providing a friend and playmate for the king's own child, there really was no choice in the matter. In other words, the king rules. Frightening is the fact is that the guilt by association exile and imprisonment of these people started not that long ago, in 1972.Briefly, as a teen-ager with her family, Malika did enjoy an exciting and fun-filled time. For example, she liked to dress in the most hip styles of the time, sneak out of the house at night and head for a local night club for an evening of dancing, etc.The meat of the story, however, begins with the exile. Living under horrendous conditions, which included lack of sanitation, lack of adequate food, lack of normal communication, this family persevered. Malika played a primary role in maintaining a will, not only to live and rise above their humiliation, but to escape their confines.Beginning their confinement, the youngest was only three. He grew up in prison. All of the family was concerned for him because he had no awareness of normal life. Through Malika's day to day, continued story telling, he learned much. Everyone looked forward to the story, which provided needed entertainment and a special camaraderie for these prisoners. It kind of reminded me of the \\"Arabian Nights\\", with a twist.Confinement to separate cells constituted part of their prison time. This was a clever family, though, and being separated inspired creative ways to stay in touch.Eventually a plan to escape materializes from the minds of these incarcerated innocents.You, now, must read this story to see what happens..."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This was a great true story and it is amazing how the family finally did get out of the hell that they were condemn to.

I think what I found so interesting is that I never even known about this until I read the book! I don't remember anything on the news about this at all, when they were released in the 90s. Malika's story of bravery is incredible and almost too hard to even imagine such a transition (princess to prisoner)My only wish was that there was more about Malika's life after prison and with her family.

Fitoussi writes a beautiful foreword to introduce the book and, of course, Oufkir describes so eloquently and in such incredible detail her life before imprisonment and her (and her family's) experience(s) in prison.I was completely enraptured by her story and so incredibly impressed with her vivid recollection of seemingly every detail and of her poignant words chosen to tell her story.The incorrect grammar from time to time, to me, only serves to reinforce the authenticity of her story and, as stated by Fitoussi in her foreword, the integrity of Oufkir's words - to change a single word translated by Oufkir would only serve to sacrifice Oufkir's story as she recalls it or not honor her intentions.I highly recommend this book - it provides a stimulating education of Morrocan culture and customs and a heart-wrenching description of a family's horrible ordeal. One can not help but feel tremendous emphathy for them."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is one of the most harrowing stories I have ever read. It is usually the type of true life story that many will say they find hard to believe. But I believe it to the core...some of the details are so horrific that there is no way anyone would even want to make it up. I almost wished that I didn't read it because I don't want to believe that someone who is King of a such a beautiful country would treat children (that he knew and loved) in such a horrific way. In reading the reviews I am not sure if many of the readers are aware that the book was translated from French to English and that translations even under the best of circumstances are very to hard to convey to the reader,i.e. the original intent. Also because Morocco is so close to France, I'm sure that the average French person is very familiar with the political situation in that country which is why the authors did not concentrate on the political aspects of Morocco. Perhaps the writers did not know they were going to write for an international audience, which is often the case. Regardless, this book is the Grimmest fairy tale that you will ever read!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I loved this book. I agree that it wasn't the best writing, and it was somewhat confusing at times because the story jumped around abit. But, nonetheless it was an EXCELLENT book. And the details of her life were so graphicly expressed. I read this for a bookclub and I'm glad I had the priviledge witnessing the story of her life.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I have put off reading this book for years because I just do not want to read another depressing story about miscarriage of justice and suppression of the people. I bought it this summer while on vacation since I am in the midst of collecting all of Oprah's past and present selections. I just picked it up two days ago and haven't been able to put it down.At first, Malika's story seems to be centered on pretty dresses, jewelry and the royal life as an adopted princess. She was adored and never wanted for anything. Eldest daughter of General Outfir and his wife, Malika grew up among royalty. That all came crashing down when her father is assissinated for planning a coup to overthrow King Hassan of Morrocco. Malika and her brothers and sisters and mother spent the next twenty years in jail.The tone of Malika's voice as she tells her story through the writer changes over the course of the years. She remembers her childhood fondly and sometimes with despair. She remembers her years of prison as a torture but yet a challenge. She recites their heady days of freedom as overwhelming and joyful. She tells of her sadness and bitterness that she has wasted her youth in prison and never knowing love or having a baby and her fears of never knowing anything other than despair and gloom. This is an honest and sometimes brutual look into herself and her years in captivity.It is not a depressing book. It is a gripping tale of how one woman and her family survive the ordeal and how they re-entered society after twenty years of being out of it. It is an insight to a life that most readers will never be privy to (fortunately!) and it takes tremendous courage to recite those years of sorrow to make it real to us readers.If you're looking for a book that shows another depth to the unfailing human spirit, this book is it. Malika is an ordinary woman caught up in the whirlwind of a royal society and made to pay for her father's sins. She survived ~~ and with courage and beauty that I'd never imagine possessing.8-16-04"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Some of you may have seen this woman on Oprah a few years back telling of her ordeal. I put off reading this book & had come to the conclusion that I didn't want to read a depressing nightmare of being locked in a remote prison for decades. Then along came a friend of a friend, who encouraged me to read it, that I \\"needed\\" to read it.This book, to me, was life-changing. As I recognize how spoiled us Americans truly are, nothing could've prepared me for this family's struggles.Malika & her family displayed such amazing gifts of courage & strength that I was blown away. In awe and humbled. Their \\"tale\\" was almost just that: a tale. I simply cannot fathom the conditions that these poor people survived in.As I was continuously mesmerized by their strength during their imprisonment, I was later caught in Malika's greatest feat of all: forgiveness. This woman showed me what a powerful thing it truly is. She forgave with such grace & eloquence that I was just speechless. I speak mainly of her due to the fact that she was \\"adopted\\" by the royal family as a child & later cast out in a most horrifying way. As us readers were not given as much detail of her siblings (especially after their release), I can make no assumptions for them. Nevertheless, this family as a whole is an unwavering symbol of love, strength, & survival.I hope that they are doing well now & thank each one of them for their story.I hope that I never forget it, for it is a daily reminder of what I have in this life with my freedom & my family."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"At first the story seemed a bit blah to me - her first 'imprisonment' was in the royal palace. Although she dearly missed her parents, she was treated like a princess and as if she was the king's own daughter. It was very interesting to see how the Moroccan royalty lived.Later in the book, she was placed under house arrest with her family in a series of guarded homes. However it seemed that she was still living a better life than many of the country's poor (all the food and water they wanted, plus all their belongings - designer clothing, jewelry, etc. - were still in their possession). It is not until later in the book that the Oufkir family is transferred to a deplorable prison which seemed to me like a concentration camp. There, they spent many years and became like so many other political prisoners &quot;the forgotten.&quot;Ms. Oufkir has an uncanny ability to remember the most minute details of her life and does an excellent job of relating the relationships between herself and her family members as well as describing her thoughts and feelings throughout their imprisonment. Like some other reviewers, I too believe the writing was a bit weak at times (the only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5), but perhaps that is because the story was translated into English.I do recommend this book - it is a 'heavy' read though and can be quite stressful at times."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"\\"Stolen Lives\\" is Malika Oufkir's personal account of her life as an adopted daughter of the king of Morocco, then later a political prisoner in Morocco as she and her family paid for the sins of their father.It was interesting to learn about the traditions in Morocco. It's amazing that she was basically just taken away from her parents at a young age in order to become an adopted daughter of the king, since he had a daughter the same as as Malika and the daughter needed a playmate. Malika gives an interesting account of the ways of the court- the traditions, the festivals, the reverence paid to the king and the concubines. As a child, she never had a normal life- she was essentially a prisoner inside the court. I would have liked to have read more vivid and detailed accounts of the court- not gossipy, just from a cultural standpoint. I had a hard time picturing many of the scenes she described due to vagueness.After her father, a revered military man, was executed after leading a coup against the king, he was executed and the family sent into exile, even though the family had nothing to do with the coup. The conditions were incomprehensibly inhumane. I'm amazed that Malika is able to talk about it so freely, for she even admits she's haunted by the demons. It's difficult to even empathize despite her account, for I've never experienced anything like she went through. It's a story that sounds more like 15th century Europe than 20th century Morocco. Her youngest brother was only 3 when they were imprisoned. She describes how amazed he was with the world when a few of them were able to escape. For instance, he finds something hard on the ground but didn't know what it was- it was simply asphalt.I was shocked that I had never heard of her story, and I am upset that the US media has not focused more on political prisoners such as Malika and her family. No, I'm not a card-carrying member of Amnesty International or anything, but it is important to bring stories such as Malika's to light. As her story reveals (but without going into too much detail), when the international media learns of their plight, circumstances change.Malika is very forthright with her opinions and emotions. She describes how her feelings towards the king were so mixed with the love of a daughter towards her father and with the hatred of the wrongly imprisoned towards the captor. Her whole view of the world has changed, and yet a lot of her original opinions never changed.I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"After reading another review of this book I felt compeled to add my review. This book doesn't have contradictions as another reviewer has suggested. The conditions of this family's incarceration were constantly changing and in fact some &quot;contradictions&quot; are addressed in the book if you read closely. Letters were first allowed and then disallowed. They were allowed medicines at first and also in the end however for the majority of their prison term medicines were not supplied. This book was written exactly how a story would be conveyed to another person. The story follows a basic timeline but is not entirely contained to that timeline. This book attempts to compress 25 years of facts, thoughts and feelings into a book and does a fairly good job. The story is remarkable but more impressive to me is the family dynamics that evolved during their time in prison. The book is easy to read and only took me several days to finish. Perhaps some of the confusion over the book is due to the length of time you have to read the entire text. It was for me my first book addressing human rights and was indeed an eye opener. It is at the same time a tale of horror and survival due to strong family support."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I saw an interview with Malika Oufkir on Oprah Winfrey's show and was so taken by her courage, her incredible spiritual strength and the unbelievable horror of her tale, that I felt I had to know more. I found this version to be an inspiring testimony to the human spirit but also an honest account of the terrible toll of this family's ordeal, leaving one brother &quot;a permanent child&quot; in Malika's own words, a brother who found adjusting to a normal, free life nearly impossible and who is still suffering the effects of his imprisonment.For their part, Oufkir and her sisters were left suspicious of men, emotionally scarred by what they survived...and yet they also managed to find the strength to serve as witnesses to their injustice and to find the courage to speak out. This is one of the most inspiring true-life accounts I've read in the last year and one I'd put on any &quot;must read&quot; list. If you dont know the details of Oufkir's story, here's a brief summary: At the age of 5, Malika Oufkir, eldest daughter of General Oufkir, was adopted by King Muhammad V of Morocco, a man who wanted an available playmate for his young daughter. While in the palace, Oufkir led a life of a fairy princess, in total luxury --- until her father was found guilty of treason as part of a coup to overthrow the new regime (led by King Hassan II). Malika's father was executed and she, her mother and her brother and sisters were immediately imprisoned. From one day to the next, Oufkir went from luxury to a struggle for her very existence, living in conditions that you can't believe until you read about it. There were times when one or the other would try and commit suicide (her brother when he was only 7) or be forced to eat food drenched in rat urine. And yet they DID persevere and manage to escape to tell their tale. Please don't assume that the grim details in this book (and I won't pull any punches; there are parts of this book that are difficult to read0 take away from the inspiration to be found here. After finishing this book, I actually felt uplifted and was amazed that I did, buoyed by the fact that this family went through such horror and yet managed to find the courage to survive - and then to tell about it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Words cannot express the depth of admiration and awe I felt as I read this stirring and detailed account so richly shared with us by Malika Oufkir. It was a great privilege to learn so much from their tragic experience and yet triumphant outcome over such unjust mistreatment. And yet another triumph in writing it so that we could all be enriched and reminded of what strength in character and family can mean. I'll never forget this book."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I can see why this book is being peddled to a western audience. We in a democracy are more likely to be outraged at an entire family being held responsible for the actions of one member. In other parts of the world, a family like Oufkir benefited from the father's proximity to power, and was brought down with the father. It is not clear what Oufkir's father did, besides the attempt at assasination of the king, but I feel like that information is necessary to understand this story, yet Malika does not provide it. I don't find this story terribly credible. There are too many contradictions (in one sentence she says they got to spend time out in a court yard together all day, and in the same paragraph she says family members only saw each other by reflection of water in a shared gutter. Elsewhere she claims she and her brother seduced two people on a train to help them in their escape; this after saying her brother had only three teeth in a swollen mouth full of abcesses and that she herself was so swollen from malnutrition that she could barely fit through the escape tunnel, and that they were dressed in years-old rags...). Malika's incredible self-aggradizement throughout the book makes me wonder if she doesn't suffer from some type of mental disorder. Malika does acknowleged and understand that, despite her over-the-top privilege, she was just as imprisoned in her first 18 years of life as she was in the second half, but notice she only considers the second half that she supposedly spent in prison as &quot;stolen.&quot; She doesn't seem to have much of a problem with the ridiculuous level of wealth and privilege she had in the first 18 years in spite of the general poverty the rest of her countrymen were living in at the time. I found this book poorly written and an insult to rational minds everywhere."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a story of unbelievable punishment administered by the powerful King and Queen of Morocco against a young family (including children) written by courageous escapee, Malika Oufkir. The book highlights the tragedies that can occur when an outmoded, archaic, leadership structure rejects modern principles like fair trials, justice, or morality.In the beginning of the book, the lonely Princess Lalla Mina needs a companion, so the King plucks the author from her family, and presents her as a \\"gift\\" to the Royal Princess. The author then describes her pampered lifestyle of decadence and excess while living in the Royal Palaces of Morocco. Through the author's eyes, we explore the world of a Royal girl, where the Princess values horses more than people. We are taken to see harems, where Queens and concubines bathe naked for the King. The girls were educated by a private German tutor, followed later by private French schools. This puzzled us: doesn't Morocco have a school system?After the author's father, General Oufkir, fails in plotting a coup d'etat, the Oufkir family become outcasts and prisoners of the state. For twenty years, the prisoners are cooped up in desert jail cells riddled with diseased rat packs, slithering snakes, venomous spiders, and hungry scorpions. The book is simply written, without fanfare or extravagant language, but cuts to the true, often horrifying facts: Malika's innocent little brother was jailed at age three, then released at aged twenty-three.After the heroic family escapes by digging an underground tunnel, Royal Princess Lalla Mina and Prince Sidi Mohammed try to befriend Malika Oufkir, in a \\"just like 'ole times\\" fashion. This made us wonder: If the Royals were such good buddies, why didn't they rescue Malika Oufkir from jail when she needed their friendship the most? These Royals certainly had the power and influence to have had them released from prison...AT ONCE!As soon as Ms. Oufkir succeeds in her dramatic escape, she hires a French attorney to defend her human rights. That was a smart thing to do but, this made us wonder: are there no Moroccan lawyers that can be trusted? At this point, Malika forsakes her Muslim religion and thinks about becoming a Catholic.We felt completely heartbroken after finishing this tragic story. The outmoded Royal Family who represent the important nation of Morocco, have surely disgraced their country and it's people."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"As an American woman who lived in Morocco for five years, as both a Peace Corps Volunteer and then as a private citizen, I found this book to be at first interesting but ultimately deeply unsatisfying. STOLEN LIVES tells the story of Malika Oufkir, daughter of strongman General Oufkir, righthand man of King Hassan II of Morocco. Starting life as a pampered girl who is virtually adopted by the King and lives in the palace as a companion for his young sister, she ends up a political prisoner, who along with her family and two servants is imprisoned for almost twenty years in increasingly deplorable conditions. Eventually, she and her family make a dramatic escape and well.. the rest is an Oprah-esque happy ending. Though I enjoyed the voyeuristic look into the Moroccan royal palace, and was kept interested in the increasingly harsh conditions in the infamous Moroccan prison Bir Jdid, ultimately I found this book to be incredibly implausible and deeply unsatisfying. It is certainly true that there were significant human rights violations occurring in Morocco during the time that this book describes-- it is also plausible that the Oufkir family did endure some of the harsh conditions described in the book. To me, however, the story of their escape was flat-out unbelievable. I also felt frustrated by the fact that the story does nothing to illuminate the complex situation in a country where a tiny elite rides from palace to palace in chauffeur driven limousines while the vast majority of the population live in dire poverty. I am sorry that this book will probably be widely read, as it paints a picture of this complex and fascinating country that is lopsided, sensationalistic, and laced with untruths."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I let someone borrow my hard cover version and sadly, they have never returned it - so I was happy to purchase another copy at such a great price.

Thank you so much for this book."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I'll start with the mugshots. Contrary to what one would expect having read the book, nobody is bald, nobody looks like death, all the women are wearing makeup, most of them are smiling and Abdellatif is glowing with health. Is it Fatima or Halima who was imprisoned with them? In the mugshots it says Fatima, in the text it says Halima. That is a huge mistake to make. The original section that describes who went is confusing so I have no idea. This aspect of the book drove me nuts. The writing is poor, very confusing. MANY contradictions (as has been written many times by other reviewers) made it difficult to believe anything fully. One minute they have nothing and the next the kid is riding around on a bicycle (during yet another family member's attempted suicide - nobody succeeds, btw). They are starving and the sister is getting fat, so Malika makes her exercise, etc, etc, etc. Then there is the loaves and fishes radio, which was a chronic source of suspicion. Let me put it this way, I wanted to read and finish the book but the fact that Malika was so self-centered (the hero of every scene) made caring difficult. She protested ten times too many that she was an innocent virgin despite having been a spoiled party animal. It's simply obvious that she is hiding things. I guess I had a hard time feeling sorry for Malika for numerous reasons and I think Fitoussi did a poor job of putting the pieces together. I don't know what to make of the book other than I'm not sorry I read it."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I read 55 pages & found myself unable to \\"gel\\" with the main character or any of the characters.

Since I was unfamiliar with the history of the coupe, I was left wondering why the General would take action without taking steps to protect his family? Certainly he had the assets to do so."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This book, a true story written by a now adult woman who was jailed as a young woman, is not recommended. The family seems to accept the politics of their country when it provides them with wealth, comforts, and power. It's difficult to feel sympathy when they are suddenly on the flip side of their politics and jailed-mainly I believe because the story is so poorly written. It never engages you or draws you into the story, so sympathy for the \\"characters\\" never develops. Undoubtedly a very powerful story but this book doesn't do it or their cause justice.

The pain and horror that the children and the adults endured had no end in sight. Yet something in them held on and found a way to find small amounts of joy in this concentration camp like prison.

This is a book that will fill your soul with wonder, the wonder of how good can triumph in such evil circumstances and wonder at the human soul for thrusting such evil upon children and adults. There is no answer and to say life is unfair doesn't explain this story.

Too bad for the interested reader that this book does not do the horror, injustice, and the family's strength and determination justice! &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; is a vapid, childish attempt to elicit tears from sentimental and superficially activist American women. It's so easy to imagine this story as a starting point for an interesting account of the social and political environment in Morocco. Where are the intelligent editors who can take a fascinating personal story and turn it into a book that can provide the reader with a thought-provoking learning process instead of a late-night tear-jerker?"},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"This is a book that on its face held a lot of promise. Any story in which a mother and her children, as well as faithful family retainers, are unjustly imprisoned in squalid conditions for twenty years for an ostensible crime committed by the familial patriarch would certainly be of interest. Wrong! This is a tepid and disappointing book, poorly written and, most certainly, poorly edited. It is so filled with contradictions and inconsistencies, as to create somewhat of a credibility gap for the reader.The story revolves around the Oufkir family, who were, at one time, a prominent, highly respected, and well known Moroccan family. Their story is told by Malika Oufkir, who is the eldest daughter of the late General Oufkir, who was executed in August 1972, immediately following an aborted attempt to assassinate King Hassan II of Morocco, for whom he was the Minister of Defense. General's Oufkir's treasonous action was the catalyst for the tragic turn of events that were to engulf his family.After the aborted coup, the General's immediate family was placed under house arrest and four months later, along with two loyal family retainers who volunteered to share their fate, were whisked away to the first of several desert prisons that were to house them for the next fifteen years.As Malika tells it, hers was initially almost a fairy tale story. Brought up in luxurious surroundings, she suffered early heartbreak when, at the age of five, she was separated from her family and \\"adopted\\" by then King Muhammad V, so as to be a live in playmate for the King's daughter. This adoption is never really explained, and one has no idea what her parents thoughts were on this issue. Malika lived in the Palace in the lap of luxury for many years. As a teenager, however, she moved back with her family, where, there too, she continued to live a very privileged life, steeped in luxury and money.After the Oufkirs' circumstances changed, theirs is truly a tragic story. There is little doubt that the conditions in their desert prisons were deplorable and squalid. With inadequate sanitation, insufficient food, no medical care, or educational provisions, the family was truly living a life of privation. Cutoff from the outside world, as they were, they truly were disenfranchised.Their escape from their last desert prison, an escape which brought their plight to the consciousness of the public, was amazing. But for their escape, there is no doubt in my mind that they would still be languishing in a desert prison today, barely alive, if not already dead. I salute their determination and ingenuity in making a desperate break for freedom.The problem lies in the telling of the story, which is so poorly told. Many things are left unexplained. No effort is made to ground the events that led to their family's downfall in a historical context. Whatever Malika said seems to have been what went into the final draft of this book, even if she contradicted herself a page or two later, which is the main problem with the book. There are so many inconsistencies with what Malika herself says, that the discerning reader is left to question much of what she represents.Malika comes across as a somewhat self-absorbed, vapid woman to whom fate dealt a harsh and unusually cruel hand. Her self-absorption is most evident in that she barely acknowledges the sacrifice of the two faithful family retainers, who voluntarily shared their fate, nor does she discuss the impact that this had on them. It is also a little disconcerting that more does not come through about the perceptions the other family members had about this hellish experience. Their insight might have provided a little more balance and interest to the narrative. In the hands of a good writer and excellent editor, this book might have withstood scrutiny and met expectations.Sorry, Oprah, your book club selections are usually excellent. This one fails to make the grade."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"I waited with anticipation for the book to arrive and have to say that it was worth the wait.

How ugly and awful that this story -- hard, cruel and unforgiving -- had to be true. Even more awful is that a man once existed who felt it was his God-given right to torture whom he pleased. It is disgusting -- nearly bordering on demented -- that in the 20th century, these shameful and horrific crimes were allowed to exist against a young mother, her six children and two relatives, for 20 years and that very little, if anything at all, was done to right the wrongs.In &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; you will see what being at the depths of despiar REALLY means and you will suddenly count your blessings, look around you at your abundance of simple riches and pray that you will never experience what Ms. Oukir and her family did.For every person who thought their life couldn't get any worse - I ask you to read this book."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"Oufkir was the eldest daughter of the King of Morocco's closest aide: she was adopted by him and raised to be a companion to his daughter.

She was able to educate the children in the group and help her family through the terrrible hardships they endured. Without her they would not have survived more than a few years. This book will open your eyes to just what foreign countries are capable of doing. If you enjoyed this book, I think you will like 'Sing Me A Bawdy Song' by Noema Ayers. It is the story of a family living in Los Angeles during the 30's and 40's. It is full of historical facts and GOOD old-time songs. Since it is 60% true, it will kkeep you asking 'Did this really happen?' and 'Was that true?' It is easy and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"STOLEN LIVES","review":"The premise of this book is fascinating, however, that's where it ends. Tragic though the story may be - it is poorly written, choppy in delivery and lacking in evidence of mastery of the craft of writing by the author.

Like this. And choppy and dry. The sentences were short. The style was off-putting.

Sonia and Henri, a married couple with a small child, are relaxing after putting their recalcitrant son to bed. Suddenly, Ines and Hubert, guests whom they had expected the following evening, arrive for dinner, which, in this emergency, turns out to be &quot;chocolate fingers&quot; and &quot;crisps.&quot; Henri is an astrophysicist who has devoted three years to a research project which is about to be published, and Hubert tells him that night that another researcher may have beaten him to the publisher. Hubert, also an astrophysicist, may be able to help Henri professionally.In each of the three acts, which replay this scenario, one or more characters changes, dramatically affecting the dynamics of the group and the outcome of the evening. In Act I, Sonia is rigid and assertive, while Henri is the opposite, wanting to placate both their screaming son and Hubert, who can help him professionally. In Act II, sexual politics becomes a focus, with Hubert and Sonia agreeing to an assignation, until Hubert's self-promotion and condescension, combined with intemperate remarks by Ines, bring the evening to a disastrous close. In Act III, everyone is more relaxed and is conversing about &quot;unity theory.&quot; Both couples are patient with the child upstairs, Henri has more confidence, he is sanguine about the research of the other scientist, and Hubert, while insensitive in his relationships, is not a complete dolt.As astrophysicists, both Henri and Hubert have been studying &quot;unity theory,&quot; a theory connecting the fundamental forces of the universe and explaining interactions, and the author illustrates this visually through the action on stage. Like the four fundamental forces of nature, we have four characters, some weak and some strong, operating independently on some levels while interrelating on others. As we see from the different outcomes in the three acts, minor changes or glitches, even random ones, can affect relationships, future directions, and the whole concept of &quot;unity.&quot; The characters are quite different in personality in each of the acts, not really unified as personalities, illustrating dramatically Hubert's observation about the gap between &quot;reality and representation,&quot; and between &quot;object and word.&quot; Though the conceit is clever, the play stands as a sparkling, light comedy of relationships on its own--familiarity with science is not a prerequisite to its enjoyment.

The man is smart. And I like his wife's music.But let's return to Reza. She was already a famous playwright in France, otherwise the man would not have chosen her.Apart from that I know little about her.She wrote a play called, in English, Life x 3. I would never have noticed it, frankly, if not for the following personal reason: my daughter, the younger one, is a gifted amateur actress and theater person with years of track record in school theaters. Her triumph was her direction of Ionesco's Lesson. As an actress, she sparkled as Philomele, her last part before school was over.Now as a new out-of-schooler in a gap year, her first acting job (after an unfortunately failed attempt to stage Glass Menagerie, where she would have had the role of the daughter) was in Life x 3. It is a 4 persons play. My daughter was the 5th, the little son who cries behind stage. A bit of a let-down after years of fame.A play about two couples. One visiting the other for a dinner party. The problem is that there was a misunderstanding about dates. The hosts were thinking in terms of tomorrow. Difficult, because the guest is the host's superior in the world of science (cosmology) with presumed influence on career prospects. You can see right away that this is getting difficult. The senior man asks about the forthcoming publication on the halos of milky ways or something like that. It is ready! But have you seen the recent publications by such and such on the same subject? Depression, dejection, accusations, and then the little son acts up in the background and the tense conversations embrace the subject of education, with glee.The level of the professional chess games (who is important for whom?) is enriched by bitching about child management and about the women's inability to understand what the owners of creation are talking about and by finger food at the improvised disaster party. It ends in hostility and evacuation.And then we get the same scenario in different permutations. The protagonists change their character, the reaction to situations changes, the guest goes for the hostess, the son goes on interfering from behind the scenes...The play is restricted by pragmatical considerations to 3 versions of the same starting situation. It could conceivably last much longer with endless variations.The concluding question must be: so what? This is a funny evening at the theater, but I don't see any depth in the approach to real life.Unless your daughter plays a part in it, you do not really need to watch it. I can't think of a reason to read it."},{"Title":"Lydia Maria Child: The Quest for Racial Justice (Oxford Portraits)","review":"This is the book to have when you need quick information on Lydia Maria Francis Child.

This book is an example of why it should be. If you are a fan of NotLD and seeking a print version of the story, I suggest seeking out the version the films' originator, John Russo, produced.The writing is not exciting and even with the film almost committed to memory, the scenes do not come to life. This title smacked of an individual trying to make a buck off of something that is loved by millions. For anybody to take this film and convert it into book form seemed wrong on so many levels. For anybody to write the words \\"They're coming to get you, Barbra...\\" and include a copyright page in the front of their book just felt wrong.I have no familiarity with Mr. Andrews' other works, but this so-called \\"Movie Tie-In\\" (as it is noted on the spine of the book) has soured me in what may be a permanent way."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.","review":"Wanted to know what all the hoopla was about... still don't know.

I am a long standing fan of the zombie genre, with such hits as \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" adorning my shelves. I'm in college now and it is always hard to find a good quick read that can keep you picking it up even when you've looked at text on a page for way to long; this is one of those books. I think I finished it in a week, and a test heavy week at that. This book though was so scary and engrossed me so much. One night, I was reading it in our Chemistry library at our university and had not moved for so long that the motion sensing lights turned off, and I probably jumped a foot out of my seat. I'm a big horror fan and I haven't had a scare like that in ages. Anyone who is a fan of the zombie genre, and likes a book that takes you by the neck and runs with it should read this book. I still have it in my library and recommend it to all my friends who borrow my survival guide."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.","review":"If you are looking for a beautifully done adaption to N.O.T.L.D. then you MUST read this novelization. Since \\"Night\\" falls in the public domain and anyone can do anything they like to it I really had no idea what to expect. What I got was a very well written and extremely faithful book that makes it very easy to picture the characters in the film being dragged through their night of hell. Some authors would have taken it too far. Mr.Andrews does it perfectly -- in fact, the best praise I can give him is that the only stuff he added only paints a better picture of each characters psyche. He adds explanation of how each character got to the little farm house in the middle of nowhere and does so in a way that answers a lot of questions that die hard fans have had for years. One of my favorite things the author does is find intelligent ways to explain things that have been thought of as \\"film flubs\\" in the movie for years by only adding a voice to what's going on inside the characters head (my favorite is he manages an intelligent explanation as to why the \\"live\\" broadcast they are watching of the posse in the middle of the night seem to be standing in a field in the middle of the day). If you want to find out what makes Mr.Cooper such a jerk -- Why does his wife even bother putting up with him? -- How did little Karen get bit -- How did Tom and Judy end up in the basement even listening to this blow hard? Read this book and you shall see. Even the characters that you are unsympathetic to are written so well you understand at least why they are the way they are (You still want to shake the unholy hell out of 'em...but now you understand them). The only negative thing I can say about this book is that Christopher Andrews hasn't yet followed it up with his novelizations of Mr.Romero's other works -- I do hope he plans on fixing these blaring errors soon!"},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.","review":"I'm always iffy on a book-movie tie-in and there was no exception with this one but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.

It lead into it with some description, then took over with the movie and just took a life of it's own from there. Job well done Christopher Andrews...what's one lost night of sleep but it wasn't all your fault cuz as soon as I finished the book, I had to rewatch the movie again ;)"},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.","review":"Night of the Living dead is, without a doubt, one of the greatest horror films of the 20th century. It's brilliantly moody and terrifying. When I first saw it, around 1970 as part of the bottom of a 'Spook Show', it frightened me so badly (the only horror film ever to have this effect), that I didn't watch it again until I was 19.This novelization is excellent. Rather than being a slavish retelling of the script, this, based on the script, fleshes out the story, giving each of the characters an excellent back story. The part about the Beekman Diner, hinted at in the movie, is re-told in excellent detail. Each of the major characters gets a fine telling of their backstory. There are even a few winks and easter eggs to other films in the series. the author did a great job and I recommend reading this! It's far superior to the previous adaptation by John Russo."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.","review":"I was reluctant to buy this book for two reasons. (1) I'm a bit protective of George Romero's copyright. I think its uncool of others to reissue his film and make money off of it because of a screw-up in the copyrighting. Yes its legal but it I still don't like it. But this isn't the film, this is a novelization. The author didn't just rebundle the film but put his own blood and sweat into the novel so I got over myself on that one. This feels like a companion not a rip-off. (2) I tend to not like novelization of films much. The two are different animals altogether and horror generally fails the transition. But I was generally thinking about horror books made into flat movies (think Steven King) and not the reverse. I'd never seen a horror movie turned into a book. I enjoyed the authors book of short stories (title fails me right now but it was mostly horror) and he did a wonderful job of turning Hamlet into a novel (yeah, that took brass balls) so maybe he did a decent job of turning the granddaddy of zombie movies into a novel. Anyway it was worth the minimal risk so I took the chance.I'm glad I did. It is easy to root for an actor on the screen. To get into their skin and want them to survive. That is much harder in a book when they are simply a name and brief description. A straight forward adaptation probably would have fallen flat as the story was crafted for film, for a tight fast moving film at that. What the movie lacks is characterization and backstory and that is exactly what Christopher Andrews brings to the story. He brings the characters alive and adds just enough backstory to fill things in and make us care but not so much that the story halts or even slows.Needless to say I enjoyed the book enough that I'll buy his next, and probably the one after that, although I hope he'll veer back into horror territory again soon."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.","review":"I think if you like the 80s version of the movie you will like this book.

There are no prestige classes, spells, feats, or any other items in this volume. That being said, there are a number of interesting and unique monsters listed herein.Though the monsters are listed in alphabetical order, the publisher breaks them down into various types: grudge monsters, terrain creatures, chase creatures, plot creatures, flavor creatures, and finally a \\"race\\" intended to be used as PCs or NPCs.Grudge monsters can inflict permanent harm on a party. Thus, the party will likely have a \\"grudge\\" against this monster, perhaps leading to future encounters with the same monster or others of its kind.Terrain creatures are found only in certain terrains or locations. For example, gravestone guardians are only found in cemeteries.Chase creatures provide great opportunities to have a running villain in your campaign. The foreverjack, for example, is a rogue who was lucky enough to have escaped death. These would make great NPCs for the adventurers to hunt.Plot creatures usually have a close connection with the underlying plot of the story. For example, the atrocity wight is created from mass burial sites (e.g. concentration camps, genocide). Usually, this would be linked up with the scheming of the villainous NPCs.Flavor creatures take the place of normal creatures in other campaigns, usually animals. For example, the bloodseeker is an undead wolf (zombie in appearance with a skeletal head) that can unfailingly track a creature whose flesh it has tasted. This may very easily replace tracking dogs in your campaign across the board.Finally, the damphir is a race of semi-vampires created when a pregnant woman is drained of blood by a vampire, but not killed. When born, her child is a damphir, have some strengths and weakness of the vampire.Overall, the volume shows some unique and usable ideas. There are a few monsters that may be a bit too powerful, but overall, the volume can be used to add some new undead to your campaign.

This book was written in 1833 by Blessed John Henry Newman and is a beautiful current edition of the work. By having these reprints available to us we are able to read such important source documents. This book was pivotal in the conversion of Newman to Roman Catholicism. The book gives a very detailed (510 pages) study of how Arianism developed, how it spread, and how it was finally curtailed.Newman helps us to understand the world that existed and the various pressures on this world. Christianity was trying to develop in a pagan philosophical world. In order to grow and be accepted the Christian religion needed to be explained in terms understandable in a Hellenistic world. Newman does an outstanding job of explaining the total milieu Christianity developed in.Arianism developed in this changing world and Newman helps us to understand why Arianism had the appeal that it did and how it became so pervasive in the ancient world. Newman also guides us through the different Church Councils that developed the doctrine to counter Arianism.The book is very readable and Newman is a masterful writer who keeps the readers interest. If you wanted to gather a much better understanding how Church doctrine developed this is an excellent book to read."},{"Title":"The Arians of the fourth century","review":"This is a great book if you want to understand how early Church doctrine was developed.

This melodrama will keep you on the edge of your seat hungrily going from chapter to chapter trying to fathom the totality of the mystery which spans continents but is primarily is set in San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Washington DC and Israel.Dr. Kobernick's tale of intrigue shows a benefit from his Dental profession, world travels and a deep personal involvement with Israel's people and confrontation with its Arab neighbors.This book is not as long as its pages might connote. The chapters are minimal in size which demonstrates an excellent ability to say what has to be said as the story moves forward and allows reader not to be lost in lengthy chapters. This layout permits the reader to read progressively in mini plot bites. Having read &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; by Dan Brown with its own minimal chapters after the &quot;Reactor&quot;, I felt justified in concluding that Kobernick was especially skillful with this writing technique.All readers who are familiar with the locations of the action in this book will become more than elated as the plot is carried into familiar terrain.The movement of the characters who are from all walks of life, political, religious affiliation and diverse ethnic backgrounds, keeps you on your toes and will test your ability to follow the action. Examining many of the situations would definitely be useful to FBI, CIA and airport security persons since they reveal elusiveness and scheming plots to escape current routine detection. We may all be safer from reviewing these fault lines in security. &quot;Reactor&quot; addresses Middle Eastern issues and is a poignant study of the frightening lengths to which terrorists will go in attempting to achieve their goals.I urge anyone wishing to read a contemporary, real life, powerful book, a fast moving thriller to rush to order this novel.Dr. Kobernick should be commended for his lucid cliff-hanger of a first novel. The novel is chock full of real people and will be worthwhile for you to get involved with its suspenseful total action."},{"Title":"Reactor","review":"Reactor is a compelling novel of conspiracy, presenting a nefarious Middle Eastern terrorist-driven scheme to assemble a nuclear reactor within the United States and use it to crush America and Israel both.

That He desires to have an intimate, deeply personal relationship with each of His children? Did you know that it is His desire for us to grow in our faith and grow more and more into the image of His Son?These are some of the things that Max Lucado writes about in his book, When God Whispers Your Name. In usual Lucado-style, he uses great analogies and stories to drive the points home. Some of these points include: God's grace and love for us; our privilege as His children to lay our burdens at His feet and leave them there; God's desire to change us from the inside out; how to jump start this change through God alone; identifying areas in our lives which may be hindering our growth.The reader is reminded again and again of how much God loves His children. How much He wants the best for us. How everything that happens in a believer's life serves a purpose.Lucado also emphasizes that our goal in our faith walk should be growth. Growth in our faith. Growth in our love. Growth in grace. But he also emphasizes that God is understanding, tender, and merciful.\\"So the next time you need rest, go ahead. He'll keep you headed in the right direction. And the next time you make progress--thank Him. He's the one providing the power.\\" {Quote from the book.}This is a typical Max Lucado book, and I don't say that in a disrespectful or negative way. Lucado is a great storyteller and, again, he does a great job with the stories and analogies in this book.And, as usual, it is a light, happy, easy read. Not so deep that you really have to think and concentrate, but not foofy and fluffy either. Simply stated yet packed with truth.I did find my mind straying a bit while reading the book, though. There were times when I had to refocus on what the point of the book was because he made a lot of different points. This sometimes made the chapters disconnected. Each chapter was good in content; they just did not all flow together very gracefully, in my opinion."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"This book was given to me durimg a period of dryness and difficulty.With gentilness it brought me back on into an open space ."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"To some God's voice is loud and clear, but to others it is almost silent.

A definite re-read in my library."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"When I was in Christian college 18 years ago, Max Lucado was probably the most popular author on campus. I look back at those days as the \\"glory days\\" of my faith. I was going to a Christian college (Kentucky Christian College), attending chapel twice a week, attending a small group on campus, taking Bible classes, and traveling to churches on the weekend to sing about Jesus. I had a personal devotion time most days, and had group devotions twice a week in my dorm.When we needed a devotional or small group talk, we pulled out a Max Lucado book and read a section of a chapter and then talked about it. I didn't own any of his books myself, but I had heard most of the parts of most of his books. I even bought them as Christmas gifts for my Dad!This week, I received one of those books in the mail from a publisher. Originally published in 1994, while I was newly married and attending Cedarville College in Ohio this book is now once again in stores for holiday shopping. And I found myself wondering if Max Lucado was really as pithy and amazing an author as we all thought he was way back then. Since 1994, a lot of life has happened. I have six children, and two of them still wake me up most mornings between 6:30 and 7 a.m. begging for a Dora episode. I homeschool the other four, and when I fall into bed most nights it is with the feeling that I have worked all day long and the house is still a mess. I am now one of those faceless people in Max's book whose dreams have changed. Fortunately, I am happy about that. Most days.What I found when I picked up When God Whispers Your Name was a book I didn't want to put down. I read half of it during a ballet class. That makes it a quick and easy read since ballet is only 1 hour and 30 minutes. I found myself looking for an ink pen to underline things. I found the encouragement I was looking for. I even found the comfort of familiarity... I think I probably need to go back and read this book one chapter at a time for my daily devotions (you know, twice a week so I can really absorb the message of hope enclosed.My Bottom Line: I do enjoy the works of Max Lucado and When God Whispers Your Name is a nice addition to our library. I think it is easy enough to understand that I might make it required reading for my 12 year old. I'm going to go poke around on our shelves because I think we have at least a couple other adult books by Lucado that will make good reading during Monday's ballet lesson.Disclaimer: I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review on my blog. Here you have it."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"A few weeks ago, I received Max Lucado's book When God Whispers Your Name, Discovering the Path to Hope in Knowing That God Cares For You. It's roughly 235 pages (there are ads on the last few pages) and came to me in paperback. This book is not considered a devotional but it does consist of 28 short chapters that can be read in any order. I would say this is an inspirational book but it's also very light reading that gives you a reason to smile. Some of the chapters are bible stories. Some are just stories about people. In his chapter Maxims, Lucado discusses the simplicity of short and sweet. He goes on invite his readers to his trophy case of cuts that did not make it into his other books. One such quote is this, \\" Sometimes the most godly thing we can do is take a day off.\\" See, this book will make you laugh. I know I sure did. However, at the same time its inspiring.

Mr. Lucado points us in the right direction when we encounter times of depression, fear, or doubt in our lives. Does God really love me? Does He remember who I am? Does He care about my future? Does He have a plan for me? All these questions, and more, can be answered by one simple statement. God knows your very name.I found this book to be a supremely quick read. It was encouraging for me, and I have never doubted God's involvement in my life. I can only imagine what a blessing it would be for those who have feelings of loneliness from time to time. The book was slightly disjointed, but not distractingly so. I had never read a book by Mr. Lucado, so that aspect sort of took me by surprise. It seemed an anthology of ramblings on a loosely-defined topic, but it was quite enjoyable nonetheless. It was somewhat of an emotional rollercoaster, as Mr. Lucado is a very good author who can evoke any emotion from the reader. He is downright hilarious when he wants to be, but at the same time, he knows how to touch your soul.

This review is my honest opinion and was in no way compensated for said opinion."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"I enjoyed reading When God Whispers Your Name by Max Lucado. The author has successfully taken God's teachings, personalized them, and made them relevant to today's readers. Max Lucado is masterful at retelling Biblical truths that will inspire, comfort, and challenge you.The book is divided into three sections, yet each chapter stands alone. The first section speaks to the fact that God works in our lives, the second section teaches us that God is with us in our brokenness, and the last section challenges us to see the unseen and look to a time when we will be in God's presence. There is a discussion guide at the back of the book. The guide lists \\"Points to Ponder\\" and \\"Wisdom from the Word\\" for each chapter. This allows the book to be transformed from a personal devotional to a small group study.I found this to be a good book to take along with me; to steal away and read during a free moment in my otherwise busy day. The author's words flow effortlessly as he reintroduces us to Biblical notables like Moses, Gabriel, Philip, Joseph, and King Josiah. I believe that if we are quiet, if we take time to slow down enough, we receive the blessing of hearing God speak to us in a still small voice. This book helps us to live into that truth; while remembering that God loves each one of us and knows us by name.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

The inside cover of \\"When God Whispers Your Name\\" (Thomas Nelson)lists more than 90 titles he has authored and the back cover blurb tells me he has more 100 million books in print. When does he have time to pastor his church in San Antonio?This is a reissue of a book first published in 1994. In it each chapter is a simple story intended to communicate hope, as the subtitle suggests -- \\"Discover the Path to Hope in Knowing that God Cares for You.\\" The book, Lucado writes is for those who may have forgotten \\"that God has written their true name upon his hand.\\"Many chapters take a person from the Bible and insert him or her into a modern-day setting. For instance, Moses is a once-successful businessman who is now a janitor when speaks to him from the mop bucket. He also shares stories from his own life as a parent, a child, a husband and a friend. In one chapter he sees a little boy marvelling at a Christmas creche and Lucado reflects that must be what it was like for the angel Gabriel during the nativity story -- utter wonder at God's plan to save the world through a little baby born in a barn to poor parents named Mary and Joe.Each chapter is a short story or musing by Lucado.The chapters are not necessarily connected. Lucado is niot building a chapter-by-chapter case. Each chapter stands alone and each story is meant to illustrate God's holiness, grace, sovereignty and care for us. But sometimes, I admit, I had to look at the cover of the book and its subtitle to help me understand what the point was. It sometimes seemed that Lucado was dumping entries from his journal to fill this book. I also admit that I've had that feeling before when reading a Lucado book.But I don't want to appear harsh. I need to hear that God has a name for me. That I am special to him and he has a destiny for me. Lucado is a good writer and at times he catches me. Like when he writes that faith should make me more pleasant or when he points out that the Holy Spirit is in control of each step in the evangelistic or discipleship process.\\"When God Whispers Your Name\\" is a light and easy-to-read book.

The fact that Max Lucado is such a humble person draws you in . . . and you can't help but hang on to his every word.

Max covers multiple topics in his essay-type book. One of the insights that stuck out to me was about a people mover.He wrote of a delightfully exaggerated trip through Dallas-Fortworth's sprawling airport, complete with descriptions of day-long hikes to find his terminal, mirages, and a canteen. But there, in the distance, a people mover--one of those moving walkways that require little to no energy on the part of the person \\"riding\\" the belt for long stretches. He tied this to how sometimes we need to rest in God and let Him move us forward. He's always moving us forward. That ministered to me and I think will speak to anyone who has ever gotten stuck in the striving mentality of having to earn every inch of progress. God commands rest (see the Ten Commandments), but sometimes we forget this.Wherever you are in your life, this book will speak to you. Hope-filled chapters abound. And who couldn't use someone coming alongside them and encouraging them? That's what Max does. He links arms with you, whispers some helpful tale tied to a moral and urges you not to give up, unless it's to give in to God.I'll leave readers to discover why he titled the book as he did. Loved those chapters! If you're looking for light reading full of heavy doses of hope, this one's for you.*I was provided a free e-book copy of this nonfiction title from the publisher in exchange for my unbiased review.

It is written in a way that tells 28 unique short stories that all beautifully portray God's love for us. By using the short stories, it really opens your eyes to aspects of God's love for us. There are discussion guides in the back of the book for each chapter and even suggestions of which chapters could be read together for discussion. This book has led me to discover many different aspects about God's love for us, like the fact that God has a name for us that only He knows. I don't know about you, but that makes me feel even more special that by being a child of God, he has His own special name for me (and that His own name for me is not because He doesn't know my \\"real\\" name).Through Lucado's writing, I also discovered that its not the gifts that God gives us that matter, only the gift of His presence and His love are what matters. Think if you were an orphan alone, would you prefer a family with a mother and father or living in immaculate splendor with everything you could ever imagine without the love of a family. I bet you the vast majority of orphans could care less about the immaculate splendor of the house. Many of them are provided everything they need physically (many also are not provided these necessities) but still lack the love of a family. If you asked them what their one wish would be, I bet you almost unanimously it would be to feel the love of a family. That's how it is with God and us. Think about Paul in prison or John being exiled. They were able to survive despite their circumstances due to their love for God and His love for them.I would definitely recommend this book. It is a great quick read and you can read as few or as many of the short stories that you want in a day.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through BookSneeze(R).com book review bloggers program.

Did you realize that your name is written on the hand of God (Is. 49:16)? Perhaps you've never seen your name honored. And you can't remember when you heard it spoken with kindness. In this book, Lucado offers the inspiration to believe that God has already bought the ticket-with your name on it. Are you ready to hope again? Are you ready to let go of doubt and sorrow? Just listen carefully. God is whispering your name.In this book, like a lot of his other books, Lucado gives you a glimpse into his own life and the lives of those around him whom he's had the opportunity to minister to. That really speaks to me! At my church our pastor is the same way. He doesn't just preach the Bible to us he helps us see how it relates to our lives and speaks to our everyday situations. He makes the Bible come to life for me just as my pastor does.One of my favorite chapters is Chapter 5...Maxims. This chapter is his \\"trophy case\\" of cuts from this book and a couple of others. I like to share them with my friends on Facebook and text them to others I know they needs some motivating, inspiring words. Max Lucado says we learn brevity from Jesus. His greatest sermon for example can be read in eight minutes (Matt. 5-7) and his best-known story can be read in 90 seconds (Luke 15:11-32). Here are a couple of my favorites:Nails didn't hold God to the cross. Love did.You'll give up on yourself before God will.The right heart with the wrong creed is better than the right creed with the wrong heart.You will never forgive anyone more than God has already forgiven you.When Jesus went home he left the front door open.Another thing I love is that at the back of the book in a section called Discussion Guide each chapter is broken down for you with Points to Ponder and questions to make you really think, followed by Wisdom from the Word. For example my favorite chapter...Chapter 5. The Points to Ponder talks about the brevity we learned from Jesus and gives some examples like how he summarized prayer in five phrases and silenced accusers with one challenge and rescued a soul with one sentence. He made his point and went home. Then there are a couple of questions. 1) What is so powerful about brevity? What can make it so effective? 2) Which of Max's maxims in this chapter most struck a chord in you? Wisdom from the Word: Read Luke 15:11-32. Why do you think this is Jesus' best-known story? What makes it so powerful? Read Matthew 6:9-13. List the elements of prayer found in this passage. Do you use these elements in your own prayer life? Explain. Read Mark 12: 29-31. How do these commands summarize all the Bible's teaching? How do they fit together?...the path to hope in knowing that God knows you, never forgets you, and cares about the details of your life.Max Lucado has something to offer everyone so if you are looking for direction, struggling with something, or looking to get back on the right track you need to check out what Max Lucado has to offer.

As a Christian it is a comforting thing to know that the God of the universe knows me by name and actually does love and care for me. I always enjoy reading Max Lucado's books. I feel all warm and fuzzy inside as I read the amazing accounts of God's work in his (Lucado's) life and in the lives of others. 99% of the time the stories are applicable to my own life, and I am able to reflect upon God's work in my life because of it.Though I must admit, this one was a little harder for me to get into than other books by Lucado, it is still very good. I would recommend it to anyone needing to feel God's presence or who question God's care for them as individuals. I think, like most of his books, Lucado writes short chapters to inspire daily devotional reading - if the reader should so choose. This book would work rather nicely for that, as a one chapter a day kind of devotional. Usually once I read one chapter, it is really hard for me to put his books down though ;).Overall, I thought Max Lucado's When God Whispers Your Name was a good book. I think God has gifted Lucado to be an excellent writer, and I can definitely see his love for the Lord Jesus Christ in his writings.This book was given to me, free of charge, in exchange for an honest review, by Thomas Nelson Publishing Company's BookSneeze program."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"When I first received my book in the mail, it was the worst time to read for me. I read to relax and learn, neither of which I was able to do at that moment. After a week of battling life, I forced myself to sit and read. It took all of thirty seconds for me to be pulled into this book. I read through it in one sitting, and it was exactly what I needed to hear.Max Lucado, once again, has written a book from his heart to reach out to any reader. With the use of simple sentences he brings a spiritual concept into our earthly view. He trades the robes of an Old Testament character for the uniform of a janitor, and immediately a reader can identify with the man's situation. His creative genius shines when he reveals that the modern man is really Moses.The book itself is well structured into three parts: 'The Song of the Minstrel', 'The Touch of the Master', and 'The Guest of the Maaestro.' These three sections reveal that God is still working in our lives, even when we are broken, and preparing for the day we will join Him. Max challenges the reader to make the book a personal journey by providing a book guide in the back. This book guide acts as a workbook, leading the reader through a Bible study. The guid can be used individually or in a small group setting.Overall, I am impressed with the book. not only did it have an impact in my personal life, but it's a book I continuously keep picking up. I recommend this book to anyone needing inspiration and encouragement.Disclosure: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze book review bloggers program.

Well known for his ability to weave truths into words, Max Lucado seeks to share hope to the reader and knowledge that amidst the weariness and uncertainty of life here on earth, we have a Savior who cares deeply for us - and knows us by name.This book is a collection of many stories. In some the character are old. In others, they are young. Some are Bible stories, others possibly derived from the neighbor next door. Maybe on one of the pages you'll find a story that reflects perhaps a bit of you.Although I enjoy the stories Pastor Lucado shares, I can't help but feel that the hope he shares is somewhat shallow. Yes, it is encouraging to know that God knows our name when we are feeling down... but the mailman knows it, too. For lasting hope we need an introduction to our Savior and a good look at the cross - knowing that He suffered and rose to bring us victory in the daily life. Then, we can really appreciate that such a great God knows our name, in fact, He knew it well before we were even born.*This book was gratefully received from Thomas Nelson at no cost in exchange for my agreement to post this review."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"Full of inspirational thoughts and analogies, which point out how everything here is temporary and no matter how good, incomparable to what awaits all those who enter into the kingdom of God."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"Max Lucado is one of my mother's favorite authors, (as well as the author of a children's book that makes me cry to this day), so I was looking forward to trying out When God Whispers Your Name. However, this book was not what I expected. It was filled with Lucado's signature simple, short sentences, as well as short, easy to read chapters. However, I personally did not find a great connection between what the cover makes me expect and what is inside the book. I expected more references to New Testament passages about being a child of God, bought with the blood of Christ. While this did happen, I found the book talked much more about the Old Testament heroes, who after a closer look did not always live so heroically.Once you look at the discussion guide, the life application, as well at the Christ-centeredness, is more obvious. However, not everyone will do this and may then miss out on the book. I also feel that going through this book in a small group would lead to an entirely different understanding than reading it as an individual. I can't think of any specific group that would benefit more from this book than others, however, it may not be the perfect book for teenagers trying to know that God cares for them.I received a free copy of this book from Thomas Nelson in exchange for my honest review but was under no obligation to provide a positive review."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"This book is great for MACHO MEN, intellectual know it alls and the hardened atheist ."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"A book that is the those who feel the need to feel special."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"I received this book as a gift, ....after reading it I disposed of it. I found it to be disrespectful of our Savior. Lucado suggests that the reason Jesus went to the wedding at Cana was because He wanted to \\"twirl the bride around the dance floor\\". This is the Son of God we're talking about, not some red-blooded human ordinary male.He uses a lot of space to write short, incomplete sentences that are supposed to grip us, I guess. It didn't grip me."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"When God Whispers Your Name is fine until it reaches page 119 which is now page 183. It continues to page 214 with the next page being numbered 151. It is offensive and apparent that a portion of another book has been included with this printing. This is a disgrace to Max Lucado's reputation. There are thousands of books that have been sold and we wonder how many have this misprint. This is a terrible situation. We are very concerned about the effects this may have upon the public. We feel Max Lucado should be made aware of this grave error."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"If you haven't figured it out by now by perusing my reviews, I really enjoy books written by Max Lucado. The way he writes helps me to see a different aspect of God in every book, from childrens, to fiction to study. This book lives up to that, so much so that I have suggested it to my women's group at church.There are 3 sections, the Song of the Minstrel, The Touch of the Master, and the Guest of the Maestro. Each section has short chapters that can easily be read in a short amount of time (waiting for dinner to cook, waiting for the kids to come out of school etc) but they are really powerful. The discussion guide at the end of the book includes questions for each chapter that will help you to reflect on what you read, gives you scripture to guide you into digging deeper and even suggests which chapters to read together due to a common theme.I laughed out loud, I cried, I had \\"ah-ha\\" moments, but most of all I was reminded just how present God really is in our lives if I just hush up and look for Him! Another Lucado winner!"},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"\\"When God Whispers Your Name\\" is another great book by Max Lucado. He is such a great story teller. This book is 232 pages of stories from the Bible and everyday people like you and me who are lost, discouraged or weary. These stories offer hope and encouragement by reminding the reader that God knows your name. I'm reminded of the verse in Psalm 46:10 - \\"Be still and know that I am God.\\" I enjoyed this book and it is another one that I will probably read again.I chose this book to read as part of the Blogging for Books program with Waterbroook-Multnomah Publishers and received no payment for my review other than the privilege of being given this book for that purpose."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"I'm gonna tell you now, this review isn't gonna be as good as it would be because I just wrote a whole entire review and never saved it. Sigh. Anyways, ill start. This book by New York Times Bestselling Author is... Max Lucado! This book is great! I was expecting it to be one of those books that you read once, and your not very interested in, you leave a bad review then stick it on the shelf to collect dust and never be read again. Wrong. This is one of the best books i've ever read. I might read it again. And again. And again. Or look up certain chapters and read those again. Now I could stop here by saying \\"Great book. Go buy it. It's a nice read. Ten Stars\\". But that wouldn't reach the 200 Word limit my company has me write. Oh well. Guess I have to go deeper into detail about it.I'll start by telling you about the way the book is laid out. There are Three parts and 28 chapters in all. Each chapter is Three to Four pages long. Short Storys. It's a good book for a bible study class at a church or group because you can focus on two or three chapters at a time. And the way it is written, its very interesting to read, and what good is a book if theres not something funny in it somewhere? This book is hilarious. And well written. This book was categorizd 'Inspirational'. And it works. You can read a chapter of this each morning before work to give you a jumstart for the day. Like inspirational fuel.Another thing I like about the book is the 40 Pages of Notes and Discussions in the back. Good stuff back there. I'm gonna have to end this review here. Overall this is a really great book for a group or bible study, or, like I said, that inspirational kick to your day. It's a 10/10."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"When God Whispers Your Name by Max LucadoMax Lucado is a great story teller. This is a wonderful book of faith, with many Bible influences intermingled with life stories. Max uses his sense of humor, along with a very serious side. The different titles of each chapter are very interesting. This is an introduction of hope and encouragement. The reminder that God knows our nameI would highly recommend this book. It has so many good Christian scriptures and Max follows them by stories that fit the scriptures. He talks about Jesus going to the wedding at Cana and why did Jesus go to a party! You will find the answer to that in this book!He talks about the angel Gabriel who was to tell Mary that she was to become the mother of Jesus. A very interesting story of how the angel felt. The fears and questions he had. That story has been told many times, but not exactly in this way!There is a chapter called \\"A Sack of Stones\\". A very good chapter. Who wants to carry around a sack of stones! After reading this chapter, one will stop and think about do I really carry a sack of stones? Maybe it will be a \\"life-changing chapter\\".There is an interview with Moses and the Holyland Press. And the book goes on and on with such interesting stories and scriptures. It is a well-written book.

Tying modern day people and stories to occurrences from biblical times like an absolute master, Lucado incorporates stories of the likes of Moses and Abraham and shows how those stories are still relevant today, and how God is still working through us today. Lucado inspires his audience like no other writer I've read from. \\"When God Whispers Your Name\\" makes you really feel like no matter what is going on in your life, it is for God's purpose. He draws fantastic parallels between famous biblical men and modern day man in an exceptional effort to show us that fundamentally, God hasn't changed, and that no matter what we are experiencing in our own lives, there is a purpose. Even when we don't understand the situation we are in, just as Moses probably didn't understand his own situation, in the end, there is a purpose and it is one that is of the Creator.

After reading these works, that joy is back in full. There is no room for anything but praise and joy no matter the circumstances. I knew all this at one time and lost it along the way, but am finding it again and am so grateful. This little book has all anyone needs to find the way to God through Jesus Christ.

This book has made my life with Christ more real."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"This truly is a book that reminds us to \`Discover the Path to Hope in Knowing that God Cares for You'. Divided into three parts, \`The Song of the Minstrel', \`The Touch of the Master' and \`The Guest of the Maestro' Lucado cleverly weaves stories, thoughts and Bible quotes to bring the message of hope. He blends modern day people with biblical times occurrences, to point out that God has not changed and just like Moses, we don't always understand the circumstances we're in, but we still need to trust that it's all for God's purpose. With its thought provoking Points to Ponder and Wisdom from the Word study guide, this book could easily be used as a devotional.When I started reading, I couldn't help but wonder, \`What's with the short, simple sentences?' I chuckled when I came to the fifth chapter and Max answered, \\"Here's a toast to the simple sentence. Here's a salute to one-liners. Join me in applauding the delete key and the eraser... More periods. Fewer commas...Concise, clear, vivid... Ahhh, brevity. An art apparently unheeded in the realms of insurance brochures and some-assembly-required bicycle manuals. We learn brevity from Jesus. He made his point and went home.\\" (OK Max. Got it.)My favourite chapter: \`The Gift of Unhappiness'. I had to let that thought swirl around in my head a while, before I ventured into Max's musings on it. The whippoorwill is an awe-inspiring analogy of how our songs in the night comfort and encourage -- God whispering peace when we hurt; and how trials make us yearn for heaven, because \`God has planted eternity in the hearts of men.' Eccles.3:10. Once again, Max Lucado blessed us with a real inspirational gem - this time, leaving us wanting to sing with the whippoorwill.In exchange for an honest review Book Sneeze gave me a complimentary copy of this book."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"What a wonderful and relevant book and such an easy read.

It's one of his earlier works. His writing style is a little different than those of most other authors whose books I've read, but it's a good kind of different. The book is written in a more conversational tone. It's kind of refreshing after reading so many books written in a formal, ridged style.This book discusses how to listen and hear when God whisper's your name. The book is basically a compilation of several short stories that all lead to a centralized theme. The author tells a story and then explains how it applies to life. This style results in a great book that aides in your walk with Christ.When God Whispers Your Name has a powerful message. This book is a breath of fresh air in a world filled with smog. It's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"\\"When God Whispers Your Name\\" is an inspirational book based on Biblical stories presented in modern disguises. Max Lucado tells the modern story and then identifies the Biblical original. He does so in a way which holds the reader's interest and is never boring.My daughter is in a challenging, Biblically based Theology course I had gone into this book in the hope of enhancing my familiarity with Bible stories in order to help her. I obtained what I wanted, and more. Lucado tells Bible stories in ways that make them memorable. I approached this book with some trepidation. As a Catholic, I expected this Protestant minister to overwhelm us with quotes and citations. There is some of that, but they never interfere with the story.This book provides the reader with a road map to a more intense personal relationship with God. As I went through this book I found myself to be both inspired and excited. It can do the same for many Christians and others too."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"Lucado writes in a conversational manner. His strength is in his ability to tell stories. He takes a familiar Bible passage and presents it in a fresh context. Like most writers he also has a gift for creating quotable phrases. An example is &quot;We seldom see history in the making, and we seldom recognize heroes&quot; (p. 33). A second example is &quot;Faith in the future begets power in the present&quot; (p. 44). And a third, which is an epiphany of an observation, &quot;I challenge you to find one soul who came to God seeking grace and did not find it&quot; (p. 53). Lucado's book leaves people feeling good about themselves."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"I really enjoyed this book as well as Lucado's other writings. He has such a great gift of being able to take simple stories and make such strong and good points through them which are applicable to our lives.In the beginning of the book Lucado wrote, \\"this book has been written for one purpose, to encourage.\\" That purpose was fulfilled. I could have read this book in probably two hours because it is such easy reading. But instead I spaced it out to where I only read a few pages a day so I could ponder what he said throughout the day. I go back to previous chapters almost daily for a quick encouraging word.There is so much Lucado says in this book that makes you sit back and smile and say, \\"Our God is an awesome God!\\" So, if you want some smiles and encouragement and many good things to ponder throughout your day, pick up this book and give it a read. I hope you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"This book made me feel so wonderful and loved by the king himself - God!

I picked up this book when I was struggling to deal with some depressing times in my life, and this was God's answer to my struggles. God's love is presented right there through Max's words. He did not tell you to do anything, he simply presented what Jesus did for us on the cross in everyday terms. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is going through some hard times or anyone that wants to feel lifted up!"},{"Title":"When God Whispers Your Name","review":"Max Lucado does it again!

While some folks may have a problem with that statement, the comment is actually quite biblical when you consider that this earth is filled with sin while heaven is a perfect place. Besides, which place will Christians reside in longer? Really, this is a no-brainer.

There are plenty of copies out there to be found by search.Pryde was a Hudson's Bay fur trader among the Inuit (Eskimos) of the Northwest Territories. He lived pretty much as they lived, did pretty much as they did, and assembled a lot of cultural, linguistic and handcraft lore about them. Also, worthy of note, he made friends in the process. He passed away in 1997, and the new territory of Nunavut posted a eulogy for him. This speaks strongly for the authenticity of his account; if he had not been truthful, the Inuit would hardly consider him a friend.Pryde is very frank about the basic details of life, from his sexual exploits with Inuit women to common myths about the Arctic which he takes pleasure in refuting.

That is the demolition of the ego and of pride, the deadliest of the seven deadly sins.Martha King, President of the Bharati Foundation succinctly states it. To paraphrase: \\"This commentary is a personal lifetime guide. It directs the seeker on their journey on the spiritual path, starting at where the student is. This book provides the necessary guidance to orient oneself spiritually in any situation the world presents, however tragic\\".When Martha King says the commentary is a lifetime guide it is evident that these books can be read again, and again. For someone like me with the intellect of a gnat, the wisdom in these pages is easily lost.The idea of surrender is a tough pill to swallow. I am a shining example of self will run riot but in a moment of fleeting humility I took a friend's suggestion and dove into these books (there are two volumes). The \\"wow factor\\" was immediate and profound. The answers come quickly. I already knew some of this stuff but it is buried beneath a cloud of self-delusion and insane thinking. Swami Nijananda's clarity shines like the Hope Diamond. There are countless insights and revelations. There were many times after reading \\"Trustful Surrender\\" I found myself in an unfamiliar state of awe and humility.Sometimes when I listen to a lecture or read a book concerning spirituality/spiritual growth (I don't read warm fuzzy ones) I become discouraged by the seemingly lofty or unobtainable goals or ideals that are espoused by the presenter or author. Or it is a biography of a great sage who's stage of enlightenment I surely won't reach in the next several million lifetimes, give or take. Not that the goal of the subject matter in these books is anything less. To its end, it is utter submission to the Divine. Swami Nijananda presents the \\"how to\\" in such a way that is really hopeful and encouraging. He ceaselessly acknowledges the difficulty and you feel like he is in the struggle right there with you, side by side. Don't get me wrong, SNB is direct and doesn't mince words. He tells us what we must hear, not what we want to hear and he does it with compassion and at times a wonderful sense of humor.He encourages us to start surrendering with the little tiny stuff that happens to us so we are prepared for the inevitable big stuff. He gives us examples of real down to earth conversations we can have with the Divine in any situation. He discusses at length the proper hierarchy of prayer and what to ask for and how to ask for it. While SNB touches on the metaphysical, this is the everyday stuff that prepares us and brings us to the brink of deeper understanding.If you meditate and are like me, you struggle with your practice. I practice mantra meditation but my head has enough trash in it to fill a New York garbage barge. This can be frustrating to say the least and for me, frustration fosters self-pity (there goes that pride thing again). SNB's frequent discussions on Mantra in this volume have given me new reason, hope and purpose in my meditative endeavors. For me meditation is an act of faith and surrender. Just practice, practice, practice and leave the results to the Divine. I guess that's where the word trust becomes operative.The \\"Trustful Surrender\\" volumes are invaluable additions to any serious seekers library and spiritual repertoire."},{"Title":"Language and Style of the Vedic Rsis (S U N Y Series in Hindu Studies)","review":"The Rig Veda is written in the oldest Old Indian language, and what's more it is a unique even if quite extensive document, hence with nothing else from the same period to compare it with. Ms Elizarenkova refused - and she is 200% right - to retrospectively project what we may know about this language from some less old Old Indian documents to asses this unrivalled language of the Rig Veda. Consequently she has to study this language from inside. Her method is then very simple. She will not build a grammar of the language of the time when the Rig Veda was composed, but rather a stylistic study of the syntax of the particular language of the Rig Veda. First we have to understand the context in which this language was produced. She studies the Rsi, the poet-incantator-priest of those distant days, the way he worked and his social position, a hereditary quasi-divine position. Then she can enter the language itself since she understands the discursive situation that produced it. And she does it logically: vocabulary, metrics and phonetics, morphology and syntax. Every detail, every remark is deeply embedded in and enriched with the heritage collected from all the linguists who studied this language before her. That enables her to show the real position that is hers and to support it with heavy arguments contrasting it with those of her predecessors. I was very fascinated by her study of theonyms, and that of metrics in general based on the use of the repetition of some names or words, or some paradigms of names or words, to build a highly expressive oral language that can be used as an incantation in some religious ritual. I was also deeply fascinated by her study of infinitives and participles in their syntactic complexification of the sentence by appending what can be a sentence, or the equivalent of a sentence, to a verb or a noun with rich semantic possibilities varying with the formal means used to articulate the infinitive or participial clauses onto the main clause: absolute accusative, absolute genitive, absolute locative for three examples. This ancient language has the rich possibilities - if not even more - of Sanskrit and Pali and these possibilities are perfectly used by the authors to support the poetic form and at the same time to reinforce themselves from it. Finally the book is more a stylistic description of the language than a grammar of it. The grammatical presentation makes it easy to read for a linguist. The stylistic presentation she could have chosen might have made the book more dynamic but a lot less easy to penetrate linguistically. She tried to sketch that possible poetical approach in her conclusion, but that makes this conclusion stand aloof when compared to the rest of the book.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne"},{"Title":"Something you should know: The fulfillment of your heart's true desire","review":"If you've read Ken Roberts book \\"A Rich Man's Secret\\" you'll know Clement Watts is the fictional \\"rich man\\" who's \\"secret\\" is the central mystery of the story. Near the end of the story a wise old woman named Minnie states that Clement \\"published a little book he made sure every one of his hundreds of employees received. He called it 'Something You Should Know.' \\"This is that \\"little book.\\"If you really like \\"A Rich Man's Secret\\" (as I do), you'll want to pick up this book, as well as the audio set \\"Rich Man's Secret--The Course,\\" along with another book ghost-written by Ken (that seems to have been a writing exercise Ken did to prepare himself to write \\"A Rich Man's Secret\\") entitled \\"A Chance Encounter?\\" (author unknown).As far as \\"Something You Should Know,\\" it is a further elaboration on the central theme of this whole series of books by Ken: that \\"your mind is not your friend\\" and that you need to learn how to \\"step outside\\" of it and simply observe it in operation. As you do so, you'll open yourself up to a Higher inspiration that lies outside the limitations of your mechanical (and self-defeating) mind. \\"There is nothing to do. There is only something to see. Now is How.\\" While Ken claims his sources are Guy Finley and Vernon Howard, I need to say again that Ken expresses these esoteric truths far more clearly than either writer (or lecturer) ever did. Ken is also great for throwing in a lot of quotes from the great writers (such as Shakespeare, Thoreau and Longfellow) and from the Bible to supplement his lessons.Strictly speaking, Ken's work here is in the same ballpark as \\"The Power of Now\\" and with the various spin-offs of Werner Erhard's est movement, such as Shya and Ariel Kane's \\"Instantaneous Transformation\\" books and tapes (such as \\"Working On Your Relationships Doesn't Work\\") and Benjamin Zander's book \\"The Art of Possibility.\\"At the same time--for me--I find Ken's work more direct and to the point.

The theoretical writings and developments in the thought of such notables as Takiguchi Shuzo, who introduced Surrealism to Japan through his translations of Breton as well as his own writings, are covered extensively. Moreover, Sas provides material here which leads not onlyh to a deeper understanding of the thought behind 20th Century Japanese literary movements, but of the process of cultural transfer as well, in all its complexity and ambiguity. Sas notes in her prologue that &quot;Japanese Surrelism is striking and important both for the specific questions it raises and for its exemplary place as an encounter between cultures, literary movements, and languages. Sas uses the title of her book, &quot;Fault Lines,&quot; to denote how the introduction of Surrealism to Japan was, like the great Kanto earthquake which occurred around the same time, an occasion not only for literary &quot;shock&quot; and &quot;rupture,&quot; but a variety of creative reconfigurations as well. The book goes beyond a simple chronology of events as they occured, and instead takes up specific theoretical and often deeply philosophical issues of concern to both French and Japanese poets, showing in great deail how the Japanese poets dealt with these issues within their own thought processes and poetic procedures. Both poetic works and theoretical writings of major Japanese figures such as Takiguch Shuzo, Nishiwaki Junzaburo and Kitasono Katue, as well as Surrealist forerunner Hagiwara Sakutaro are quoted and examined in detail...Sas makes an extensive use of the writings of Japanese poets, artists and crtitics [including]...hitherto ignored women poets such as Ema Shouko and Tomotani Shizue as well...a wealth of material...should add significantly to the awareness in this country of experimental poetry in Japan during this century..."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming : An Evolutionary Approach","review":"The original reference work on Objective-C; the second edition was published May of 1991. So don't expect anything about OS X or Cocoa. But it's still a good book. If you want to read about the language itself, its history, the motivations behind its design, and its relationship to other languages, this is the book for you. If you want an introduction to the concept of object-oriented programming that is not mucked up by the foulness of C++ or Java, but rather gets you started down the One True Path of Cocoa right off the bat, this would also be a good place to start. I learned Objective-C from this book, and it is still handy as a reference work. Kind of the Kernighan &amp; Ritchie of Objective-C. Four stars instead of five because it has less and less relevance for the typical Obj-C programmer nowadays, who is almost certainly coding for Cocoa on OS X."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming : An Evolutionary Approach","review":"The first three chapters are conceptual, and compare various approaches to object-oriented programming.

I assume big changes, but either way I haven't read it.)Okay, so you just got a Mac or an iPhone and you've noticed that the development tools you need are free (and, indeed, come with the computer). You go out and buy books, but you want to see the original book. Well, this is it. Congratulations, you've just purchased an interesting historical document that has almost nothing to do with Mac programming, in a language that is almost but not entirely unlike the Objective-C you'll be using to write your app.The 1986 edition is truly a time warp -- for example, the choice of \\"acetate\\" as an analogy to describe a GUI view is probably going to be lost on anyone who's only ever done page layout on a computer. Cox writes comparisons of Objective-C to Ada, C++, and Smalltalk, but the comparisons are far, far outdated. Three years before the original ANSI C standard came out, Cox was still using K&R; C as his substrate language. The coverage of how object-oriented GUI systems work is more or less on target, but since it's based on a very old version of X, it isn't very much like the OpenStep/Cocoa environment. But a bigger problem than its antiquatedness is the fact that (probably by necessity) it's three parts textbook, one part advertisement for Stepstone's (or at the time, PPI's) product. The grating and poorly-thought-through term \\"Software-IC\\" (for a binary object library) pops up everywhere.Used copies, however, can be had pretty cheaply, so if you like computer archaeology it's certainly a nice little trip to the days when object-oriented programming was just going mainstream and Steve Jobs was looking for technologies to build his NeXT system on. There's also enough source code to learn a bit about writing your own Objective-C libraries, if you know how to translate to the @ syntax that ObjC has used since not long after this book came out.

Very little is written about what the Church has done to Indian people. When we think of atrocities that were experienced by Native Americans, we tend to think that it was primarily the U.S. government that was responsible.Such was not the case, for in many instances, the Church has been responsible for genocide, sexual abuse, and kidnapping. We must face up to these facts before reconciliation can begin, and Mr. Smith's book accomplishes just that.I speak not as an outsider but as a fellow minister to Native Americans. For three years I have worked among the Omaha and Winnebago Tribes and I can tell you that &quot;Whiteman's Gospel&quot; is very factual, relevant, and much needed. Indian people rank at the bottom in academics, their young people commit suicide at rates 5 times higher than the general population, and medical facilites are either non-existent, or in disrepair. Clearly, these people are in distress and only the Church can meet many of their needs. Craig Smith's book makes those needs known.If you don't know anything about Native American ministry, then &quot;Whiteman's Gospel&quot; is a book that you must read."},{"Title":"Whiteman's Gospel","review":"Every American Christian should read this book. It is very relevant in terms of its historical and cultural perspective. True students of history know that all history is revisionist. American Christians today are often taught about this country's Christian heritage and foundation. There is an element of truth to that message, but it is often one-sided. Much of it comes from an imperialist perspective that used the Old Testament accounts of the Israelites' exodus into the promised land as the justification for the genocide of indigenous Americans.We must be very careful not to represent Christianity from a nationalist viewpoint. This book goes a long way towards exposing the truth of how Christianity was misrepresented among native peoples as a white man's religion. The same thing has come full circle in the American political arena, where Christianity is falsely being represented as the Republican religion.This misrepresentation hinders the true Christian work, which is the commission Jesus gave to go into all the world and proclaim the Good News - the news that God has canceled out the penalty of sin through his Son, who took upon himself the punishment of sin; he was crucified, and his blood ratified a covenant between all mankind and his Creator.When I read this book, I was reminded of how the notion of America being a Christian nation could actually be more of a hindrance to the work of the Gospel than a help, because if the nations associate our (American) foreign policy with Jesus Christ, how can we get their attention long enough to proclaim the good news to them? Such is the case with the American Indians who could not hear the truth of the Gospel for the volume of such ungodly actions of dishonesty an tyranny perpetrated by a \\"civilized\\" and \\"Christian\\" nation.This book puts the Christian focus back where it should be. It is a work which exalts the ministry of reconciliation, which is the real purpose the Father had when he so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son."},{"Title":"Whiteman's Gospel","review":"This is an awesome book, that I think every one should read!!

Although these books provide the reader with the basic analytic tools of measure theoretic probability, they usually fall short of presenting probability in more general (and abstract) spaces. As far as I know, there are not many good books on the subject: Billingsley &quot;Convergence of Probability Measures&quot; comes to mind, and Jacod and Shiryaev's &quot;Limit Theorems for Stochastic Processes&quot; (both excellent, and very expensive). The goal of this booklet is to fill this void and to provide a researcher with some more advanced analytical tools. The book is a &quot;selection of topics&quot; in the author's words, and I think it has no pretense of completeness. What it presents, it presents very well, with short yet rigorous proofs (as far as I can tell: I studied only the first two chapters, and the last one). The reader should know probability at least at the level of Billingsley's &quot;Probability and Measure&quot;. A basic command of topological spaces and Banach spaces is recommended. One criticism: having a PhD student in mind, the author could have spent a few more pages on examples, but this doesn't detract much from a book that is already a helpful reference and an example of good style.Finally, here are the titles of the chapters, with a short description when needed: 1. Introduction [sets the stage for random variables in Polish spaces] 2. Spaces of probability measures 3. Conditioning and martingales 4. Basic limit theorems [SLLN, CLT, LIL, Large Deviations] 5.

It was originally published in 1957. It is illustrated by Charles Schultz (of Peanuts fame), and originally featured an introduction by Walt Disney (later releases have an introduction by Bill Cosby, who hosted a second incarnation of Kids the Darndest Things! and did a poor job).In a popular segment on Linkletter's program House Party, he would interview small children, who often gave hilarious responses to (mostly) innocent questions. In this book, Linkletter presents some of his favorite moments from the show, and talks about some of the program's background, including how the children were selected.Although it loses something in its transfer to print, nearly everything in this book ranges from the amusing to the hilarious. Only the last chapter, a collection of stories that didn't happen on the show (and mostly aren't true), disappoints.

I do remember the show, and the show was quite funny, but something is definitely lost in translation. I simply found nothing in this book amusing. Trying to picture the conversations--using my imagination--made the reading more tolerable, but there was nothing I read that I would read out loud to my residents. They would certainly be sitting there with blank expressions on their face, and their thoughts would certainly be, \\"and the punch line is??\\" Cute, maybe. Hilarious, fall off your chair? no."},{"Title":"Kids Say the Darndest Things!","review":"This book was marked as new but when I recieved it, there was dirt all over the back cover and some of the pages were bent up. For the price I suppose I couldn't expect anything else, it was only 50 cents.

I know she will love it regardless of cleanliness."},{"Title":"Research for Writers (Writing Handbooks)","review":"Initially, I was excited to find this book.

If you haven't read any of his books yet, you can start here, or go back to his earlier works in paperback.Our hero, Tanner, is great...Not to uptight or politically correct...Thank goodness he's not another recovering alcoholic! He's tough, takes a lickin, but lovable too...He's got his faults, but that just makes us identify with him that much more. The plot is great (as always), steeped in current issues and events. The pages turn too fast and the end comes too quickly..Pick up this or any of his other books. Well worth even the hard cover price."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"John Marshall Tanner is back as the reluctant bodyguard to a driven sucessful novelist whose life has been threatened. Stephen Greenleaf lays bare today's literary world with a parade of suspects ranging from the jilted ex-husband to the soon to be fired agent, and the cross-dressing devoted fan obsessed with Chandelier Wells. But as always with Greenleaf what appears to be a simple mystery is actually a very complex character study. Tanner is still struggling from the death of his best friend Charley Sleet, commitment issues with his new love interest Jill Coppelia, and a daughter from an earlier indiscretion. An honorable and principled though somewhat rusted white knight with an Oreo addiction Tanner continues to do battle in in an unscrupulous world. After twenty years he's come to realize that &quot;other people's problems, particularly those brought brought on by stupidity or self-indulgence, which in my experience is most of them, seem to provoke my ire more than my sympathy these days.&quot; John Marshall Tanner may decide to retire with Elipsis. If so it will be a loss to the literary world equal to John D.MacDonald's Travis McGee. Greenleaf has expertly written a wonderful tribute to a dying breed. It will prove satisfying to even the most devoted Tanner fans. Thanks for everything, Stephen Greenleaf."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"John Marshall Tanner, private investigator, tells his story of this case. His client is Chandelier, a super successful writer of romance novels. Her secretary is Lark. Tanner's girl friend is Coppelia. And the author surely has fun inventing names. Aside from that, he writes in clear, concise language, presents a tight plot that is well thought out. It is a book that is a pleasure to read because it is written intelligently and without the usual gimmicks. What more can one ask for? I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"After the death of his police officer friend two years ago, Bay area private investigator John Marshall Tanner is dating Assistant District Attorney Jill Cappanella. He also seeks cases to pay off his bills. Best selling and wealthy author Chandelier Wells is receiving threatening letters stating &quot;If you don't stop it you will die.&quot; Chandelier may not know what the letters want halted, but she takes the warning seriously and hires Marsh to act as her bodyguard.Initially, Marsh thinks the person terrorizing the author is a diehard lunatic of a fan, trying to get a rise out of Chandelier. He changes his mind when a bomb explodes in her car killing two people and injuring Chandelier. The MO seems like that of a pro. Marsh suspects someone close or formerly close to the writer as hired a hit man. As he steps closer to the truth, Marsh places himself and his loved ones in life threatening danger.John Marshall Tanner is an extremely likable sleuth who at fifty remains vulnerable and compassionate, making him very appealing especially to women. ELLIPSIS is a fast paced but intricate work whose villains are shockers yet realistic. Stephen Greenleaf humanizes all of his characters within a fabulous tale that shows why his Tanner books have been award winners.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"This is the first book I've read by the highly recommended Greenleaf. Marshall Tanner, private investigator, is brash, sarcastic, quick-witted, and very human... He is hired to protect a suspense/romance writer who is then involved in a car bombing. Tanner's own personal life and the way Greenleaf ties the clues and different elements of the story together makes for entertaining reading that held my interest until the final surprise. His presentation of Tanner makes me want to go back and get to know him better. My guess is it will be just as satisfying as watching Michael Connelly's Hieronymous Bosch develop..."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"I wish I didn't know what &quot;ellipsis&quot; means.I wish that the author had left a few strings hanging. The Tanner series never disappoints. I recently began reading the series from the beginning and it is interesting to see the development and growth of the character. Mr. Greenleaf has crafted a man who is an accidental hero, a man whose heroism has its roots in his fundamental sense of decency and his loyalty to those whom he cherishes.The John Marshall Tanner series is worth discovering."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"I enjoy Greenleaf's work for his plots and characters, and Ellipsis displays Greenleaf at his best. The focus character, Marsh Tanner, is approaching his 50th birthday, and the book shows Tanner taking stock of his life, finances, interests and career. The life of a P.I. may be interesting, but it is a poor career choice, and Tanner knows it. Tanner finds himself the reluctant bodyguard for a famous and successful writer, and the book is full of shop-talk about writers and the business of writing. Part of the fun is seeing how the frustration of the writing biz is perceived by a character all too aware of the frustrations of the PI biz. Yet once again, through asking questions, following up leads, and getting people to talk, it is revealed that the reluctant Tanner has the skillset needed to unravel the mystery of the threats and attacks on his client. Greenleaf addresses some of the threads and characters which came up in earlier books, which gives this book a very satisfying sense of resolution."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"The 14th in the Tanner series. It's very good. Tanner is hired to bodyguard (something he rarely does) a wildly successful, but very bitchy, author. Someone wants her dead. I'm already in trouble with the spoiler police so I'll leave it at that.I'm all screwed up. I decided to read the whole series, they are that good, but now I've read three totally out of order and it would appear this is the last one Greenleaf wrote (will write) in the series, a shame. Bring Tanner back. Now I'm back to the first and will proceed in order."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"I used to love Stephen Greenleaf's John Marshall Tanner mysteries, but ELLIPSIS was tired, mechanical, and unconvincing. It reminded me of the reasons why Robert B. Parker's Spenser novels ran out of steam. For one thing, there is too much midlife crisis angst on the part of Tanner, too much relationship trouble between him and his girlfriend. For another, there are two different women of mature years who are raunchy and amusing and make Tanner blush -- one is plausible, two are excessive. For a third, the plot is warmed-over. I was reminded of Parker's LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE. Again the p.i. bodyguards a major female celebrity writer. Of course, in the Parker book the writer was lesbian; here she's straight and a romance novelist. A promising plot development -- allegations of plagiarism -- goes nowhere. Another plot line, a carryover from a previous book in the series, becomes increasingly significant, but if you haven't read the previous book you'll be frustrated and put off by the too-neat tying together of disparate plot lines. Finally, the ending of the Tanner character study in this book depends on a &quot;deus-ex-machina&quot; ending that had me throwing the book across the room."},{"Title":"Ellipsis: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"It arrived on time and in the condition described.I would use this provider again."},{"Title":"Ocean Liners: The Golden Years","review":"Curiously, this is well-illustrated book about big ships with hardly any photos of the actual ships!

To the unitiated, this is a picture that might easily have been produced by either a child or an expert...

Now that I have more confidence and have a better understanding of the structure of knit works, I realize it's not me with the problem, it's the book.I cannot convey the amount of frustration I felt as a new knitter -- I would follow instructions to the dot, and have to rip out my work and try again, over and over again.

Whether I'm working on a particular stitch for the first time or simply need a reminder on how it's properly done, this book has been a tremendous help.For those learning the very basics, this may or may not be a good guide (knit/purl are only 2 pgs). As with any skill, you can't expect to be a master in an hour or even a week. Personally, I learned with help from owners of yarn stores and even from a few online videos. However, once I learned the basics, this book (no joke) taught me the rest and now I can pretty much handle any pattern, regardless of the level of difficulty. That's not to say that I don't need help now and then... I do... but most of my questions are answered in this book.This book is most helpful with the methods of casting-on, knitting in the round, correcting dropped stitches, finishing (sewing two pieces together), blocking, picking up stitches (knitting from another finished piece), and other random things like buttonholes.In my opinion, it's a \\"must have\\" for all knitters."},{"Title":"The Knitting Directory","review":"I've worked up about 15 patterns and found mistakes in 3 of them, and 2 weren't worth the time.

I will say that it is true there are inaccuracies in a few patters, but once you start knitting and master the basics from this book, you'll be able to spot the misprinted directions.

(See his review of 'Why I am not a Muslim') So I think it would be safe to say that the writers he has recomended are hardly the most useful never mind trustworthy.Concerning the book, it is a short introduction to Islam. Similar to Islam and the destiny of man but in less detail. It covers the basic fundamentals of the religion and how they are undertood by its followers. It seems it was intended as an introduction to Islam for non Muslims rather than a book intended for Muslim and it would probably be worth a read if one was intending to travel to a predominant Muslim country or had dealings with a large Muslim community in his/her own area and wanted a book that would give then a brief but clear idea of how Muslims live their lives.One negative though has to be the title. Considering since early orientalism to this present day their has been an obsession with the veil (far more than in the Muslim world itself where it is hardly discussed) and 'lifting the veil' 'beyond the veil' 'under the veil' uncovering the veil' (would seem some writers have more of an interest in staring at 'exotic' eastern women than actually studying the Middle East) It is such a pity that this book should continue the trend with such a silly title."},{"Title":"Unveiling Islam (Islamic Texts Society)","review":"This is a very good introductory text on Islam, concise yet comprehensive, enunciating not only the basic precepts and principles upon which the faith rests, but also containing quite detailed chapters on the civilisation and culture which stemmed from the historical inception of the faith. I would recommend this book especially for people born and living in the West, or who have had significant contact with the now dominant Western mode of living, as the author - himself having been born and lived in the West - writes in a way which acts as a bridge, connecting and establishing a bond of understanding over the gulf which presently separates the two cultures. A non-Muslim reader will gain a real insight into the mind and heart of a true Muslim - someone who really believes - becoming familiar not only with how he thinks and what he feels, but also with what motivates him and how he acts. The quality of the translation from the original French into English is superlative: lucid, accurate and easily comprehensible. All-in-all, this is one of the best introductory texts on Islam I have come across in the English language, and, on a more personal level, I would say that this book is an essential step which needs to be taken, in allowing sincere, thinking people anywhere to forge an understanding of the world and existence in a viable and tenable manner, at once congruous with modern knowledge and discoveries, and yet, at the same time, consistent with ancient wisdom and truths."},{"Title":"Unveiling Islam (Islamic Texts Society)","review":"I was very pleased to have been recommended this book by a friend and I understood why once I started.

I would highly recommend it to both Muslims and non-Muslims who are interested in understanding the faith. The author gives enough of an introduction to satisfy questions."},{"Title":"Unveiling Islam (Islamic Texts Society)","review":"Make no mistake, this book is written solely with the purpose of converting readers to Islam. For that reason, the seven chapters herein chiefly set out to present Islam as unrivaled in its purity, and to outline of demands for an Islamic life. Apart from belief in one god, this requires acceptance of the \\"unity\\" of the Muslim community and a belief that Islam is, to quote from the Koran (Sura 3: 199) \\"the best community to have been raised up for mankind.\\"This would explain why the book was published by the Islamic Texts Society, whose purpose is to extend Islamic evangelism, or Da'wa, to all non-Muslims. In classic Islamic form, the reader is \\"invited to discover a world,\\" in other words, invited to convert to Islam.Thus Chapter 4, entitled \\"A miracle and its progression in history,\\" makes the ridiculous claim (through quotation from Francesco Gabrieli's Muhammad and the Arab Conquest) that \\"No one was converted by the sword.\\" Still more absurd (and unsubstantiated) is the claim that \\"Arabs never presented the people they had conquered with the choice between death and the acceptance of their faith.\\"On the contrary, the historical record makes precisely this pattern clear in land after land, and region after region, as denoted in such scholars as Bat Ye'or (The Decline of Eastern ChristianityandIslam and Dhimitude),K.S. Laland others.If you buy this book, do so only with the understanding that it in no way purports to be impartial or balanced. The sole purpose of this text, stated clearly at the outset, is to convert infidels and kafirs to Islam, nothing less. Moreover, misrepresenting history is part and parcel of that process.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Unveiling Islam (Islamic Texts Society)","review":"This book is written scholarly to dispel the wrong notions about Islam in the West, especially in America where the ultra right Christian and Jewish political and religious machines are working hard day and night to dehumanize Muslims and Islam by any means. In their view, Islam can not be presented even from a neutral point of view. This author of this book outlined Islam in a completely unbiased fashion. If you honestly want to learn truth about Islam and work toward the mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence, this book is definitely for you. But if you adamantly fall into \\"Israel first, America distant second\\" category, then this book is definitely not for you."},{"Title":"Unveiling Islam (Islamic Texts Society)","review":"Unless you believe that Darwin's Theory of Evolution suggests that we are \\"perfected monkeys\\" (page 1) or are prepared to accept that \\"cosmic acceleration\\" is \\"clearly visible\\" in the last years of the twentieth century (page 10) don't read this book. It will just make you grind your teeth.If you need any further persuasion, as an example the author puts forward the view that \\"Islam appears to man's intellect rather than his sentimentality\\" but then goes on to explain that this is \\"primordial\\" intellect : not the capacity for involved reasoning\\"and so on and so on.In precis. The only thing unveiled is the view that the world (the Western, Modern and secular world that is) is corrupt and meaningless, and that submission to predestination is the answer."},{"Title":"So You Want To Build a Live Steam Locomotive","review":"The only book I've seen of it's kind available in the USA....it is a highly detailed composition from a steam engineer's point of view.....not for the pure beginner...written in the 70's....some knowledge of metal working and model live steam engines helpful.....best part about book shows how to make steam whistles and laying track...however, the deep theory about how steam actually flows and the workings of the pipes inside the boilers was not very clear.....but a good book for hours of reading enjoyment.....worth the price for the serious or junior modeler."},{"Title":"So You Want To Build a Live Steam Locomotive","review":"The information in this book makes up a great reference for building a locomotive, but doesn't give details on important topics.

I have some experience with restoring full size steam, so I understood some things that might mystify a newbee. At the same time, he answers questions like \\"how much does it cost?\\" \\"What tools do I need?\\" This isn't a plan book, but will help you understand the basics of how things go together, and make some basic choices of how YOU would like to build your loke. It helped me understand how small scale and full size are constructed differently. Be prepared to spend some time *studying* the drawings - very well done, but sometimes rules of orthographic projection are intentionally broken to show certain aspects of an assembly.I think the chapter on valve gears could have been reworked, too many types covered briefly, and he seems to have a notion that Walshaerts gear with piston valves is the way to go, and so covers this in detail, slide valve with Stephenson gear is the best choice for a first engine I think, much simpler. He does cover these items to some degree.You will want to buy other books if you're serious about building, but I wouldn't want to be without this one.

In this novel, though, there is a gleam of hope beneath the dusty debris of the everyday, perhaps precisely because, in the lives of the women featured in this novel, the everyday has been disrupted. Each of the four primary female characters (Elizabeth of the title being the central character) is in the hospital, one trying to see through a successful pregnancy after many failures and the other three having hysterectomies. Each, lying in bed and surrounded by strangers, is forced to look at herself through strangers' eyes, to regard herself and the people in her life in a new light. And in each woman's life, a significant rupture occurs during this time of forced contemplation. Trevor thus puts to us the question: what if we were forced to deal with each crisis, removed from the comfort of the everyday, removed from our everyday perfeceptions not only of others but of our very on selves? It is a fascinating question and one that Trevor probes deeply and gently, exposing each nerve fiber laid raw by these circumstances. In the stripped-down setting of a four-bed hospital room, Trevor asks us to realize what it truly is to reflect on the difficulties, troubles, and disasters of daily life-- when we are stripped bare of the defenses that we are so accustomed to using to buffer raw emotions. Elizabeth Alone is a quiet, yet powerful, work."},{"Title":"Elizabeth Alone","review":"Readers of Trevor's more recent books--Death in Summer, Felicia's Journey, Two Lives, After Rain--will enjoy this earlier novel, which has all the trademark Trevor strengths: economy, wit, good carpentry, and that rare thing, truth."},{"Title":"When God cries: Portrait of a child slayer","review":"This could happen to you!

You would then understand the death of JFK, and why does Elisabeth II always carry a bag with her."},{"Title":"The Immortals","review":"Here's a chillingly effective novel, one that promises secrets & certainly delivers the goods. It's told in two parts, using an almost journalistic style of reporting events, which makes it all the more compelling & believable.The first half begins in the 1950s and follows two French lovers, Jeanne & Roland, while also depicting mysterious scenes of world leaders & secret services at work. It's obvious that Roland is somehow involved in some worldwide conspiracy, even if he isn't aware of it; and when he vanishes, Jeanne devotes her life to finding him, even though he's supposedly dead ... like so many others in suspiciously similar circumstances.The second half reveals the great secret & the workings of the conspiracy in the early 1970s. It gives nothing away to reveal that Jeanne eventually finds Roland -- and at that point, with half the book still to go, I wondered if it had run out of energy & suspense. Far from it! Once the reader grasps the nature of the secret & all its possible consequences, the suspense actually grows more intense. We realize just how easily something could go wrong, especially with so many people involved ...To say more would be to spoil the story. It's definitely worth tracking down & reading! And I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers that this would make a terrific film. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Immortals","review":"This book is a masterpiece of politic/fiction. Barjavel shows amazing mastery and errudition in creating an incredible fiction that happens to fit all the major events in the world during the cold war.

If only the makers of the X-Files were a little bit more learned.If you can't find this book in English, go learn French and get it in French.

As a result, you barely scratch the surface of these complex programs. I am a beginner myself, and already there are things I want to learn that I can't find in this book. Its clearly written for slow college students, and while I'm a college student myself I find this book to be too slow and elementary. I covered almost the whole flash section in about two days. If you are completely new to working with images, video timelines, and web publishing, this book would probably be fine, in fact, perfect for you, as it pays close attention to the beginner's details. However, I've worked with Adobe Photoshop and have done some web publishing before, so the step by step instructions are rather intuitive. Also the examples used throughout the book are incredibly unprofessional and unrealistic for practical use, so you feel like you're learning to draw stick figures and make goofy personal web pages when you're trying to learn to make something professional and marketable.If you aren't particularly serious about learning these programs and just want to play around with them, and if you don't have any, meaning zero, experience with photo applications and web publishing, buy this book.

There are parts which will make you laugh and others which will make you want to hug your dad again and treasure your times with your kids."},{"Title":"Inside the Criminal Courts","review":"This is an excellent and innovative textbook. Instead of just teaching you about concepts, the author has actually incorporated the concepts into entertaining stories. So, instead of just reading about the courtroom work group or challenges in court, you get to see these concepts in action as you read stories about key courtroom players (lawyers, judges, defendants, etc...). Each key vocabulary word is put in bold so that you can recognize it when you read it. In addition the words, not the definitions, are listed again at the end of the chapter, just in case you missed one. I am graduating this summer, so this is one of my final classes. I have never enjoyed a textbook so much. I wish all textbooks were written in this manner. It has been a tremendous way for me to learn and has helped me to retain information. I highly recommend this book to any criminal justice teacher who is looking for a refreshing change or interesting addition to their classroom or to anyone who has an interest in just exactly what goes on inside the criminal courts."},{"Title":"Inside the Criminal Courts","review":"I Just finished reading this book and Love it!

The price of the textbook was very reasonable."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"I found this book to be very uneven. Yes I know not a very original beginning. Anyway I was rather disappointed in this work. The author was a former British Army officer and throughout his work there is a heavy condescending air towards the Irish and their grievances. I felt like he was saying that if the silly little Micks had simply been patient their good and benevolent masters would have taken care of everything.Very unpleasent. I am not in anyway connected to the Irish Problem, but I found myself with a growing dislike of the author's point-of-view. And I also found the author to be very biased-which is intriuging since this book was written in 1958 and the new outbreak of secterian violence in Northern Ireland was over ten years away. He gives scant attention to the Irish point of view and simply states that the majority of Irish simply wanted peace. I found that to be simplistic. I give it two stars because he dosen't gloss over the criminal acts of the police and British military though he does try to rationalize them while ridiculing the IRA. I was hoping for better things from this book. It's very difficult to find good pieces on the Irish Rebellion and unfortunely this book is not a great addition to my collection. I picked it up for a dollar in the bargain bin at a local book store and now it will be going to my local library. But if you know absolutely nothing about this period it is better then nothing. At least it is a starting point for bigger and better things."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"I read this book a year ago after I bought it in a bookshop in Galway during my last visit to Ireland. After a year's reflection, there are three features of this work which deserve comment.Firstly, this is not a dispassionate view of history. Far from it, there are areas in which the spin made me uneasy to the point of skin crawl. Moreover this polemic, though filled with quotes, contains neither attribution nor footnotes. The illustrations are, in contrast, attributed in the acknowledgements. The bibliography is scant, less than one-tenth of the references contained in a work I am currently reading about the Irish War of Independence. That the author was a British Army officer with a discernable agenda is widely accepted.I heartily recommend this book to everyone interested in the period who is not from the British Isles as a must read if you are to ever understand Ireland's relationship with Britain.There is no contradiction here. Bennett could be a representative example of the British ruling class attitude toward the Irish. Although I was pained at some of his clumsier attempts at whitewashing the Black & Tan paramilitary police, I found Bennett's attitude vastly illuminating. If one grasps this attitude, should it prove widely applicable, it does wonders to explain the lack of communication that existed between the British and the Irish until relatively recent times. Think of it as a time capsule.Leading to the second point, Bennett could have summed up very briefly: The British used regular army troops brutalized by trench warfare in place of civilian police. These troops ran amok, the British newspapers picked it up, sensationalized it and these sensational reports weakened a crucial portion of public opinion in Britain towards retaining Ireland in the Union.The second point is not that Bennett was less than succinct but that the scenario outlined above was exploited by insurgents for the remainder the century. Arguably, it may have got it's birth in the Boer War but the IRA and the IRB honed it to the point where it was a marketable franchise picked up in total by everyone from the Irgun and Lehi to FARC. Switching to the other side of the conflict, one needs only look to recent events to see governments employing military units in place of civilian police with exactly the same consequences. First as tragedy, thereafter as farce, anyone?The last point worthy of making is to ask why did not an author with the stature of Foster or Lee write this book? I find it difficult to believe that Irish scholarship would stand idly by and let an apologist write the definitive work on the Black and Tans."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"This book was written by an author and ex-British lieutenant colonel, Richard Bennett, and it is a history of the Irish War of Independence focusing primarily on the Back and Tans. The book begins with the Easter Rising of 1916, and follows the war through to its final conclusion in 1921.Overall, I found this to be a pretty good book. It is true that, in spite of the title, the book is not primarily about the Black and Tans. But, nonetheless, I found it to be a pretty good book on the War. The book is somewhat spoiled by the author&#8217;s tendency to editorialize, dropping witty little comments about both sides and their pretensions. But nonetheless, I did enjoy the book, finding it to be very informative on the Irish War of Independence."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"Richard Bennett describes the work of the Black and Tan soldiers in Ireland near the turn of the last century. He labels them as \\"the toughest, the wildest, and the most feared\\" of all British soldiers. The Black and Tans were sent to Ireland in 1920 by Prime Minister David Lloyd George to suppress the growing republican movement. As history shows, their violence did not squelch the drive for independence. The Black and Tans were essentially given carte blanche and they used it. They tortured and murdered Irish citizens at will. The soldiers received their name because of their uniforms-- it so happened that a pack of wild dogs that once tormented County Limerick had similar colorings as the soldiers' uniforms and thus the nickname stuck. By the next year, the Black and Tans had been so successful in their mission that even the British tide of opinion shifted against them. Bennett, who was a military man himself, articulately recounts the havoc wreaked on Ireland by the Black and Tans and does an excellent job of placing the reader right in the environment. It is also worth noting that the book comes with many wonderful b/w photos of the time."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"I enjoyed this book. It debunked much of the mythology that people my age were exposed to. As a child, I knew some IRA men. They were formidable characters. My hero Michael Collins took a drubbing in this book. The use of condescending adjectives for bishops was a turn-off. Nevertheless, Bennett provides a very valuable service."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"I purchased this book in a university shop more or less because I was interested in the photographs of the last days of British rule in the South of Ireland. I was particularly taken by the devastation of the City of Cork and also the striking photo of three Black and Tans guarding a sports day at a hospital.The latter prompted me to recall the beach scene in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; when the American soldiers are recreating a beach leisure activity and the more they tried the more perverse it seemed. No doubt it was also a scene replicated in Kenya and Malaya and in a hundred other places prior to the British leaving.The actual account while obviously partisan to the British is I think a very honest attempt at covering this period and the author is honest enough to admit that the British police carried out activities that were in effect not much different to those carried out by the Germans in occupied territories. He doesn't mention the effects the large scale reprisals had on the merchant class but does mention that a plethora of pro-unionist bodies such as chambers of commerce were induced by the havoc to change sides in favour of the IRA.He mentions at least two IRA atrocities of note which are often glossed over in pro-republican accounts and the least convincing of his accounts is probably the massacre of civilians in Dublin by the British at Croke Park an event covered in the &quot;Michael Collins&quot; motion picture by Neil Jordan.As objective an account as one might hope for from a former British Officer, it is a pity the modern war in the North did not have similar accounts by later variants of the same."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"I didn't know the details of Richard Bennett's background but it didn't take long for me to know this book is definitely biased toward the British. Bennett appears to think the Irish would have been perfectly happy to remain under British rule had those in charge in Dublin not bungled their 'rule' a bit and had a few ruffians not insisted on pushing for Independence. And wasn't it nasty for those Irish heros to wage their war when the Brits were otherwise occupied elsewhere?!"},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"We read this for our Irish Book Club & there were diverse opinions. Since the book is written by a British officer, it is critical of Michael Collins & the IRA. Our group made the comparison with the US in Iraq & Afghanistan today. No matter how justified the intervention, the local guerrilla groups will react and the US or Britain will be drawn into a quagmire that makes their soldiers behave overly violently. With the political restraints at home in US & Britain, the soldiers are not given the mandate to win."},{"Title":"The Black and Tans","review":"I bought this book on the title alone - big mistake. Expecting to find more detailed information on the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force (The black and tans), I was sorely disappointed. The book takes a quick, general and superficial look at the Irish \\"war\\" of independance, albeit with a somewhat pro-British bias. The activities and men of the black and tans is not covered in more detail than in other general accounts of this conflict."},{"Title":"Southern Railroad Man: Conductor N. J. Bell's Recollections of the Civil War Era (Railroads in America)","review":"I work as a conductor for a freight line and became intersted in the history of railroading beyond the stuff written by historians and train buffs about the Robber Barons and the building of the Trans-Continental Railroad. Bell worked for the early southern railroads when men were made of steel and the boxcars were made of wood. A pulitzer prize winner it is not, but well worth the read if you want to know how they did it way back then."},{"Title":"Southern Railroad Man: Conductor N. J. Bell's Recollections of the Civil War Era (Railroads in America)","review":"This is a fascinating and touching first-hand account of the struggles of an honest hard-working railroad man through the upheavals of the War and its aftermath.

Instead I got rivalry and family problems and I know the way I say this sounds no better than my first opinion but nevertheless this book is way cool! I think Brad is a total jerk and I'm SO glad that Alison broke up with him. I mean, talk about a waste of space! Sheesh. And the way Ilene Cooper(the writer,)makes Mr.O'leary talk seems so... real. I actually feel SYMPATHY for the characters in this story, I mean the way they talk, act and feel seems so realistic. The promblem (or the good thing) about Jamie and Alison is they are practically EQUAL. I mean Alison is all sweet, innocent, pretty, nice and understanding but she's WAY too goody-goody and easy to push around. Now Jamie is also pretty but in a different way, even though she is also a redhead. See Jamie is more curvy and athletic-looking, (at least that's how I think of her,) and Alison is all slim and angelic-looking. Now Jamie has a tougher life and is more of an individual while Alison depends so much on her &quot;mommy and daddy&quot;. I feel sorry for the O'leary family cause everything is all messed up. In the summary of the book I don't think it's right to mention Jamie's diet. It wasn't that big of a deal. Dana is a total and complete, I mean &quot;incomplete&quot; airhead and is totally weird and unreasonably pushy. I LUV it when Jamie told her off, she had it coming. I sort of think it isn't fair, at the prom, Jamie had a great time (except for ugh, Brad,) and Alison had practically the worst night of her life because of duh... Brad. I wish Elsie appeared more in the story, she's cute. Overall, this book is a must-read and you better read it or else... P.S. I apologise for my uhh... strange way of speaking.

Basically what I'm thinking is they could've done better to discuss evolutionary designs as opposed to completely new (relatively speaking) concepts. Either way it's a great book, -Ali"},{"Title":"Megawatts and Megatons: The Future of Nuclear Power and","review":"This is a strange book. Actually, it's two books in one, with a dopey chapter for children thrown in for good measure. The first half is about nuclear power, both in energy production and weapons. The second half is an editorial for nuclear disarmament. The authors make no attempt to divorce their politics from the discussion. Even the first, more substantive half of the book is liberally laced with disarmament talking points.Notwithstanding their views on disarmament, the authors support nuclear power and do a pretty good job explaining the scientific, financial and engineering aspects of the Peaceful Atom. If the portions on nuclear power were available separately as a pamphlet I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. On balance, however, those few chapters don't justify wading through the entire book."},{"Title":"Megawatts and Megatons: The Future of Nuclear Power and","review":"In Megawatts and Megatons, Garwin and Charpak collaborated on an excellent description of nuclear power and weapons, starting with discussions of nuclear physics and energy, and ending with a narrative of post WWII international relations, centered upon arms control and prevention of use of nuclear weapons.The authors have strong opinions on the proper use of nuclear energy and the means to reduce dependence on nuclear weapons, as one would imagine from two scientific practitioners. As such, they have presented a well-developed argument that aims to convince the reader that the U.S. should modify its energy and nuclear weapons policies to reduce the threats of global warming and nuclear contamination as well as nuclear conflict and terrorism.Unfortunately for the layman, the technical nature of the first portion of the book may make difficult reading for the reader without a background in science or engineering, although the authors do make an effort to describe the concepts so that the non-expert may understand.I recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the technical description of nuclear power and weapons, nuclear policy, and recommendations new policy directions."},{"Title":"Megawatts and Megatons: The Future of Nuclear Power and","review":"For me this was a required text for a college course on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and energy. I can honestly say that if you are a person with a significant scientific background you will enjoy this read. The authors (Charpak and Garwin) present facts about all areas of nuclear issues.The authors explain in detail about past, current, and future nuclear power generation and its impact on the human race. In addition they go into detail on the upsides and pitfalls of nuclear versus fossil fuel energy production. In the same regard the authors discuss the past, current, and future of nuclear weapons. The authors provide a detailed schedule for nuclear disarmament, which they really mean as a dwindling of nuclear arms.The authors do a fantastic job of explaining the effects of nuclear power production and nuclear weapons on human life. The fact that the catastrophe at Chernobyl had far less impact on human life than mainstream media would have you believe was interesting.All in all the authors provide an incredible amount of information on the past and future of nuclear arms and nuclear power.Negative reviews of this book are most likely from people who do not understand the vast amount of math and units used in this book. The authors do their best of explain Sv, eV, MWe, and other units, but if you do not have a basic understanding of physics and SI units you may find this book difficult to understand.To the scientifically inclined - enjoy this read and understand that nuclear power will play an integral role in our future as is the curbing of our dependence on nuclear weapons as our supreme power in the world."},{"Title":"Megawatts and Megatons: The Future of Nuclear Power and","review":"This book manages to be informative without being boring.

I read Kukoff's book and Embracing the Convenant for the same reasons but was looking for a single person's journey in depth rather than a bunch of quotes or a series of stories by others. Shires doesn't speak just for herself, though, but for many who are wondering about taking such a huge step. Judaism is a different world view. Even making a meal involves questions and decisions. She talks about moments like that. This is not a how-to book but it treats the steps that someone takes who has to go slow towards life change. Courses, rituals at home, going to synagogue, coming to terms with family and the past. The parts on Torah didn't bother me. I read them as another aspect of Jewish life that a convert deals with. There is a section early in the book where she stands up for Judaism before she knows she will convert that I found convincing as part of the process of deciding. Plus she's not afraid of being wrong or appearing stupid. Shires even laughs at herself now and then which is good in a book like this. Two of the interesting women she met on the journey were the artist Helene Aylon and the author Blu Greenberg. I believe the chapter on women and Judaism brought together well a lot of ideas that I've read about here and there but hadn't put together before. I found the book helpful and will go back to it."},{"Title":"Coming Home: A Woman's Story Of Conversion To Judaism","review":"Some books make you think and this is one of them. She engages with the traditions in different ways than most. It challenged me to think about Jewish life and Torah freshly. I found the beginning and the last section about going to Germany most moving."},{"Title":"Coming Home: A Woman's Story Of Conversion To Judaism","review":"I agree with the reviewer who felt that Ms. Shires's textual analysis didn't flow well. I found the majority of this book to be rather dull, tedious, slow-going, and uninvolving. It was an original idea to tell the story of her conversion by relating issues she had difficulty with or areas she found inspiration in to certain passages of Torah and the similar writings of others, but it just didn't seem executed well. If this is supposed to be a conversion memoir, why does so little of the book actually concern her conversion or even her herself? The sections when Ms. Shires is writing about herself, such as in the beginning section, the ending chapter about her visit to her husband's native Germany, and the middle chapter about the mikvah, are quite good and interesting, because they're actually related to her life and to her conversion and not just tediously rambling on about certain Torah passages.From reading this, it seems as though she were the classic child who does not know enough to ask. She says she did a lot of reading prior to her conversion because she really wanted to know the religion and to approach it from a variety of disciplines, but in many sections she admits that she didn't know about some pretty important things or issues till after she converted. For example, she says that she hadn't had a lot of education about the mikveh and had been too embarrassed to ask her converting rabbi, and therefore went into her conversion day feeling she had to immerse herself because she was thought to be \\"contaminated\\" and \\"dirty\\" as a non-Jew and had to cleanse herself before being admitted to the tribe. How could anyone in any denomination, particularly if she's had such a long process of education and learning as Ms. Shires evidentally had, reach conversion day thinking such a thing and not having learnt more about the custom of mikveh? (I was also annoyed that her chapter on the mikveh used the dated and inaccurate translations \\"contaminated\\" and \\"unclean\\" for the Hebrew words \\"tumah\\" and \\"tamei.\\" That continues to give the completely false impression that menstruating women are thought to be dirty and unclean, when in actual fact the words surrounding this state of being are translated more like \\"ritually impure,\\" and the impurity refers to a spiritual, not a physical, state of being.)I was also left wondering why she converted under the auspices of the Conservative Movement when she so clearly feels ill at ease with many of their official positions, or at least the positions her own community seems to take. She really seems like she'd feel more at home in a Reform, Reconstructionist, or Renewal community. I'm also baffled as to why she frequently says that the Conservative Movement hasn't done enough for the inclusion of gays and women, unless her community isn't as liberal as many other Conservative communities are. Or are the changes of the past few decades not radical and sweeping enough for her? I also share her belief that women, gays, the disabled, and other groups that traditionally haven't always been included fully in Jewish life need to be completely integrated and granted full equality and participation in the community, but at times her call for this reads more like a political polemic and speaking from personal experience as opposed to really representing the great strides the Conservative Movement has made in these areas in the past few decades. I'm not doubting her personal experiences with people she's known and what she's dealt with in her own community, but it just seems baffling if she's trying to say the entire Conservative Movement takes those positions as well.A couple of interesting chapters do not a very recommendable book make. Most of this was just very slow going for me, and the divrei Torah weren't that novel or insightful either. I've heard most of these interpretations and analyses before, only not in such dull language. I'm actually disappointed I bought this book, though at least I got a cheap used copy. I'd looked forward to reading a conversion memoir, but instead got a tedious exercise in boredom that had almost nothing to do with the author's life, either before, during, or after her conversion."},{"Title":"Coming Home: A Woman's Story Of Conversion To Judaism","review":"I have read many individual conversion stories to Judaism. The majority are remarkable and beautiful as they highlight the personal transformation of an individual's path to conversion. That said, I found this book to be very tedious.

I learned a lot about her, that she was born in 1971 and died in 1995. She had one brother and one sister. Selena had sold more than 35,000 CD'S before her unfortunate death.This book has 11 chapters and 13 women are featured in each chapter. This book explains when the women were born and when they died and what they accomplished in their lives.Another woman I will like to talk about is Julia Alvarez. She is a great Dominican writer. Alvarez won the 2002 Nebraska Book Award for ''Before We Were Free.'' Also Mrs. Alvarez wrote the book ''In the Time of the Butterflies'' to remember the real life murder of the Three Mirabals sisters who were assassinated for the opposition of the dictator Rafael Trujillo.If you want to know more information about Selena, Julia Alvarez and other Latina women read ''The Book of Latina Women.''I really recommened this book for anyone ages 10 and up.This book meant a lot to me because it talks about women from my culture and my friends' cultures. It is also important for us to learn about successful women from many cultures.

Omega-3 fatty acids and heart disease","review":"George Lucas said, &quot;From my point of view, the film industry died in 1965.&quot; After reading Mark Litwak's comprehensive overview of the New Hollywood system, I have to agree. Litwak painstakingly outlines the changes that have occurred following the break up of the studio system, both in terms of the rise of agents and agencies as power brokers and in terms of the emphasis placed on star packaging. REEL POWER gets much of its power from extensive interviews with those on the front lines of filmmaking as well as the powerful elite. Litwak does an excellent job of weaving quotes and anecdotes throughout his explanation of the system, a system which seems to run on fear and ego. One of the strongest elements of this text is its clear and savvy organization. Litwak breaks down his analysis by the trends that characterize New Hollywood -- the rise of CAA, the role of deal-making and the new power brokers -- and the major roles in the business -- writers, directors, actors, producers. He spends some time discussing other, less well-known aspects of the business, including independent filmmaking, marketing, distriubtion and exhibition. One of the purposes of REEL POWER is to debunk some of the lingering myths about Hollywood, particularly the notion of overnight success and the casting couch. Overall, this is a comprehensive, thoroughly-researched, well-written cautionary tale about the excesses of an industry that churns out flops as regularly as it dismisses substantive talent in favor of the flavor of the moment."},{"Title":"Evaluation of publicly available scientific evidence regarding certain nutrient-disease relationships: 7. Omega-3 fatty acids and heart disease","review":"This book may be a little outdated--but sadly, probably not that much. What it's done for me is reinforce my belief that there is little point in trying to work in today's Hollywood. Not if you aspire to make films with any insight at all into what used to be called The Human Condition.It's a factory town, and films get made not because of original characters or stories but because the system has to be kept moving. And I don't think I'm feeling particuarly cynical about this tonight just because I saw George Lucas' latest disagreeable contribution to a town and system he claims to despise today.It's just that it's been years since I saw a studio picture that seemed alive."},{"Title":"Evaluation of publicly available scientific evidence regarding certain nutrient-disease relationships: 7.

She evokes soot, worn wooden floors, and the sparkle of sunlight. She does such a good job, in fact, that most of Hambly's books are part of larger series, such as fantasy trilogies or a mystery series (e.g. her Benjamin January mysteries, set in 1840s New Orleans). This is one of the few exceptions: Stranger at the Wedding is a standalone story, so you won't have the sense of commitment to a whole universe.In this world, magic works. Magicians are distrusted because of the power they could wield, however, so they are not permitted to marry, to own significant property, or to have a business with more than a few employees. Most mages have withdrawn from the world to learn and research but not to use magic pragmatically; each takes a vow not to use magic to benefit any human. And most of them live in a remote... well, monastary covers it. Some \\"dog wizards\\" do their best to eke out a living in the cities, but most of them are poor. Meanwhile, the society-at-large has reached the age of steam and coal; the industrial evolution is underway. (This is a nice change from the usual feudal era in which most magic is presented.)One of those mages is Kyra, a 24 year old woman of \\"good family\\" who was ejected from her parents' home after her magical abilities became public. (Kyra has a \\"bit part\\" in an earlier trilogy, but you definitely don't need to have read that one.) When she gets a premonition that her betrothed sister will die on Alix's wedding night, she feels that she must go back home to deal with the threat.I've owned this book since it first came out (in the 80s? early 90s?), and I've read it several times in the intervening years. It isn't that it's *wonderful*, but it's engaging, particularly when I want the reader's eqivalent of \\"comfort food:\\" entertain me, but don't make me work too hard. Kyra has a wonderful smartass sense of humor, the romance feels \\"real\\" (even if it's actually love at first sight), and the storytelling -- as usual, with Hambly -- is excellent. Even though I've read this book several times before, it kept me reading late at night, after midnight, when I *knew* I had to get up at 6."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"Nicely tongue-in-cheek -- until it gets Very Dark -- fantasy/romance, much in the style of Georgette Heyer's Regency romances, though the underlying McGuffin is rather nasty.Kyra the Red would be very typically a Georgette Heyer type heroine -- impetuous, tall, a bit physically clumsy, unrecognising of her own idiosyncratic beauty, unwed at an unfashionably late age -- who has the added misfortune to be a wizard.A wizard, in a world in which the Church begrudgingly allows one wizards' order to exist, with the proviso that the wizards may not use their magic to affect the world outside their walls. To use unauthorised magic is an automatic sentence of death.And Kyra has come home for her younger sister's wedding; home, where she knows she is not welcome in her father's house.Home, where she quickly discovers that someone else is trying to steal away the groom, using illicit purchased magic.Home, where she cleverly and subtly uses her forbidden powers to stall or prevent the wedding. (The mice are a particularly good touch, and Don Maitz's typically lyrical cover refers masterfully to that sequence.)Home, where her prophetic dreams have told her that a curse decrees that her sister's marriage bed will be her deathbed.Home, where she finds herself, uncomfortably, increasingly attracted to her sister's betrothed... who seems (after he gets over thinking her somewhat addled) to return her regard...There can be little doubt that Hambly had Georgette Heyer in mind when writing this -- compare it to, oh, \\"The Grand Sophy\\" or \\"The Masqueraders\\" -- and i do not think that Heyer would have felt offended by this tribute."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"Kyra's family disowned her when she decided to become a magician. She comes back only because she must -- because she has a foreboding that her sister will die on her wedding night.Working magic in secret, Kyra tries to postpone the wedding long enough to solve the mystery. Yet something completely unexpected happens -- she finds herself drawn to her sister's fiance, Spens! (Though at first glance he seems like a stout merchant with bad fashion sense, Spens is a great character.)My biggest problem with this book is the structure of the plot. Important information about the past is withheld, and when the reader learns that information, we pretty much figure out who did it. But I enjoyed this book so much that I didn't mind.I've heard Barbara Hambly's other fantasy books are even better. Now, I can't wait to read them.I gave this book Desert Isle Keeper status at All About Romance."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"This book is another wonderful story set in the world of Antryg Windrose, although neither he nor Joanna Sheraden appears in it. I think the Windrose Chronicles happen to be Hambley's best series, and this book certainly lives up to that expectation. ... After she arrives the fur begins to fly between her and her estranged family, but once she meets the prospective groom and his family the fun really begins as she tries to delay the wedding and find out who wants her sister dead. This book is once again a great mix of fantasy and mystery, which seems to be a Hambley staple. Also typical of a Hambley book, the prose just draws the reader in, and enough twists and turns occur in the plot that you are never quite sure what is going to happen next. At various times throughout the book the reader will empathize with each of the main characters, which again points to the wonderful and heartfelt character development that I have come to expect from Hambley. This is a great book, and I encourage new and old Hambley fans to track it down and read it. I only hope she writes a few more stories about the characters in this strange new world."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"Continuing the thread started in her Windrose Chronicles,Barbara Hambly weaves yet another yarn that is well-spunwith character depth and a plot that, convoluted as it maysometimes seem, is internally consistent and easy to swallow -despite its liberal sprinkling of wizards, ghosts, spells andcurses. The story includes characters and a historic settingthat is comfortable and familiar to any who have read herWindrose Chronicles, yet the story is independent of thoseworks and stands on its own, with a very different perspectiveon the politics and day-to-day lives of the inhabitants of theEmpire.Kyra - whom we met briefly in Hambly's &quot;Dog Wizard,&quot; is thecentral character, and her unravelling of the mystery as to whathas twisted her own developing magic skills, who and what isthreatening the life of her sister, and how to navigate throughthe quagmire of paternal resentment, socialite scheming, thesuspicions of the Church's Magic Office and her surprisinglyconflicted heart over the man who would be her brother-in-law,are expertly and masterfully interwoven by Hambly's skills asa storyteller. A very good read - even more than once."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"This was one of my first forays into fantasy several years ago. I enjoyed it then, and upon rereading it, I find it holds up rather well.Hambly excels at describing, in a matter-of-fact manner, surroundings that may be fantastic, unreal. Kyra is bold, even fierce, and in Spens we find a surprising equal. The magic in the book is fun, the plot engrossing, and the ending is perfect."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"This book is refreshing, because it's not another &quot;fight the dark evil god&quot; too common in fantasy. The story is about a predicted curse, and who have done it ? And how to dodge it, too. The romance is present, but not too important. It's not a love book, but a mistery one."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"This is my favorite of Barbara Hambly's fantasy books. Instead of trouble on a planetary scale (destroy the bad-guy before he destroys the world) we get mayhem and danger on a smaller scale - within a family and family-to-be. Kyra is a 24 year old wizard who is taking her exams within the Citadel of Wizards when she is given omens that her younger sister Alix will die on her wedding night. Despite having been cast out by her father six years before, Kyra goes home to prevent her sister's death.Kyra desperately postpones her sister's wedding again and again while trying to uncover the source of the danger. Meanwhile she remembers how as a teenager she discovered the magic within her, found a wizard to train her, and how all hell broke loose before all was said and done. It's a tainted mental journey, for while Kyra loves magic, she has ample reason to hate it as well. She also finds out two other things: that her sister wants to marry someone other than her fiance - Spens, and that Spens himself is quite a good guy.As with other reviewers, I love the ending. I think it's a fairly happy one. It also gives validity to Kyra's wizarding abilities, which at the start of the book she had reason not to put faith in.My chief problem with Hambly is that sometimes her narrative can get awkward. For example a chapter may start with a person talking, and we don't know who that person is for a few paragraphs. So we skim trying to find out who they are, and don't pay attention to what they are saying. Or another trick of hers, is a person will start talking who hasn't entered the room yet - narratively. So the reader flounders trying to keep up with who is doing and saying what. I find her books easier to read the second time around when I know what will happen. However, I find them very rewarding when I do."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"I did love the Windrose books and looked forward to this book that takes a minor character from those stories and forms a stand-alone story (although in the world of The Windrose books).

I have only read a few other books that I enjoyed as much as I did this one."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"NOTE: This review contains mild spoilers for elements of Stranger At The Wedding as well as the Silent Tower and The Silicon Mage.Let me preface my review by saying I abso-smurfly-LOVE Barbara Hambly. She is really one of my favorite authors - smart, funny and generally well-roundedly awesome. The Sun-cross and Winterlands series were brilliant. And I was loving the Windrose series until I hit Stranger at the Wedding.Antryg and Joanna are great characters and I don't easily get tired of reading them. But tall, clumsy, non-traditionally beautiful Kyra - who was a bit character with like two lines in Dog Wizard - and her non-starter of a story irritated me from Day 1. In Silicon Mage and Silent Tower, you get a renegade, mad genius wizard and mousy female programmer as protagonists, and super-intense plotting, well-laid revelations at surprising times, inter-dimensional travel, and nail-biting terror interspersed with hilarious snark from Antryg. In Stranger you get Kyra, a Trainee Mage At Odds With Her Family, sneaking around trying to secretly bewitch things but getting busted due to repeatedly falling down while everyone is sniping about each other's clothes - exhaustive, obsessive cataloging of What Everyone Was Wearing, and people bitching about DRESSMAKERS, ffs - for chapters on end. I almost abandoned this book! It takes a lot for me to do that, especially fiction. Here is a telling fact about this book: the hero is named *BLORE*. Blore *SPENSON* and from what I can tell it is not meant to be an ironic reference to awful character names. BLORE. SPENSON. Come on. Really? As a name for a romantic lead it's positively fanfic-esque.I know Stranger is supposed to be a standalone, unlike say Silicon Mage, which would make zero sense without reading the Silent Tower, but anyone looking for more of the Windrose universe should be aware that they are wading into shallow, fluffy waters. It was like going to read an Elizabeth Peters thinking you're getting an Amelia Peabody novel and instead getting Vicky Bliss, only more so. Vicky is light and fluffy and fun as hell, which is great when you're in the mood for it (note: she does not blather on about clothes, either). So it was an especially rude awakening for me because I accidentally skipped Dog Wizard at first, not realizing it was next in the series after Silicon Mage. I went back to it after finishing Stranger, but I don't know how much difference it would ultimately have made to my feelings about the latter. But let's say I knew what I was getting into - Hambly did indeed warn us at the beginning that neither Joanna nor Antryg appear in Stranger, but somehow this failed to clue me in to it being a period romance that just happened to feature wizards - Stranger STILL would have bored me to tears. Any time the characters are forced to be dumb for the sake of a soap opera plot (Kyra can't possibly just up and TELL Blore the real reason she came to her sister's wedding, can she? Oh no, what would Lady Earwygg think?? PS Yes, Earwygg is her real name too) is when they lose me.I did eventually manage to finish Stranger at the Wedding, and it was mildly entertaining when all is said and done (despite repeated grippings of my hair and shouting \\"Why, God, why?!?! Shut UP about the purple and black dress!!! %$#$% DO NOT WANT\\"), but Hambly can do so, SO much better than this. I guess based on other reviews, I should stay away from Georgette Heyer!!I wanted to give this two stars simply out of respect for her other body of work, but I can't in good conscience. I really did not like this book. Sorry lady."},{"Title":"Stranger At The Wedding","review":"The book is tooo descriptive.. Reading everything in extreme detail was almost tiring..

I suppose I had good, if accidental, foresight. As others have said, Things Fall Apart is a relatively short novel told in a straightforward yet elegant manner. The voice works well for this particular narrative, much of which focuses on the customs and rites of the Ibo people in the village in which the protagonist, Okonkwo, lives.What I find most impressive about Things Fall Apart is the way it renders all perspectives; the book doesn't seem to glorify or demonize any one culture, and it really doesn't pick sides. The book deals with an Ibo tribe as well as a group of European imperialists, and it would be easy to depict one faction as being pure and noble and the other as evil or backwards. However, Things Fall Apart takes the high road by illustrating the complex continuum of both: Yes, the Ibo people have some practices which might seem \\"savage\\" to our modern Western mindsets, but they also have strong senses of morality and righteousness and Achebe depicts this admirably. Likewise, yes, some of the European imperialists seem cruel and dismissive of the Ibo people, but others of them genuinely seem to be motivated by the interest of evangelizing and doing what they believe to be right and noble.While the book itself may seem like a simplistic tale, there are deep, complex issues at work here--issues that lead to questions with no easy answers which Achebe, for his part, does not attempt to supply. That's just as well. Sometimes a book need only ask the questions and allow readers to come to their own conclusions. So what is Things Fall Apart about? Well, ostensibly, the book can be divided into two halves. The first half centres on the life of a man named Okonkwo, his wives, his children, and the practices of his tribe. Some readers will complain, and have complained, that the lack of focused, singular plot in the first half of the novel is a problem. I disagree. I don't believe that all works of fiction are required to have one singular, specific plot route and I believe it was Achebe's intent to set the stage for what happens in the second part of the novel. In the first half of the novel, the readers get acquainted with Okonkwo and the Ibo people.Meanwhile, the second half of Things Fall Apart focuses on Okonkwo's exile and his return from exile. For seven years, he has to leave his village and return to his mother's village (I won't say why here, so as not to spoil the detail for prospective readers), and when he comes back, he finds that European imperialism has drastically altered his own village, Umuofia. This leads to the novel's main conflict. Achebe renders the culture clash in a very intriguing manner, one which left me unsure of how I felt about the various events that unfolded. Because the earlier chapters showed the Ibo culture in such detail, considerable sympathy is placed on them, but a Western reader will also be inclined to agree with some of the Western views (not all, I should hope). For example, in Ibo culture, twins are considered evil, so they're left out in the forest to die. However, when the Europeans arrive, they begin saving twins. Who is right? Is it right to trample on another culture if it means satisfying what your culture considers the greater good? Like I said, this novel asks some difficult questions, and there are no easy answers.Okonkwo is not a typical protagonist. He does not show compassion to others. He can be downright cruel, and he beats his wives and sons when they displease him. Yet, Okonkwo has reasons for what he does (not that it necessarily makes him right, but it does make his perspective understandable); he is upholding what he believes to be an ideal of Strength. In his own mind, he's a hero. And Okonkwo is not totally a monster; indeed, there are times when a hint of human feeling seeps through. I found his wives and children similarly compelling, but painted in brush strokes, such that much of their lives and personalities are not shown. What is shown is enough to whet your appetite for more.I docked this novel one star, and I made this decision for two reasons. The first is because I believe the transition between the book's two halves is somewhat unshaky. I understand the need for a transition, but I think Achebe could've handled it somewhat more gracefully. As it is, I feel he plowed through and forced Okonkwo to leave under fairly flimsy and dubious, abrupt circumstances. The second reason I took off a star is because towards the end, the book stops being so evenhanded, and some of the missionaries turn Evil. At least, this is how I perceived it. What one of the Europeans says at the end of the novel seems almost like a caricature; read it and you'll see what I mean. Before, I thought Achebe was doing such an admirable job of showing the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, but in the end, \\"things fall apart\\".Even so, the book is good and thought-provoking. I recommend it. It's a fast read. Although it is not a happy novel, I never at any point found it oppressingly, suffocatingly depressing. Perhaps the lovely yet simple prose helped to keep the events of the novel from being too overwhelmingly unhappy. Everything transpires as if in a song or a dream. I disagree with reviewers who say that Achebe portrayed the Ibo people as \\"savages\\". If you saw that in the novel, I think it's because you are analyzing them with your own values. I didn't see that Achebe intended that at all. I did not feel that Achebe passed value judgments on the Ibo people, and for the most part, he restrained his judgments of the European imperialists as well."},{"Title":"Things Fall Apart: Intermediate Level (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Chinua Achebe is an accomplished Nigerian writer. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is reputed by Wikipedia to be the most widely read book in modern African literature and has made Achebe the most widely translated African writer of all time.The book deals with the impact of a foreign culture (the British Empire expanding into Nigeria) on the traditional ways of life and tribal beliefs of the Ibo people of Nigeria. History tells us who inevitably won that \\"clash of civilisations\\".In the book the destruction of a tribal community comes at the hands of well-meaning, but fundamentally arrogant, Christian missionaries, supported by the \\"civilising mission\\" of government officials.Many of the old Ibo beliefs and customs (at least as described by Achebe) were violent and superstitious. The superstition should be no problem for any objective reader - after all, it is simply a different form of spiritual belief to that which most Western readers will be used to, no worse and no better than any of the major religions, just different.Unfortunately for the Ibo, it was these very beliefs that the christian missionaries found repugnant - perhaps more so than the violence.However, it is the violence of men towards one another and towards women and children that will appal most modern readers.Of course, this is a work of fiction and the non-Nigerian reader has no hope of knowing how realistic is the traditional village culture portrayed. Nigerian readers will immediately be able to put it into the correct perspective.Without any other cultural background or context, books like this in the hands of the unthinking reader can perpetuate stereotypes and even do harm. There is already too much ignorance of, and intolerance to, the customs of other people. One has only to think of today's general ignorance and stereotyping of Muslims - and the general ignorance and stereotyping of Russians during the Cold War.Sadly, traditional customs and beliefs, even languages, are under increasing threat from the blandishments of the modern world. This is a pity. Most cultural beliefs have a valid place in the human community and are worthy of preservation, as an historical and anthropological record if nothing else. Many of the social and other problems that beset traditional peoples can be laid at the feet of the destruction of customs and beliefs.The challenge is not only to protect traditional customs, but also to do so in ways that are consistent with preventing violence in those communities. It is difficult, for example, to make any case in favour of female circumcision.On another level the book can be read as the human tragedy of the principal character, Okonkwo. To our eyes he is a flawed figure, but to his tribe he was an important man.Achebe's style is very spare and the text is pared to the bone, with few adjectives and adverbs. Sentence constructions are very simple - but not nave or unsophisticated. Hemingway and other famous writers used a similar style. I like it very much.I found it helpful to read the Wikipedia entries after I had started the book. This gave me some background and made my reading a more meaningful exercise.This book made me confront important matters: the clash of civilisations and comparative spiritual beliefs. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is an important book and worth reading."},{"Title":"Low-Fat Ways to Cook One-Dish Meals","review":"My mom and I love this cookbook.

Not only do they have terrific recipes that make great dishes, but they're also easy to follow, have big color pictures and are spiral bound. When I make a dish for the first time, it really helps to know what it's &quot;supposed to look like&quot;. The spiral binding makes it easy to leave open on the kitchen counter."},{"Title":"Geronimo","review":"By and large, you shouldn't start a review of a book by saying that you, the reviewer, are an idiot. Just the same, I am an idiot. Why am I an idiot? Because I'm fairly certain that I've been walking around as a full-fledged children's librarian, all my credentials in place, while thinking that Joseph Bruchac was Michael Dorris. This is a pretty good litmus test of idiocy. Just now, JUST now, I went to Amazon.com to confirm that Bruchac had written, \\"Sees Behind Trees\\". Imagine my shock when I discovered that for years now I've been giving credit to the wrong danged guy. Now I did read and enjoy Bruchac's, \\"A Boy Called Slow\\" years and years ago, but that does little to offset my embarrassment. In any case, I've read a Bruchac book now and I've come away with it with mixed feelings. Telling the tale of the great Geronimo's life through the eyes of a fictional grandson, Bruchac has meticulously researched and lovingly drawn a portrait of this impressive figure. His book is full of factual information and heartbreaking detail and life. Unfortunately, the first half makes for a very dry read. If kids can get through it and proceed on to the second, they'll find themselves more than adequately rewarded by the tale's end. A great but mixed read.Little Foot was adopted as a kind of grandson to the great warrior Geronimo when his parents were killed in a Mexican raid many years ago. Over time he has stood by his Apache people, finally standing down to the American army when Geronimo surrenders with the feeling that they should fight no more. En masse the Apaches are taken from their homes in Arizona and sent by train to Florida as prisoners of war. Through Little Foot's eyes we see the history and betrayal of the Apache people. Their inordinate trust in a white government bent on their destruction. How they watched as their children were sent far far away to the infamous Carlisle Indian School (and subsequently killed by the school's diseases). Finally, we view Geronimo's life in Fort Sill, Oklahoma and his constant yearning to return home. Jumping backwards and forwards in time, readers get a well-rounded view of Geronimo's life and a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding the lies people told (and still tell) about him.The book is an excellent antidote to such ill-prepared Native American titles as, \\"My Heart Is On the Ground\\" and its ilk. With Bruchac you are in safe hands. Well-researched and fairly bursting with an overabundance of factual information, the story is fiction but it reads like fact. The author knows enough to write some humor, even in the bleakest of moments, into the tale. Better still, you really do come to care for Geronimo and Little Foot. Even the magical realism, which is a bit off-putting in such a realistic novel, is handled with grace. Now there are problems with this book, but they aren't simple mistakes. I dare say Bruchac never puts a word out of place or a sentence out of alignment. What he says is always the best way OF saying something. Unfortunately, I didn't think it all needed to be said. Put in plain English, the book bored me sometimes. We're watching a story that begins when Geronimo and his people step onto a train that is taking them far far from their home. It ends when his grandson returns to his tribe and Geronimo at long last. In between, however, Bruchac has a hard time with continuity. That's facetious of me to say. Of course he knows exactly what he's doing. It just doesn't happen to work. What the book does, right from the beginning, is engage in constant shifts between the present, the past, and the future (if you deem the train time \\"the present\\"). Not only is this confusing but it draws out a story that could be more fascinating than it's presented. The train details are great. The stories of Geronimo's life are great. But when you get to page 174 and the characters are STILL on the train, you begin to worry that the action will remain permanently bogged down. It doesn't, of course. Halfway through the book it picks up and makes for a great read. It's just that first half that's the difficult slog.Also, it's very difficult to care for a book when after every happy moment you have to deal with a chapter that closes with a variation on, \\"What they did ended up sending us all on this endless train journey toward the dawn, a journey that would have no destination for many of us other than disease, despair, and death\\". Even when it looks like things are perking up or that the Apache might have a little happiness in store, that hope is swiftly crushed with lines like, \\"I did not know how wrong I was\\". Obviously this isn't a happy-go-lucky tale and Bruchac DOES balance his woe with as much cheer as he can honestly muster. Though some Indians were sent to Florida in trains without even so much as bathroom facilities (a fact Little Foot is careful to mention), Bruchac mentions this and then gives his own characters slightly better fare. There are funny stories here and amusing anecdotes and jokes. I just wish a little more care could have been taken with the countless bleak chapter closing sentences.But in the end the book rises above such flaws. I would certainly not hand it to any reluctant readers and you should not purchase this title under the mistaken apprehension that it's a non-fiction biography. Bruchac notes right there on the cover that it's a novel. It's often painful, often heartbreaking, and always interesting. It takes an especially skilled author to bring together a story based on real life that has as great a sense of closure as \\"Geronimo\\". Bruchac is so skilled. And then some."},{"Title":"Geronimo","review":"Geronimo was a legendary figure in American culture, and during the last half of his lifetime, a tourist attraction wherever he went. And while Joseph Bruchac's novel GERONIMO describes this vividly, he also paints a portrait of a real man. Told through the eyes of \\"Little Foot\\" or \\"Willie\\" this fictional grandchild of Geronimo is responsible for passing on his legacy through the stories he shares.\\"Remember That is what I now do. I tell the story as best I can. With each line of my tale I will place a kernel of corn on the ground. Then, when I am done, that corn will be there for you to pick up. Eat it and this story may stay with you as it has stayed with me. Do not fall asleep, or the story may be broken, as were our lives. Listen\\" (5).While it doesn't follow strictly chronological guidelines, the main story takes place between 1883 and 1908. The heart of the story is the imprisonment of the Apache Indians--yes, I know there is a more descriptive, more accurate name, and their exile from their land in Arizona. They were deported by train, under guard, to camps and forts in Alabamba and Florida. The train carrying Geronimo became a tourist attraction at every stop along the way, and a money-making venture.\\"'They are waiting for a memory,' Wratten said to me as we passed slowly by yet another great crowd of waving, shouting people. 'They want to be able to tell their children they saw Geronimo.'\\" (78)The memories they make for themselves in their new homes were anything but pleasant. Full of hard work, sadness, depression, and disease--their camps were prone to malaria--they were often separated from their families...wives from husbands, and children from parents. Many children were sent to a school in Pennsylvania where many became sick with tuberculosis and died.Woven into the stories of hardships and broken promises, are stories of the past both pleasant and bittersweet. Their days of peace and contentment, and their days of battle fighting the Mexicans and Americans.Beautifully written, I hope this book finds its audience because it is a truly memorable book."},{"Title":"Geronimo","review":"What a great historical fiction story of Geronimo, told through the eyes of fictional grandson. The story focuses mainly on the imprisonment of the Apache Indians who were taken from their homes in the Southwestern US to live in the Southeastern half of our country.Geronimo was a powerful leader but along with other leaders he was separated from his family, including his grandson, and sent to live in a different relocation camp from them.Author, Bruchac,is a great storyteller. He was able to weave humor in and out of the story. Even though there were many parts that may appear cumbersome to read and handle for an upper elementary or middle school student, Bruchac, had the anecdotes perfectly placed to keep a reader's interest.When I book talk this book with my students, there are several occasions where I'm be able to read excerpts that will pique their interest enough to maybe check the book out on their own.Bruchac gives a reader a different perspective of the Apache Indian. One who is enterprising, innovative and true to one's family. The book allows the reader to form a much different opinion of a tribe that through out history has been portrayed as a very violent tribe."},{"Title":"Geronimo","review":"Bought this book : Service was goodShowed up quicklylooks new pages fine crispGreat book!"},{"Title":"Geronimo","review":"Okay, call me easy to please. I loved this book. I love historical fiction anyway. I loved the chapter headings which were excerpts from historical documents. I loved the point of view --grandchildren tend to love their grandparents unconditionally. The feeling of the great respect that the author has for Geronimo comes through loud and clear. How can reading about a people being forced into exile be boring? It was heartbreaking. For me, there was a sense of relief once Geronimo was reunited with some of his wives and children. The telling of this story taught me a few of the more obscure facts of the \\"Indian Wars\\" such as the fact that Chiricahua Apaches \\"prisoners of war\\" were encouraged to join the Army but upon their honorable discharges, they weren't allowed back into the prisoner of war camps (relocation centers such as Mount Vernon, Alabama) because as former soldiers, they were no longer prisoners of war and then unable rejoin their families.

It transformed me to another time and world. Characters believable. It's wonderful to have a Christian based love story."},{"Title":"A Bride for Donnigan (Women of the West #7)","review":"\\"A Bride For Donnigan\\" is a Christian historical set in the American West during the pioneer time period. It's a part of the Women of the West series, but the books aren't connected to each other so you can read them in any order. These novels are quick reads.The setting and historical detail created a nice yet still somewhat vague (as to exact time period) backdrop for the events. The story followed Kathleen's life from seventeen-years-old until she has a large family of her own. Kathleen and Donnigan have to overcome misunderstandings about what they think the other partner wants out of marriage and the sorrows of losing and raising children.The Christian element was woven into the story, and it was the focus of the story near the end. Kathleen and Donnigan both realize there must be a God, but they don't know anything about him and there's no preacher available. They glean what they can from the Bible and, after some misunderstandings caused by various Christians not clearly answering their questions, finally come to understand how to make things right between themselves and God.Married sex was implied (as babies were born). There was a very minor amount of \\"he cussed\\" style of bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"A Bride for Donnigan (Women of the West #7)","review":"\\"A Bride For Donnigan\\" was one of the better books by Janette Oke, and started out very interesting. But, there are some hills of good and bad. First off, I found everything too perfect and sugar coated. What are the odds of Donnigan and Kathleen getting along? Much less, falling in love? It might happen, but it would take time. Which leads me into how Oke didn't express how much time goes by, nor the age of Donnigan. We don't know much of anything about Donnigan. Towards the end, the total point of this book was gone. I was hoping for more about their marriage, and the trials and tribulations of it. I did enjoy the characters, nonetheless, and did care about their outcome, but Donnigan seems too good to be true. I'm also glad that a book was finally written about this subject, even if it was just a storybook romance. It still doesn't beat \\"Roses For Mama,\\" but is good all the same. I recommend."},{"Title":"A Bride for Donnigan (Women of the West #7)","review":"I didn't get very far reading this book. I didn't read about Kathleen's relationship with Donnigan because I was throughly disgusted with her character by Chapter 3. Kathleen is so timid it's revolting. She does the housework for her stepmother &quot;Madame&quot; for years, including bringing her breakfast on a tray. Never mind the fact that &quot;Madame&quot; has got two good legs and Kathleen limps. Never think about that, Katie, me darlin'! Never speak up for yourself! Just do like &quot;Madame&quot; says. Maybe she gets better as the book goes along, but I didn't really care. I'd have liked to see &quot;Madame&quot; get hers a little ways down the road. I guess if you've got that attitude, however, then Christian fiction is not for you."},{"Title":"A Bride for Donnigan (Women of the West #7)","review":"I must say, when I first saw that my church library had picked up a new Janette Oke book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, by the end of the book, I was just glad that I had gotten it from the library and hadn't laid down good money for this dreadful piece of under developed, boring waste of paper!! Not up to the standards that I have come to expect from Janette Oke. All I can ask is...how can writers who &quot;scribble off&quot; (to use another reviewer's well put description) fluff like this actually sell books? I'd like to warn you against buying this book, and if you still want to read it, get it from the library!"},{"Title":"A Bride for Donnigan (Women of the West #7)","review":"If you're looking for a quality read, don't pick up Oke. On the positive side, there are no curse words or lurid sex scenes. If this is your only standard for a good read, you're in luck.

This book, hands down,is the best Oke book thus far.

You can feel the anxiety Kathleen experienced with the haystack fire and also with the loss of Taryn. Donnigan's search for God's plan of salvation was thought-provoking as we take the presence of churches / Bibles / pastors as a way of life. Interspersed throughout the book were bits of humor and wit. \\"A Bride for Donnigan\\" is an all round great book."},{"Title":"A Bride for Donnigan (Women of the West #7)","review":"I liked it because both main characters were well developed and the plot was unusual about man out west and two of his friends ordering brides from overseas.

Life in the west was hard and there were often tragedies, but they overcome the trials of farming and raising a large family.

Although, at least with fluff like this you haven't wasted a LOT of time. It only takes but a few minutes to skim through this book. Even so, it probably took less time to write it. There was obviously no effort put forth. Is there really a Janette Oke, or is that the name of a junior high writers club that has a connection to a publishing house? I almost hope it's the latter, because if it isn't, Janette Oke DEFINITELY missed her calling- maybe she should take up gardening, or painting and leave writing to true Christian romance novelists, like Lori Wick or Lauraine Snelling.

The authors squarely place blame for behavior problems on parents' discipline practices. This book perpetuates the education profession's view that &quot;parents are the problem&quot;. Very little discussion is devoted to children with learning problems or children with ADHD (only 2 pages in each case, and not till the middle of the book) yet research has shown that many kids who are frustrated in school due to these issues often have or develop problems with behavior. A study conducted by the National Center on Disabilities (published in Jan 2000) indicates that most school districts fail to meet federal laws regarding special education. This means that many kids are left out in the cold when it comes to meeting their educational needs. Children with ADHD need to be educated by teachers who are knowledgeable about this neurological problem.

With amazing skill he builds consistent and fascinating worlds to weave stories of the future. Vernor Vinge has a strong libertarian bent. My only complaint is he doesn't write enough. I wish he wrote more.Across Realtime is a book with two stories. Both of these stories revolve around a concept of \\"Bubbles.\\" At first people believed the bubbles were force fields and those inside would die after the oxygen ran out. Later they discovered the bubbles were stasis fields, basically frozen in time. Once the bubbles popped, the people would continue on with their lives.Around our time scientists at Livermore Labs created the technology to \\"bubble\\" people and objects. A group of people used bubbles to encase armies and quickly ruled the world. The Peace War takes place fifty years in the future. A revolutionary group tries to revolt. Vernor Vinge explores what fifty years of rapid growth in computer technology might be like.One of the heroes of the story is a science from Livermore Labs who tries to stop the bubbles from being used to conquer the world. He finds a young boy who is a greater genius. Together they lead the revolution. There is a lot of intrigue as the \\"Peacers\\" want to keep their power and stop the revolt.Marooned In Realtime takes place in the same universe, but millions of years in the future. The singularity occurred and most of humanity has moved on. Those in bubbles during the singularity missed out. Some of these few humans want to restart the human race and are trying to gather a critical mass. Wil is the main character of the story. He is a detective who is trying to find the person who bubbled him and made Wil miss watching his children grow up.Both of these stories are complex. There are lots of details making the stories seem real. Vernor Vinge put a lot of thought into what it means to have bubble technology."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"One of my favourite books; I highly recommend it. Note that over the years there have been multiple editions of this book with the same name, but they're not all the same. The Baen Books edition with the cover picture showing a sun with concentric rings has three stories: The Peace War, The Ungoverned, and Marooned in Realtime. Other editions (the one with the purple cover showing a bobble in a dessert scene, and the one with the cover showing a bobble in a valley with trees and mountains) are missing the middle story."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"This is one of SF's true classics -- this falls in with The_Stars_My_Destination to Lord_Of_Light to the Hyperion series -- and is a thoroughly entertaining read."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"I have in recent years managed to squirrel together an almost complete collection of Vernor's works, and I am still astonished that this Californian mathematician's visionary works are not far better known.

Thewoman's diary forms the centerpiece of the story, and isthe catalyst for some deep insights into the human capacityfor love and compassion -- and also for cruelty."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"Bar none the best fiction I have ever laid eyes on. Unless you count Calvin and Hobbes. The best book comprised of only words then. And the only thing more outrageous than the fact that the year \\"The Peace War\\" was published, it had its Hugo award STOLEN away by the inferior (yet undeniably more popular) \\"Ender's Game\\" by Card, is the fact that \\"Marooned In Realtime\\", the second volume of this book, which somehow held up to the unimaginibly high standard of \\"The Peace War\\", had the Hugo that rightfully belonged to it stolen away by the VASTLY inferior sequel to \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Speaker For The Dead\\", by the same stinker. Oh well. It just goes to show how little the Hugo people know what they're doing. (Their winning choices for short stories are even more ridiculous. For instance, one in particular where the author got EVERYTHING so wrong, even the most basic concepts, it was hard for me to even stand to read, such as the fact that tidal force is proportional to the inverse cube of the distance, so if you approached a sufficiently massive object, you wouldn't feel it until the instant before you were blasted to bits. And of course none of the story's characters, advanced space travelers mind you, had foreseen that this massive object would have a deadly tidal force and were all taken off guard.)That said, if you give this book a CHANCE, I think you will find it the most compelling, fascinating story you have ever read. Unless you have read things I have not. Which is more than likely. The premise: what would happen if a group of people got ahold of the ULTIMATE weapon? A weapon so strange that no one could possibly have expected its invention, yet so powerful that it made nuclear weapons obsolete, and a few people controlling it could conquer the world? That's The Peace War. The long-term effects of this technology, and long term trends of human technological development in general are what fuel the second book, \\"Marooned in Realtime\\". Interesting social analysis, and I think a very likely interpretation of the nature and fate of intelligent life in the universe. Prepare for the ultimate showdown, the ultimate fight for freedom, perhaps even the ultimate battle between good and evil, because the bad guys conquering the world is only the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"Looking over what some of these reviewers wrote, I'm wondering, \\"What color is the sky of their planet of origin?\\" Sure, it's science fiction, but Vinge is writing about something that, given the current rate of Moore's Law, is going to hit us in less than two decades.Vernor Vinge is a former computer science professor at San Diego State University, and the whole point of his book is to introduce the singularity (if you miss it, it's in his one-page afterward).Yes, Across Realtime is a great story - one of the best I've ever read. But it's the ideas that make great science fiction, and Vinge will be known for his big idea long after the Sun flames out into a burnt-out cinder. Check out his presentation at the VISION-21 Symposium sponsored by NASA, especially his 2003 comments on it.

It does NOT have the short story apparently included in some paperbacks. Both novels are excellent, \\"Marooned in Reraltime\\" being a bit better than \\"The Peace War\\".For details of Vinge's writing skills and some story details, see the five-star reviews of the expensive new paperbacks (up to $21+ for both novels in separate trade paperback versions)."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"This is the good stuff. This guy is to me most reminiscent of Clarke, and that is about the highest praise I can give a science fiction writer. I have no idea about the possibility of \\"realtime\\" or any of his other ideas, but like Clarke, he has enough of a math and science background to flesh them out logically and realistically. And better yet, the characters are plausible and not weakly portrayed, the good guys are not perfect or always right, and the bad guys are not %100 evil, but also have compassion - mostly. And refreshingly, Vinge's grasp of politics, society, and economics is far more contemporary and realistic than that of most sci-fi writers. This pair of novels, or rather two-volume set IMO, is exciting, challenging, and also a real page-turner. Five stars."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"I think it's incredible that this book -- like many of Vinge's books -- is out of print. Hopefully Vinge's winning the Hugo for _Fire Upon the Deep_ will bring the publishers to their senses and lead them to reissue this marvelous book.Two caveats about this book. One: some editions leave out the short story &quot;The Ungoverned&quot;; make sure you get the right one. Two: at least in the edition I have, the presentation of the various sections of _The Peace War_ is very scrunched together compared with the version of _The Peace War_ that's sold separately."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"I have thought of this book almost every week since I read it four years ago.

It examines a fictional setting in which some alien civilizations have reached their Singulatiry transition but not all members have followed their more fully engaged fellows, so they get &#34;left behind&#34; in some ways. If you are interested in the rapid increase in technological capabilities in our own world (robotics, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, genetics, etc) then this story shows at least one author's version of what might come next when humanity itself may change so dramatically as to become something new and different."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"Marooned in Realtime is a must read. Never before or since have I seen a detective mystery in which each suspects represents a philosophical view on the ultimate fate of human civilization."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"One of the most intrigueing new ideas this book presents is the concept of a bobble, an impenetrable sphere that can be erected around any person or place. By using this Vinge is able to take us as far into the future as is necessary to show the struggle of a few indidividuals trying to save humanity after the majority of the human race vanishes into a mysterious event called the &quot;singularity&quot;. Vinge creates a real sense of urgency in these individuals by putting the fate of humanity into the hands of one policeman, Wil Brierson. The only complaint I have is that the transisition between the different parts of the book seem choppy. Otherwise, this novel is a great combination of human survival and murder/mystery."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"I liked the Deepness novels perhaps a little better, but just when I thought the Marooned was going nowhere it through me a surprize and got very interesting. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"For \\"The Peace War\\", the first of the short novels. This I thought was a brilliant piece of work. A classic struggle against an oppressive power through the use of technology and ingenuity. There is a wonderful mix of action and stealth to create this epic story. While this isn't the best of Vinge's work, I definitely see this book as potential for a high budget special effects film.\\"Marooned in Realtime\\" was an upset in my opinion. Vinge implausibly reunites several characters from \\"The Peace War\\" several hundred thousand years in the future. This book was more of a murder mystery than a sci-fi novel, and he used sci-fi as a device to justify his implausibilities."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"Of the two books included in this reprinting I'll confine my remarks to the second -- Marooned in Realtime which I read recently. Written in 1986, this is probably one of the best science fiction works of the past 20 years. I can't believe it didn't win a Hugo the first time out.This book didn't receive the attention it deserved, and it is very fortunate that Vinge's later success has led to this reissue. My only explanation for the relative anonymity of the first work is that the ideas presented there were simply too audacious. The concept of the Singularity was introduced here and then continued in a 1992 article by Vinge published in the Whole Earth Review. It then seemed to disappear, until rediscovered by Kurzweil and Moravec around 2000. Without giving away the novel, Vinge makes a good case for why SETI will fail.Beyond some breathtaking ideas (of which the least is the total abolition of privacy -- novel in 1986, prosaic now) there's also a great murder mystery, and a poignant romance.Read it, but don't expect to get anything done until the book is done...."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"The book (and stories within) is an average - maybe slightly above average- SF novel. To suggest it's in a class with Dune (or Vinge's two newer novels - which ARE in a class with Dune), is shocking to me.Buy it if you're looking for a pleasant, but not breathtaking read. And if you haven't read A Fire Upon The Deep and then A Darkness In The Sky - what are you waiting for!!!"},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"Well, there are a couple of good ideas knocking about in here.But the story is often very convulted and some of the characterslack development. Its interesting in parts but at times its annoying having to keep track of the various characters and events.If a book is good then this event tracking should take care of itself. But when the story covers geological time frames its a little bit messy.I wouldnt agree with a lot of the reviewers who claim this is far better than many other sci-fi novels - I found it an interesting read in parts but tedious in other ways.I didnt share the significance of finding out who marthas killer was especially when there were other things of much more significance happening in the novel and to be honest finding out which of the high/low techs killed her was a bit of a rush to an anti-climax.Theres a old psychological trait that perhaps people writing review will do so for books they find more favourable than others so its questionable whether you get a true reflection of public opionion about a book..so I'm not too sure how much my views are out of step with the general enthusasism here for these novels. I suppose you'll have to read it to make up your own mind...but remember there is an finite amount of books any human will read so choose well !"},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"This book is actually two novels:&quot;The Peace War&quot; and &quot;Marooned in Realtime&quot;.&quot;The Peace War&quot; is very well written and places Vernor Vinge with the old time sci fi great writers.&quot;Marooned in Realtime&quot; is a very bad mystery and with a very bad plot.The result is a five star mixed with a one star for the whole book. It is worth buying for &quot;The Peace War&quot;."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"It has been said that 90% of everything is crap. This is not strictly true; for example, 95% of science-fiction is crap. When I was younger I read science-fiction indiscriminately. Now that I am older I'm starting to pay a great deal more attention to questions of literary quality and I often find myself frustrated by the incredibly bad writing in most science-fiction. However, I found that Across Realtime very definitely falls in the remaining 5% that makes sci-fi worth reading: in fact, Vinge has written some of the best genre fiction I have ever read.Across Realtime is actually two closely related novels and a short story. The first novel, The Peace War, introduces Vinge's star concept, the &quot;bobble&quot;, and also chronicles the demise of the Peace Authority. Following The Peace War is Vinge's short story The Ungoverned, which introduces contract police officer Wil Brierson, further develops the bobble concept and serves as a nice little tract for the author's libertarian-anarchist political views. Finally, and in my opinion the crown jewel of the book, comes Marooned in Realtime, a masterfully plotted mystery story spanning 50 million years into the future. Marooned in Realtime is centered around Wil Brierson and a small band of friends trying to restart the human race in a post-post-apocalyptic world of decaying high-technology. Marooned is so excellent that it alone is worth the price of admission.I think that there are primarily two reasons for Across Realtime's success.First, the book deals with strong, unique and thoroughly expounded ideas. Almost by definition science-fiction is supposed to deal with ideas, but more often than not the ideas that authors choose to examine are old-hat and stale by the time they deal with them. Vinge's ideas definitely aren't though: the bobbles are a fascinating concept and he handles his post-apocalyptic society with real style. He not only comes up with original ideas but he carries them all the way through to their logical conclusions. He realizes that &quot;ideas have consequences&quot; and that you can't change a society's technology and organization without fundamentally changing the people who live in that society.Secondly, Across Realtime is written with outstanding characterization, especially for a science-fiction novel. The only other sci-fi I've read with better characterization is Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game (which, incidentally, I also highly recommend). All too often the left-brain writers who dominate this genre play fast and loose with their characters, destroying their character believability and thus savaging the value and truth of the entire story. Good characterization requires right-brain and emotional thinking. Even though Vinge is a mathematician and computer-scientist with the University of California in San Diego (really left-brain), he proves that he is more than capable of the kind of thinking that makes for strong characters. The young genius hoodlum Wili, the tinker-scientist Paul Naismith and police officer Wil Brierson are all memorable people and they carry the events of the story very well.The copy of Across Realtime I read seems to be difficult to obtain; I read a copy that my Dad bought through ABE Books for $25. We may have overpaid a little, considering that the book that was originally a $6 paperback, but even so the going rate is easily $18+ from what I've seen on the 'net. If you want to read Across Realtime you can either buy it from Amazon.com for $19 and accept the four to six week wait or you can try to find it used.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"Across Realtime (My version) is an omnibus collection of two novels by Vernor Vinge: The Peace War, and Marooned in Realtime. The Second book, especially, is among the best SF books I've read.The Peace War is, seemingly, a fairly standard SF novel: in a post apocalyptic world, a dictatorship took over, and the brave heroes fight it off. Except that it is much more than that - Vinge's talent, his characters and his ideas all turn this B movie premise to an original, powerful SF novel. Especially important is Vinge's simple but brilliant invention of the 'Bubble's - spheres which are completely shielded off the world, in which time doesn't move.'Marrooned in Realtime' takes the premise established in the first novel, and pushes it beyond belief. The beginning of 'Marooned', especially, is idea oriented SD at it's finest - you read going WOW every two seconds.Idea oriented SF is probnably the hardest thing in the universe to write - you need not only to know how to write well, not only to understand science, but also to come up with a scientific idea which has mind opening reprecussions. I think I can count on 1 hand the number of times I've seen Idea oriented SF done right - this is one of the prime examples.If you're a lover of SF, Across Realtime will be a parade of ideas, characters, action and thrills. So don't miss it."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"I shall not bore you with another rehash of the outline of this novel, other than to say it is a sweeping saga spanning millions of years. Vinge really illustrates how we rely on our technology, and have largely lost our survival skills to cope with nature on an individual basis. Could we survive as a species if there were only a few hundred humans left? Vinge is a scientist by trade and it shows, he definitely makes you think! This novel has a very good base of scientific fact mixed with a great plot and excellent character developement, and can stand up to anything well known writers such as Asimov or Bradbury or Heinlein ever wrote, and that is saying a lot. As I began to read this book, I read perhaps ten or twelve pages a day, but I became so entranced by the story that later I found it hard to put down, it was so good. I loved the ending of the book, especially the last few paragraphs."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"...And no one seems to miss it but those who read it. What happened? Across Realtime is by far one of the most incredible books I have ever read. It took me 5 years to hunt it down again (I only remembered the story, not the title). Now that I have found it, I discover it is no longer in print. I struggle to find a copy anywhere. Vinge never got the recognition he deserved. I was moved to tears as I read about the main character left to fend for herself alone in an almost primitive Earth, yet only inches from her friends and loved ones(Marooned in Realtime). She lived her life alone and she died alone. It was heart-wrenching. An incredible murder mystery set against the eerie echoes of that main character as she relayed her life eons previously. This is the perfect story for making you think. Just when you thought the story was as big as it could get, it explodes, making you see a whole different angle. I think the revewer previous had the right quote: &quot;Ordinary people caught up in struggles of vast importance.&quot; Now thats my kind of book."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"Bobble Book 1 (Peace War) is ok, fair science fiction, somehow dated (as every novel including the word \\"soviet\\" is).

You 'll feel awed by the science and never be able to guess the villain in the detective story part. Across Realtime should have given Vinge his first Hugo instead of A Fire Upon the Deep.

If you like the big ideas, big consequences, big time-spans, all carried out their logical conclusions, this is the story for you! Vinge clearly shows his skills in writing stories with a &quot;sense of awe and wonder&quot; that he later showcases in his &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; and &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot; novels. If you liked those two novels, you'll most probably like &quot;Marooned in Realtime&quot;.One note:If you wonder if you &quot;need&quot; to read the &quot;Peace War&quot; and &quot;The Ungoverened&quot; in order to fully enjoy &quot;Marooned in Realtime,&quot; there are a couple of concepts and characters that are introduced that are important to fully understanding &quot;Marooned in Realtime.&quot; In fact, the conclusion to the &quot;murder mystery&quot; in &quot;Marooned&quot; hinges on your being familiar with a certain character introduced in the earlier stories. I was surpirsed by this since I was hoping that &quot;Marooned&quot; could stand alone by itself without too much backreferencing."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"I read two of vinge's novels before I've started this one.

If you can usually figure out what's going to happen in a story and you hunger for that rare author who can keep you in a continual state of amazement, read Vernor Vinge. I have a library of nearly 2,000 books and Across Realtime is definitely one of my top ten favorites. My only criticism of the man is that he hasn't written more for you and me to read."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"If you've read some of the other reviews here, you've realized by now that \\"Across Realtime\\" is actually two separate books - a novel and its far-future sequel - combined into one volume. (Some editions apparently include an additional related short story, but NOT this one - i.e., ISBN 1857981472. That story, called \\"The Ungoverned\\" is available in Vernor Vinge's new collection, but it's not terribly good.)The first novel, \\"The Peace War,\\" I consider not very special. Little distinguishes it from other post-nuclear war stories, and the characters are not especially compelling. Vinge's clever invention (called a \\"bobble,\\" the details of which I won't give away here) is modestly intriguing but takes a back seat to the archetypally heroic rebels who want to overthrow their archetypally tyrannical rulers.\\"Marooned in Realtime,\\" on the other hand, is extraordinary. It showcases Vinge's extraodinary imagination just as \\"A Fire Upon the Deep\\" does. Vinge really explores what can be done with his bobbles, and he uses them to touch upon some much deeper issues, such as \\"Where will our ever-advancing technology lead us?\\" and \\"What happens at the end of the universe?\\" The characters, too, are cut from a much more varied cloth than in the first book. (My only knock is against Vinge's decision to sprinkle his protagonist's utopian anarchist beliefs throughout this novel. Like Heinlein's ultra-libertarianism, it sounds foolish & can get a bit grating.)I'd give \\"Marooned\\" five stars, but \\"Peace War\\" only merits three, so I've split the difference and given \\"Across Realtime\\" four stars. Definitely read the books in order, though - Vinge will reward your careful attention to the first book in the sequel.In short, if you read \\"A Deepness in the Sky\\" and a \\"Fire Upon the Deep\\" and you're looking for more Vinge to whet your appetite, you've come to the right place."},{"Title":"Across Realtime","review":"I loved this book (or compilation.) I purchased it a few years back at an airport newsstand, looking for a little easy reading. Short of one ar two other SF novels, I can say I have never read a better story. Mr. Vinge has invented a heck of an idea in his &quot;bobble&quot; In fact I spent many a moment thinking how the world would be a different place if such an item existed. I believe the caliber of a novel can be determined by how much time you spend thinking about it.....this book does just that. In fact both of Vernor Vinge's new novels are quite excellent as well and I can't tell you how excited I was to see them sitting on the shelf at my local bookstore."},{"Title":"Spurgeon on Leadership: Key Insights for Christian Leaders from the Prince of Preachers","review":"Samuel Brengel, a great Salvation Army evangelist wrote: \\"The final estimate of men shows that history cares not an iota for the rank or title a man has borne, or the office he has held, but only the quality of his deeds and the character of his mind and heart.\\" Never has a man proved this more true than Charles Haddon Spurgeon. Larry J. Michael reminds us that Spurgeon decided against formal theological education and ordination early in his ministry. Yet this man who rejected titles such as Reverend and called human ordination, \\"empty hands on empty heads,\\" has been given the title of Prince of Preachers by the generations that have followed him.Many of of our readers will probably ask, \\"Do we really need another book about Spurgeon?\\" Once you read Spurgeon on Leadership, you will certainly be thankful that Larry Michael believed there was such a need. This is not a biography but rather a study in the leadership style of the most influential Baptist in the last two hundred years.The first twelve chapters define the characteristics of Spurgeon's leadership style that set him apart from the crowd. Those characteristics are:The last two chapters focus on current events in Spurgeon's world and ours and how Christian leadership can respond to those challenges.Spurgeon On Leadership is a highly practical book. Each chapter ends with a list of leadership lessons we can learn from Spurgeon. For example in the chapter on creativity we are given this leadership lesson: \\"The message of the gospel does not change, but the manner of its presentation may be adapted according to the situation. Spurgeon said, \\"I am not very scrupulous about the means I use for doing good ... I would preach standing on my head, if I thought I could convert your souls.\\" (p. 151)Everyone can benefit from this book. Whether you are an official leader in your church or sit on the back row of your Sunday School class there is much to learn here. You will be surprised by some of the things you learn about Spurgeon and yourself along the way.Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Spurgeon On Leadership is that we are reminded of what God wants to do with each of us. Our thanks go out to Dr. Michael for encouraging us to think big thoughts about God and for His work. Spurgeon refused to be forced into other people's boxes and so should we! Let us be what God wants us to be and do it with the gusto that Charles H. Spurgeon did."},{"Title":"Spurgeon on Leadership: Key Insights for Christian Leaders from the Prince of Preachers","review":"Great book - well-written leadership book using the life, writings and influence of one of the great saints of the faith as his foundation and backdrop, author Larry Michael not only exposes the reader to Charles Haddon Spurgeon, but also explains how God used this man to literally change the world around him for the glory of God! I've always had a fascination with Spurgeon, especially as a Christian raised in the Reformed tradition now belonging to a Baptist church, Spurgeon has been the common link between these two worlds - wholly devoted to doctrine and the sovereignty of God while passionately evangelical providing leadership through service even unto the least of these. The life and ministry of Spurgeon is a picture of a man entirely sold out to God for His glory and for His pleasure. Spurgeon was a man's man and God's man at the same time - what you saw was what you got...and that was a robust, honest, intelligent, passionate, compassionate, animated, serious man of faith.Michael does a great job of really pulling from the life and ministry of Spurgeon some excellent points of application not only for those in ministry, but for everyone who is called to be a \\"minister\\" of the gospel of Christ (all believers). The book is a great read for every parent, businessman, missionary, pastor, lawyer, teacher, musician...the list goes on and on. Spurgeon was a man of highest integrity who lived the same on Monday as he preached about on Sunday. His passion for the orphans of England was matched by his passion to train up another generation of godly young men to preach and teach others God's Word - and he was not merely a man of ideas or words, he was a man of action putting feet to his faith in countless ways.I hope more people are captured by the life of this incredible man whose life goal was to introduce as many people to the saving knowledge of Christ as possible - and with this book, Larry Michael continues the legacy of Spurgeon for another generation!"},{"Title":"Spurgeon on Leadership: Key Insights for Christian Leaders from the Prince of Preachers","review":"Samuel Brengel, a great Salvation Army evangelist wrote: \\"The final estimate of men shows that history cares not an iota for the rank or title a man has borne, or the office he has held, but only the quality of his deeds and the character of his mind and heart.\\" Never has a man proved this more true than Charles Haddon Spurgeon. Larry J. Michael reminds us that Spurgeon decided against formal theological education and ordination early in his ministry. Yet this man who rejected titles such as Reverend and called human ordination, \\"empty hands on empty heads,\\" has been given the title of Prince of Preachers by the generations that have followed him.Many of of our readers will probably ask, \\"Do we really need another book about Spurgeon?\\" Once you read Spurgeon on Leadership, you will certainly be thankful that Larry Michael believed there was such a need. This is not a biography but rather a study in the leadership style of the most influential Baptist in the last two hundred years.The first twelve chapters define the characteristics of Spurgeon's leadership style that set him apart from the crowd.The last two chapters focus on current events in Spurgeon's world and ours and how Christian leadership can respond to those challenges.Spurgeon On Leadership is a highly practical book. Each chapter ends with a list of leadership lessons we can learn from Spurgeon. For example in the chapter on creativity we are given this leadership lesson: \\"The message of the gospel does not change, but the manner of its presentation may be adapted according to the situation. Spurgeon said, \\"I am not very scrupulous about the means I use for doing good ... I would preach standing on my head, if I thought I could convert your souls.\\" (p. 151)Everyone can benefit from this book. Whether you are an official leader in your church or sit on the back row of your Sunday School class there is much to learn here. You will be surprised by some of the things you learn about Spurgeon and yourself along the way.Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Spurgeon On Leadership is that we are reminded of what God wants to do with each of us. Our thanks go out to Dr. Michael for encouraging us to think big thoughts about God and for His work. Spurgeon refused to be forced into other people's boxes and so should we! Let us be what God wants us to be and do it with the gusto that Charles H. Spurgeon did."},{"Title":"Uniter of Heaven and Earth: Rabbi Meshullam Feibush Heller of Zbarazh and the Rise of Hasidism in Eastern Galicia (Suny Series in Judaica) (Suny ...

I've just completed a third reading of the book and I find that as my learning deepens, so does my appreciation of this work. Rabbi Miles Krassen, PhD brings both the dedication and thoroughness of an academic and the depth of understanding of a serious contemplative practice to his work, a rare and deeply appreciated combination.

It is not just an academic tome but has the quality of writing of a true scholar combined with the personal wisdom and understanding necessary to fully address these ideas. Of all the books in English that I have read on this topic, it is rare to find that combination. It is not a book to be read only once, but studied and meditated on again and again.

Heller was part of the circle of closest associates of the Baal Shem Tov though not having spent time with the founder of hasidism himself. A study of his thought then gives us a glimpse into one of the earliest directions of Hasidic thinking before it started to gain some of its narrower focus in the hands of the students of the Maggid of Mezheritch. As such, we find expressions of an ascetic orientation and a harshness of approach that are not so characteristic of the teachings normally attributed to the Besht, the Maggid, and the disciples of the latter. In broadening the picture of early Hasidic thinking Krassen has done a real service for Jewish studies scholarship and the Jewishly educated lay reader.I found Krassen's treatment insightful, incisive, and a model of clarity. In fact, his chapters on 'devekut', cleaving to God, are perhaps the best current introduction to the topic. Accordingly, I have made them required reading in my classes on Hasidism.In short, I highly recommend this erudite and accessible book to all who have an interest, and some background, in the history and thought of Hasidism."},{"Title":"Uniter of Heaven and Earth: Rabbi Meshullam Feibush Heller of Zbarazh and the Rise of Hasidism in Eastern Galicia (Suny Series in Judaica) (Suny ...

I looked forward to each evening, when I could steal a few minutes to read. However, if you can, this book deserves more than a few minutes an evening. You will instantly fall into the story and become captivated by Genevieve, a teenage girl who dressed as a 150 year-old widow. How she came to be in that position, and how she saved the king are the makings of a great story.In the excesses of the Sun King's court, she who was mistress to King Louis XIV reigned supreme. Genevieve was the younger sister to beautiful Marie-Angelique, the angel in the window. She was also the daughter of the Madame Pasquier, whose husband fell out of favour with the king's exchequer, and onto reduced means. Madame Pasquier's main ambition was to have her eldest daughter married to someone with both money and rank, so that her stature would return. Madame Pasquier was also interested in the money that she believed her husband had hidden outside of the country, and would do anything to get her hands on it. Thus, Madame Pasquier turned to La Voisin for help with her future, and in keeping her beauty.During the reign of the Sun King, fortune-telling was not a crime... in fact, it was good business. There were webs of witches in Paris that catered to the wealthy and privileged. One of the most powerful of the witches was La Voisin, the Shadow Queen, who basically controlled a corporation of poisoners, abortionists, fortune-tellers, and other persons who lived in the shadow world. La Voisin also offered franchises, as it were, into her shadow world. With contracts and business-like acumen, she became very wealthy from the success of others.Genevieve had two strikes against her in this world of beauty and perfection. The first reason was that she was born with a malformed foot. The second was that she was raised as a philosopher by her father. Genevieve, being her father's favourite, and was taught the Greeks and Romans, and how Reason rules the world. However, she was a typical teenage girl, who like any teenage girl in any century, wanted to be loved by the beautiful poet who mooned over her sister. Events changed Genevieve's world and put her in the path of La Voisin, who saw the great income potential in the young girl and her ability to see futures in a bowl of still water.Without giving away too much of the story, Genevieve became a strong person in her own right. She was a fascination at the court of the Sun King, and desired by all to have their fortune told. Genevieve was called upon to tell the future that was seen in her Oracle Glass. She was paid handsomely for the images she saw and interpreted them as best she could. Living as a 150 year-old widow, Genevieve earned her own living and learned much about the world.Ms. Riley did a wonderful job of portraying this teenage girl, and how she grew up under disguise and in a time when women typically held no power. There were only a few questions left after finishing the book, but these did not detract from the story. Ms. Riley also switched from third person chapters, which told the overall story or focused on characters that were not Genevieve, or first person chapters (the majority of the novel) so that the reader got more depth of character with Genevieve's thoughts and emotions. This aspect of the novel was very well crafted and flowed very smoothly. To be honest, I did not have any guess as to the outcome of the story until the last section of the book. This also lent to my having thoroughly enjoy the book... not knowing what would happen at the beginning of the story made the reading and discovering the story more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"This book is addictive. I have actually found myself reading it through once, then turning right back and reading it again! The author's turn of phrase and writing style lends itself well to rereads; every time I go back I find some other gem of a phrase or detail I hadn't noticed before. Plus I love the marquise's character, that of an intelligent philosophic woman who I can admire and relate to all at once. Normally I never bother to sit down and recommend a book online; but for this awesome novel I'm making an exception!"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Judith Merkle Riley tells wonderful stories. They are lively stories with finely drawn characters and a whole new (or old) world presented to us. We can follow the characters through streets that are depicted in all details, and learn about human triumphs and failures. This is a terrific book! Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"I read this book after reading (and bemoaning) most of Riley's other books. All, and I mean ALL, of her other heroines are ditzy chicks who need the assistance of holy beings (Hadriel, Anael, or God, depending on the book) to understand life, and even then, they continue to be very ditzy. If I were a feminist I would rail against them for setting the feminist movement back a few hundred years. But I am not specifically a feminist.Anyway, Genevieve Pasquier has a mind of her own, and she uses it. There are times when she's a bit slow to grasp something that seems obvious to the reader (the situation with her father's death and the cause of La Voisin's warm chambers, notably), but she isn't slow in a dippy, airheaded way like Riley's other characters; it's just that she hasn't bothered to put a lot of thought into these situations until confronted with an unpleasant fact that sets the train of thought in motion. Once she has that unpleasant fact, she's perfectly capable of reasoning it to the end. Kind of like me.I really like this book and read it at least once a year. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"The Oracle Glass was on my list of things to read for a long time. I enjoyed Judith Merkle Riley's trilogy about her Medieval heroine, Margaret of Ashbury, but I didn't hurry to read her other books. Belive me, I'm going to remedy that quickly, because it's been a long time since I was so utterly absorbed in and captivated by a novel like I was with The Oracle Glass.Set in Paris during the reign of the Sun King, Louis XIV, The Oracle Glass tells the story of Genevieve Pasquier, the malformed youngest daughter of a domineering and ambitious mother and a ruined and philosophy obsessed father. After she escapes from her family, Genevieve is taken under the wing of La Voisin, the queen of a vast and thriving ring of witches, poisoners, abortionists, and fortune tellers. Under the guise of the 150-year-old Marquise de Morville, Genevieve breaks into the court circles through her natural talent for reading fortunes in water. Initially, she enjoys the wealth and power and the fact that she's regarded by many as a beauty, but as she becomes more deeply involved in court intrigue and, essentially, matures into adulthood, she learns what a dangeerous world she's been pitched into. When she falls out of favor with the king and is forced to turn police informer, she has to make the decision that will save her life.This is one of those novels that had me from the very first page. Ms. Riley researched this book wonderfully and extensively, and her characters were firmly rooted in the period. I loved exploring this different side of Louis XIV's court from the perspectives of both the witches and the police. It's also refreshing to read a novel about witches that's not immediately associated with trials and burnings (although they do occur!), rather it examines witchcraft's daily uses in a world full of supersition and uncertainty.Genevieve is the perfect juxtaposition of likeable and frustrating, hard and emotional. You're rooting for her from the very beginning. La Voisin, with her entire focus on achieving maximum success for herself through the \\"business partners\\" in her network, is the perfect foil. You can't help but wonder who's going to win the battle of wills every time they get together. And the minor characters add color and drama that help drive the story along to its smashing conclusion.This book is, very unfortunately, out of print, but the Margaret of Ashbury trilogy was recently reprinted, so hopefully, there will be a new edition of The Oracle Glass in bookstores one day very soon. Meanwhile, though, get thee to a library. You'll thank me later."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"If you've studied anything about the court and life of the Sun King, Louis XIV, one of the oddest things was that despite the hold that the Catholic Church had on the lives and minds of the people, there was a court case that's baffling to modern minds.This was the Affaire des Poisions.Turns out that the King's official mistress (read good-time-girl) Madame de la Marquise de Montespan was visiting a business woman in Paris by the name of Catherine Voison, who happened to be a witch. La Voison sold potions, arranged for abortions, and arranged for someone to die now and then. Turns out she had an entire bevy of conspirators who were telling fortunes, selling spells and wreaking havoc, all within the ties of a secret society.In this world, the author sets the tale of one Genevieve. Small, dark, born with a twisted spine and a limp, and far too clever for her own good, Genevieve reads, daydreams over young men that would never give her a second look, and remains the apple of her adoring papa's eye.And like Cinderella, she has a stepmother and sister, and that's where the similarity ends with the fairy tale. For Genevieve is much too clever to believe in magic, but then, Cinderella didn't end up in the Seine one night either...And Catherine Voison is the most unlikely of fairy godmothers too. Genevieve accepts her offer when she's suddenly orphaned and forced to live on her wits. Together they work a fraud that sets all Paris abuzz and even the King might take notice of a fortune-teller whose forecasts are uncannily accurate.But several gentlemen are not so easily fooled, among them Desgrez, the chief of the Paris police.I'm going to stop here. It's too good of a read to pass up, and I don't want to spoil this one. Curl up with a cat, and while away a few hours enjoying this one.If you're further piqued by the dazzling Sun-king and his court, I recommend finding a used bookstore and scaring up the Angelique novels, which are even better than this one, and classics in their own right."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The Paris of Louis XIV is brought magically alive under Riley's talented pen -- a fascinating world filled with complex characters and with a strong, intelligent yet flawed woman at its center who is all the more sympathetic for her all-too-human weaknesses.

I never knew that combining so many genres and characters could result in a stunning achievement! This is the kind of book that makes you want to wish that it never ended. So, when it did, I just started from the beginning. I never got bored!I was apprehensive about reading &quot;The Oracle Glass&quot; because I have not read anything by this writer before. I got hooked after reading the book jacket because the time of Louis XIV is my favorite period in French history. I have read many books about the real-life characters in this novel, but never were they more hilariously, and accurately!, portrayed than in &quot;The Oracle Glass&quot;!The main character, Genivieve Pasquier, is refreshing. She is not just very intelligent and well-educated, but clever, witty, and has a dramatic flair. The author takes a chance on making her beauty unconventional. Genivieve has one foot shorter than the other, she is all twisted, and has uncommon, non-classical, features. After the famous sorceress, La Voisin, takes Genivieve under her wing, she does not change her appearance but changes the way people look at Genivieve. I thought that this part was very well thought out. It proves that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and a person is deemed beautiful when they let their inner radiance shine. The fact that she is able to dupe everyone to believe that she is the Marquise de Morville, a 150-year old woman who maintains her youth, is a great lesson in human nature. I also appreciate the fact that she is an independent woman, trying to make a living in a man's world, and succeeding admirably.All central characters are interesting and well drawn out, without being one-dimensional: Marie-Angelique, Genivieve's sister, is light-headed and supercilious, but she is also kind and devoted to Genivieve. Andre Lamotte is utterly charming and carefree, but he is capable of deep emotions. D'Urbec is very complex, with many facets to his personality, capable of fierce emotions from different ends of the spectrum. LaReynie and Desgrez are at times upright and serious and, at the same time, wily and dubious. Although Genivieve's mother, uncle, and brother are evil and insane, there is a lot of pain in them because of their lowly position in life. Finally, La Voisin is the most mysterious and complicated character of all. She has many motives and agendas. You never know what she's thinking or what she is planning to do. She does a lot of wicked things, but she does them because she does not have another alternative. Women at that time could only look to wealthy patronage or prostitution to get ahead.This book is full of little details that are hilarious. One such thing is the parrot, Larito. For most of the book, his only utterances are &quot;Hell and damnation&quot; and &quot;Fire and brimstone&quot;. Of course, he utters them at the most peculiar moments setting the stage for the hilarity that fills this book as much as tragedy does.The only things that I did not like were that there was a list of fictional characters in the beginning of the book. I understand that the list of real-life characters is valuable, but the list of fictional characters is unnecessary. The first-time readers know in advance what characters are coming up and that spoils some of the book's surprises. I also would have appreciated a better background of La Voisin in the novel itself. It would have been interesting to know where she came from and how she came to be the greatest sorceress of that time.Overall, this is a great book. I have never read a book that combines romance, mystery, adventure, and the supernatural so successfully. The greatest thing about this book is that all the characters have their vices, which does not diminish them in the readers' eyes at all. On the contrary, it is easier to suspend disbelief and sympathize with them.I recommend this book to absolutely everyone. Read it and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Judith Merkle Riley is one of the best writerrs of historical fiction working today.As an historian, I am always impressed by Riley's ability to recreate the feeling of a period. The Oracle Glass does a wonderful job of re-creating the world of seventeenth-century Paris where magic and science were uneasy bedfellows.The story focuses on Genevieve, a young girl who pretends to be an aged crone (very aged---she admits to being well over a 100!). Genevieve works for the famed witch, Catherine Montvoisin but she is also a follower of the new philosophy (science).Underneath the persona of an aged wise woman and fortune teller, Genevieve remains a young girl. And like all young girls, she is in love---first with a conceited fop and then, finally (!) with a man who is her intellectual equal and who loves her more than he loves himself.This is the kind of book which you will love to read late at night (preferably a cold winter's night). There is a touch of the supernatural in the story---but it is Riley's mastry of the romance novel which really makes this book great reading for late at night!"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Author Riley does a magnificent job of recreating the life of a young girl in Paris during the reign of Louis XIV. Abandoned in her early years, Genevieve is finally brought home by her kind, scholarly father. Events bring about a change which force her to abandon her family in fear of her life and she is suddenly helped by the mysterious La Voisin. Well known throughout Paris as a fortune teller, La Voisin also has more pratical methods of helping her clients, such as poisons and back room abortions.Blending fictional characters with historical characters, the author really evokes the time period and it is easy to imagine yourself living during this time. I did think the story was slow to start but after about fifty pages, moved much more quickly. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves good historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"This was one of those delicious novels that drew me entirely into its world, that was so vivid I could smell said world's smells and taste its tastes. I wanted to devour this novel and yet I never wanted it to end because it was so wonderfully drawn. It is exactly what I seek whenever I pick up a book: transportation to another time and place.Riley does an amazing job of taking a slice of history and making it real. Textbooks do history a disservice by boiling it down to facts and dates and it is authors like Riley who remind us of the romance, intrigue, and fascination of the past. Though she inserts fictional characters into factual events, she presents the reader with a very rich and detailed picture of Paris in the 1600s. The intrigues and rivalries and crimes of the day rival anything that has happened in modern history and serve to remind us of the danger of burnishing history and turning it into \\"the good old days\\".The story is equal parts historical reenactment, a tale of the triumph of overcoming adverse circumstances through courage and brains, and a touching and satisfying romance.Genvi&egrave;ve is a wonderful and very human character. She is sympathetic and yet, at times, the reader will want to reach into the page and give her a good shake. The perfection of the character rests in the fact that she is not perfect. Though she has a good heart, she does bad and stupid things and possesses the very human flaw of following her heart rather than her head.I am very glad that I have another Riley novel to turn to now that I've finished this one, so skillful, interesting, and wonderful is Riley's writing."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"One of the things I really like about Judith Merkle Riley's books is that she always puts in little details that add humor, make the setting come alive, or just make the characters more human. I'm not really into writing technically analytical reviews, I just mention what I like. I liked The Oracle Glass because the mixture of humor and court intrigue is engrossing. It's a good book to while away an afternoon with. The romance in this book is a little weak to me, partly because you can see how it's going to fall out. Also, you'll have a good idea of how it's going to end halfway through, but it's interesting and likeable enough to finish. It's not rocket science, but it's fun, with some good historical touches, and it made me want to do more research on the historic event that the novel is based on."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"This book is wonderful and has a flesh and blood element to it. It's about a girl who has to survive, so she uses her gift of fortune telling to earn a place to sleep and eat. Her skills scare her as they develope, and the evil people around her use her handicap to lure customers. This is all set in France, in the pre-Naploean era, the book gives a insight into a rich history of france and the super naternal going ons of the time.I couldn't put the book down, I love all of Judith Merkle Rilyes books. The Oracle Glass sort of makes this bound between you and the heroine. In real life not everyone is beatiful, and what I like about this book is that the heroine finds an alternative skill to better her life."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"This book kept me entertained the entire way through.

I read it, and I love it then and I still love it now. Since, I've bought my own copy and I've probably read it twenty times. THE ORACLE GLASS is intelligent, entertaining, and the main character is admirable and still the reader can identify with her; it shows Genevieve maturing and finding herself and her true love, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. My only complaint is that the book ended too soon. If you like THE ORACLE GLASS, look for THE SERPENT GARDEN (good but not as good, in my opinion.)"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Oracle Glass was a very different type of historical read for me, VERY descriptive, it had a soft touch of magic, suspense and some humor. This story is about a woman's (Genevieve's) journey of life, her life and all of the trails tributes along the way. I found it to be a touching, adventurous tale to a woman's very long journey to gain peace in her life and with herself. Die hard historical fans would most enjoy reading Oracle Glass.What's a girl to do when she's not wanted in the first place? Considered the furthest from the bell of the ball, she trudges her paces through life after losing two loved ones so closely to the other, the only two that really understood her, accepted and loved her. She experiences the most traumatic occurrences one young woman could ever endure, not only from her losses, but from a vicious attack on her by person that called themself family. Found by the leader of a witch's occult while she was leaving her home, she is taken in to a new world, molded and finalized as one of the best of the best seer's of all time. Genevieve goes through a lot of change. Her appearance, company she keeps, the way she lives and many others that could be listed.One question that always lingered in her mind was, could anyone ever love her? She does not search for it, but does find some companionship. The day love does find her she'll be swept off her feet as she's truly meant to be.This book is packed full of treachery, murder, deceit, revenge, mystery, and secrets. The ending left a lot for the mind to ponder for it was not final. Is there a plan to continue on with Genevieve's story?*Warning there are scene(s) that have involve an incest in form of rape and some mentions and situations of abortion. Those who take offence to those occurrences may find some parts of the story unlikable or not to their tastes."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Riley has outdone herself in this spellbinding novel.

Normally I'm done a book and on to the next one in a week or so; but The Oracle Glass keeps bringing me back to Genevive's world and the characters in it! It's great for coming off of heavier novels for college courses in the evenings, few other books are like this.

One of my favorites"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"This is the book I read after every semester in school, after vacation or when I have &quot;Riley withdrawals.&quot; I had to include my review here, because it is so very good. This is my favorite story of all her books; Genevieve Pasquier is a believable and remarkable heroine--she actually has weaknesses! Shes &quot;ugly&quot; and is upset about it! She has a mind and a father that reads philosophy--how unique is that! (Ok, so her mom is looney and poisons people and her sisters a romantic fool, but hey, family's always weird!) Then you've got the interwoven story of the witches and D'Urbec for a great page turning tale! Too bad this isn't a literary classic; I truly feel it should be!"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"17th-century Paris is the setting for this tale of a 16-year-old girl who becomes the protege of the leading female occultist of the time. In an incredibly Byzantine plot, the girl is transformed and rises to a position of great influence in the wackiness surrounding the court of the Sun King. There's all kind of sensational stuff, poison, black masses, abortionists, and the usual stalwarts love and revenge. At times it gets a little overwrought, but it's fairly good fun nonetheless. If one were to be totally honest, probably more likely to appeal to female readers."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"While the characters in this tome are compelling, I found the prose to be lacking in the depth and maturity necessary to sustain a story with as many facets as this one has. The result is a story line that feels illogical, chaotic and predictable."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad book. For one thing, it has a great setting: what could be more fun than 17th century Paris mixed with witchcraft and court intrigue? The main character is believable and even intelligent. And the first half of the book is riveting, with a plot that moves along in curves and twists and keeps you coming back for more.The problems start coming in about halfway through the book. The plot, which had been hurtling along at a brisk pace, grinds to a halt. The characters start to get into a fixed routine that rapidly becomes stale, and all the suspense evaporates. In fact, Genevieve predicts the ending of the book several times throughout the story, so there's no fear of her being killed or even emotionally hurt.Emotional scenes need work--they have all the plausibility of a B-movie performance. I got the impression that the author has an intellectual understanding of such scenes, without a true grasp of the feeling behind them. As a result, romance is a crutch rather than a highlight of this book. The same holds true for some of the characters--they are intellectual constructs of a certain character type rather than psychologically complex people.It's also a pity that the court intrigue, so often hyped in the first half of the book, is really not as complex and vivid as it could have been. Perhaps what really irked me about this book is that with such a great setting, the plot had enormous potential, but instead just peters out. It is worth reading to get a feel for the period, and it's fun in its way. I would recommend it to fantasy fans in need of pure escapism, with Riley as a sort of fantasy counterpart to Danielle Steel. If you come to it expecting to have fun and nothing more, you probably won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Her voice is unique - combine a historian/philosopher with modern sensibility. How many writers have that ability?She has created brave and gallant characters - enough to engage any reader of perception and interest."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"First I will tell of the two faults I have with the book. 1) the first chapter feels out of place, and it is hard to get into the right mood after it. 2) the charecters don't feel as if they have been described enough when they were introduced. With the exception of the two or three main characters. However I fell in love with the book when I bought it (on a whim for 3$ at a bargin book store). I have read it twice and am working on it for the third time. It is amazing! Everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"The book was a great read.

After reading this book, you'll stop wishing you were a noble in France during the time of Versailles as it appears a much more dangerous place than you originally thought."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"I just love this book. I accidentally found it in a library about a decade ago and re-read it many times over the years. It's a good book that keeps your attention, well written with historical authenticity and cute love insterest."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"It's a story about a girl from a good home, that is not really good. Her mother does not like her because she is deformed. So this girl transforms into the most sought after seer in Paris. What a Cinderella story. Ok not really. But she took life in her own hands and made something out of it. At a time when a woman should not be alone.One negative thing about the book would be that it could have been shorter, like 150-100 pages shorter. Because even though it kept out the pace it still felt like it dragged a bit since it was so long. And I am unsure about the end. I can't say but, sometimes you know for sure, and sometimes you can just be 70% sure about something, mysterious, well yes ;)A secret network of witches, poison, court intrigues at the splendid Sun Court. A world where you can tell futures and those rich enough to spend their money will believe every word you say.Genevieve was a nice heroine, her mentor La Voisin a nice baddie without being crazy bad. She was just a big spider in a net. Then there was a tiny bit of romance, just a tiny bit late on as Genevieve became more popular.There are real historical characters in this one, including La Voisin. And the author mixes reality and fiction in a nice blend."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"This is a great novel: amusing, easy to read, mostly respectful of the history involved, and full of surprises that I should have seen coming. Start it early in the day. If you have to put it down before finishing, you'll want to pick it up again right away."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"I found the historical setting, details and writing enjoyable. Even though this is a pretty long read, it goes quickly. Set in 17th century Paris, it offered an interesting view into court life and it's outskirts. The story line and the characters were well written, with only a few slow spots or confusing twists. The love story was a nice addition! I recommend this to any fan of historical fiction, especially if you enjoy stories with a strong female lead."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"I admit that I'm a sucker for a historical novel with a deep sense of time and place, where the history is more than \\"wallpaper\\" and the characters do not have 21st century sensibilities dressed in farthingales or knee breeches. If the main character in such a book is a woman navigating the obstacles of her time period, so much the better.The Oracle Glass has all of that and more. It is the story of Genevieve Pasquiers, a very intelligent teenage girl who is left for dead by her scheming family, and adopted by a different type of scheming family, a company of women who are either witches, business women or both. This family is headed by La Voison, a real historical personage whose reign over the Parisian demimonde coincided with that of the Sun King, Louis XIV. La Voison sees the potential in young Genvieve, who has the ability to read the future on the surface of water. The first half of the book, in which Genevieve grows to the age of 15, stumbles innocently into the intrigues of her family, is cast out and then brought into La Voison's operations and made over into a sophisticated century-old crone with mystical powers, is riveting reading. I was rooting for Genevieve the entire way and enjoyed her rise to power. And lurking in the background are the shadowy and frightening figures of the Parisian police investigators, who bode no good for Genevieve or her compatriots if the extent of their schemes ever come to light.Unfortunately the book does sag somewhat in the second half. The plot that roars along through the first half, stalls, even as Genevieve's situation begins to go downhill. While the last 75 pages or so pick back up again and the book steams to a conclusion, the slow and repetitive plot made several hundred pages a bit harder to read.Still, the history and intrigue of a time I am less familiar with than the more usual British historical settings kept me going. I was grateful for the cast of characters listed in the beginning of the book--I needed it to keep all the court schemers straight! Like another favorite historical author, Philippa Gregory, Judith Merkle Riley builds her story around a female figure with the intelligence and nerve to build a degree of power and independence in a time that wasn't very friendly to women. Like Gregory, this character is a sharp observer at a key period of history, on the fringe of the interactions between great historical figures and in constant danger of being overrun by them. Even with the plot difficulties in the middle of the novel, this makes for a compelling and interesting read. This was my first book by Riley but it will definitely not be my last."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"I loved this book! wonderfully written mesmerizing ,clever,did not want to put it down not much on 17th century reading this is a must read !"},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"The oracle glass was a very good read.

It brings to life an aspect of the life lived in the mid 1600's that has really never been presented so openly.It is true that under King Louis XIV, the &quot;Sun King&quot;, life was very hard for the common people, while at Court, life was extremely frivolous. But in this book it shows the extent people were willing to go to live in, and be accepted by, that Court.Very interesting book full of detail and very lively characters."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

The heroine is unique, but so very believable- i identified with her from the first. It is not always that heroines in historicals are portrayed as less than perfect. She starts out as being described as a grotesque little monkey to a straight backed young women with the nobility at her knees. A little improbable, maybe, in real-life terms., but the message is clear- A strong will and determination will help you rise when the odds are stacked against you. The pace of the book nevar slackens, and it is intense, gripping, and the constant physical pain the heroine is under gives the book the extra vicious edge, that tells your brain-this is real, and it hurts ! A book that speaks more clearly to me than most, as one of the many Imperfect who walk this planet, in the shadow of the rest ."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"Aside from the possibly incorrect portrayal of witchcraft (such as the ridiculous idea of the Black Mass), the remainder of THE ORACLE GLASS is excellent. Through the eyes of a young woman fortune-teller, the reader sees the difficulties of life for women of 17th century Paris - that men forced them to get abortions from quacks so they ended up dead and their bodies were thrown in the alley, that any unmarried woman who ran a business or earned any money could have everything seized by a male relative and she could be locked up in a convent, and the double-standard of married men having as many mistresses as they want but any woman was considered a whore and could be arrested for prostitution. From Genevieve's intelligent logic-and-reason point of view, the overly-plumed, -wigged, and -laced aristocracy and the &quot;witches&quot;appear very comical. I laughed aloud many times."},{"Title":"The Oracle Glass: A Novel","review":"This book is my all time favorite book.

I found the story to be engaging, the characters compelling and overall hard to put down. Riley's style does not take a story too seriously (which I enjoy), yet gives plenty of meat to satisfy the most fickle reader. There is plenty of intrigue, and magic and the protagonist is a great heroine for the literary and historical buffs.Once done I had many friends clamoring to barrow it, who enjoyed it as much as I did. After giving my first copy to my (then 16) cousin, another avid reader, I had to have a copy to loan to my friends.

This book is a delightful piece of writing by Sim Van der Ryn and is to be experienced, not just read.Sim Van der Ryn buries this jewel in the text on page 127: \\"The heart of ecological design is not efficiency or sustainability. It is the embodiment of the animating spirit, the soul of the living world as embodied in each of us waiting to be reborn and expressed in what we design.\\"\\"Design for Life\\" chronicles Sim's childhood inspirations after World War II, the trials and successes at Berkeley in the 1960's, his experiments in sustainable home construction and self-supporting communities, and his environmentally responsive style of architecture. Woven throughout the 175 pages are poignant stories, watercolors illustrating thought processes, and 200 rich color photos.Sim is the real deal, he is an architect even a builder could love. He lived it, breathed it; designed it, built it, improved it, and analyzed it. His stories convey a deep sense of reverence for building structures with meaning. The book will float you down a lazy river through a kaleidoscope of experiences that leave you in awe of the pioneering efforts of one individual with vision and a dedication to be true to himself. He did not intentionally create the new genre of green architecture. A universal intelligence flowed through Sim and his architecture was the fruits.Sim Van der Ryn is best known for a spectacular rammed earth guitar house and the ever-impressive Real Goods corporate headquarters. He also co-authored a landmark book with Peter Calthorpe in 1986, \\"Sustainable Communities,\\" a book that was early to recognize the intelligence of planned villages."},{"Title":"Design For Life: The Architecture of Sim Van der Ryn","review":"The small town I live in is going through a boom period. There are new housing developments all over and in all price ranges. And the houses really suck. From little boxes at the low price end to McMansions at the high end, there is absolutely no originality, no thought of energy or water conservation. (I live in a desert climate, all of these houses have thick lucious grass lawns that have to be watered every day.)I'm thinking of a new house, smaller, since the kids are gone, but with some special features for my hobbies. It is really refreshing to see a book like this one that takes into account what can be done. The book is sort of a cross between an autobiography and an idea book. The autobiographical emphasis is on how events in his life shaped the ideas he has transposed into buildings.I don't aee any of the buildings described in the book as being exactly what I want, but I see lots of parts of various buildings that when combined together come pretty close. All in all, I found more of what I wanted in this book than in any other idea book I've seen."},{"Title":"Design For Life: The Architecture of Sim Van der Ryn","review":"Wonderful review of what went right in the last 50 years in architecture, by a forward thinking, brilliant mind."},{"Title":"Design For Life: The Architecture of Sim Van der Ryn","review":"After reading the author's earlier work this book was a surprise.

I find this inexcuseable in an author writing a book about solar observation.His \\"not safe\\" conclusion is correct if anyone tried to follow his use instructions as they are totally wrong.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears. 1987.British Folktale Picture BookThe author uses its own unique style to tell a story that not only entertains, but provides children with insight into other's feelings. The words sometimes flow a little choppily. Some might find this distracting to their importance. Upon hearing the story, various types of expression by its recipients is possible. While the retelling is adequate, what this book mainly brings comes from its magnificent illustrations.Amazing illustrations are characteristic of the author/illustrator. The illustrator is the author of the retelling. She is well known and keeps to her consistent theme as in her other stories, with \\"Hedgie\\" intricately hidden on the bedposts. The frames keep the story flowing from one scene to the next, allowing the reader to anticipate each page's turn. Every page gives the reader an eyeful. The pictures capture attention and want to be looked at again and again. Each look brings more discoveries of the illustrator's attention to detail.The author/illustrator encourages cognitive stimulation. Young thinkers are positioned to breakaway from the mind's general imagination and look deeper into the interpretation. A youngster seeing the pictures and hearing the words is most likely considering his or her own self as an addition to each scene. Young children are able to make personnel connections to the story as it is analyzed and made meaningful."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"This whimsical depiction of Goldilocks and the Three Bears doesn't do anything new or innovative with the storyline, but it doesn't have to.

Then, when the bears come home and catch her asleep, mother bear (who looks like Mammie from \\"Gone With The Wind\\") tells her she can come back any time she feels like it. In a nutshell this is a children's version of actual events involving Nordic European settlers who roll in and claim everything as theirs. The only thing missing from this story is rape and smallpox.

One of the BEST illustrations I have seen in a children's book in a long time. Better suited for older preschool aged kids/ younger elementary school kids since it is a little scary.

I think this one is her favorite. I love to hear her retell it, \\"great, hooge bear.\\""},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"This is the classic story of Goldilocks, adapted from Andrew Lang's Green Fairy Book and lavishly illustrated in Jan Brett's wonderful style. It is told in the traditional way, with its repetitive scenes, different voices, and climactic ending. Goldilocks unashamedly trespasses in the three bears' home, damages and steals their property, and deserves the fearful ending (and perhaps a worse punishment). Parents will have to supply their own moral evaluation, however, because the author's emphasis is rightfully on the pleasing symmetry of the tale and the careful details in each picture and its borders, which provide glimpses of other characters. Goldilocks is warmly and lovingly drawn, with shining blonde braids and a beautifully embroidered dress; the bears are also dressed in traditional German costumes, and their furniture is intricately carved with bears and other images. The excellent artistry supplies a visual feast to accompany this traditional story.There may be a better illustrated Goldilocks book, but this is the best I've seen."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"Variations on \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\" have long entranced children. Whether it is Robert Southey's version from 1837, whether Goldilocks was simply an old woman, or the many modern varieties, the themes are the same: If it isn't yours, don't touch it.\\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears,\\" as told and drawn by Jan Brett, is a thrill to read. With big pictures, ready for a parent or teacher to show to younger ones, it is in typical Jan Brett detail. Doe-eyed Goldilocks does all the things we expect, as do the two parent bears and their son, the little, small, wee bear.Bear motifs decorate the bears' kitchenware, providing a \\"Where's Waldo?\\" type of exercising and a smile for the child as he finds another bear hidden in the pictures.Special care looks to be taken with drawing a realistic rendition of Goldilocks.The retelling is good, though not magnificent. It will read without a hitch as far as meter is concerned. It is prose, but told in a fairy tale mode. The repetitions of describing the bears as they discover evidence of Goldilocks will be fun to say and hear aloud.The bears are not as intimidating as they might be in real life. When the final confrontation comes, it is far less scary. The bears, in fact, with the little one in particular, are sympathetic as they watch Goldilocks sleep. She runs not because of provocation, but from the surprise of waking with three large animals watching. I would run too!I fully recommend \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\" drawn by Jan Brett.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"This book has beautiful, magical, fantastical pictures with Jan Brett's typical detail and whimsy. The bear's house is extraordinary. I think it is one of her very best books and goes well with the old-fashioned text. No other version of this story compares."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"I found this wonderful classic inspirational ! That Ms. Brett would go to such INCREDIBLE detail and fine art to tell the story. Even when my children were small - we would study every page EVERY time we read it and linger on the intricacy. Well done!"},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"The book Goldylocks and the Three Bears was a very good book. The book was about a family of three bears who decided to go on a picnic. There's first a big papa bear, then a medium mama bear, and then there is a little baby bear. Then Goldylocks comes trottying along and Stumbles upon the three bears's home. She sees that no one was in the house so she decides to go right ahead on in. Then she eats the bears food, breaks one of there chairs, and falls asleep in baby bears bed, and of course they catch her. I always loved reading this book for some reason, maybe because it takes place in the blackwoods of Germany. This book is a definate read for all children. No child should go with out three little bears, it's a classic!"},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"This is the original story, well told. I rate it at 4, versus 5, stars, though, because of the illustrations. Although absolutely beautiful, from an artistic point of view, they are a little complicated, from a child's point of view. For instance, there is an illustration of Goldilocks sitting on Papa Bear's chair, but no illustration of Mama Bear's chair or Goldilocks trying it out. Same for the beds. The main illustrations are framed with smaller illustrations which seem to be referencing all that Goldilocks does, but I bought this book for my two year old (who LOVES it), and I think it would be clearer for him if it had more explicit illustrations."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"Brett's recreation of this much adapted, favourite nineteenth century folk-based tale is luminescent. A faithfully reworked text is simple and clear, poetic and great for reading aloud to younger children. While toddlers should enjoy the text and exploits of the &quot;little, small, wee bear&quot;, older children and adults will derive much pleasure from this work's seemingly endless visual splendour. The painted illustrations are sublime. Brilliant, clear, richly textured, and exquisitely patterned, this book should be acquired for its artistry alone. One yearn's to reach out and touch the embroidery of the characters' clothing, stroke the bears' bristling fur, feel the porcelain-smooth, bright and beautifully decorated porridge bowls, and rub the wood grain of the handsomely carved house posts and bed boards. Beyond their technical brilliance, each painting richly illustrates the corresponding text and enlivens its characters. In Brett's version Goldilocks is at once angelic and yet completely lacking self restraint, the violated bears are more bemused than belligerent, and baby bear is a curious, playful and frolicking tot. Delightful border art offers additional commentary and foreshadowing, as well as a charming,independent narrative about a family of gardening mice. A must."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"[It is odd that some of the below reviews here are for the James Marshall version of Goldilocks, but this review is for the Jan Brett book.]As with all of Ms. Brett's books, the illustrations are sumptuous and wonderfully detailed. I agree however with 2 previous reviewers that there are some illustrations missing and that the wording is cumbersome to read outloud.By missing illustrations, we mean that not every picture of the trilogy of bowls, chairs, and beds (big, medium, little) is shown and I think this makes it difficult for small children to follow. This oversight seems particularly odd considering that Ms. Brett could have included the missing actions in the usual side-bar pictures that she is renown for.Also problematic (but overcome by the patient parent) is the cumbersome wording that refers to the bears not as momma, pappa, and baby bear, but \\"great, huge bear\\", \\"middle-sized bear\\", and \\"little, small wee bear\\". Perhaps it parallels the original telling of the story, but to me and at least one other parent, it made if hard to read outloud.That said, my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) give this a definite thumbs up as an excellent addition to your bookshelves."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"I love Jan Brett's books, but this is not one of my favorites. The wording is tedious to read, and I found myself skipping sentences to avoid it.

There is so much going on in a Jan Brett book.You can read Goldilocks as a straight story book, words and pictures, and enjoy it very well.You can go back to the beginning and hunt for little mice in the woodcuts on every page, and watch as they plant and tend crocus bulbs that will turn into the flowers Goldilocks is collecting when she discovers the three bears' house.You can look for \\"live\\" mice on every page, and act out their emotions as they enjoy the story.You can guess each one of the three bears' favorite things by looking at their colors and motifs all through the story. Papa bear likes yellow things and bumblebees; Mama bear likes red things and strawberries, and Baby bear likes blue things and mushrooms.Every page is loaded with clues as to what comes next -- your child can tell you the next part of the story before you turn the page.The illustrations are extraordinary. This is my favorite Jan Brett book. Enjoy it with your family."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"I was not impressed with this version of Goldilocks, while the illustrations were beautiful, the added repetitive wording got very tiresome. I was reading this to my 6 month old, and I don't mind that they didn't call them \\"Papa, Mama and Baby\\" but repeating \\"great, huge, big, giant, large, huge bear\\" every other sentence was exhausting to read and quite boring, did not keep her attention or mine at all."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"In this story, Goldilocks learns a lesson. She learns not to go into other people's houses. She ate their good, broke their chair and slept in their bed. She woke up and saw the bears. She was scared! Goldilocks learns not to go in other strangers houses and take anything from them. She might be taking something special from them...Perla K."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"This is a nice retelling of the familiar three bears story. The only thing I did not like about the wording is that she refers to the bears as \\"great, huge bear\\", \\"middle-sized bear\\", and \\"little, small, wee bear\\". I think that this would be a mouthful to read aloud, and personally I just like \\"momma bear\\", \\"papa bear\\", and \\"baby bear\\" better. However, the illustrations in this book make up for it because they are absolutely gorgeous. They are incredibly detailed, and include the borders and previews to the next pages that Jan Brett is known for. I really enjoyed looking at this book, and found something new in the artwork each time I did!"},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"The illustrations in the book are gorgeous. However, they are possibly too complex for young readers. Still, the illustrations are beautiful. I really object to the descriptions of the three bears. Papa bear has become a \\"great, huge bear\\" and mama bear the \\"middle-sized bear\\" while baby bear is now a \\"little, small, wee bear\\". Ridiculous! The story has gone from a family of bears, whose home is invaded by a (beautifully drawn) little girl, to an unrelated collection of bears of varying sizes that make the story clunky to read, for no obvious benefit to the story or anything else besides some distorted sense of political correctness. I've returned the book, and suggest that you look elsewhere for the classic story."},{"Title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"My daughter loves this book and wants it read to her over and over. Thank goodness for the beautiful illustrations. I never get bored, even having reads it to her numerous times in a day, because there is always something new to see in the pictures."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"Telling a cohesive story from the narrative perspective of multiple characters is one of the toughest tricks in fiction. One voice usually outshines the others. Wide Blue Yonder is the glorious exception that proves the rule. All four voices are not only distinctive and wonderful but they balance and inform each other as well, spanning the spectrum from a young girl's teenage ennui to a con man's deepening madness. That Thompson's prose is crisp and often startlingly inventive is icing on a cake that is already deep and rich and completely satisfying."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"It's been a long time since I enjoyed reading a novel as much as I have enjoyed reading Wide Blue Yonder. The novel is well-written and funny and contains wonderful characters. The story takes place in Springfield Illinois in the hot, hot summer of 1999. Josie, a disaffected 17 year old lives with her divorced mother and spends the summer working at Taco Bell, avoiding her father, and stalking a gorgeous young policeman who wandered into her life one day. Her mother, Elaine, who tries so hard to be happy, is also trying to help her ex-husband's Uncle Harvey, who refers to himself as the Local Forecast (he's a bit obsessed with the weather channel). As Harvey keeps track of the weather heating up, things are heating up in Springfield. Josie's pursuit of her obsession takes her down a dangerous path and Elaine's pursuit of salvation for Harvey threatens to take him down another dangerous path. This story is told with much clever humor, with Josie's cynical observations on Springfield life being perhaps the most amusing. I really enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"According to seventeen-year-old Josie, Springfield is one of those places that &quot;used to be important but were now only good for being state capitals.&quot; With great characters (flawed and all), amazing prose, and using weather as a metaphor, Jean Thompson offers up a troubled story. This is a book that is driven by its appealing characters -- and not by the plot. The heat and storms of summer 1999 run parallel with the characters' unheaval and ultimate transformation. But the great prose is not enough to warrant a five star rating -- the plot is weak at best and the ending just plain silly. That said, her characters are awesome: Frank, Teeny, Yoo Hoo, Officer Crook -- I could not get enough. Also, her keen observations made for hilarious reading (I especially got a kick out of Abe Lincoln turned father figure to young Josie).If you are a softie for great writing, dialogue, and good character development, do not miss this book. I look forward to Jean Thompson's next book and will read &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; in the meantime."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"There's no doubt that Thompson is skilled at her craft. Her plotlines are strong and her characters unique yet recognizable.I love her blunt style, the way she fashions things without pretense or overwriting.That said, this novel lost me from time to time when the point of view began to shift and the writing style changed and changed again to keep that stormy pace. I really did not want to read pages and pages of screwed up text, no matter how \\"accurate\\" that is, or how well it gives us insight into a minor character.As for the major characters, they are well etched and set in constant motion. I liked Josie. I liked the way she moved about the world in her own teenage way. But this never seemed like Josie's book, and I never quite figured out whose book it was.In the end, I found the novel to be a bit like the storm described within its pages, a force that picks up characters and throws them about, a storm sometimes tame and confusing, but a storm sometimes fierce and strong and quickly cutting."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"This is the story of a teenage girl who seemeingly has nothing on her horizon but trouble. Her uncle believes that he is the Weather Channel's \\"Local Forecast\\". Unknown to them both is that a raging loner from Los Angeles is heading toward their hometown of Springfield.This is a beautifully written, dark and suspenseful novel. Thompson's writing is crisp, realistic, and she does an excellent job of capturing on paper what life is like in the heartland. I highly recommend this novel. I, for one, will be looking for more from Jean Thompson."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"Thompson is a fantastic writer, but I have to say I was into the characters sometimes and at other times not so much. Sometimes I felt too much in a character's head, like there wasn't enough for me to figure out on my own. Other times I felt too distant, like I needed more to care. That, and the conclusion of the story seemed to come from nowhere (this was intentional, as one of the motif's in the book is the weather, how random and powerful an approaching storm can be-but I still didn't like it). But her depiction of small-town life is great, the characters are original, and the writing is superb."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"While I love Jean Thompson's short stories ... being able to sink my teeth into this delicious hunk of a novel was even more satisfying. And frankly ... sad or dark endings have become trite at this point in literary evolution. What a relief to finish a novel without wanting to weep."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"With an adventurous teen paired up with a doddering elderly uncle, &quot;Wide Blue Yonder&quot; takes normal life onto a roller-coaster ride full of daring and danger. Very much alike in their stubborn &amp; feisty personalities, Josie and her Uncle Harvey are both exceedingly uncomfortable around the other members of the family. Following a few disastrous events, they land together in a situation that is hilariously played out by Josie's ability to rise to the occasion.Jean Thompson does a great job in creating these two; I especially enjoy that a character as young as Josie possesses such a bold personality and that old Harvey is not quite as out to lunch as others assume. Elaine, Josie's mother, is a rather bland character serving to connect these two but it is Rolando, the wild card from California, who ultimately binds them together and catapults the story to its frenzied conclusion.Like some of the other readers, I must admit not caring much for Rolando -- the harsh nature of his character is a disturbing and discordant note in &quot;Wide Blue Yonder.&quot; Thankfully, Thompson has also created a wonderful stout and non-English speaking maid who eclipses Rolando's ugliness of spirit with her own trust in life. Through her pained love affair, Josie may well represent the heart of the novel, but it is in this wonderful character of steel and grace, unencumbered by words, that Thompson embodies the soul of her novel.So while the summer sun is still shining, I think you'll find &quot;Wide Blue Yonder&quot; a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"I love this book. exciting, different, wacko (some of them) characters. liked josie the best. this is my favourite book of all time. i recommend it. what more can i say? i am hooked."},{"Title":"Wide Blue Yonder","review":"I liked these characters -- Josie, Elaine and Harvey --a lot at first. They were quirky enough to be interesting and I liked the way Thompson worked the plot around them. Then she brought in Rolando, a crazy mixed up Hispanic. I knew something bad was going to happen and I didn't like it. I think Thompson wanted to write about the first three people and their lives, but couldn't figure out how to make the novel stay entertaining and come out right. She set these three characters in motion, then realized she didn't have a clue as to what would happen in the end, so she added a &quot;bad guy&quot; for excitement and a big conclusion. I didn't like how easily everyone's problems were solved including the bad guy's. The ending was too neat a package with everyone all lovey-dovey."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"After reading In This Mountain I have decided that Jan Karon should follow Father Tim's example and retire. I have been a Mitford fan since I read the first book and always beat a path to the bookstore to get &quot;the next one&quot;. In This Mountain isn't as bad as &quot;the last one&quot; but I found myself doing the unthinkable - skipping whole sections! And I had a headache after every few pages - poor Father Tim's head is always pounding! Sad to say - very disappointing."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"These were great books to read."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Once I got into the book, which has a slow start as the main character is worrying about moles in his yard (yawn....), I enjoyed it. It's a quick read. Unfortunately, much of the action is predictable and corny, but it's also relaxing to read something that isn't, frankly, challenging. Think of this as an adult version of a children's bedtime story. Peaceful and sleepy. Nothing wrong with that. I won't hold it against the author that the photo of her on the back of the book, complete with too much jewelry, too much hair, and what looks like real fur trimming her clothing, makes her look like Edith Mallory, one of the book's antagonists. Somehow, I assumed the author would look more like the sweet Cynthia character (the minister's wife). All in all, this book is delightful, undemanding, and spiritually uplifting. As someone with a number of Jewish friends, I do wish the author would downplay the Christian rhetoric, though. One can be spiritual without pushing a particular religious agenda. (I gave a hospitalized Jewish friend a copy of this book before I had read it and before I realized it had Christian overtones.)"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I've liked Karon's Mitford books, but this one was almost too much. Must EVERY exchange between Tim and his friends include, &quot;Im praying for you,&quot; and &quot;And Im praying for you, too&quot;? I started noting this early on, checked each occurrence, and there's more than forty such exchanges. Now even for a priest, that'a little much. And I have come to skip over the paragraph where Tim asks Cynthia, &quot;And what DON&quot;T you love?&quot; Her cutesy replies are gag material. And the description of Edith Mallory &quot;trapping&quot; Tim in a locked room and trying to seduce him is almsot Saturday Night Live material. All this said, the nice telling of ordinary stories in an ordinary town is refreshing, and with the above qualifications, this still is a good read."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The (endless) crisis of an old man, thickly spread with religious jam. Ms Karon has given up story telling in favor of preaching, not an appealing choice."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Reading any of Karon's \\"Mitford Series\\" is somewhat like reading about people who have been raised for their entire lives to date in some dark closet. Her characters are absolutely and purely ignorant of virtually any and all aspects of human culture, human civilization or human achievement. Their conversation reveals no inkling of what year it is, or what state they are in, much less what nation or planet they are on. In the real world these creatures would have spent the last 50 years glued to the front of the boob tube, and essentially their entire conversation would be devoted to soap operas, talk shows and televised sports.Yet apart from a few vague references to a \\"remote,\\" or the \\"five o'clock news,\\" there is little evidence anyone even has a TV... much less reads a (non-local) newspaper or books, fiction or nonfiction. [Hope, who runs the local bookstore, does seem to know who Thirkell and Wodehouse are.]For quite a few years Karon has been mining the vein of \\"non-books\\" diligently, rather than supplying new \\"adventures\\" (to use the word very loosely) for Father Tim and his fellow prisoners. This is finally the 6th Mitford novel (despite what the publisher claims), and takes over roughly where A NEW SONG left off. As we join the team, Father Tim and wife are getting ready to spend a year living in a tent in Goatbugger, Tennessee doing something the author never bothers to specify, because it is obvious to both author and reader that Tim ain't gonna get there (what would become of Violet, for example!). Instead Tim, in his customary mindless way, manages to seriously injure himself and another minister, and spends the rest of the novel in a deep, brooding depression. It's not that Tim is communing with his inner thoughts, because like all the other characters, HE HAS NO THOUGHTS! And that makes this novel very rough going, to say the least.As another reviewer noted on these pages, \\"pray\\" is almost the only verb in the book, and it seemingly appears about 5 times per page. Otherwise, nothing happens. There is some nonsense about a lunatic who wants to build a log cabin the size of a cathedral, or maybe a cathedral the size of a log cabin, his raving being unclear on this point; continuing villain Edith Mallory makes her customary pointless appearance; Father Tim gets a computer and goes online so he can read his own e-mail; some ex-cons need the good Father's support; one of Dooley's missing brothers turns out to have, gosh, been right there all along; and that's pretty much the size of it. About the only suspense concerns whether or not incidental characters Hope and Helene will become regular church attendees and I wouldn't dream of spoiling that for you!Rumors are afoot that in a later novel in the series, Father Tim will encounter for the first time in his life a Muslim, or a Hindu, or a Jew, or a Catholic, or a university professor, or a scientist, or even an uppity knee-grow, and expire from shock and heart-failure. I don't think loyal readers need to worry."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I enjoy the Mitford series.

The owner of the diner tries to figure out the best way to offer chicken gizzards when a frequent customer makes a recommendation. The strength of this book lies in the characters, but it also has a strong plot involving Tim Kavanaugh the main character, and a bout with diabetes.

I am sorry, however, to read that there will be only two more forthcoming,with the end of the series is coming in 2005. Jan Karon has captured my laurels with her simple, gentle readings. Believe me, in these times the Mitford books are a delightful retreat from the horrors on the news. I suppose it is difficult to keep producing these books for the demand, but I with the Muse would inspire Jan Karon to give us many more."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I think not only did we get an update on the &quot;Mitford&quot; family, but some important subjects were touched upon.

I found five of the nine books but unable to obtain the other four so I went to Amazon.com and was successful. The trouble was, the four I found was not in sequence so I was determined to find the others because I was so into the story. I also ordered two books my aunt (who recommended them) needed to complete her set. The first book was delivered incorrectly but Amazon.com stepped right in and shipped the correct book plus free shipping. Thanks Amazon.com!!!!!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"In This Mountain takes you though a miriad of emotions of Father Tim and his family and friends in Mitford. Jan Karon allows the characters to experience joy, pain, sorrow, and rejoice... I had a hard time putting it down once I started reading it.

The condition of the tapes was not very good. I had to shake them and rewind and forward wind to keep them playing at times."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Jan Karon's muse is definitely back. This book is a joyful read. Father Tim has always served as an inspiration to me just as he does to everyone he comes across. The characters that surround him in the Mitford books have become more real to me than the people in my own neighborhood, and church. Jan Karon is a gifted author, and enjoying her books has been a real blessing to me. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"While I have enjoyed the other Mitford books, if I've had any complaint it is that the stories are a little too pat and everyone is a bit too cute. I was pleased and moved by the direction that Karon took In This Mountain. I felt this book had more substance than her previous books, while retaining their charm. Father Tim's wrestlings were very meaningful to me, and sermon he delivers near the end of the book is a masterpiece. I hope this indicates the future direction of the Mitford series."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"In this latest of Jan Karon's novels, the pace is considerably quicker than in her previous Mitford series books. I was pleasantly surprised at the unexpected turn of events in the life of Father Tim in this book. It makes the reader realize that from time to time, a little rain falls in everyone's life, including the beloved Father Tim Kavanagh. Jan Karon has a wonderful ability of bringing all her characters to life for the reader. Keep up the great work Jan!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed all the Mitford Series, this one being no exception. It's refreshing to read a book where the characters genuinely apply Christian princples to their daily lives. I reviewed the first set for my book club and even served the famous orange marmalade cake! However, I find Karon's overuse of \\"trotting\\" and \\"thumping\\" distracting. Jan, why don't you trot down to the Happing Endings Bookstore, thump down $5.99 on the counter, and get thee a Roget's Thesaurus. I'll be counting the \\"trots\\" and \\"thumps\\" in the next one!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book to find out how my friends and indeed family members had fared since the last book. I am a great Karon fan and hope she will continue to write about these lovely and real folks with their flaws and endearing traits but only if she is really inspired to write another one. I think this one seemed like a stretch for her and there was a lot of &quot;fill&quot; between the pages. I felt like she was trying too hard to pull all the factions together and was laboring over the storyline. I didn't like the departure to Whitecap island in the first place and would have preferred her staying in Mitford, hence I had trouble recreating the Whitecap vignettes as I didn't really care as much about those characters and it's been quite awhile since I read the last book. Would have given this 3 stars but I just couldn't do that to such a wonderful storyteller whose books I love so well."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"In This Mountain finds Father Tim and Cynthia again living in Mitford, following their stint on Whitecap Island a few years ago.In the little town of Mitford, life hums along. Dooley looks toward his career as a vet. Joe Ivey and Fancy Skinner fight a haircut price war that takes no prisoners. Percy steps out on a limb with a risky new menu item at the Grill. Uncle Billy feels pressure to produce a surefire joke, and 'The Man in the Attic,' returns to Mitford as the town holds its breath to see what happens.Though Father Tim dislikes change, he dislikes retirement even more. His wife wins awards, receives bouquets, gets invited to tour the country. What's he doing? Father's health with his diabetes takes a turn for the very worse when he is neglectful taking his medicine. This bad spell leaves him in the throes of depression and sadness. To top it all off, Edith Mallory, who absolutely despises Father Tim, gives him more problems.Finally, he snaps out of his depression, and decides to take on a unique and difficult ministry. This makes him feel more energized than ever before.The book was a dandy one as all the preceding ones before it.

I can relate to lots of the things that Father Tim deals with. This book spoke directly to my heart. Retirement is not something that Pastors look forward to, at least not the ones I know. A good pastor / missionary / evangelist never retires from doing the Lord's work.But what caught me here was the fact that even Pastor's can struggle with some discouragment and depression. I have struggled for the last two years with some depression after being moved from one position to another. It has been difficult. Sometimes I wondered where God was.I like Father Timothy kept opening my Bible looking for the right verse that would speak to my heart. So, as I read this book I totally related.I would hope that as you read it you will come to understand that Pastors are just as human as everyone else. We deal with the same issues that laypeople deal with.God is there and is walking with us through every part of our lives. You just might not see him clearly right now. But hold on tight, He is there and He loves you and will help you find the other side of depression and bring you Joy in the morning.Thank you Jan for writing a truly heart felt book."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Like all the other Mitford Series I loved this one and looked forward to the next one!!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Still not up to the first books in her series, but still worth the read."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I was so sad to finish this book! What a delight: such an optimistic and hopeful view of life. I almost turned to the first page and started reading it over!Father Tim and Cynthia have moved back to Mitford after their stint on Whitecap. They are happy to be back, but Fr. Tim is dissatisfied with retired life. He doesn't know what to do with himself. He wrestles with his faith and with the direction his life is turning. Cynthia has received major accolades for her children's books. The Man In The Attic is back in Mitford, Dooley is lovesick, and the &quot;Turkey Club&quot; is meeting at The Grill as always.With a few surprises along the way and an ending that will leave you gasping, Jan Karon delivers the most notable Mitford story yet!

This one displays more insight and emotion into the characters, particularly Father Tim, as he deals with several tough issues. But there is still the same small town humor that we've all come to know and love in this series, and I again finished another Mitford book wishing I could visit this place and meet these eccentric, loveable, and strong characters.

Even if you haven't lived in a small town you'll be able to &quot;get into&quot; this book. There's so much there. It reminds me in many ways of McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD or even TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in its writing and well-drawn characters. This is a timely and moving tale, sure to please.Also recommended: McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"This is the book Jan Karon has made; let us be thankful and rejoice in it. An amazing addition to the Mitford series, one that left me gasping at one point and re-reading it almost as soon as I finished it. Once again Ms. Karon presents the reader with the gentle village life of Mitford and the lovable but occasionally cankterous Father Tim, and shows us a gentle side to some very difficult issues. Far from syrupy, the books in this series manage to tackle some really hard turns in the road without becoming a soap opera - more an approach to life through faith and kindness and devotion. For some people, this might be a difficult read but the message of thankfulness and hope will guide you through the darker parts. Life with Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, Puny, Emma, the Turkey Club, Harley, Hessie, Hope &amp; Helene - well ALL the favorite Mitford character, continues to challenge and enrich anyone opening the cover of this truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The seventh book in the popular Mitford Years series returns fans to peace, comfort and serenity despite obstacles. John McDonough, known to many as Captain Kangaroo on the Fox Family Channel's \\"The All New Captain Kangaroo,\\" turns in a measured and understanding reading, investing characters with authenticity.It has been over three years since the beloved cleric, Father Tim Kavanaugh, and his wife, Cynthia, have returned to Mitford. For Father Tim it is a time of introspection as his 70th birthday approaches. He, unfortunately, reaches some painful decisions about his career while Cynthia seemingly flourishes professionally.Favorite characters from past Mitford books abound: Dooley Barlowe finds romance and his life's work as a veterinarian; duck for cover as there's a haircut war between barber and hair stylist; and there's an updated menu over at the Main Street Grill.Karon hasn't lost her touch at creating characters we'd love to know.

Don't get me wrong, I really liked this book, but throughout I felt like we had been covering territory that we'd already journeyed through in the first books, particularly &quot;A Light in the Window.&quot;I felt that Ms. Karon got a little bogged down in all the introspection Father Tim went through in this book after his accident (which I won't give away for those who haven't read it yet). And I also thought the Edith Mallory character resurfacing yet again was a repeat of what had happened in previous books. I was really hoping to see the end of her, especially after Father Tim married Cynthia. Maybe it's just a part of the woman's character that she keeps trying to get Father Tim in compromising positions!However, I loved the &quot;Sammy&quot; angle in this story as well as how Ms. Karon further fleshed out Hope Winchester (a delightful character), Helene Pringle, and Hessie Mayhew. And I was happy to return to Mitford, albeit through some familiar territory as said before.I'm looking forward to the eighth book in the series, and am hoping some of the loose ends from this book will be tied up -- Dooley and Lace, Sammy and his mother, and the &quot;year in the country.&quot;Oh, and one more thing -- my question at the end of &quot;A New Song&quot; was never answered in this book. What was in the note Father Tim gave Helene Pringle at the end of that book?

Compared to her last book, a prequel about the couple's wedding that only took a couple of hours to read, this book is much more substantive and fun to read. Once again, Tim's fussy personality and Cynthia's practical sense make for a pleasurable read. It just goes to show you that it doesn't take blood and guts and cussing and sex to make a very good book."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The 7th book in the Mitford Series is a joyful read, and just what I had hoped for. Father Tim and Cynthia blossom as their years together move on. Their devotion to each other never wanes, even through the trials and tribulations that are about to test their beliefs to the core. Father Tim goes through some dark days, after an occurrence that shakes all of Mitford to the bone. As usual there are lessons to learn, for with every darkness comes a dawn, though it might be an unexpected one.All the regulars are back and gizzards are the Tuesday special at the grill, Percy is as cantankerous as ever, some things never change. Emma Newland is working on getting Father Tim into cyberspace, while he's still working on learning to use the microwave. Dooley is back and still searching for his brother Sammy, and George Gaynor \\"The Man in the Attic\\" returns.Jan Karon has created a wonderful place to come with every book of this series, and she doesn't disappoint in her latest edition of the town that everyone should spend time in. She has a wonderful way of allowing the reader to step right into the setting she has created so clearly in her minds eye. We all should spend a little time in Mitford.

She is a wonderfully human mixture of weaknesses, strengths, and believability. \\"In This Mountain\\" recounts, from Father Tim's perspective, her gentle and enduring faith in the midst of a dark and relentless crisis in her husband's life.

Sadly, this is not the case. I believe that the author is writing for those readers who are soooo glad to have a good old small town story with the right values, that she neglects character development and plotting. Even the dialogue, origanally charming, is of a sameness. I will not be finishing this book and that is very unusual for me."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"As usual, I loved Jan Karon's new book #7. I always feel so good after I've read her books. I feel so close to the characters and I know them and love them. I can hear them talking in their dialect; and to me, they are very real. I never want the series to end, but I don't want them to be written just to take advantage of their popularity. I am afraid the story will suffer if they come too quickly, but I can hardly wait."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I have so enjoyed the Mitford series. I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I would liked to have seen the more familiar characters developed. It seemed like the story centered mostly on Father Tim and his medical problem.

Very powerful ending that reinforces the honor of commitment and moves you to hopeful tears! Both authors seem to have an inspirational flair to their writing that is wholesome and uplifting. I always look forward to more from Jan Karon!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this novel--don't know if it has been so long since the last one or what, but I felt like this was very choppy, the way the story jumped from one passage to the next. I had a hard time reading it, and have so looked forward to another Mitford visit. The characters are all there, and the examination of Fr Tim's struggle with retirement, depression, health and most importantly, his faith was outstanding and very well done. It was just hard to jump from one thing to the next. Really these books are a good exposure to Christian faith and values, and really want to make you think about it all. I remember thinking there were to be 7 books total, but this leaves off making you think there will be one more book, as there is still a Barlowe brother to be found, and that appears to be the mission of Fr. Tim--reuniting the Barlowe children. All in all, this will not disappoint Mitford fans, just be forwarned that it did not seem to &quot;flow&quot; as the ones in the past."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Once I got into the book, which has a slow start as the main character is worrying about moles in his yard (yawn....), I enjoyed it. It's a quick read. Unfortunately, much of the action is predictable and corny, but it's also relaxing to read something that isn't, frankly, challenging. Think of this as an adult version of a children's bedtime story. Peaceful and sleepy. Nothing wrong with that. I won't hold it against the author that the photo of her on the back of the book, complete with too much jewelry, too much hair, and what looks like real fur trimming her clothing, makes her look like Edith Mallory, one of the book's antagonists. Somehow, I assumed the author would look more like the sweet Cynthia character (the minister's wife). All in all, this book is delightful, undemanding, and spiritually uplifting. As someone with a number of Jewish friends, I do wish the author would downplay the Christian rhetoric, though. One can be spiritual without pushing a particular religious agenda. (I gave a hospitalized Jewish friend a copy of this book before I had read it and before I realized it had Christian overtones.)"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The seventh book in the Mitford series is all about love and discovery...Father Tim and his wife, Cynthia have returned to Mitford and those of us who have read the first five books (the sixth was a novella and not worth discussing) are sighing and smiling in relief that they (and we) are home. The rhythm of the town is one we are familiar with. The characters are old friends (at least most of them). Their eccentricities and foibles have been missed and we desperately need to get caught up with what has been happening in Mitford since the Kavenaugh's spent three years on Whitecap Inland in North Carolina.For a man of strong intellect and true instincts, Father Tim can sometimes be his own worst enemy as he proves in the first part of the book. He is ignoring his diabetes by not exercising, eating the wrong things and &quot;forgetting&quot; to take his insulin shots or adjusting the dose himself. The result of such a course of action is both predictable and tragic. The depth of the tragedy is something he discovers as he recovers from his injuries and is told the harsh truth of what actually occurred.The story is then woven around Father Tim's recovery from the accident and the depression that followed; the search for Dooley's brother; the return of The Man in the Attic; the continuing saga of Uncle Billy and Rose and the comings and goings of all of the wonderful Mitford characters.This book is not fluff, however. There are many sermons, stories and words to live by scattered through the events related here. You will laugh, smile, shed a tear, and grind your teeth, but most of all and most importantly, you will care what happens. You will care deeply and when you at last close the last page you will also have grown from the experience. I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Jan Karon has cornered the market on 'gentle fiction' and with IN THIS MOUNTAIN, she has written the best book of her career.I am so glad Father Tim Kavanaugh and his beloved wife Cynthia are home again in Mitford.

I have had &quot;In This Mountain&quot; for quite some time and finally sat down to read it. I was spellbound, eagerly waiting to see what came next.Karon's stories are believable because they take one into the mind and soul of the characters. I just know that if I were to run into Father Tim and Cynthia on the street, I would recognize them instantly (Father Tim would probably be in need of a haircut!)The Christian mores are woven so intricately into the story that they do not &quot;hit you over the head.&quot; I have found life lessons in the books that I have put into my journal to refer to over and over again.I like the fact that Father Tim, even as a spiritual leader, wrestles with the very same emotions and spiritual issues as the rest of us and that he uses prayer to see him through.I am involved in a couple of Bible studies; these books are a wonderful complement, putting the principles into everyday situations.Can't wait for the next Mitford book! Thank you, Jan Karon!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"This latest installment in the Mitford series is a delight in every way. Father Tim and Cynthia have returned to Mitford and Tim is chafing under the inactivity of retirement, while Cynthia travels around the country promoting her newest children's book. Karon deals with the difficult topics of illness, death, and depression with a deft hand, mixing in just the right amount of hope and grace. All of the old favorite characters are here, along with some new ones, and readers will delight at the humanity and gentle humor which Karon injects in her book. She has a way of getting inside her characters' heads and is able to lovingly portray their frailties along with their faith."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Everyone who has submitted a review has done a great job commenting and summarizing the seventh book in this series. I tried myself to stretch it out so I wouldn't finish too quickly as I knew, I also would be sad to finish it. I would hope that more authors would spring up like Jan Karon and take the lead in writing good quality stories that do not have to have explicit sex scenes, swearing and uncomfortable inuendos or undertones that make someone question why paper was wasted on the book. A long sentence, but I believe a common thought of many readers. Thank you again, Jan Karon, for staying on the straight and narrow yet providing your readers with a very rich and pleasurable story. There is no time wasted, no guilt to be felt when picking up one of your books. Anyone would be truly blessed to read this story as well as the 6 books before."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Jan Karon has outdone herself in this novel. She has deftly and beautifully reminds us of grace and redemption in this fallen world: both of their existence and of our need for them. She writes about the realities of life, which can sometimes be painful, but Karon never for a moment lets us forget that God offers redemption for all who merely ask. This redemption not only secures us a place in heaven with God our Father, but it is how He works in our lives day by day, as He measures grace sufficient to meet the need. Father Tim struggles deeply in this novel, making us ache with him, and he learns that dealing once with painful issues (such as his relationship with his father)is seldom enough to banish them forever. He also learns how much his actions and lack of action can wound those he loves most. Having a father who was for many years a minister, I am amazed at how well Karon has captured this often lonely life. So often people fail to realize that ministers struggle sometimes and need ministers of their own, yet they are often isolated and not generally by choice. Thank you, Jan Karon, for writing about the world as it really is and for writing about God as He truly is. And, yes, &quot;in everything give thanks . . . for this is the will of God.&quot; Thank you, God, for Jan Karon and for the reality of Christ's redemption."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I was the first to read Jan Karon's 7th book when it arrived at our local library branch. I devoured it over the week-end, turned it in on Monday morning, then went immediately to buy it so I could enjoy it again slowly. Now I'm ready to begin with At Home In Mitford and re-read the whole series. I've begun to include Father Tim, Cynthia, Uncle Billy, and all the other wonderful characters in my conversations like they're real people. Jan Karon, through the voices of her characters, has preached some of the best sermon material ever. She must be a wonderful person to have such wisdom, insight, and inspiration. No fictional work has ever made a greater impression on me. I also have every audio version, and John McDonough is the best!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Once again it was interesting to follow Father Tim's struggles, Cynthia's successes and Dooley's progress. I enjoy the searches for Dooley's siblings and the stories of what happens when they are found. The other characters make for a great read too. I was especially glad to see George Gaynor reappear. I had hoped he would become part of the series again. Overall it is another well written book. My only problem with it is the Edith Mallory plot. The tricking Father Tim and locking him in a room seemed too odd. Edith was an interesting villain in the earlier books but this time she was just too strange."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I love all the Mitford books. I love the characters, the town and even Barnabas. But for some reason, the whole tone of the book seemed sad. With Father Tim having his diabetic blackout and the repercussions that followed were unlike the other books. I always found them uplifting so I am wondering if the next Mitford tale will be within the same vein. Is this the prelude of Father Tim's more grim illness or just an instance of showing us that life is never perfect, even in Mitford? We will have to see."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Karon is definitely nearing her best again with this latest installment in the life of Father Tim. Well worth reading, and as always I come away from her better works refreshed in mind and in spirit.However! I take it Ms. Karon has an editor, and while I know that one of the most thankless tasks on earth must be the editing of a highly successful author...if Ms. Karon uses as verbs the words \\"crow\\" or \\"relish\\" ONE MORE TIME I will personally drown her in a vat of wisteria eau de toilette!The two largest criticisms of her work in general, and I think we can safely say in this book in particular, are Karon's propensity to be precious...suffocatingly precious...and her use of the good Lord to solve all the problems that prove a bit too taxing for her storytelling skills.In this novel, Father Tim suffers not only a crisis of the soul, but clinical depression. While Karon describes the disease very well indeed, she hands off the cure to a convenient religious revelation, which sells short the real life experience of this condition. It strikes me as vastly unwise to suggest that God will send a cure in the absence of prescribed medication (Father Tim ditches his for no good reason) or skilled therapy (Father Tim gets none...a rather damning omission on Dr. Hoppy's part, I thought).The book could also have benefited enormously from another 50 pages or so, delving into the minds of those around Father Tim. Dooley goes through some major stuff off screen, as does the Bishop, Cynthia...jeepers, everybody.The stuff here is good, and don't miss the wonderful diatribe against those who spurn cake-eating, but Ms. Karon needs to pull out the stops and give these books the much better shot I am sure she is capable of."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"It was wonderful to pick up on the life of Father Tim and Cynthia once again. This is another one of her books which I was unable to put down. I will truly hate to see the series end. The characters are still like family. You feel the joys and fears along with everyone else. Also, purchased Esther's Gift and the Mitford Snowmen for my friends for Christmas. They are a delight."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I am glad - truly I am -- that devout Christians and those who yearn for rural utopia have found a champion in Jan Karon. Lord knows, we need wholesome, uplifting stories. Ms. Karon can be a good storyteller indeed, but her publisher has done her no favors by releasing her work without benefit of a good editor. There can be no other explanation for her maddening over-repetition of signature phrases (\\"meaning it,\\" \\"into the bargain,\\" \\"chinwag,\\" \\"the prayer that never fails\\"). As another reader noted, Ms. Karon desperately needs a thesaurus.I enjoyed the first few Mitford books. Only pure stubbornness, alas, compelled me to finish In This Mountain. I am an ordained clergywoman, well acquainted with the power of prayer and comfortable with the language of faith. Still, the simplistic, saccharine faith of Fr. Tim and the Mitford gang - chock-full of spontaneous prayer but sadly lacking in moral courage -- sets even my teeth on edge. I recognize bits and pieces of Fr. Tim in many of my colleagues but the whole package of him is simply not to be believed. One wonders whether Ms. Karon has had, somewhere in her past, a girlish crush on a clergyman and has spun out her fantasies in this idealized portrait of what she imagines a priest should be, casting herself in the supporting role of Cynthia Coppersmith. Thankfully, this Stepford Priest exists only in Ms. Karon's imagination. And thankfully, this literary ordeal will be over soon, with the release of the last book in November."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I have read all the series books up to this one. There was just enough plot variation to keep me going in this time. But I must admit the series is wearing thin on me.But even more wearing is the author's need for an editor. I believe that it's difficult for authors to see their own bad habits. That's why there are editors. And I think Penguin/Viking Books has failed Karon in this area. Karon has a habit of repeatedly using little turns of phrase that were maybe cute once or twice, but after dozens of uses they are just annoying.In a couple of the previous books, the phrase that really stood out to me was \\"..., meaning it.\\" For example, on p.373 of this book, \\"'I'm sorry,' [Father Tim] said, meaning it.\\" Sincerity is a valued characteristic in these books and in life. But there must be various ways of describing it. When that phrase keeps turning up, I am no longer struck by the character's feelings, but by my own annoyance.In this book the description that came up so often I gritted my teeth every time I saw it was: \`thumped down.' I didn't count, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was used as many fifty times. People \`thumped down' on chairs, benches, sofas etc so many times I was wondering if anyone had a sore butt.I like Karon's community that she dreamed up. I loved her first book. Series fans will no doubt be offended by my opinion, but I think she needs to take a break for her own creativity's sake."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I very much enjoyed the first few books in this series, but it seems that the author had written herself out, alas, and had nothing much more worthwhile to say. This seventh offering in the lot is just not worth reading, when there are so many other books out there waiting.For one thing, the author waxes more and more religious with each book. In this volume people are throwing prayers at each other on virtually every page, over the smallest of trifles. It gets a little annoying after a time, annoying and ludicrous. For example, when the bishop has chest pains, his secretary calls Father Tim and asks him to pray for the bishop. The call might have been spent to greater good in finding a competent cardiologist first. Jesus himself admonished his disciples to pray in private without fanfare or show, for those who pray loudest in public \\"have their reward.\\" At various times Tim does remind himself to pray the prayer that always is answered: Thy will be done. Asking God to change his laws or abrogate the laws of nature feels wrong to me. Prayer and dogma get in the way of the story and weaken this novel to a great extent. That the prayers are answered in fiction is a matter of the writer stacking the cards that way.Secondly, while I'm sure some readers are much taken with Dooley, I've found him unpleasant and occasionally obnoxious (for lack of better words) since book one. He is no better in book seven. Why Father Tim takes such pleasure from seeing him is beyond me. Dooley is self-centered and thoughtless.My advice to a reader who has not read any of this series would be to stop after book four. There is nothing after that worth one's time."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I feel Jan's books get better with each one.

However, In This Mountain, was a real disappointment in Jan Karon's otherwise delightful series.The storyline was disappointing, the characters weren't as interesting, and Father Tim's depression was way too drawn out. The lengthy religious aspects of the book made it feel as if I was reading a theology book instead of a book for pleasure. I will stick with the seies in the hopes that the next book will move back to Jan Karon's usual excellent work."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Like those cream-filled cupcakes, the Mitford books are addictive, although bad for you and not even tasty. The first few had a certain charm. The author, however, has long since revealed the full extent of her abilities, wit, and imagination. If you want to read a series of books about a loveable cleric, read Trollope's Barchestershire novels."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Although the return to Mitford is welcome and the subject matter is timely, this book is very choppy and repetitious. If you are not a very religious Christian you may find the constant scripture quotation (more than her previous books) distracting.

Wonderful easy reading."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"While Jan Karon's characters are still quirky and interesting enough to get you through the book, this is definitely the worst book of the series thus far. First of all, she definitely needs a better editor to catch her favorite expressions. I was so sick of hearing people \\"thump down\\" into chairs that by the end of the book, I thought their rear ends must hurt! She also has an annoying habit of using the phrase \\"meaning it\\" to describe how intense her characters said something. This is not Karon's fault; it's her editor's responsibility to catch these things. It's difficult for an author to notice these things when they reread their manuscripts because the whole thing, including every rewrite, is in their head.Secondly, there was just not enough action or plot in this book to keep me very interested. While it's true that most of the books in this series are more character driven than plot driven, most of them have enough plot twists to keep you from noticing. This time, I noticed. Maybe it's time to end the series. While I would like to know if Dooley ever finds all of his siblings or if he learns of his inheritance from Miss Sadie, I'm tiring of Mitford. The characters seem to be losing some of their charm - and in a character driven series, that is not a good thing."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I shop only for unabridged books on CD.

I strongly recommend this book to family and friends, because of the lightheartedness and touching moments presented alongside the realities of day-to-day living. Set in a small town in the foothills of western North Carolina, the residents of Mitford are guided through their daily lives by Father Tim Kavanagh and his wife, Cynthia. This book, in my opinion, is the best in the Mitford series written by Ms. Karon. Her books bring Christian values and spirituality back to the forefront of adult literature, where they are greatly appreciated in this world today. I enjoy Jan Karon's books because of the homespun small-town characters, the comical and serious situations that can pop up unexpectedly, and the ability of the characters to persevere through their trials. For your best summer read at the beach or in the mountains, please take In This Mountain with you. Read it and enjoy what life and God have to offer in a small town!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I know that many readers are going to disagree with this review, but I felt I had to say that IN THIS MOUNTAIN by Jan Karon is not her best work. While reading this novel, I felt, over and over again, that Karon came \\"back to Mitford\\" because her readers demanded it, not because she was full of inspiration to continue the storyline. I closed the book the other night feeling as if I were reading a religious/inspirational piece. Will librarians place it on those shelves? They should. There is no fire in the relationship between Cynthia & Father Tim, that I could see, but I was delighted as everyone else to see what has happened to Dooley and the rest of Mitford since the last time we visited. I know, in order to write these particular books, and have overcome such stupendous odds in life, Jan Karon has to be one of the nicest people the world has ever produced, but I'm sad that this book is ho-hum. Will I buy another in this series, if there ever is one? OH, YES. I can't lose my old friends."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"It is always easy to love the townfolk of Mitford and desire to live in a place as simplistic and care-free as Mitford. After six novels in the series, though, one would think they would know what to expect from Jan Karon's always loveable Father Tim. Yet, inside In This Mountain, Karon manages to skillfully evolve the character of Father Tim, the faithful shepherd who cheerfully attends to every need of his flock and town. In a turn of events, Father Tim finds himself in a situation where he is ministered to by the town folk who show him deepest sympathy, gracious forgiveness and abundant encouragement. This book restores one's faith in the ability of a person to overcome life's most difficult trials. The text is refreshing in it's language (anyone can read it because there are no foul words) and is wonderfully written. The ending will not disappoint the reader. My advice to you is: read In This Mountain slowly (and try to wait patiently for Jan's next offering!)"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Simply put, Jan Karon puts a smile in your heart.

There's Cynthia and Barnabas and Dooley and diabetes and Lord's Chapel and Edith and Uncle Billy, et al.She takes life's day to day grind and makes it wholesome, entertaining and delightful.

That's how I have felt about each Mitford book that I have read. Father Tim is like all of us, so human and goes about his life not really realizing how important he is to the people in his life. He sees only his frailities, not all he does and how much he means to his family and friends.I love the way his heart sings when he is around Dooley and although he isn't his birth father, he has been there for the boy through the good and the bad. Father Tim tries over and over again to place life's activities in God's hands, but like usall takes control when he really needs to let go."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I am rating this book on my likes and dislikes; not on the way the book was written. I feel odd rating this book no more than a 2 with all the 4s and 5s it has received. But, I did not enjoy reading the book. The story seemed to drag on and on going nowhere. I could predict every move that was made in the story. There were no surprises. I guess it just wasn't my type of reading. Others seemed to have loved it."},{"Title":"Masters of Country Blues Guitar","review":"I've had this book for three years or so. Lately, I've switched from playing mostly acoustic fingerstyle to electric blues, but I still like to get out the acoustic and this book from time to time. It has a bunch of Hurt's best songs, and the skill range is from fairly easy to quite difficult.Keep in mind that you won't find complete tabs for all of the songs. Sometimes, you get just the 12-bar pattern for the song. Learning the breaks and extras will be up to you. But if you're a fingerstyle player with at least a little experience under your belt, Hurt's songs are a great way to build up your chops.Not to mention that the book includes two CD's full of Hurt performing his music. If you like his music, then the purchase price is a good deal just for the CDs! The book also has an essay by the author who found Hurt living in poverty and obscurity, and brought him to New York for the early 60s folk-blues revival. And there are some great pictures in the book.Please keep in mind that if you're a raw beginner at fingerstyle guitar when you get this book (as I was), even the easiest of the songs will seem impossibly difficult at first. The book simply contains tab. It has zero information on how to play the songs; just the tabs. If you're a raw beginner, and you're determined to learn to play Hurt's music, I suggest getting the book, and bringing it to a good teacher. That's what I should have done!"},{"Title":"Masters of Country Blues Guitar","review":"I was interested in learning the guitar style of Mississippi John Hurt after checking out one of his CDs (Satisfied Blues)from the library. The CD did not come out of my CD player for over a month, and I felt driven to learn his style. This book was extremely useful in helping me learn this style. I have had the book about 4 months and can play about half the songs. The learning process involves following the tab and listening to the CDs over and over. The first song I attempted to learn (Spikedriver's Blues)took some time and a lot of patience. You have to learn to play the alternating base while putting in the melody lines. Now that I have practiced his style for four months, many of the other songs are coming much easier. The book includes the lyrics, so that after learning the song, one can practice singing over the guitar. I have been playing guitar 17 years, and haven't found a particular style that sucked me in so much. The CDs that accompany the book are excellent as well, and include some songs which I haven't found on many of his popular recordings. The songs are excellent. I actually practice more guitar each day, because of this style and this book. I bought an instructional DVD for Mississippi John Hurt as well, but use this book far more often."},{"Title":"Masters of Country Blues Guitar","review":"When a guitar player hears Mississippi John Hurt's playing athey are generally struck by the simple beauty of it. To master the Hurt style is quite complex, but this book with its combined CD's (which feature MJH himself!) offer a good roadmap for unlocking the style of this master. Definitely not for the beginner, but one great feature is the way the tablature is presented. It is large and easy to read. To me, this makes a world of difference when attempting to learn a new piece using tablature."},{"Title":"Masters of Country Blues Guitar","review":"this is a great cd/book combination to learn some wonderful blues tunes. the book is well written and the tablature is very easy to follow. the music isn't easy to play, but it's very well written and anyone who puts their mind to it will be playing some of john hurt's great tunes. the best part of the combination is the cd's. two cd's covering each tune in the book and all done by john hurt himself. it's a great way to learn or just listen. highly recommended."},{"Title":"Masters of Country Blues Guitar","review":"Although I've been playing guitar for years, this book is a real challenge for me. I'm determined to work it from the first song and not move on until I've mastered each piece. I've had it for a couple of months and I'm on song number three. The other 5 star reviews speak accurately about the significance of the music and the transcriptions and CD are a good value. If you are learning finger style blues or just need the tab to play it, then you should buy this book."},{"Title":"Sleds on Boston Common: a Story From the American Revolution","review":"I read this book to my grandchildren before we visited the Boston Commons. It peaked their interest in visiting this historical spot and created lots of good dialog between us. Since then, I have used it in my classroom when we study the Revolutionary War. Then I show a picture of me standing in the Commons with my grandchildren. This makes history seem more real to them. I recommend this book for home and educational purposes.Nola Wilkinson"},{"Title":"Sleds on Boston Common: a Story From the American Revolution","review":"Sleds on Boston Common makes history come alive by focusing on a fictional group of children who want to go sledding during the tension-filled days just before the start of the American Revolution. The story moves beyond the normal heroism of the patriots and the perfidy of the British to put a warm human face on everyone. Reading this story can be the precursor to a wonderful visit to the Boston Common to locate where the best sled runs might be. It can also help ignite an interest in American history.Henry Price lives in Boston, where his father runs a small toy and map shop. Because of rebellious activities, the port of Boston was closed by the king on June 1, 1774. This hurt commerce and everyone was suffering economically. Despite this, Henry's father had made Henry a new sled for his birthday which fell on December 22, 1774. During the two hour break from school at lunchtime, Henry and his siblings head for the Boston Common with the new sled. They are discouraged to find that thousands of troops are setting up camp there, and the troops block all the best sled runs!What to do? When Henry sees General Thomas Gage, the British Governer of Massachusetts Colony, Henry decides to speak to him. But first, he and his brothers and sister count the troops, horses, and anything else that the patriots want to know.General Gage turns to Henry and says, &quot;Let this boy have his words.&quot;After listening to Henry, General Gage says, &quot;I'm a father as well as a soldier for my king . . . .&quot; &quot; . . . I know my own children would like to sled this hill if there were here.&quot; &quot;He shook my hand, man to man.&quot; &quot;My eldest son is named Henry.&quot;In this fictional story, General Gage tells his troops to allow the children to sled, to clear a good run, and to keep the ice in one pond undisturbed for skating.The children were able to return again and again. &quot;Because General Gage was a man of his word.&quot;The war started in April 1975, and General Gage was ordered to return to England in October 1975.The illustrations in the book build from splashes of watercolors with inked outlines and details. The images are done in kaleidoscopic form that suggests movement by the figures.The author also provides an end note that describes more about the events described here, in order to help create that bridge into interest in American history.The book is also done in blank verse, which gives the style an elegance and crispness that make it a pleasure to read.I suggest that you also read the poem, The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, to your child as a follow-on. If the interest continues to build in your family, there are many fine fictional stories about the early days of the American Revolution that you can also read to and with your child.You should also use this book to reinforce the point that even those who oppose you are usually well-meaning.Have a good run!"},{"Title":"Sleds on Boston Common: a Story From the American Revolution","review":"This is a fictionalized account of an event that (maybe) actually happened. The story has been told often enough - I heard it long before this book was published - about a group of children who sent a delegation to the British General encamped on their sledding hill, asking him politely to move so they could still sled there, but all the details in this book are made up to fill the sketchy story that's been passed down.The pictures are simple and engaging, the story is inspiring, and it involves sledding... as well as the lesson that the people you dislike and fear, who are your enemies, still are people inside."},{"Title":"Mary Ann Omnibus (1) (v. 1)","review":"The first novel is so/so.. Such a young heroine takes some getting used to. She is only eight in the first three novels. Thirteen in the fourth. I found the second and third novels highly entertaining and fourth was great. Once you get use to an eight year old main character, the going is pretty good. Mary Ann deals with friends, enemies, street fights, overstrict nuns, gets her dad a job, tries to keep him from the bottle, wishes her granny dead most of the time (and one really can't blame her!), and in between bouts of \\"misbehaving\\" confesses her sins to her beloved Father Owen. If you can get your hands on this rare book, it is worth it. Much laughs."},{"Title":"The Music of Santeraia: Traditional Rhythms of the Bataa Drums [With CD] (Performance in World Music Series)","review":"This book is great!!!! This book provides the only transcription of sacred rhythms of Santeria I have been able to find. The transcriptions are accurate. The authors are also very respectful of the religious nature of the music. This book is useful for both musicians and non-musicians."},{"Title":"The Music of Santeraia: Traditional Rhythms of the Bataa Drums [With CD] (Performance in World Music Series)","review":"The book did what I was looking for to do in regard to the bata drumming styles and rhythms. This is the real timimg of the Yoruba-Nigerian and Cuban expressions of the bata drums. I hope it would had the same effect on you as it did to me. Even if you are not a musician or just love community drumming the bata rhythms are the original trive toques(Spanish)of the Afro-Caribean Cuban Santeros and the Latinos Musicians that used them in Salsa Music of today."},{"Title":"The Music of Santeraia: Traditional Rhythms of the Bataa Drums [With CD] (Performance in World Music Series)","review":"This is a great book for learning about the music of santeria, but it has some short comings as far as TEACHING how to play the bata drums. This book covers historical background, musical structure and provides notations for many traditional bata songs. I would not consider it to be an instructional book.My book came with a CD, which is perhaps the best recording I have been able to find of traditional bata drumming (most discs have vocals with the drumming that make it difficult to specifically concentrate on the drums). This disc consists of recordings of specific songs being performed on bata drums.I wish that the CD would have broken up the parts for the indivdual drums to make that easier to hear. I would also have liked to have some instructional demonstrations on the disc to hear various techniques of playing the bata drums. The text is also weak on instructional techniques for the drums with only 9 photographs and 1 page of text dedicated to teaching technique. There is no discussion or demonstration for the use of bata drums with contemporary music. I realize that this is not the intention of this book, and apparently teaching technique is not either. (I sure would like to find a book dealing with these issues!)"},{"Title":"The Music of Santeraia: Traditional Rhythms of the Bataa Drums [With CD] (Performance in World Music Series)","review":"Having been a student of Amira's, and having travelled to Cuba several times, I know a little about what this book means for people who study Afro-Cuban sacred rhythms. Cornelius is also a drummer and ethnomusicologist.This book is accurate, interesting, and extremely informative. But it is a shame that Amazon doesn't carry the CD that goes with this book--it is a clearly laid out study of the most important rhythms. I have known some drummers who grew up playing in Havana to get excited when they heard this recording, and ask to play specific sections over again to study them in detail.This book is satisfying to all levels--from the beginner who wants to start learning a little about the rhythms, to the advanced scholar who is ready to dive into the details. The authors are completely trustworthy sources of information and this is a work of devotion and years of study."},{"Title":"The Music of Santeraia: Traditional Rhythms of the Bataa Drums [With CD] (Performance in World Music Series)","review":"THis was supposed to come with a CD and it did not come with one. Please send it ! The whole idea of this product is to have the audio reference."},{"Title":"The Music of Santeraia: Traditional Rhythms of the Bataa Drums [With CD] (Performance in World Music Series)","review":"I agree with everyone who loves this book, which combines the historical scholarship of Fernando Ortiz with careful transcriptions of New York-based bata drummers, including Jesus Perez, Julio Collazo, and Puntilla.This book is all rhythms, marvelous if you are a drummer or other musician, do not get this if you are looking for a history of santeria.This book DOES include the CD, which is indispensable for learning the rhythms. There is only one ISBN for the BOOK/CD set, which is 0-941677-70-2. If your copy doesn't contain the CD, return it for one that does, and do NOT buy the CD from dealers who try to sell it separately for as much as $200 on Amazon marketplace and elsewhere.Happy drumming!"},{"Title":"Apt. 3","review":"I first read this book to my daughter when she was 4-years-old. The New York tenement setting was such a foreign world in contrast to her suburban Dallas upbringing that she was immediately enthralled with the fact that so many families of diverse ethnic backgrounds would all live in one building. Keats paints such a vivid word picture that a child as young as she could easily be drawn into the story line. The characters and events became real to her, to the extent that she could literally hear the harmonica playing. My daughter begged to revisit this story and consequently every trip to the library for the next year included Apartment 3. To this day, at age 29 and expecting her first child, she still recalls this book and wants a copy of her own."},{"Title":"Apt. 3","review":"I purchased this book as a donation to a book collection drive for young children. Along with their engaging story lines, one of the things that I love about the Ezra Jack Keats books is the artwork. That is probably what attracts most people to the books. The vivid, beautiful colors and stylish designs always catch the eye of both children and adults. Then, they fall in love with the charming stories of children's adventures in life. Apt. 3 does not disappoint. I definitely appreciate the fact that the main characters are black children because it is not easy to find storybooks that include them or feature them prominently and positively."},{"Title":"Apt. 3","review":"This book is a wonderful read aloud to share with any grade in school as it can be adapted to suit different age groups & their comprehension abilities.

I discovered that eating healthy vegetables and fruits could be very easy. We both are in the process of lowering our cholesterol, sugar, sodium and fat in our daily diet.Having used this book for the last two months, I have yet to find a recipe that I do not enjoy. I used 3 recipes at Christmas dinner and they were hits at the dinner table including the vegetable spring rolls. The 2 guacamole recipes in the book are delicious - I would never have added basil to my guacamole before this book.We are having success in lowering our cholesterol levels and I hope soon that my doctor can order me off my medications."},{"Title":"Heart Power Recipes","review":"I was pleasantly surprised after opening this cookbook. It is full of excellent vegetable/vegetarian recipes that are low fat and easy to make and unique in that they are good for the heart. I found the spinach, arugula and garlic burritos with homemade salsa one of the most fantastic dinners that I have made using just vegetable ingredients. Try the pea soup as well - since I have had the book I have made it at least twice a week - it's so easy and so tasty! The first chapter explaining the heart power foods is a real draw as it highlights twenty vegetables/fruits that are good for my heart and explained how I am able to incorporate them into my daily diet. Most of the foods used seem to be in line with a Mediterranean diet and in my opinion that is great for my heart."},{"Title":"Heart Power Recipes","review":"I have recently gotten heavy into a yoga practice and am trying to improve my health overall.

The Spring Rolls too have become a staple. These recipes make you feel you are not giving up anything when you eat vegetarian!

DARK DESIGNS is the first supplement printed for Cthulhu by Gaslight and contains 3 long scenarios. Obviously, if you are playing Gaslight, you will want this collection. The scenarios have the feel of an age that has passed, so I am not sure that they would update well to the 1920s even (which is more technological and global but values rural traditions less).\\"Eyes For the Blind\\" - a group of conspirators is trying to call up a being that is supposedly a traditional defender of England. This being has strong ties to the rural and pagan settlers of England before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. The investigators do a fair bit of traveling around southern England to follow the trail left by the conspirators. Little does the party know that there are TWO beings, and that they don't wish to be awakened. This scenario includes a nice pullout map of southern Britain.\\"The Menace from Sumatra\\" - Normal, sane people go on scientific expedition. Crazy, cultist people return, with biological menace to society. The prime cultist isn't completely evil, and he does genuinely care for some. It's just that he does experiments involving growing a blue fungus on people that turns them into goo. He also does this to people who get in his way. And people he comes into contact with. Hell, it eventually happens to just about everyone. He does have a cure, though, and it is up to the investigators to get it out of him.\\"Lord of the Dance\\" - it begins with a hackneyed introduction, that is, a friend or relative has had a terrible experience and now you have to investigate. In this case, her artist lover has disappeared and she has been driven mad. So of course, the investigators do what they do best. Along the way they encounter living wax, a portal across England, a wizard's house that is a dimensional anomaly, a pagan ceremony, and a hideous being using the artist's body as a host. Everybody in this scenario needs a double-barreled retirement plan. This has a sort of globetrotting feel to it, although the action is confined to England, and there is plenty of sleuthing to do.These scenarios are all pretty decent; I think they would shine even more when set with THE GOLDEN DAWN from Pagan Publishing - the scenarios are similar in tone and would mesh well. There are some cliched elements in DARK DESIGNS, but it was published in 1991 when the RPG space was still being fleshed out. There are rules in the back for Victorian investigators and some nice tear-out handouts. There are some detailed maps as well."},{"Title":"Usborne Sparkly Touchy-feely Mermaids","review":"I have a few touchy feely books for my 10 month old, and this is one of the best. It's made of really thick cardboard pages and is almost indestructible. The illustrations are wonderfully colorful and interesting. Each page has multiple touch and feel spots, though some of the textures are similar (how many different types of scales can you find for mermaid tails) but they are all different colors and my son still enjoys touching them. The story is a little more involved than most touch and feel books, so I think he will enjoy this book for a long time. This is really a beautiful book and worth the cost.*** Another really good touchy feely book is \\"Dinosaurs\\", also by Fiona Wells."},{"Title":"Usborne Sparkly Touchy-feely Mermaids","review":"We love the \\"That's Not My -----\\" series board books from Usborne. Our daughter loved turning the pages and touching all the different textures since she was 6 months old. Eventually she got bored with them so we ordered the Touchy-Feely Mermaids book when she was about 11-12 months.Its definitely very colorful and busy. So much that she seemed overwhelmed as compared to the simpler Usborne books and didn't like it much. She is a bit older so she has some interest in it now. In our experience it didn't seem to be a fun a book for older infant/early toddlers since there is too much to see/read and less to grab/feel. There are sparkly sections but they are smaller.I'd recommend this for older children. The book doesn't have a recommended age but I think older girls (and boys) would enjoy the story of how mermaids live and the colorful underwater scenes."},{"Title":"Usborne Sparkly Touchy-feely Mermaids","review":"I love all USBorne with the touch/feel aspect. They're extremely durable where as every other touch/feel type book I've purchased has been torn within a day or two by one of my two children. I do not know if it's just my particular children but they have not been as engrossed by this as the trucks or the farm USBorne. I didn't drop the star rating from 5 because it could definitely be a preference, but if you're wondering which to buy, I would opt for the truck or farm since those have held the interest of both my children for the longest time and this one as well as the dinosaur one is only a passing interest on a rare occasion."},{"Title":"Usborne Sparkly Touchy-feely Mermaids","review":"This series is hard to find but I don't know why.

It is good for her to read of the biblical principles that are taught and to read of the struggles other girls go through in trying to live a righteous life.

The best part of the book is when she looked down from up on a hill and chose the place she wanted to put her house.

Campbell explores the question if there can ever be a missile defense system that would truly defend the U.S.? Or would the threat then turn into one even harder to defend against? His technical expertise is again on display as he is able to explain complex technology in understandable terms. He also has included a couple of very good naval combat scenes. I recommend you read all his books including this one."},{"Title":"Vauclain's Shield","review":"All and all a interesting story that keeps your interest.

I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Vauclain's Shield","review":"JOHN T. CAMPBELL is an exceptional Action Adventure Author. Has all the best in his books. Submarines, Aircraft, Military, CIA., warfare and enemies of the U.S. You're in the Subs, on the aircraft and warships. Fighting to survive in battle. Characters are easy to identify with. The action starts from page one. Your Instantly drawn into the plots.There are several players that interact throughout his books. Each chapter takes you to actions of the different players . In other words . Never boringOne of the stronger parts of Mr.Campbell's books is the depth and the completion . All questions are answered and the Epilogue completes the books. I really enjoy the fact his books don't take the quick and easy ending. He goes way beyond a lot of Authors whose books lack depth and end quickly with little reward for the readers. Just when you think the books are about to end he throws another aspect into the mix.I've read them all. Highly recommend his book to others."},{"Title":"Vauclain's Shield","review":"John T. Campbell did it again, he continues to provide excitement and special unique twists in his writing. He makes it an easy read for the non-technical reader providing a clear picture with his 30 years of knowledge in the Aerospace Industry. I highly recommend reading his Illustrated Guide to the Desert War weapons used in the new conflict with Iraq as well as all of his other books, Raid on Truman, Sub Zero, and Cobra Dane. I feel Vauclain's Shield should be required reading by our service men especially at the Pentagon and those working for the Department of Defense. It is a great suspense thriller with a wonderful surprise."},{"Title":"I Am Woman: Walking in God's Divine Purpose","review":"I Am Woman is an autobiography of the life of a lady who has realized that God is central to her entire being. This book is a moving tribute to the power of God in our lives when we want Him present and most especially when we aren't interested in His presence. I envision that the author and myself are around the same age as some of the history recorded is first hand knowledge to me so I related especially well to this book. The life of a teenager in the 80's; the college experience; the boyfriend drama, was all so real to me. Her spiritual beam in constant flux was reminiscent of my life around the same time, which made reading this book a page-turner to me. I think the best way to connect with this book is on a personal level, let it minister to your heart. I am always touched as a reviewer; at the level of openness authors decide to contribute with their readers. It is always interesting to me to see how sharing one's life experiences can have a lasting impact on others coupled with the tremendous courage that it takes to share such. I felt this book to be very genuine and can minister to women who are experiencing many of life's bumps and bruises. I was encouraged with the scriptures that were used in this book. Many of these scriptures I've read over the years, but never in quite the same context as the author used. I liked to see the fresh prospective brought about by this book- a sermon in print. Men always seem to want to know what makes women tick, and so I would suggest that this book not only inspire women but men as well. The lessons learned and the verses of scripture quoted and the message shared are universal. Ms. Givens thanks for sharing a part of yourself as inspiration to others. I Am Woman is quiet wisdom, the kind that makes reflect inward without being overbearing. A wonderful job."},{"Title":"I Am Woman: Walking in God's Divine Purpose","review":"I AM WOMAN is a wonderful testimony of Given's personal quest to know God's purpose for her life. In relating her tale, Given's imparts to her readers very touching, very real life stories. She provides rich scripture lessons to reinforce her narration. It continually evidences the power of God's redemptive power and unconditional love. I AM WOMAN is a resounding affirmation for women of all ages in their walk with God.I AM WOMAN provides many life stories to which most females could relate. One particular story regarding a relationship issue told of how Given's was ready to turn her life completely around to convenience the man of the moment. Through her own will, she made many rash decisions. However, as she allowed the will of God to control her life, she came into the realization that this man was not for her. She offers the prayer of repenting and turning away from being in control of her life and realizing God has a perfect plan for her.I AM WOMAN is laced with many prayers and scripture references to continually reinforce Given's personal testimonies and imparts to the reader a very valuable scripture-based lessons. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in strengthening her relationship with God!Reviewed by Nedineof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Vasarely (Plastic arts of the 20th century)","review":"was missing the soft black cover of the book, i which you had inform me on that, but never mind! general its ok!"},{"Title":"A History of Playing Cards and A Bibliography of Cards and Gaming","review":"First, an important note: There seems to be 2 versions of this book floating around. One with 16 color plates and one that is all B&amp;W. I learned this when I received mine and found that it was all B&amp;W. Be sure you know which you are getting.Also, many of the b&amp;w images appear to be poor photocopies, either far too light or too dark.This book is no doubt the authority. It is very well researched. But the way it is organized is rather dull. Each chapter basically lists and briefly discusses all the cards that were found from that particular country. It might have been more interesting if there was more discussion of how the different suites evolved or how the countries influenced each other."},{"Title":"A History of Playing Cards and A Bibliography of Cards and Gaming","review":"This book is a well-researched, thorough and informative guide to the history of playing cards. I was especially interested in the medieval information, but found the entire work clear and easy to follow, while keeping up high standards of academic quality. I would recommend this work to anyone seriously interested in the history of the field. The Plates were also very helpful in illustrating the development and styles of cards through the centuries."},{"Title":"A History of Playing Cards and A Bibliography of Cards and Gaming","review":"I'd been looking around for a fairly comprehensive work on Playng Card history, and found this a pretty good choice.

It covers the history and developement of playing cards from their earliest beginnings to about 1930 when the book was first published.

I just can't read enough about Goldy and her antics from her culinary prowess to her analytical nosiness. I have read all of Diane Mott Davidson's books including her new one \\"Crunch Time\\". If you like mystery with entertainment on the side, you will enjoy this author and most assuradly the characters in her books. I tell everyone about the books and have made comments that it would make a great primetime TV show. The inclusion of Goldy's culinary talent and recipes adds just the right spice to keep the reader coming back for more. I have tried some of the recipes and enjoyed the results. Keep Goldy in business Diane!!"},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Diane Mott Davidson's adventures of Goldy the caterer are enjoyable to read and mouth watering at the same time. Reading them in the order written helps keep the continuity going as you follow Goldy's antics and misfortunes and her struggles to raise her son, Arch, and keep the anger of her ex-husband at bay. I'll be sad when I'm done reading the last book."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"By book five, readers come to expect certain things within a series. In the case of the Goldy Culinary Mysteries, we expect both delicious sounding recipes, one of Goldy's loved ones to be suspected of murdering a fairly new character and Goldy getting involved way beyond what's considered acceptable and yet still managing to help solve the murder (thus clearing the loved one's name.) In Killer Pancake, the recipes are slightly less delicious sounding than usual. Maybe it's my personal bias against \\"healthy\\" food or maybe Turkey Curry and Raisin Rice and Hoisin Turkey with Roasted Pine Nuts in Lettuce Cups sound rather disgusting. Either way, the recipes were a disappointment for me. Goldy's assistant, Julian, is suspected of killing his pretty new girlfriend. Goldy gets nosy and ultimately saves the day. No huge shocks there. The mystery itself wasn't shocking, but I'll admit I didn't see it coming. Overall, Killer Pancake didn't quite work for me. The recipes set the tone in culinary mysteries and I couldn't make myself interested in food I would never ever eat."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"This is the fifth book in the goldy culinary mysteries series which i have just started reading, currently on the seventh. I really like this series, I got into it for the culinary perspective but its not just about that. Goldy is a cateerer that also helps her now husbuand, homicide detective, Tom, investigate some cases that she herself is involved with, unofficially of course. This book deals with a make up scandel and her live in assistant Jullian. I would recommend it. Just like the rest of the series this is an easy to read without having to think too much about it kind of story."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"The compliments: It's full of low fat recipes. It's funny and pretty fast paced. It has good characters. It was a well written mystery.The complaints: The ending was rather abrupt. It left me questioning what happened to everyone besides Goldy. I wish Goldy dealt with her abusive ex-husband better instead of continually having to have someone else defend her. It's time for her to take up kick boxing, judo, karate, skillet tossing, something! I didn't find the murderer's reason for killing plausible. The author describes Colorado well but at times goes overboard;some parts of the book read like a brochure."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Colorado caterer Goldy Schulz (formerly divorced single mom Goldy Bear) has a very personal stake in the death-by-hit-and-run of Claire Satterfield, a young Australian woman working for a high-end cosmetics company: her assistant, Julian Teller, was in love with the girl, and now he's in shock. It's inevitable that Goldy--who was catering a meal for Claire's company at the time--should start snooping around, and even her new-husband-of-two-months, plainclothes detective Tom Schulz, encourages her in it, as long as she doesn't get into anything dangerous. As always, there are red herrings aplenty, including a pushy local newspaper reporter, a store security chief with a kinky habit of peering through one-way mirrors into women's dressing rooms, and hints of industrial espionage, while complications include Goldy's much-too-fond-of-the-bottle ex-husband and his other former wife, who has a coronary incident and faces the scary prospect of having to give up everything she considers decent food. But what makes the whole thing go are the inimitable characters and Goldy's wry narrative voice. You may not feel, at first, that the book is living up to its press (I didn't), but be patient ad give it a chance; it gets better as it goes along."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Love all of the Goldy books - was in wonderful condition and arrived very quickly."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"While the \\"Spare the Hares\\" people were a little gruesome, I did like the underlying theme of \\"beauty without an expensive and time-consuming makeup regime\\" and the laissez-faire attitude Goldy takes with her appearance, while still being happy in her relationship! Oh, yeah - there was a mystery, too (sometimes I focus on the oddest things). The mystery was farfetched and overreached a bit, but the colorful characters keep you interested and wondering until the very end. I did notice that these are not books you want to read while on a diet. She describes the food with far too much relish! Plan on feeling the need to get up and snack while reading this series (though she includes plenty of delicious-sounding recipes, so there's no excuse not to whip up something mouth-watering in the kitchen when you take a break to rest your eyes)"},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Compared to the other stories, this was just not that great. The main character is still fearing her ex-hubby?? He's still violent and not YET in jail, did I miss something with the justice system?The story and plot were great, although all of these stories keep making me more and more hungry. I love the fact that she includes recipes to go along with her stories.This is just another one of the fluffy Diane Mott Davidson stories and I do love it, but it was a little laughable how \\"whimpy\\" the characters seemed to become in this story."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"The book is a quck and fairly enjoyable read. You will fall in love with all of her recipies and business follies. However, after having read all of the preceeding books in the series I was somewhat disappointed with this offering.When the books opens, she make a few comments that lead you to wonder if she has forgotten she is married and why she married someone that she is not too comfortable with, even though the previous book was about the wedding. My only other problem with the book was how both she and her new husband (a police officer) deal with her still abusive ex-husband. No cop would let this situation get so out of control (I am from a law enforcement family). And Goldy, for all of her fearlessness in investigating is a total wimp with her ex."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"As \\"Killer Pancake\\" opens, Goldy is facing a difficult situation, catering to a group of cosmetic company representatives. Of course they are calorie conscious and want low-fat, low calorie fare, without all the buttery goodness of the recipes that have enabled Goldy to make a reputation for herself in the Colorado mountains.Julian has become involved with a beautiful sales associate. When she is found dead, Goldy must deal with Julian's isolation and grief even as she delves into solving the crime. Davidson writes with warmth and understanding of Goldy's motherly love for Julian, and mothers of young adult children will find much to identify with in her characterization of their relationship.Recommended ---you'll not be disappointed in this one!"},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"I'm not totally enamored of Goldy herself, the main character of this series. I find her too impractically stubborn to be cute. She rushes to ignore sound advice, gets herself injured nearly every time, moans every time the injury comes up, which is often, and then does it again. I find this stupid. I get irritated, too, at some of Goldy's attitudes, in that they don't seem to progress with the passage of time. What might have held when she was younger, should have given way by now to more experienced thinking.But I really love the other regulars in the series. Davidson does a great job of bringing them to life, and Goldy too, for that matter - I couldn't have an irritation at her if the writer didn't make her real for me, and I find I'm interested in all the regulars, what they're up to, how they've been, what's new in their lives. Goldy herself, when she's working, I like very much, too. And Julian is a pleasure to read about - even here his characteristic professionalism does hold up, though battered, even while he's stricken with grief, and suffering with shock, at the death of his girlfriend. That's good characterization. Arch belongs in this series, is always someone I care about and wonder what's going on with, and what new interests he's found. Tom has always been a perfect addition to Goldy's life, and I sometimes wish that the inclusion of more story-related details in his own investigations - not a lot - were provided, since it would add to his believability as a highly respected cop.And, of course I always enjoy the recipes, and the details about Goldy's business. Davidson does a good job with pacing, and drama. I enjoyed this book a lot, all my negatives aside. It's got enough twists to keep the reader interested, and the repeat characters are, as I said, always good to hear about. If you are familiar with the series, you'll like this one, too, and Davidson's touches about the cosmetic industry are good reading.However, I really do get irritated at the lack of research that goes into the effects of the murder means or weapons in this series. Common sense alone would prevail where ignorance about the actual substance misleads, but this is a characteristic of this series. As long as the reader knows that some the murders, or attempts, in this series are not accurate in their details, it's just an irritation to get through.Also, if you read the series in order, you can't help but notice that Goldy's background varies book-to-book. Note the details of her schooling, for instance, again, if you read the series in order of publication.As negative as I do get about the flaws in this series, it's still a favorite of mine. And there's a huge place for cozies in this world of graphic violence, too, a great pleasure to be had in reading a series about people, and ordinary life that doesn't shove shock-intended, sickening details down your throat you rather wish had been withheld.This book has a lot of behind the scenes industry conflict that adds to the story. A lot of cosmetic details - if they are accurate - make good reading, too, as do the actions of many background personnel. I also find I'm developing an enjoyment of the reporter, too, though at one time I thought she was an annoyance. I found I was disappointed at the murder of Julian's girl-friend, as she, too, was an interesting character. That, too, is good dramatic appeal.And overall, as with all the Goldy books, the mystery is sound, sometimes perilous, full of interesting people, drama, tension and humor, appealing repeat characters, red herrings, good background subterfuge and nastiness, good reading about Goldy's home life. And her nosiness, her feelings about food, and her coffee always appeal to me.I'm trying not to give much details about this story away, as I find that, to me, a book by a favorite writer is always more appealing the less I know about about the new one that's just come to my attention. I already know I can depend on the writer to give me a great read, I only look forward now to getting into the latest in Goldy's life. But I, like so many others, also appreciate the reviewers who do add details, because once I am into the story, if something beings to appeal or to irk me, I always love to zap over to Amazon, and read the other reviewers comments about that, too."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"So far I've read all Diane Mott Davidson's &#34;Goldy&#34; books and just love them !!!

Unfortunately, one of Mignon's top salepersons who happens to be Julian's girlfriend is found dead from a hit-and-run accident just as they are setting up the luncheon. Julian is heartbroken and Goldy is determined to find out who is responsible for Claire's death. Despite the fact that her policeman husband Tom is on the case, Goldy carries on her own investigation. She is suspicious of the animal rights group which picketed the luncheon because Mignon uses animals to conduct research. She also discovers that Claire had a busy romantic past and she feels that someone may have killed her out of jealousy.
