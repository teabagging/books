I just recently ran across a hardcover version of this book, and I loved it. I'd already read his movels GAME RUNNING, IN DEEP, and SPRINTER, plus I found out he also publishes under the name of Bruce Elliot and so I read his two Touch Benson books under that name as well. This book doesn't have a sequel, but it should. Chris and Matty are great characters, and the book never stops! Jones is just a better writer than he needs to be. I'd love to see this as a movie!"},{"Title":"Maximum Velocity","review":"Jones' breakneck-paced &quot;Maximum Velocity,&quot; takes place in the Colorado mountains near a remote hamlet. Chris Neilson and his wife Matty and their toddler son have just moved there from a California suburb when a relative of Matty's turns up in his red Lamborghini and, after a few deft maneuvers, leaves Chris for dead and takes over his life.From the beginning, Jones manages an off-kilter tension, an unpredictability generated by the Springer character, which grows helter skelter as the novel progresses.Essentially a chase, with a number of outlandish aspects, the novel only flags when Jones pauses to develop character. A former screenwriter, Jones' forte is action and his best character is the larger-than-life villain. Springer is a sadist who enjoys himself, a highly trained CIA killing machine who increases in invincibility as Chris' efforts become more desperate. Suspend your disbelief and you're in for a high-speed roller-coaster of a ride."},{"Title":"The Madwoman of the Sacred Heart","review":"Alan Manguel is a middle-aged professor of philosophy in Sorbonne, who makes a real impression on his students almost so much that a cult starts around his teachings.

From then on a journey starts with many increcible twists and Alan finds himself deeply involved in a group of people who believe they will give birth to the new Messiah. He can't get out because his young girlfriend and mother-to-be of his child is in the center of all this, claiming to be Elisabeth mother of John the baptist. To make things worse a series of miracles (or coincidences) keep happening, challenging Alan's logical view of the world.The book is a masterpiece because it is so engaging. Every page brings an unexpectable twist, but the story keeps very tight with inner logic. Like in many true masterpieces of literature and cinema (eg. Bonnie and Clyde) the reader cannot tell whether the book is serious, or joking. It is definitely hillarious, but also it engages the reader in deep thought. And at the same time you can't stop reading for a second because you need to find out what happens next. It is a very intense book.One warning: the book is seriously sacrilegious, if you believe in the Bible (especially if Christian).

Smaller page size, no colors, and the cover is different (the bottom 20% of the original cover is missing, probably to make it more acceptable for the American bookshelves.) Another problem is the title's translation. &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; in French is the &quot;Sacre Coeur&quot;, the famous church in Paris.

With this, i felt like even though the work was beautiful he was boxed in, in a way, by terrestrial limits.Im even more familiar with jodorowsky, and im starting to find it upsetting that he always incorporates the same elements into his story telling. Anyone familiar with jodorowsky will agree. Thats not to say im not a huge fan, but this comic gets three stars because im tired of it. As far as his series of graphic novels goes, the incal series is great, and i think the best of all is metabarons. I havent read technopriests but maybe someday.Anyways, all in all, this was worth the fifteen or twenty bucks, because, lets face it, ots FIFTEEN OR TWENTY BUCKS RIGHT, i just cant give it more than three stars because im rating it against their other work."},{"Title":"The Madwoman of the Sacred Heart","review":"As a longtime Jodorowsky fan, I've read almost all of his English translations.This was the most recent story that I've been able to track down and Sr. Jodorowsky and Sr. Moebius continue to show their cosmic depth, intelligence, spirituality and skill!I wasn't expecting much from this little black and white book, even with the great creators involved but I have to tell you that this is one of the more profound stories I've read in several years. Sr. Jodorowsky has written some wild and insightful tales before, but this really shows his grasp of the human mind, both intellectually and spiritually.I felt transformed, along with the protagonist, as I read this, and it feels really good. It's never too late to be that great, good person that we always dream we are, deep down; and this book is a great reminder of that, not to mention quite an exciting journey along the way.Miracles are real, if you care to look."},{"Title":"The Madwoman of the Sacred Heart","review":"This is a weird one to be honest. I only kept reading because I was waiting for something awesome to happen, and there's a few instances where it does.

Art wise moebius does not let you down and there are no instances of rushness or lazyness in his work and infact seems to have really enjoyed himself while drawing this book.A good read but nothing great."},{"Title":"The Madwoman of the Sacred Heart","review":"I noticed that this trade has approximately 50 fewer pages than the French version.

I might have gotten more out of it if I was a philosphy professor like the storie's protagonist, but as a humble member of the seething masses, I was left in the dust while the narative took off on a surreal existential rollercoaster. I risk sounding like a semi-literate baboon here, but I might still have loved it if Moebius had drawn us some crazy aliens or something, but the rather mundane terestrial setting for this book really left nothing to focus on but the obscure religious analogies that, to be perfectly honest, I didn't get.

He warns of the increasing encroachments against your computer. The biggest single danger is that this might be your home computer. Not a computer at your workplace, for which you might be able to ask a sysadmin for help.So it's you and Tittel against the 3 menaces. Be aware that the terminology in the text and title may vary from what others use. Often, malware is taken to include viruses. I think he chose to break viruses out separately from malware so that the title would outreach to more people. Malware is still somewhat of a techie term, while spyware and viruses have broader recognition.Naturally, since we're discussing personal computers, the text tends to focus on those running a Microsoft operating system. But in fact, much of his advice applies to Macs and linux/unix machines. Though users of the former 2 types might take heart in knowing that most viruses or worms won't go after their machines.Tittel explains that increasingly, it's harder to draw clear lines between malware, spyware and adware. But he shows how to use existing anti-malware products that can scan for these and remove them. These products use combinations of signatures of known malware, and also search for \\"strange\\" activity that is typical of malware. However, since new variants of malware are continually being developed and found, you should always download the latest sets of signatures from your vendor, before running the tests.Tittel also gives a succinct description of phishing. A particularly virulent type of malware that has increased enormously in the last 2 years. He suggests that you scrutinise the links and be very wary of any message that asks for personal information; either in a reply, or in a web page pointed to from that message. Unfortunately, the phishers continue to refine their tactics and many users simply aren't savvy enough to follow Tittel's suggestions. These users may be a minority, but there are enough of them to make this worthwhile for the phishers."},{"Title":"PC Magazine Fighting Spyware, Viruses, and Malware","review":"Any of us connected on-line for even a few minutes has probably been the recipient of at least one virus attack.Not only viruses, but many other kinds of intrusive software would like to come into your machine for its own purpose.

Personally I think this is quite a good book."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"This short book is set in two contrasting locations the uglyness and agony of the First World War as well as the main character's home enviroment, the Devonshire countryside. The book tells the tale of two brothers growing up in a poor but suportive home environment, which gets progressivly worse after the death of their father. It shows how the local gentry could force those without resourses to do as they were instructed. This conflict between the gentry and the working classes is one of the main motive forces in the story. Michael Morpurgo shows how ultimatly the older brothers refusal to be broken in spirit led to his undoing. A very well written and enjoyable book, not just for young adults. Its a book that speaks up for those soldiers who were put to death by the the officer corp of the British Army.A final thought on this topic; Back in 1997 Tony Blair seeking election as the next Prime Minister made an election promise to give posthumous pardons to these men. to date he still has not delivered on this promise.OK so in the end Blair came through with the pardon when he was needing a boost the polls just before an election if memory serves."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"Private Peaceful has a very interesting premise: Set against the backdrop of World War One, we follow brothers Charlie and Tommo as they grow up and subsequently enlist in Britain's army to fight the Hun. Each chapter begins sometime during a very long night as Tommo remembers all the adventures and trials he and his family endured together. Morpurgo does an excellent job of building suspense as we learn slowly that Tommo is dreading the coming of morning, though the reason is unclear until late in the book. By then, we are so emotionally vested in this story that the realization of what's coming is devastating.Private Peaceful (Peaceful is the family name) is a short book that packs a wallop of emotion. However, at times Morpurgo doesn't move the story along as quickly as I'd like, though of course war itself is like that. Tommo doesn't waver in his commitments, whether to his brothers, his soldiering, or his love for his brother's wife; it's this love for Molly that I found immature on his part. The brothers are realistic in their devotion to each other, and Morpurgo is skilled in bringing us to the climax that tests those bonds.Overall I enjoyed this book, though I felt it might have done a little better with Tommo being less focused on his own feelings. The book would make a great addition to a history teacher's repetoire; it illustrates the devastation of trench warfare and the unrealistic notions of young men enlisting to fight an unknown enemy. Ultimately packing a powerful punch, this is indeed a book I find easy to recommend."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"Private Peaceful is a must read book by Michael Morpurgo and I would reccomend it to people from 10 years onwards.

Because I'm an Old Adult (OA), and found the story absolutely captivating from start to finish. It brought to mind, of course, Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage (Enriched Classics (Pocket)) and its young hero, Henry Fleming, who, like Morpurgo's Tommo Peaceful, wanted desperately to prove he wasn't a coward. Going to war to prove one's manhood has long been a theme in literature. A more recent novel of the Second World War, Nick Arvin's Articles of War, is even closer in theme to Morpurgo's book. Arvin's novel owes much to William Bradford Huie's non-fiction classic, The Execution of Private Slovik.Morpurgo was, I suspect, very careful to avoid usage of the kind of casual obscenity that is endemic to the speech of rank and file military men. In so doing he was able to preserve his status as a writer of YA books. His descriptions of young (16) Tommo Peaceful and what he is thinking as he endures military training and then his various baptisms of fire in the horrors of WWI trench warfare are simply dead-on. You ache for this boy, who quickly, out of necessity, becomes a man. And the love felt between the Peaceful brothers - also brothers-in-arms - quickly becomes a unifying element of the story, from their childhood onward.Simply put, PRIVATE PEACEFUL is just superb story-telling for any audience, YA or OA. Now I have to find a copy of Morpurgo's companion piece, War Horse."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"When Tommo's brother Charlie is about to get executed, Tommo thinks about the 18 years of his life with Charlie the night before Charlie dies. They are in France in the British Army in WW I. Charlie is about to get executed because he did not listen to his Sergeant. Charlie did not go out on the battlefield because he saw his brother get hurt and wanted to take care of him. Tommo thinks about being friends with Molly. Tommo and Charlie met Molly at school. Molly became Charlie's wife. Tommo was in love with Molly. Also Tommo thinks about all of the things he did with his family, Mama, Papa, Big Joe, Molly, Charlie, and Great Aunt Wolf. Tommo is also thinking about how Charlie and he annoyed their great aunt. They used to let mice in the house because their great aunt hated mice. Tommo thinks that it was his fault when his father died. He did not notice that a tree was falling and he was in the way. His father had to push him out of the way and the tree fell on his father. Finally, Tommo remembered that Charlie would take him to school and would teach him things. I feel that this is a historical fiction book for kids 10+. The reason I feel that is because it involves war and execution. I have no feelings for the book. One thing that would make the book better would be to have the story happen in order from beginning to end instead of almost end to beginning to end."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"Private peacefulReviser Big TonyThis book is a good book if you like to read war books. This book is about the adventures and experiences that a person had when he went to war. The bad thing about this book is that it is a made up story but it seems like it could have actually been somebody's life story.Michael Morpurgo wrote the book and he did a good job at writing it because when he describes the war and some parts of the war, you feel like you are in the book with the characters and fighting with them in the battlefields.The only thing I really didn't like about the book was that it had butterflies on the cover of the book. I thought it made it look like it wasn't going to be one of the better war books, but I was wrong. It was a good book; so don't judge this book by the cover.

It's a story about making difficult decisions and standing behind your decision. The story takes place leading up to and during World War I. Two brothers in England, very close but very competitive, decided to enlist to do their part, in spite of other obligations (one has a young pregnant wife, the other is only 15 years old, was secretly responsible for his father's death, and vowed to look after his mother). Neither are prepared for what awaits them. The English Army is not portrayed in a very friendly light in this book, and the reader will often marvel at the stupidity of those running the operation. In all, a bittersweet story but an easy read and poignant."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"The great... amazing.... book of the millennium, Private Peaceful staring Tommo with his first love at age seven Molly. The first half of the book is about his childhood,but the second half is about Tommo in WORLD WAR I. Tommo's family cannot live in the little house that they live in if Charlie doesn't go to war. Charlie goes because he was older than 18 but Tommo was 16 so he lied about his age to go with Charlie.Sorrow, romance, and well, life are themes in this book. Private Peaceful is a very \\"sniff\\" touching book. The book shows me that War isn't, at least this book shows it is not, a situation, this book shows it is a living horrible thing. This book shows that war isn't even close to fun. Don't get involved in war.Don't think this book is just war, it has laughs, but do not get driven away by that thought, there will be war to too. This book made my eyes fill with tears when I read the end. \\"Sergeant reader\\" (you) \\"Yes sir\\" \\"Read this book and that's an order.\\""},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"We would say that this book is mainly aimmed at kids aged 10 and over.....The book is all about the two brothers and the time in life that the two brothers, Charlie and Tommo, spend together.

The author has written several other stories for young readers including one called Farm Boy (if i am remembering right) that deals with a grandson of one of the characters in Private Peaceful."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"Set in England during WWI, Private Peaceful is a story about a family, relationships, and the horrors of war. Thomas \\"Tommo\\" Peaceful feels guilt and regret over the demise of his forester father, who dies at the hands of a falling tree while trying to save his youngest son. In spite of his dad's absence, Tommo seems able to fully enjoy life with his brothers, Big Joe, brain damaged due to a case of meningitis when only an infant, and Charlie, three years Tommo's senior, and their loving mother. Not long after Mr. Peaceful's death the Colonel reminds the widow that their use of a cottage on his estate would end unless she agreed to work as his wife's lady's maid. While Mrs. Peaceful works at the house, a strict, by the book, maternal great aunt, known as \\"Grandma\\" to the Peaceful boys (though they secretly refer to her as Grandma Wolf) cares for them. The boys struggle to please the demanding woman, silently enduring her constant criticism of the family and belittling behavior towards Big Joe, and suffer the cruelties of the Colonel. Fortunately, they find a friend in Molly, a classmate who all three boys adore for her kindness. When asked to volunteer to serve war men arrive asking for volunteers to serve in the British Army, the boys sneakily sign up as twins to hide the fact that Tommo is only fifteen. The two serve and survive the rigors of war and the conflicts of brotherhood.Although not a fan of historical fiction, I appreciated learning the \\"historical\\" part of this work of fiction, which involves a significant event that happens late in the story. Also good: The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips by Michael Morpurgo, The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane, and The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"In the book Private Peaceful many interesting things happen. First of all in the book there are many sad parts that happen to Tommo, the main character. For example, like when the dad dies right in front of Tommo and Tommo has to run all the way home alone to tell his whole family that his dad was cutting down the old tree back in woods behind there house and the tree fell on him. Also another part part in the book is that when his dad dies his mother has to go to work to have food and money for the family. Tommo and his older brother have to stay with there grandma and they do everything to try to kill her so that they don't have to stay there with her and so that the mom will be forced to stay home so they can spend time with her. Tommo lives a tuff life through out the story and he learns to deal with it. He learns that in the end he knows it wasn't his fault that his dad died that day even though he blamed everything on him and really it wasn't anyone's fault. Private Peaceful is a very good book and these are only a few of many exciting things that happen during the book!"},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"'Private Peaceful' is a tale of courage, sadness and love.

I haven't cried this hard with a book since I read Bridge to Terabithia in fifth grade. I was really impressed with this book, more than I thought I would be.Description: Tommo wants to prove to himself and everyone around him that he is not a coward, so he enlists in World War 1 along with his brother Charlie, who has always looked out for him.That is only some of the story, you'll have to read it to find out the rest. Very sad, very short, very EXCELLENT."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"Thomas Peaceful (Tommo) is a young boy when his father dies in a freak accident while saving Tommo's life. Tommo's brother, Charlie, is more than just his brother, but also his best friend. They haven't kept any secrets from each other until their father dies. Tommo thinks that his brother would hate him and that it would be best to keep what had happened a secret from the rest of his family. Charlie is nothing but trouble on the Colonel's manor until the manor himself volunteers Charlie to fight in the First World War. Tommo doesn't want Charlie to leave, so he decides to volunteer himself to fight along-side his brother and other people he has grown up with in his childhood. They struggle to survive in their day to day lives in France with many impediments in their way. It's also imperative for soldiers to listen to their commanding officers or else they will be trialed for treason.The parts of the book that I liked were when Tommo was determined to go to war with his brother, even when his family was begging him to stay. I also liked the parts when both Tommo and Charlie are fighting together, side by side. I especially like the part when Charlie was missing in action because it had built so much suspense on whether or not Charlie would be able to make it back or not. The only dislike I had was the lack of details of the milieu around them during the times at battle.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read book with action. I also recommend it to readers that like to read about war and conflicts between characters during war. This book was extremely well written and is one of the best war books I have read so far. If you liked this book, I recommend reading Fallen Angels by Walter Dean Myers because it is also a very well written war novel, such as Private Peaceful."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"I am never usually sad after reading a book, but in this case I was.

Along with his brother, Charlie, he decides to enlist into the army to fight the Germans in France.Tommo soon starts to miss his loving Mother, his \`special' bother Big Joe and his good friend Molly.He also starts to think of his deceased father whose death Tommo believes was his fault.

Thommo Peaceful recalls growing up, poor but happy, in the English countryside. He has two older brothers, Charlie and Big Joe, his mother and Molly, who he loves. Believing he killed his father, Thommo never speaks of his death.Charlie is his protector, his ally and best friend. as boys the have a best friend in Molly. As Molly and Charlie get older they fall in love, excluding Thommo and changing the triangle of friendship. Then the war starts and every able bodied young man in their village joins the army. Technically too young to enlist, Thommo pretends to be Charlie's twin in order to get in the army.This is a well written book about adventures and experiences in war. I won't say it's enjoyable (because hey, it is about a scared young boy in a warzone) but it's compelling. The descriptions of the trenches and being gassed were very realistic and show vividly the horror of war. Made into a film, this book is suitable for ages 10 and upwards."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"Very well written. British English and culture. Interesting story.

This book allowed him to see young men show emotions, courage, and honor not ONLY being physical and aggressive. While the novel was based during a war it was about the avoidance of violence and aggression as a man."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"There are two Privates Peaceful, brothers, Charlie and Tommo. The book takes place over a long night when Tommo is waiting and dreading the dawn. As he waits, he thinks back over his very short life (he's 18 at this point) and remembers the world he left in England which is vividly contrasted with the hell in which he now finds himself. An excellent YA book, but very readable for any age. Taken in tandem with War Horse, the author's other novel about the Great War, Morpurgo provides an understandable and relateable introduction to this part of history."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"is an appropriate to use in a middle school classroom, as it sheds light on World War I through the eyes of Thomas (\`Tommo') Peaceful, a young English soldier whose undeniable love for his family brings light to a dark period in history. While Private Peaceful's character is unique, it embodies a collaboration of characteristics of the young soldiers fighting in the war; so, in a sense, he represents all soldiers. The book gradually moves towards the present as Tommo reflects on his life and his relationships, specifically that with his older brother Charlie during the time they spend trekking through the French trenches fighting off the Germans. In order to supplement the story with history, author Morpurgo incorporates specific scenarios that highlight the severity of military culture during this time, specifically through an aggressive Sergeant's maltreatment of his soldiers. All the while a theme of undying loyalty between the Charlie and Tommo prevails; however, when Charlie defies the Sergeant's orders to protect Tommo, he pays the ultimate price and Tommo's role in life suddenly changes. Overall, Private Peaceful would be excellent to supplement classroom instruction as it offers a sobering perspective on human life through a well researched plot that students will enjoy."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"Michael Morpurgo's book, Private Peaceful, is an excellent work of historical fiction. The book was a bit slow at first, but once the novel continued on, it was a lot more interesting and engaging. I was impressed with how Morpurgo wove in historical details throughout the work. His descriptions of the trenches and the physical effects of being gassed, shot at, and other hazards, made the novel more real. The realism continued on as the reader also got an idea of the mental effects of trench warfare and the toll it took on soldiers. I think readers will appreciate Morpurgo's honesty in the portrayal of one of the worst wars in the world's history. He does not gloss over the difficulties, and yet the book is still suitable for adolescents as young as middle school."},{"Title":"Private Peaceful (After Words)","review":"I'm on a Michael Morpurgo kick, devouring book after book of his, after reading Born to Run. To each of his books reviewed here by me, I gave 5 stars because I loved each one so much. But now, after reading Private Peaceful, I am regretting that decision, only because Private Peaceful is so good, so brilliant, that I have no higher mark left for it. I won't summarize the plot - the book's description can do that - but I will say that it is nothing short of stunning. The book beautifully tells the (albeit short) life-story of an English farmboy, now in a trench in Belgium during WWI. The beauty of the boy's story, as well as the richness of his inner life, attest to the overwhelming value of his life, as well as the lives of so many other young men lost at war. As much as the book is about the beauty and goodness of the world, it is also about its cruelty and injustice, not merely as it exists in the heart of the enemy, but as it exists in the heart of the friend as well. The world is beautiful, the world is horrible. It is a book written for older children and teens, only because the devastating realities it imparts may be hard to swallow for younger children. A fantastic read for adults as well."},{"Title":"To Be a Pilgrim: The Medieval Pilgrimage Experience","review":"To Be a Pilgrim delivers exactly what the title promises. Comprehensive and well-researched, it divides this vast topic into sections dealing with the rise of the pilgrim tradition in Christianity, the most poplular sites and some not so well known, the joys and perils of the journey, the hopes and motivations of the pilgrim, signs and symbols, and the decline of the pilgrimage in the late middle ages. While I enjoyed reading this volume, which is beautifully illustrated, I also noticed numerous errors in vocabulary, choice of words (eg, \\"parody\\" rather than \\"parallel\\"), and proofing (someone was reported to have drunk the blood of St Thomas Becket!) These signs of sloppy editing were frequent enough to be distracting. Nevertheless, there is much to learn in To Be a Pilgrim, and it is worth a reading for the student of medieval history and religious practices."},{"Title":"No hay mal que dure 100 aos ni mujer que lo resista","review":"This is one of the best books that I've read.

I am a goal oriented person, and drive myself to the limit. As I do this, my time seems to pass ever more quickly, and I find myself drained by the end of the day. Sometimes I have to ask myself if it's worth it.When I read Ruth Martinez's book, IN SEARCH OF YOUR TIME, I got a huge AH-HA! Now I have an entirely different perspective of time, how to use it and how to make it work for me. Oh, I'm still too busy, but it's more a conscious &quot;being in control&quot; of my time, rather than my time being in control of me. I keep my copy by my bed so that I can snatch a thought before going to sleep.I highly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have enough time in his or her life. It gives a common sense perspective to everyday life."},{"Title":"In Search of Your Time","review":"I really enjoyed reading IN SEARCH OF YOUR TIME.

I calm down and take some deep breaths, which helps me get through the situation. This really works for me. The situation is still there, but I can handle it better. I find that I'm more focused afterwards, and it just helps me to do a better job.I would rate this book as 4 to 5, and the only reason I would give it 4 is that it is short, and I think a lot of people would like a longer book. For me it is fine, though, since it is small enough for me to carry in my purse so I can refer to it whenever I feel the need. Since I can't rate it by halves, I have to give it a 5, as the content is excellent."},{"Title":"In Search of Your Time","review":"This book, IN SEARCH OF YOUR TIME, really helped me to take a look at my own life and how I spend my time. It made me realize that, as a busy wife and mother with two demanding home based businesses, besides teaching aerobics and personal fitness training, it was O.K. to spend five minutes with my little boy before delving into my other more pressing but less important responsibilities. It helped me to understand that I can slow down my busy life but at the same time not become so relaxed that I don't accomplish anything significant. It helped me recognize that when I let the demands of life take charge of me, I become very rattled, and accomplish very little. However, when I make a conscious effort to be in charge of my time, I become more efficient. This has brought me much peace, and even helps me to breathe more easily.

One of the blessed qualities of the writing of Elswyth Thane is that she can take each character of each generation of her families and make them vivid, alive, humanly recognizable, and -- most amazing feat of all -- DIFFERENT! Dinah Campion is no more Tibby Mawes than Bracken Murray is St. John Sprague, and all Thane's heroines, from Tibby to Eden to Virginia and beyond have their own decidedly varied personalities. Less war-oriented than her first two novels, &quot;Ever After&quot; tells the story of loves delayed (as loves and lives always are) by the interruption of violence into well-ordered lives. With her usual deft pen Thane not only reconstructs turn-of-the-century Williamsburg for us, but turns her talents to late 19th century New York and England as well. More than any other of her books, I think, this one depicts exquisitely the settings where her characters live and function: the fascinating city that was New York in the Gay 90s -- early vaudeville with its colorful characters, fashionable Park Avenue where the very rich dressed and partied and lived in isolated splendor, the seamier side of existence where vices of every kind could make the frightened sister of a tawdry vaudeville suicide expect to have to pay back the men who rescue her in the &quot;usual&quot; way. And Thane's beloved England sparkles through her eyes, not only in its upper-class, fox-hunting, tweed-wearing, manifiestations, but in the lonely lives led by the ignored and repressed offspring of the rich and elite. Through Thane's skill as a story-teller and the window she seems to possess into the human soul, what might be a completely unbelievable tale of love at first sight becomes an entirely comprehensible exercise in passion and self-restraint. Music fills this book, literally and figuratively, and the Spanish-American War, when it erupts into these sophisticated and civilized pages, takes us away from that music only momentarily. The disputes and disagreements of war are not the main conflicts in this novel; love postponed, love seemingly impossible, love triumphant are the themes, and Thane lifts us out of ourselves and into the hearts of her characters with all the skill of a conjuror. A honey of a book, and a dilly of a portrait!"},{"Title":"Ever After","review":"I read all of Thane's \\"Williamsburg novels\\" in the 1970's in what I remember being original library editions, and liked them very much. A couple of years ago, I ran into what looked to be a clean copy of \\"Ever After\\" at a local bookstore, and bought it, happy to have a copy of a work I remembered from my childhood. On reading it, though, I was confused to realize that it had been expurgated -- the references to drinking were almost all excised. Thane was an author of her time, writing about another time, and in both of them social drinking was an accepted thing, but none of her characters drank excessively, and it would be hard to interpret her books as endorsing alcohol, so the edits were very mysterious. There was no re-writing involved, and in one case the cut left a grammatical glitch that reads very awkwardly. I asked around when I first realized this, but could find no one that had any additional information on the press or its policies.The copy is from something called Hawthorn Press, and the only bibliographic information it has is from the original printing in 1945. The copy feels too new to be of that vintage, though, so I'm not sure what the actual edition is. Just realize that you might wind up with slightly less story than Thane originally wrote."},{"Title":"Ever After","review":"This is another example of Elswyth Thane's magnificent writing skill! Elswyth Thane has the great talent of combining historical facts and figures with fictitious and romantic plots without overdosing in either element.In Ever AFter, the story opens on Susannah, now aged and spinsterish but still writing as fervently as ever. On Eden, now married to journalist Cabot Murray and the mother of three grown children. Bracken, her eldest, is a somewhat resigned young man who shows promise in the feild of journalism. His sister, Virginia, is a blossoming and flirtatious southern belle who hooks nearly every man who looks at her. And Fitz, the son of Sedgwick and Melicent Sprague, Fitz's only companions it seems are his piano and Sue. He is the outcast of the family, the one oddity that no one understands except Sue.As Fitz leaves the shelter of Williamsburg and his songwriting, he takes a job with Cabot's paper in New York and there meets Gwen, an actress who will change his life's course forever. Meanwhile, Sue, Bracken and Virginia set out for England for the Jubilee celebration. There they encounter Sir Gration Forbes-Carpenter, who is a war veteran from the war in Africa. This leaves Sue with a choice that will plague her conscious forever; her spontaneous friendship with Sir Gration or her deep and forbidden love for Sedgwick...However, Sue is not the only one who finds love in England. Bracken, still hurt from his not-quite-finished divorce with Lizl Olezei, finds Dinah Campion. Immediately touched by her young and sweet innocence, Bracken is forced to conceal his love for her until she is of age to marry.Matters become more complicated as the steadily growing conflict between Spain and Cuba erupts into war. Fitz and Bracken are forced to go to Cuba as war correspondents and must leave their newfound loves behind.Take my advice if you have already read Dawn's Early Light and Yankee Stranger and read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ever After","review":"Well I don't normaly do this but I was looking something up on the internet and I ran across a reveiw for this book and it made me really mad. It said, and I quote \\"Tragedy unravells the lives of a man, his wife and his young lover.\\" Sounds like a really bad third rate romance novel am I right? Well, I just wanted to set the record straight on what this book is really about. Bracken is not the bad guy in the story as the other reveiw made him out to be, infact its his wife that left HIM for another man. He does fall in love with Dinah--but he doesn't do anyting about it until he is sure he can marry her properly and not make a scandel. Their are two other love stories in this book as well, Fitz and Gwen and Archie and Vergina, that will make you smile like your the one in love. I recommend this book to anyone-though I would read Dawns Early Light and Yankee Stranger first. Thane's writing is simple and beautiful and makes her readers feel as if they are actually in the story and expirencing the same emotions as her characters. I have yet to come across another author that makes me as crazy and a happy as Elswyth Thane."},{"Title":"Ever After","review":"This is the third in the Williamsburg series and one of my favorites. Set around the Spanish American War, it moves between the US, England and Cuba with memorable characters (both actual and fictional.) The whole series is well worth having if you like historical romance that is definitely not the &quot;bodice-ripping&quot; variety."},{"Title":"Ever After","review":"Elswyth Thane is a wonderful writer of historical fiction novels. I like the way each one of her books deals with the same Family during each of the American wars."},{"Title":"Ever After","review":"With this third book in Elswyth Thane's Wiliamsburg Series, I finally caught on to what she is doing: telling the story of successive generations of war correspondents. In \\"Dawn's Early Light\\" it was Julian Day keeping a journal of the Revolutionary War; in \\"Yankee Stranger\\" it was Cabot Murray acting as a spy infiltrating the Rebel ranks to get good stories for his father's newspaper. In \\"Ever After\\" there are two correspondents, the cousins Bracken Murray and Fitzhugh Sprague, each covering the war in Cuba at the end of the 19th century.In \\"Ever After\\" the story of the Day/Sprague/Murray families moves away from Williamsburg; almost none of the novel is set there. Instead, we are transported to New York, England and Cuba from the winter of 1896 to the summer of 1899. Although \\"Ever After\\" was an enjoyable read, for me it fell somewhat short of the first two books in the series. For one thing I just couldn't care very much about the war for Cuban independence, Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders notwithstanding. The war occupied more of a background role than in the previous two books, which is good considering my lack of interest; although I have to say that Thane's descriptions of land crabs hovering around dying men lying in the sands of Cuba, waiting for them to die so as to feast on their wounds and soft tissues, was pretty ghastly. In typical fashion Thane wove actual historical characters seamlessly into her narrative, although, here, too, they were far less significant than in the previous two books, with Clara Barton and Theodore Roosevelt having only brief appearances.The romances in \\"Ever After\\" were also much more flat and predictable than in the previous two books. And there was nothing in \\"Ever After\\" like the wonderful climactic scenes near the end of the first two books. Although Thane attempted to create one with Dinah and Bracken before the officers of Scotland Yard, it lacked much conflict or drama and wrapped up a little too quickly, nicely and neatly.Also -- and this is totally me -- I was really disappointed with the way Thane handled Susannah Day's story. She was part of the very poignant ending of \\"Yankee Stranger\\", and when she appeared again at the very beginning of \\"Ever After\\" I was looking forward to discovering how her story would play out. I won't say anything else, so as not to be a spoiler, except that I was unhappy with how Thane chose to play out her character. It was not at all what I was hoping for.In short, although \\"Ever After\\" is a nice read, and Thane does an excellent job of creating a sense of the time and place, the story just lacked spark. For me it was really 3.5 stars, but since I can't do that I'll round up to 4. I am looking forward to the rest of the series, and hope the remaining books are more like the first two."},{"Title":"Ever After","review":"This is one of those books you keep and read every year. Although a number of stories touch and diverge, it is Dinah and Bracken's romance that I return to over and over.Thane's description of Dinah's flowering under the attention from Bracken is so sweet. The setting, England on the brink of WWII, is richly described. The difficulties they must overcome seem insurmountable, but love conquers all."},{"Title":"The social system of the modern factory: The strike: a social analysis, (Yankee City series, vol. IV)","review":"A well written ethnography... Though written some 65+ years ago it is easy to grasp and worth a pickup for anyone interested in unions from a deep time perspective."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"&quot;Peony&quot; is a subtle, quiet novel - an excellent example of Pearl Buck's elegant and dignified style. Based on true events, the novel chronicles the life of Peony, a bondmaid who was sold to a wealthy Chinese/Jewish family. &quot;Peony&quot; can be considered a work of historical fiction, as Ms. Buck's excellent research provides accurate and extremely interesting information on Jews in China.The story takes place over a century ago in K'aifeng, the home of the largest Jewish colony in China. At the time, Jews were rapidly assimilating into Chinese society and culture, and losing their Jewish identity. &quot;Peony&quot; tells the story of one particularly prominent Jewish family through the eyes of the ethnic Chinese bondmaid, and how the problem of assimilation effects each family member individually. The topic - Jewish identity in China - is fascinating and not commonly discussed.Ms. Buck's amazing ability to create depth of character is in strong evidence in &quot;Peony,&quot; and all of the characters are extremely well developed and realistic. While the story incorporates a historic element, it also includes interesting subplots of unrequited love, familial strife, and the age-old Chinese (and Jewish) concept of filial duty and respect.This book is indicative of Pearl Buck's genius and gift for storytelling. Ms. Buck doesn't need to resort to hyperbole to get her point across - the words are carefully chosen and the story is beautifully constructed. Her writing style is gorgeous and evocative. The author's famous love for China and its many cultures is evident in her delicate prose - she treats the characters and the plot with utmost respect and historical accuracy. The beauty of China and the Chinese and Jewish cultures are done tremendous justice by this lovely book."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"This was the first Pearl Buck book I ever read. I still re-read it with a lot of enjoyment.The language Pearl Buck uses is clever; in the Good Earth she keeps the language simple, to catch the thought patterns of the peasant farmers. In Peony, she tries to capture the formal interactions between masters and servants, between men and women both Chinese and of foreign descent. She succeeds brilliantly in making the speech patterns of each character suit their role.The story is wide-ranging, from inside the walls of a Chinese-Jewish household with its extended family and servants, all the way to the Manchu court of the Western Empress Tzu Hsi. The story of the Jews in China is well-told and interesting.And of course Pearl Buck is first and foremost a wonderful story teller. If you like Amy Tan, you are sure to enjoy this book too."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"I accidentally found \\"Peony\\" while I was trying to find a book that would teach me how to grow peonies. The title, the topic and Buck's reputation helped me decide to read it. I am so glad that I did.Other reviewers have told of the understated, beautiful use of language. They have spoken of the interesting juxtaposition of the Jewish and Chinese cultures, the gentleness of the story, and Buck's decision not to satisfy our need for a Hollywood ending.All of these wonderful aspects allowed me to focus on other layers of the novel. The fact that the Jewish community in Kaifeng eventually allowed themselves to forget their own culture was fascinating. Their acceptance of and integration into the Chinese culture is portrayed as inexorable. Most slipped away easily; others faced the loss with overwhelming grief. Buck describes the Chinese characters in this book as being accepting of others while being a bit hedonistic themselves. They choose to seek pleasure and temporal fullfillment while the Jews focus on the horror of oppression, complex ritual and the absolute truth of their history and destiny. In other words, it seemed that the Jews were willing to give up their faith because it was difficult to maintain personally and for the community as a whole.The final destruction of the core of the Jewish community is, ironically, a product of being a \\"chosen people.\\" Kao Lien (a business associate of the Ezra family) tells David ben Ezra (Peony's young master) that the Jews, \\"were hated because they separated themselves from the rest of mankind. They called themselves chosen of God.\\" This is David's first inkling that the world has alternate views of the Jewish people. This is a pivotable moment in the novel. This conversation gives David enough distance from his own culture to allow him to choose a Chinese wife and to move farther from the religion of his mother. Because he chooses not to become a leader of the Jews in his city, the Temple and the culture eventually fall into ruin.More than most novels, this one is a rare combination of attributes. It is entertaining, informative, thought provoking and good literature. I will certainly read more of Buck's work and urge others to read this novel."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"I picked this book up a bit hesitantly. I'd read &quot;The Good Earth&quot; on my own initiative, and had heard of &quot;Peony&quot; from a friend. I read it, and must say that this book, though simply written, was one of the most chilling pieces of literature I've ever read. You find yourself truly wishing for everything to go right for the title character Peony, a Chinese handmaiden serving a Jewish family. A heartbreaking story, and I find myself agreeing with other reviewers when I say I wish the story could have turned out differently--not because the ending was weak, but because Buck so fully draws the reader into the story that you hope deperately for the main character to achieve her goal. A thoroughly engrossing read (I know this phrase has become cliched, but it does describe the book)."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"This was a book I bought almost four years ago when I had had to read the Good Earth for school, enjoyed it, and wanted to try something else by the author. Recently I wanted to read something and found it on my bookshelf. If I remember, it touched me even more so than the Good Earth. Peony's selfless love, which would probably be scorned by feminists, truly touched me. I wish the ending had been different; but it's not really that I wish a different ending as that I wish life wasn't sad. (read the book, you'll understand that comment) While in the beginning I thought the religous musings were a bit too heavy, it built the novel into what it was, which was much more than a love story (although as a love story I have yet to read a more sincere one) but the story of a people whose customs must eventually die off. I am so pleased to now be aware of an obscure people in China so many years ago. The historical angle fascinates me, but it is the story that I will never forget. I applaud Pearl S. Buck for her brilliance.(this is by a 17 year old girl who read the novel purely for pleasure)"},{"Title":"Peony","review":"&quot;A&quot; is excellent and that's what this book truly is. This was a great book that explored two diverse cultures mingling in love, work, family, religion, aging, power and secrets. It's a vacation to China without actually going. The proverbs, poems and phrases written within the story will stay with you forever. It's so meaningful and will provide a psychological balance for any one. If you are Chinese or Jewish this is a &quot;required reading&quot;! Although, I am a native Californian who was brought up as a Roman Catholic. My ancestry is from Spain and I clearly found some Jewish roots in my mothers' anscestors. And so, this book offered some answers to questions that I've always had in the back of my mind. In the end, you'll learn that, today, we are a world of diverse peoples' who must work together lovingly and happily. There is a great love story intertwined in this wonderful novel, too. it was a great reminder of how the peoples of our past have blood-lined the present populations while we will, henceforth, be a part of future generations."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"This is a wonderful story with well-drawn characters the reader can empathize with. When reading, you feel as if you have been picked up and plopped down in China, in the middle of this Chinese/Jewish household. I wanted it to go on forever. This book is profoundly sad and profoundly joyful at the same time, while also being interesting and informative. I was never before aware of Jews in China and now have a jumping-off point from which to do some research. Fascinating! The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was how quickly the end of the story came; near the finish of the book, the years pass too fast and everything is wound up. Mrs. Buck does not give us a \\"Hollywood\\" ending, however. She was a tremendously gifted storyteller, and I so look forward to reading her other works."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"Peony is a book of great detail and drama.

Due to traditions it is forbidden for Peony and David to wed. Now during the years as a servant by David's side Peony must try to resolve her love for him.Peony is a realistic fiction book that is full of tragedy and despair that keeps drawing you in with each chapter and page you turn.

The book is rather small -- no long, drawn-out story, but it communicates the story well, with a beautiful sort of grace.I felt I understood the culture better, and the characters were very real to me. Their story was touching. The ending, which is the type which normally would leave me feeling dissatisfied, did not. It's not the perfectly happy, romantical type ending, which I normally like, but instead it shows that even when the fairy tale does NOT come true, life can be blessed and well worth living.My children will read this one for sure."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"Pearl S. Buck's \\"Peony\\" is a lovely story that both touched me and informed me about an era of history of which I was unaware. The copy I found was a hardback published by the John Day Company in 1948; so I'm glad to see the story is currently in print. The story is an episodic tale that covers a number of years. Peony is a bondmaid that is apparently a well-treated slave. Buck's text discusses how her owners have the right to sell her, even separate spouses. Peony was sold by her parents as a baby and raised in one of the few Jewish households in China. As the Jewish families have blended with the Chinese, their Jewish identify has become less pure, eventually resulting in the abandonment of Judaism for Chinese philosophy. As Buck traces this, it is due to the welcoming nature of the Chinese whereas Jews in other parts of the world were separated and shunned. Through the wise Chinese merchant character of Kung Chen, Buck indicates that this is due to their own philosophy that theirs in the only God, which encourages their separation. The unrequited love of Peony for her master David and his development as he grows is quite beautiful. When Buck changes gears with the violence in Chapter VII, it happens so swiftly and abruptly that I felt literally stunned as a reader, unable to believe it had happened, much as one probably feels in life after a tragedy. As the story unfolds with David's marriage, the trip to Peking and the consequences of that visit, I found the ending strangely peaceful as Peony's love for David turns to a universal love for mankind. Peony is a masterful work 60 years after it was first published. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Peony","review":"I hadn't read anything from Pearl S. Buck since High School when I read the Good Earth. It was wonderful to read this book because I could step into the past and remember how much I loved her writting style.

Now I'm 52 and still haven't lost my wonderment of on finding out how people see life through the looking glass of a different culture.

The book is good, well-written, and enjoyable to read. I only wish that one of the points of tension had been something else - or that the family had been something besides Jewish. One of the major points of tension was whether or not David, the son of the family, would be able to take Peony as his concubine or as his second wife. Had the answer been that he could not take her as his second wife because she was a Gentile, it would have been accurate. However, David makes the statement, \\"In my religion - the religion, that is, of my people - a man is allowed only one wife.\\" That is not accurate. It is not known through the course of the story whether the family follows the Ashkenaz tradition or the Sephard, but it does not really matter as they are not living in Ashkenaz and, therefore, the One Wife Ruling does not apply. The One Wife Ruling was only for Ashkenazim living among Christians! Should one return to the Holy Land (prior to the re-establishment of Israel) or otherwise leave the lands of the Christians, the Rule no longer applied as long as both parties were in agreement. I don't think Kueilan, David's wife, would have taken issue to the second wife as in China it was common among the wealthy."},{"Title":"Peony","review":"Please dont read this.

One such tale is PHANTOM LADY wherein Scott Henderson is the hapless soul beleaguered by a dead wife, strangled with his own necktie, and by the police demanding to know his alibi. The only hope he has is the dim memory of a woman in a pumpkin colored hat complete with a huge feather he chatted with in a bar after the argument with his wife. But because he hasn't a name nor a description, other than the hat, the police aren't quick to believe him and when witnesses to their conversation all claim she was never there, his world spirals into an inexplicable nightmare.You won't find a suspense novel as tight, swift and dark as this around much anymore and read in the spectacularly reproduced original dust jacket art and meticulously recreated boards, the experience might only be matched if you were able to own an original gem. But then who could afford to? Much better to read this masterpiece as the facsimile!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Lady","review":"When you see an opening chapter of a book titled \`The Hundred and Fiftieth Day Before the Execution', as this one is, you get an immediate impression of what lies ahead, as well as a sense of inevitable doom. I found this to be a very clever method of piquing the interest, compelling me to read on.The man facing execution is Scott Henderson, and we meet him as the story opens when he picks up a girl in a bar based solely on her outrageous hat. For some reason he's in a foul mood and pays her little attention, even though he takes her out to dinner, a theatre show and then back to the bar. When he gets home to his apartment he is greeted by the police...and the body of his strangled wife. Things start getting really interesting from here on out.We find the story revolving around the careful recounting of Scott Henderson's movements on that night as he desperately tries to establish an alibi. As the title of the book suggests, the lady he was with that night has disappeared, leaving him in deep trouble. Chapter by chapter the clock ticks down building tension and adding an enormous feeling of desperation to the search. Three people, each of whom is willing to put themselves in danger to see that justice is served, conduct the search for that elusive alibi. Firstly, Henderson's girlfriend / mistress gets herself deeply involved, at times placing herself in extreme danger. The second person is an old school friend who Henderson calls, in the belief that he is the only person who would care enough to help. And thirdly, and most surprisingly, is the police officer that was instrumental in seeing Henderson convicted. He begins to hold grave misgivings about his guilt and provides the impetus behind their quest.Cornell Woolrich expertly weaves an exhausting tale as lead after lead is explored in an all out effort to save Scott Henderson's life. As can be expected, given the nature of the chapter titles, the story culminates in a nail-biting ending, making it a most satisfying reading experience."},{"Title":"The Phantom Lady","review":"I am making my way through noir writers, starting with one of each by Goodis, Gil Brewer, Peter Rabe and now Woolrich.

It also contains one of the most powerful single chapters I've ever read- a set piece in which a mysterious woman stalks a bartender simply by staring at him and following him until his nerves begin to crumble- which could stand alone as a short story superior to the novel as a whole. As a reading experience, this is a genuine treat, and the book itself- a faithful facsimile of the first edition- is beautiful to look at and a great pleasure to own. A bargain at the original price and a steal on sale. Thank you again, Otto Penzler."},{"Title":"The Phantom Lady","review":"'Phantom Lady' by Cornell Woolrich (as William Irish) is an extremely enjoyable pulp fiction read. While the author is known for his storytelling abilities rather than literay skills (prose/characterizations), and he has written plenty of shoddy and ridiculous stuff, 'Phantom Lady' is a classic page-turner. I personally rate this on par with his excellent 'Waltz Into Darkness' as his best (..or at least among the dozen Woolrich novels I've read, plus many more short stories).In 'Phantom Lady' we have a man wrongly accused of murder (of his wife) sitting on death row. The only person who can verify his alibi is a nameless and non-descript woman he shared an otherwise forgettable evening with. As the clock ticks towards his final hour we are entertained with a mad chase to find this woman. Believable? Let's just say it's all barely plausible, which was enough to keep this reader thoroughly entertained.Bottom line: a real treat for Woolrich fans. A must read."},{"Title":"The Phantom Lady","review":"This limited edition is absolutely gorgeous. The binding, printing and paper quality are superb.

I'm sure you can find the website using your favorite search engine (there's more than one, right?)"},{"Title":"The Phantom Lady","review":"Most novels and short stories authored by Cornell Woolrich are characterized by the use of finely honed suspense to induce in the reader a visceral, heart-pounding reaction. In Phantom Lady, Woolrich uses the impending execution of an innocent man to provide himself perfect narrative grist with which to make the element of suspense come alive.In many ways, Phantom Lady is the quintessential Cornell Woolrich novel. Not only is the overall storyline highly suspenseful, many of the individual chapters are richly suspense-laden in and of themselves. As always, Woolrich's exquisite command of the English language makes for cleverly evocative descriptions.Unfortunately, as is often the case in Woolrich's fiction, there is an almost willful disregard for plausibility. Minor holes in the plot can be forgiven when the writing is otherwise strong. But in the case of Phantom Lady, the explanation of the underlying mystery is so preposterous, Woolrich's considerable storytelling skill proves only partially redemptive.

Not pleasant, especially when you can find no one in the great city to vouch for your alibi! The police arrive, and their suggestion that you may be the culprit is enough to give you the creeps. And the police detective in charge happens to be a good friend from way back, who also does not seem convinced of your innocence. So, you have 24 hours to prove yourself and the clock keeps ticking into the moment when your life may very well be through! This great thriller/ noir author spun many hard boiled tales where the lead character seems guilty, and has to prove his innocence, a nice twist on the \\"innocent before proven guilty\\" idea on which our system is (supposedly) based.

I very much like Woolrich's writing style and have read a number Woolrich stories and a few of his novels as well. I am very much willing to tolerate somewhat implausible situtions and incredible coincidences for suspense, characters and atmosphere. But this novel is essentially a suspense thriller with a plot so unrealistic that it strains credibility. To make matters worse, unlike \\"Randezvous in Black\\", this is not Woolrich at his poetic best and the characters in \\"Phantom Lady\\" are simply not as compelling as his characters usually are. Having said that, this is still a good read, if you want a page turner above all else."},{"Title":"The Phantom Lady","review":"Five stars to Centipede Press for planning on publishing the full works of Cornell Woolrich. These five volumes make a worthy start and I only hope that Woolrich's greatest novel, Rendezvous in Black, comes soon, for I shall certainly buy it as I bought these. Quite apart from his output Woolrich was an interesting character in himself, almost like someone from one of his novels. I had read recently that he lived in a rather run-down hotel in NY with his mother, and kept a policeman's uniform in a trunk at the foot of his bed. He dressed in the uniform and walked the streets at night seeking \\"rough trade.\\" He died a miserable alcoholic in a wheelchair, mostly forgotten. As any perusal of ebay on any given day shows Woolrich's novels command insane and ridiculous prices with even cheap paperbacks going for nearly a hundred dollars. It is time that someone has brought some organization to the works, as Centipede clearly plans to do, battles with the estate aside. I did once come across a complete works published in South America (!!) but unfortunately not in English. This project will serve history. As another reviewer pointed out it is best to buy these from the publisher directly."},{"Title":"The Phantom Lady","review":"\\"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer\\"- a manipulative clich&eacute; that comes to light and helps make Cornell Woolrich's \\"Phantom Lady\\" an absolute noir classic.

Each chapter is titled \\"[Blank] Days Before the Execution,\\" creating an even greater sense of urgency. Woolrich knows how to successfully develop his characters to make them almost tangible; at times, you will want to shake one character out of frustration, and then hug him later out of glee. Each character, whether major or minor, holds captivating charisma that stays sharp throughout the entire work. Woolrich gives many of the minor characters accents that easily create a voice within your head, allowing you to truly become a part of the action. The plot keeps a steady pace, each different setting of an appropriate length that does not become droning. Woolrich's style also holds vivid imagery using the minimum number of words needed; his language is simple and direct. For those who cherish a strong, well-written, winding mystery, this is a novel for you. Woolrich's title as \\"America's Master of Suspense\\" is certainly not disappointed by this work, but only strengthened."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This novel, along with the two that precede it, are among the best fantasy fiction ever written.

The story itself is a step down from the adventure that is The Gods of Mars and fails to come close to the excellence of A Princess of Mars. That being said, this is still a fun story.Burroughs concludes his trilogy with a chase across Mars. The story picks up 6 months after The Gods of Mars. John Carter follows the kidnappers of his wife across river, desert, jungle, fortress and ice. The story itself is, as with all the Martian Trilogy, quite entertaining. However, this book cuts almost all the human interaction out that made the first two books the classics they are.I have read this book some ten times, and I still enjoy it. As I've grown older I have discovered many Sci Fi authors and stories, but none that enrapture my imagination like the original Martian Trilogy by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This is a must read for anyone who enjoyed the first two books, as it actually has a final conclusion."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs did not intended to write a trilogy, but his 1914 pulp novel &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; completes the story begun in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and continued in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and finally brings John Carter and his beloved Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium (i.e., no cliffhanger this time around, boys and girls). The story picks up six months after the conclusion of &quot;The Gods of Mars,&quot; with our hero not knowing whether she is dead or alive in the Temple of the Sun of the Holy Therns where he last saw here with the blade of Phaidor was descending towards her heart as the evil Issus, queen of the First Born, had locked his mate in a cell that would not open for another year. However, it turns out that the exiled leader of the Therns has reached the trapped women to rescue his daughter and to seek revenge on Carter for exposing his evil cult.The focus of &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; is on Carter's relentless pursuit of the villainous Thurid who have taken his beloved princess from the south pole of Barsoom across rivers, desert, jungles, and ice to the forbidden lands of the north in the city of Kadabra where the combined armies of the green, red and black races attack the yellow tribes of the north, thereby justifying the book's title. It is interesting to note that Carter's heroics in this novel have the same sort of over the top implausibility we find in contemporary Hollywood blockbusters as ERB pours on the action sequences one on top of another. Whether he is scaling towers in the dark of night or surviving in a pit for over a week without food and water, John Carter is a manly hero in the great pulp fiction tradition of which ERB was an admitted master. Overall, the Martian series is Burrough's best work, avoiding the repetition that overwhelmed his Tarzan series and providing a lot more creativity (ever play Martian chess?). There is also, Dejah Thoris, one of the great names in science fiction history."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"If I had to be stuck on a desert island with only ten books, the Barsoomian trilogy (Princess of Mars, Gods of Mars, and Warlord of Mars) would be three of them. Warlord wraps up the tale as Carter takes up the trail of the incomparable Dejah Thoris, following her captors to the hidden cities of the polar regions, culminating in a battle that settles the future of Barsoom. All the breathless adventure, daring swordplay, hairsbreadth escapes, and dry humor you could ask for. Even more in control of his material than in the other two excellent volumes, Burroughs challenges himself both to keep in the established material about Barsoom and still invent new elements. If you have not read the Barsoomian trilogy, and you love SF adventure, buy it NOW! You will re-read it with delight the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I will be 70 in three weeks and in that time I have never read any book or books by any writer that has ever held me \\" in the ready to defend myself while reading \\". I have many times while reading ERB books found myself at a point of feeling the excitement and the emotion of the moment, to the extent of having my hand knotted-up as if I were holding a sward and fighting for my life. He has such a way with words that he brings the moment alive in your mind. I love to read any of his books above any other writer. I have many other writers in my collection, but ERB is FIRST in my opinion.

No - I doubt even his most devoted fans would say so. Was he, in Mr. King's amusing phrase, a &quot;Great World Writer&quot;? Again, no - even the most forgiving literary critic probably wouldn't bestow that title upon him. Was he, however, a born storyteller with a (literally) wonderful imagination? That I don't think anyone would seriously argue.Burroughs' Martian novels, as I have said elsewhere, are great fun for both the the young and young at heart. Think Errol Flynn in outer space and you've got the basic idea. Escapist fiction doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This book was written in 1913 and is still being read today, in 2011. It lacks the punch it carried when written, everyone knows too much now about the conditions on Venus and Mars but when we read fantasy we set aside certain facts, Hence Burroughs writes as though the conditions on Mars are earthlike, except for gravity, permitting John Carter to be Superman for his day. Earth at that time gloried in war, although face to face combat was disappearing. But not so on Burroughs worlds, his hero John Carter gloried in his fighting ability, using antique weapons. The warriors of Venus and mars acknowledged his prowess and spread his fame all over. How then did Burroughs create tension, and hold interest? Carter's opponents were not his physical equals, so there were more of them. Also knowledge not known to Carter was available to them which they could exploit to their advantage and impede John Carter, Burroughs never let this knowledge be great enough to defeat Carter.So it was in Warlord of Mars. He sought his wife, the beautiful Dejah Thoris, so beautiful that she was stolen (kidnapped) and taken with some of the highest rulers of Mars to become their wife, not polyandrous, but one would prevail. So John sets out to foil their plans. He trails these men. Along the way he determines their purpose. He makes friends with various Martians, some piratical, some unknown to the other nations of Mars, but he unites them and unites Mars as much as possible given its warrior culture. If you like action there is a lot of fighting. Coincidences occur to allow the story to proceed but after all this is almost one hundred years ago, time enough for almost anything to happen. Frankly I read it for its old time appeal, or I should say reread it from seventy or eighty years ago.

It is a direct continuation of the first two in the series--\\"A Princess of Mars\\" and \\"The Gods of Mars\\"--and a reading of those earlier titles is absolutely essential before going into this one. Here, Carter tries to rescue his princess, Dejah Thoris, from the clutches of some particularly nasty villains. In his relentless pursuit, one that makes Indiana Jones look like a slacker, Carter travels from the south pole of Mars to the forbidden lands of the north. He encounters many varieties of monster, such as the apt and the sith, and gets into more fights and cliffhanging situations than a reader would believe could be packed into a mere 160 pages. The pace of the book is furious, never pausing for breath, and the final battle in the north polar city of Kadabra, in which the combined armies of Barsoomian green, red and black men attack the yellow tribes of the north, is thrilling in the extreme. What amazing films these first three John Carter novels would make, if done faithfully and with the requisite ... million thrown into each one!So why the 3-star rating? Well, there are numerous problems with the book that prevent me from giving it top grades, despite the fun I had reading it. For one, there are countless inconsistencies and implausibilities. For example, it is difficult for the reader to accept that Carter's enemies cannot recognize him, just because he has smeared some red tint over his skin. Difficult to believe that Carter is able to scale the side of a tower in the pitch black of night. Difficult to believe that Carter (or any man) could live in a pit for nine days without food and especially water. Verrry hard to believe that Thurid, Carter's archenemy, could carry the struggling captive princess over a foot-wide ledge without toppling into the abyss beneath. Impossible to believe that Dejah Thoris couldn't recognize Carter by his voice alone, despite his yellow-man disguise. All these are hard to swallow in the extreme. As for the inconsistencies: It is stated that Carter saved Thuvia from the Warhoons in book 2, when in actuality it was Carthoris, Carter's son. The city of Kaol is said to be rendered invisible by the forest that surrounds and tops it, but later it is stated that this forest is cut back from the city. Huh? Worst of all is the aforementioned tower-scaling scene, in which dusk becomes early afternoon in a matter of minutes. Here's something that Ed Wood would have appreciated! This day/night confusion is straight out of \\"Plan 9,\\" but for me is the hallmark of incredibly sloppy writing and even poorer copyediting. Further, Burroughs' descriptions of the Valley of the Therns, and its geographic proximity to the land of the First Born, are simply impossible to visualize. Throw in a bunch of misplaced modifiers and some awkward turns of phrase and you've got a real mess of a manuscript. So why did I have a tear in my eye by the book's end, when Carter gets his rewards and the entire city of Helium turns out to greet him? I guess that the power of storytelling can outweigh petty matters of consistency and grammar. And Burroughs WAS a great teller of tales, and this book IS as thrilling as they come."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Keeping in mind that much of the outer space and Mars-related science fiction in this book is far out-dated--almost comically so--Warlord of Mars is really a quite enjoyable book, even today. Edgar Rice Burroughs, perhaps more famously known as the creator of Tarzan, is the consummate story-teller. This is richly plotted fantasy with highly suspenseful action scenes; strong imagery; clearly defined characters; and an inexhaustible pool of creative names like Barsoom, Dejah Thoris, and the Therns, which sink into a reader's psyche and never wear away. Burroughs is one of the classic writers of yore, capable of putting their hero in one seemingly impossible predicament after another, yet managing to extricate them at the height of suspense by some clever trick every time. No matter how many times we read this stuff, it never gets old.The John Carter series is mandatory reading for all serious sci-fi buffs. And one should definitely read the first two books in the trilogy before taking on this third and final edition. Long live John Carter! --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"The title says it all. It's a great series, I just haven't had time to read it yet. Sorry for the useless review, I was just tired of looking at it pending."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"\\"Do you know where we are going?\\" she said.\\"To solve the mystery of the eternal hereafter, I imagine,\\" I replied.\\"I am going to a fate worse than that,\\" she said, with a little shudder.\\"What do you mean?\\"-- _The Gods of Mars_In a delightful article, \\"Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Fate Worse than Death,\\" Richard D. Mullen (1969-70) gives a detailed table of Edgar Rice Burroughs novels from 1911 through 1915. In them, he lists the times and circumstances in which a heroine is threatened with rape (the \\"fate worse than death\\") and how she is saved in the proverbial nick of time. (As you may know, an Edgar Rice Burroughs heroine is frequently unclothed but always pure and virtuous.) For those readers interested in such statistics, there are 76 cases recorded by Mullen.In _The Warlord of Mars_ (_Argosy_, 1913-14), there are at least three such incidents recorded for our moral edification. In each case, Dejah Thoris is the threatened heroine. In the first case, she is threatened by the yellow Martian king Salensus Oll (even his name is oily). In the second instance, she is kidnapped by the white Martian Matai Shang, his brave but ruthless daughter Phaidor, and the black Martian Thurid. And in the third case, she is menaced by a band of yellow Martians, who plan to preserve her \\"as a plaything for [the] nobles\\" (151).Mullen states that in each case, Dejah Thoris is rescued by the stalwart John Carter. This is certainly true of the first and third cases. But it is not strictly true in the second case. Carter certainly _attempts_ to save her, but he is not really very effective. It is disagreement and double-crossing among the villains that really preserves the honor of the Princess. (Burroughs heroines are frequently rescued by the hero, or they may save themselves. On rare occasions, the menacer may have a change of heart. Sometimes Providence-- in the form of lions, earthquakes, or passing pterodactyls-- may lend a hand.)All of the previous incidents occur in the latter chapters of the novel. But the sharp-eyed reader may have noted that I said that there were \\"at least three\\" fate-worse-than death scenarios in _Warlord_. There is in fact a fourth one as well, and it is truly remarkable. Near the end of chapter one, Matai Shang and Thurid, on friendier terms than they are at the close of the novel, are in a boat plotting how to make John Carter's life more miserable. Unbeknownst to them, Carter is following in another boat and listening to them. They have Dejah Thoris prisoner. Thurid generously allows Matai Shang first turn: \\"You shall have your way with her before another day has passed\\" (15). Carter refrains from slaying \\"the vile plotters\\" (16) only because they are the only ones who can lead him to Dejah Thoris. And then... _Matai Shang never gets around to having his way with the princess for the next twelve chapters_! This is not quite a record in Burroughs's novels. In _The Gods of Mars_, we learn that Thuvia has been a slave to the white Martians for 15 years without being molested. Still Dejah Thoris's good fortune is certainly worthy of comment.One final note. The female speaking in the quote above is _not_ a virtuous heroine. It is the imperious, willful, sometimes villainous Phaidor who will attempt to kill Dejah Thoris on several occasions. Perhaps some future Burroughs scholar will compile a list of Not So Nice Girls who are menaced by the fate worse than death."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I downloaded the book so that I will have something that I may want to read.

Read it at a time when there will be few interruptions because it is hard to put down (as the hero is almost always in mortal peril)"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs concluded John Carter's first cycle of adventures on Mars -- sometimes referred to as the Martian Trilogy -- with the serialized publication of The Warlord of Mars in 1913-1914. At the conclusion of the previous installment, The Gods of Mars, the future of John Carter's beloved princess Dejah Thoris was in grave doubt. Having proven that the centuries-old Martian worship of Issus was falsehood perpetuated by power-hungry members of the Holy Therns and the First Born races, Carter set about destroying the religious infrastructure in order to free Barsoom from the false promises of the Issus-worshippers, where devotion is repaid with slavery and violent death. But Carter's quest to spread the truth is not without a price, as in repayment for his actions Carter's enemies lock the one he holds most dear in the vault at the center of the Temple of the Sun -- a room that can only be accessed once per Martian year. Seconds before the door closed, Carter saw Dejah Thoris nearly stabbed by Phaidor, the daughter of the head of the Therns and his avowed enemy since he spurned her romantic overtures. Living with the torment of not knowing whether his beloved wife is alive or dead, Carter has worked furiously to discover a way to free Dejah from her prison -- but his enemies will do anything to get to her first and claim her as their own. Fighting men who have nothing to lose, Carter chases news of Dejah across Barsoom, confronting countless new enemies, challenges, and even climates in his single-minded quest to save his imprisoned wife.The Warlord of Mars is the slimmest of the first three volumes in Burroughs's John Carter of Mars series, but it is every bit as action-packed as its predecessors. Unlike the first two Carter novels, there is no prologue from Edgar Rice Burroughs, no preface to the following action from Carter to his \\"nephew\\" and guardian. The action opens a few months after Carter deposed the fake goddess Issus , with our hero deep in the throes of his search for a way to rescue the imprisoned Dejah and Thuvia, the latter a former Thern slave instrumental in aiding Carter when he returned to Mars in hostile territory at the beginning of the second novel. Whereas the previous novel saw Carter dealing essentially a death blow to the age-old Martian religion, exposing it as a cult, this follow-up adventure is largely concerned with the fall-out of that successful assault and sets up endless possibilities for future battle with the false religion's deposed leaders. Is there ever any question of Carter's ultimate success? No -- but that is part of the fun and magic of these books. Burroughs was a master craftig non-stop action sequences and building tension and suspense in his novels. Just when you think that surely Burroughs's imagination must be tapped out, he introduces new people, places, and customs to challenge Carter's seeming invincibility. Predictable? Sure, such is perhaps the nature of pulp fiction. But in the hands of a master like Burroughs, he proves that the journey is always a worthwhile and entertaining ride.John Carter's third Martian adventure is just as fast-paced a rollicking adventure ride as its predecessors, and serves as a fitting capstone to the first \\"trilogy\\" within the overall series. When he was first introduced in A Princess of Mars, Carter was a man without a country or purpose, forced to make his way in a wholly alien world. In The Gods of Mars, Carter returns to Barsoom after an absence of ten years, and has to fight to reclaim the life he built with Dejah Thoris's people. The Warlord of Mars brings Carter full circle, forcing him to fight for the life he wants on his new home, culminating in a rather touching recognition of Carter's place and the esteem in which he's held by his adopted countrymen and friends. Having never explored pulp fiction of this ilk until recently, I remain thorougly impressed by Burroughs's work and in no little awe of his standing as a trailblazer in the science-fiction world. Barsoom is peopled with colorful peoples of wildly varied cultures, fascinating landscapes, and never-ending posibilities for adventure and death-defying escapades.These novels are sheer fun from start to finish. I adore John Carter's completely over-the-top, unbelievable invincibility and his old-fashioned heroic charm. I love how much he adores Dejah Thoris -- it could be argued that he's the anti-James Bond, since Carter is just as ridiculously perfect and appealing to women, but he's very much a one-woman man, and his love story appeals to the old-fashioned romantic in me. :) Snappily plotted, well-written, imaginative, and endlessly adventurous, The Warlord of Mars confirms me as an avid John Carter fan, and happily there is no end in sight when it comes to exploring Burroughs's backlist. Barsoom and its people are a world I love getting lost in -- escapist entertainment of the highest order."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"It is just fun, that John Carter can come back to earth and tell his experiences on Mars and that go back to have more adventures."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This book (as part of the series) created the genre.

This is no Lord of the Rings but then again...it wasn't intended to be.The is a fun story with the universal theme of good vs evil. The protagonist really can't do any wrong and is always chasing/fighting for his woman (e.g Popeye).

The first three books were indeed intended as a trilogy, and were marketed as such in the early part of the 20th cenury, in &quot;THE ALL-STORY&quot; magazine. The fact that the first three books cover a continuous story, with a definite conclusion in this third book, also points to it being written a true trilogy. Please do not allow yourself to be confused by the fact that 7 (or 8) more &quot;John Carter&quot; novels succeeded this one."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This is the third book in the series of 11. It finds our hero, John Carter, awaiting the barsoomian year out, in hopes of finding Dejah Thoris still alive. This book has several twists and turns in it, as expected for those who read the first two books.Like the two books before this, the author has created a superb mix of science fiction and adventure. The fast moving action in this book did cause me to read it much quicker than I planned. Once I started, I had a difficult time putting the Kindle down to take a break. Rather than repeat what was in the other books, this one takes us further around Barsoom, and explores the polar regions. Along the way, John Carter managers to unite the various fighting tribes and cultures into a single force.Although these books were written almost a century ago, they are timeless. I constantly marvel at the author that imagined the possibility that earthlings were not the only inhabitants of the universe, before space travel was even remotely possible. Today, we have Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Gallactica and numerous other space travel shows to help generate the idea that we could travel to unknown planets in the future. For Edgar Rice Burroughs to have imagined the travel and characters he did was truly amazing, in my humble opinion. I believe only more time will tell us if he was correct in choosing Mars as a habitable planet.Upon completing this, the third book in the Princess of Mars/John Carter series, one could easily conclude the series is finished. This volume has a definite ending, unlike those first two books. Enjoy this book, but be warned, there are 8 more books in the series, to be read with joy and amazement."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I first read one of this series when a kid. I don't know how I came across it, but I was so fascinated that I read every one I could get from the library -- probably most of the series. That was a long, long time ago.I often thought of John Carter, and even started a book of my own based on similar principles. Nothing much came of it, except that my son and his friends would pass around and read each chapter as soon as I finished typing. I would sit with them and tell them about John Carter of Mars. They were very interested but, unfortunately, the local library did not stock any of the series.When I searched Burroughs on Amazon, I came across the John Carter series and felt as if I had found an old friend, missing for sixty years. I downloaded them and once again read every volume, almost straight through.Burroughs knew how to tell a story, and freed himself from the constraints of earth gave free rein to his imagination -- which never was that much tethered. A key attraction to Burroughs is that he feels no need to be politically correct. Even in his own time, much of his theories were out-of-date. His concepts of race, honor and merit cannot be expressed today, even in fiction. I suspect this is why the libraries do not make his books as available as they should be.I particularly think these books make good reading for young teenage boys. Some would object to the racial overtones, but these are part of the plot. Mainly, Burroughs teaches honor, bravery and loyalty -- traits that are considered quaint and antiquated today.This is the last of the series, and should be read last. Once done, you may feel as I do, having rediscovered an old friend."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Book Three of the John Carter of Mars series is an exciting story.

Mystic space travel, mysterous immortal person, lots of sword fighting, and some very wierd aliens. Very fun to teh point of being silly."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Barsoom100 Years ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing stories of John Carter and Mars. 100 Years later, people are still thrilled to read the books that came from these stories. I have seen one movie made from this series, and it wasn't that good. Now, Disney has gone all out to film \\"John Carter\\". Yes, there will be differences in the film as opposed to the book. But from what I have seen, there are many characters in the movie that I feel I know personally. I am looking forward to seeing this film like no other that I can remember.I first read the second and third of these books when I was just a kid more than 45 years ago. I had no idea, at the time, that there was a third book in the original trilogy. I eventually bought a \\"two-in-one\\" hard copy (from a book club) of what I thought was the only two books in the series (The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars). I read that book so many times that I had to apply glue to the spine a few times to keep pages from falling out.A great many years later, I was in a book store and decided to look for copies of the book that I had bought and loved as a boy, as my copy was getting pretty worn. Imagine my surprise when I saw a shelf full of the tales of John Carter and Mars.I was thrilled about finding that there was a book that predated the two that I had, and I strained my bank account when I found the rest of the series on the same shelf. I bought every book in the series that day.1 - A Princess of Mars2 - The Warlord of Mars3 - The Gods of Mars4 - Thuvia, Maid of Mars5 - The Chessmen of Mars6 - The Master Mind of Mars7 - A Fighting man of Mars8 - Swords of Mars9 - Synthetic Men of Mars10 - Llana of Gathol11 - John Carter of MarsSince then, I have read and reread those books a great many times.The books I bought way back then still have a lot of life in them after all these years. After I read the entire series, I wrap them in plastic wrap and put them in a drawer beside my bed. Every few years, I get them out and read them again. You just can't beat a classic.One would hope that with the new movie coming out that Ballantine will maybe offer a complete set of these books. I know that I will be one of the first to buy them if they do.And yes, I still have that very first book that I bought when I was a very young man a great many years ago. :-)"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I felt really good while reading the third book and I really loved the ending. Somehow the adventures managed to stay fresh even when they were outwardly the same. (Even though John Carter gets thrown into yet another dungeon, his experience and rescue is original.) I really liked the description of a camera that could take a picture and have five copies arrive at five different places that are all far away! I can't imagine anyone reading the first two books and not following them with this one but I'll make it formal: I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I'm a fan of Burroughs and the Mars series, but I can't give this book five stars. One of Burroughs great strengths is his sense of drama, and his ability to make fantastic heroes believable.But in Warlord of Mars, he goes just a bit overboard. Coincidence as a major plot device was always one of ERB's weaknesses. In Warlord nary an event goes by that isn't influenced in a major way by unlikely coincidence. Because his books are so much fun, we forgive him for this. But it just happens too often in Warlord, and it detracts from the book.Still, this is a fun read, and a must read after the first two books, because you are going to have to follow through to see when and how John Carter and Dejah Thoris finally are reunited. We meet a new Barsoomian race, and have a final confrontation with villains we first met in \\"The Gods of Mars\\". Its nonstop action from start to finish, and introduces what was undoubtedly one of the first, if not the first, \\"dungeon crawls\\" in fantasy literature.Warlord concludes the opening trilogy of John Carter and Dejah Thoris. Warlord is in the public domain, so make sure to get the free Kindle edition, or download it for free also from Operation Gutenberg's web site."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"John Carter starts out mourning the loss of his beloved Dejah Thoris, trapped by some bad guy at the end of the last book with an evil tempered competitor for John Carter's affections. Our hero chases his beloved from one pole of Barsoom to another, encounters another race of Mars, the yellow men, and kills, cliff-hangs, occasionally stumbles, and eventually rescues his princess.On the one hand, only one new race was introduced in this book, the yellow men, to compliment the green, red, white, and black men (and I'm limiting it to sentients). This is a little disappointing, as his average is down, but some of the monsterous creatures introduced, like the sith (lower case to distinguish them from the Sith ofStar Wars Prequel Trilogy), are very impressive and add to the story.Like all of the Barsoom stories, \\"Warlord of Mars\\" has the values of a different era. These are not self-rescuing princesses, everyone recognizes John Carter's Earthly superiority, combat is recognized as a viable approach to problem solving, and so forth. But the series is free of the sarcasm, irony, and self-righteousness that are hallmarks of contemporary fiction. These books have an authenticity that has been lost in an era of over-sensitivity and pessimism.Leave critical thought and excessive sensitivity on the porch, go on to Barsoom and enjoy.E. M. Van Court"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This is one of the best of the entire series of 11 books. I read the entire series myself as a boy of 15. I decided to read it to my 11-year-old son as a father-son bedtime story activity. We just finished Llana of Gathol. This book had the drama, action, and adventure that my son and I will remember together for a lifetime. You certainly would want to read the first books in the series ('Princess of Mars' and 'Gods of Mars') prior to this one. Warlord gives you the continuity of the first two books in the full ERB style. By the time you get to Warlord you're ready for a conclusion to John Carters adventurous rescue of his prized desire, Dejah Thoris. This is the culmination of what feels like unending high (and sometimes over the top) adventure resulting in John Carters ultimate recognition as Warlord.

This one is easily as good as the first two. Since these were written a full century ago (A Princess of Mars - book one - was published in 1912) some of the terminology is a bit antiquated and certainly what we now know about Mars quickly puts the kibosh on any of the terrain or life forms described in the story; But probably then, as now, the reader should enjoy these stories as fun, escapist romps, and not worry so much about the details, and in that I was successful.I have a heck of a time tracking down good physical copies of these books to read, so it may be awhile until I arrive at book four - but make it I shall. Very enjoyable, I suppose I should get around to some Tarzan as well.Also, if you are fan of this style of book, I highly recommendSpace Vulture."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"The Warlord of Mars++++++++++++ caution contains what some might construe as spoilers++++++++++++++++++The Warlord of Mars is a science fiction novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the third of his famous Barsoom series followingThe Gods of Mars (Townsend Library Edition). Burroughs began writing it in June, 1913, going through five working titles; Yellow Men of Barsoom, The Fighting Prince of Mars, Across Savage Mars, The Prince of Helium, and The War Lord of Mars.The finished story was first published in All-Story Magazine as a four-part serial in the issues for December, 1913-March, 1914. It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in September, 1919This novel continues where the previous one in the series, The Gods of Mars abruptly ended. At the end of the previous book, John Carter's wife, the princess Dejah Thoris, is imprisoned in the Temple of the Sun by the vile pretender goddess Issus. It is said one has to wait an entire Barsoomian year before the room the prisoner is in revolves back to the entranceJohn Carter discovers that a First Born knows the secret of the Temple of the Sun and he and the Holy Hekkador Matai Shang want to rescue the Holy Thern's daughter, who is imprisoned with Dejah Thoris and another Barsoomian princess, Thuvia of Ptarth. John Carter follows them in the hope of liberating his beloved wife. His antagonists flee to the north, taking the three women along. Thereafter John Carter follows them untiring into the north polar regions where he discovers more fantastic creatures and ancient, mysterious Martian races. These he overcomes in battle, and is later proclaimed \\"Warlord of Barsoom\\" by his allies. This book is the last to feature Tars Tarkas, John Carter's ally, in any major role; indeed, the green Barsoomians of whom Tars Tarkas is an oligarch disappear altogether from most of the later novels.Characters* John Carter: Protagonist of the first three novels. Carter is an American Civil War veteran, transported to the planet Mars by a form of astral projection. There, he encounters both formidable alien creatures and various waring Martian races, wins the hand of Martian princess Dejah Thoris, and rises to the position of Warlord of Mars.* Dejah Thoris: A Martian Princess of Helium, who is courageous, tough and always holds her resolve, despite being frequently placed in both mortal danger and the threat of being dishonored by the lust of villains. She is the daughter of Mors Kajak, jed of Lesser Helium and granddaughter of Tardos Mors, jeddak of Helium; highly aristocratic; and fiercely proud of her heritage. She is the love interest of John Carter. She was imprisoned by the Martian false deity Issus, at the end of The Gods of Mars. A central character in the first three Barsoom novels, whose capture by various enemies, and subsequent pursuit by John Carter, is a constant motivating force in these tales.* Tars Tarkas: A Green Martian, who becomes the ally of John Carter and at his behest, the overlord of his clan. An archetypal noble savage, and considered John Carter's first and closest friend upon Barsoom.* Thuvia of Ptarth: A Princess of Ptarth, who appears in The Gods of Mars as a slave girl rescued by John Carter from the Therns. She is later imprisoned with Carter's wife Dejah Thoris, in a prison which can only be opened once per year and remains by her side until the conclusion of The Warlord of Mars. Like many of Burroughs' heroines, she is tough, courageous, proud, and strongly identified with her aristocratic position in Martian society.Burroughs vision of Mars was loosely inspired by astronomical speculation of the time, especially that of Percival Lowell, who saw the planet as a formerly Earthlike world now becoming less hospitable to life due to its advanced age, whose inhabitants had built canals to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. [ Lowell was influenced by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, who in 1878, had observed features on Mars he called canali (Italian for \\"channels\\"). Mistranslated of this into English as \\"canals\\" fueled belief the planet was inhabited. The theory of an inhabited planet with flowing water was disproved by data provided by Russian and American probes such as the two Viking missions which found a dead, frozen world where water could not exist in a fluid stateA million years before the narrative commences, Mars was a lush world with oceans. As the oceans receded, and the atmosphere grew thin, the planet has devolved into a landscape of partial barbarism; living on an aging planet, with dwindling resources, the inhabitants of Barsoom have become hardened and warlike, fighting one another to survive. Barsoomians distribute scarce water supplies via a worldwide system of canals, controlled by quarreling city-states. The thinning Martian atmosphere is artificially replenished from an \\"atmosphere plant\\".RaceThe world of Barsoom is divided by the territory of White, Yellow, Black, Red and Green skinned races. Each has particular traits and qualities, which seem to define most individuals within them. This concept of race is more like a division between species than ethnicity.The Warlord of Mars introduces the Yellow Martians, supposedly extinct, whom John Carter finds in secret domed cities at the poles. They are black-bearded, exceptionally cruel, and keep slaves, acquiring these by using a giant magnetic device which sends fliers off course, and allows the Yellow Martians to capture the occupantsNumerous novels and series by others were inspired by Burroughs' Mars books: the Radio Planet trilogy of Ralph Milne Farley; the Mars and Venus novels of Otis Adelbert Kline; Almuric by Robert E. Howard; Warrior of Llarn and Thief of Llarn by Gardner Fox; Tarzan on Mars, Go-Man and Thundar, Man of Two Worlds by John Bloodstone; the Michael Kane trilogy of Michael Moorcock; The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, Through the Gates of the Silver Key by H.P. Lovecraft, the Gor series of John Norman; the Callisto series and Green Star series of Lin Carter; The Goddess of Ganymede and Pursuit on Ganymede by Mike Resnick; and the Dray Prescot series of Alan Burt Akers (Kenneth Bulmer). In addition, Leigh Brackett, Ray Bradbury, Andre Norton, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and Alan Dean Foster show Burroughs' influence in their development of alien cultures and worlds.A. Bertram Chandler's pulp novels The Alternate Martians and The Empress of Outer Space overtly borrow a number of characters and situations from Burroughs' Barsoom series.Robert A. Heinlein's novelsGlory Roadand , and Alan Moore's graphic novels of Allan and the Sundered Veil and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II directly reference Barsoom.In Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer's World of Tiers series (1965-1993) Kickaha, the seriThe Number of the Beastes' adventurer protagonist, asks his friend The Creator of Universes to create for him a Barsoom. The latter agrees only to make an empty world, since \\"It would go too far for me to create all these fabulous creatures only for you to amuse yourself by running your sword through them.\\" Kickaha visits from time to time the empty Barsoom, complete with beautiful palaces in which nobody ever lived, but goes away frustrated.L. Sprague de Camp's story \\"Sir Harold of Zodanga\\" recasts and rationalizes Barsoom as a parallel world visited by his dimension-hopping hero Harold Shea. De Camp accounts for Burroughs' departures from physics or logic by portraying both Burroughs and Carter as having a tendency to exaggerate in their storytelling, and Barsoomian technology as less advanced than usually presented.Furthermore, his Viagens Interplanetarias series of novels and short stories, especially those set on Krishna, one of Tau Ceti's inhabited planets, owe much to the premise of feudal co-existence alongside advanced technology pioneered within the Barsoom series.In 1989 Larry Niven and Steven Barnes published \\"The Barsoom Project\\", where a futuristic form of live action role-playing games (LARPs) is based on the Barsoom books.The Mars-based novels of Kim Stanley Robinson (published from 1992 to 1999) also offer several nods in Burroughs' direction.The 2008 novel In the Courts of the Crimson Kings by S.F. writer S. M. Stirling is an alternate telling of the Princess of Mars story but this time the princess is a very powerful character indeed.DC Comics character Adam Strange's method of transportation, the Zeta Beam, recalls the way Carter is transported to Mars.In the Commonwealth Saga novels by Peter F. Hamilton a group of humans who undertake unprecedented and often illegal genetic modifications of their own bodies are known as the Barsoomians, in apparent reference to Burroughs' creation.Richard Corben's Den series also appears to be inspired by the Barsoom series. It features a hero, Den, who mysteriously arrives naked on a (largely) desert planet where he becomes a great warrior and where the humanoids wear no clothes. Many of the creatures resemble the description of the white apes of the Gods of Mars. Like John Carter, he also receives great physical prowess from arriving in Neverwhere, although Carter's prowess stems from gravity, whereas Den undergoes a complete physical transformation.In Stephen King's novel The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three, Eddie Dean compares the All-World and the quest for the Dark Tower to a Barsoom novel.The John Carter of Mars series was also felt to be one of the inspirations for the Dark Sun Dungeons & Dragons game world setting.In A Wizard of Mars by Diane Duane, the main character Kit is a major fan of the Barsoom series and a long dormant wizard artifact recreates Barsoom as Kit imagines it to communicate with him.I highly recommend this book and series to 12 -18 year olds who enjoy swashbuckling adventures and tales of derring-do.Gunner March, 2012"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"ERB continues his epic adventure of John Carter into the Gods of Mars. Great illiteration and storytelling makes for a great read...start at the beginning and keep on going...on to Warlords of Mars"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs did not intended to write a trilogy, but his 1914 pulp novel &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; completes the story begun in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and continued in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and finally brings John Carter and his beloved Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium (i.e., no cliffhanger this time around, boys and girls). The story picks up six months after the conclusion of &quot;The Gods of Mars,&quot; with our hero not knowing whether she is dead or alive in the Temple of the Sun of the Holy Therns where he last saw here with the blade of Phaidor was descending towards her heart as the evil Issus, queen of the First Born, had locked his mate in a cell that would not open for another year. However, it turns out that the exiled leader of the Therns has reached the trapped women to rescue his daughter and to seek revenge on Carter for exposing his evil cult.The focus of &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; is on Carter's relentless pursuit of the villainous Thurid who have taken his beloved princess from the south pole of Barsoom across rivers, desert, jungles, and ice to the forbidden lands of the north in the city of Kadabra where the combined armies of the green, red and black races attack the yellow tribes of the north, thereby justifying the book's title. It is interesting to note that Carter's heroics in this novel have the same sort of over the top implausibility we find in contemporary Hollywood blockbusters as ERB pours on the action sequences one on top of another. Whether he is scaling towers in the dark of night or surviving in a pit for over a week without food and water, John Carter is a manly hero in the great pulp fiction tradition of which ERB was an admitted master. Overall, the Martian series is Burrough's best work, avoiding the repetition that overwhelmed his Tarzan series and providing a lot more creativity (ever play Martian chess?). There is also, Dejah Thoris, one of the great names in science fiction history."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs covers vast expanses of Barsoomian territory in John Carter's whirlwind pursuit of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The gentle pokes in the eye at religion, evolution, science, and even racism continue but do not impede the readability of the story. Burroughs demonstrates his superb grasp of story-telling and the construction of adventure settings with a flair unsurpassed by any other writer of the 20th century.Carter finds himself charging headline into a myterious northern world where ancient and legendary yellow men have survived in the harshest Barsoomian environment imaginable. Coincidentally, in classic Burroughsian fashion, Carter uncovers an incredible weapon which could destroy the fragile alliance of Barsoomian nations he has assembled in his long battle with the evil Therns.The first three books of the John Carter series (A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and The Warlord of Mars) foreshadow the most breath-taking adventures that role-playing gamers could imagine three generations after ERB wrote these stories. These books also provide a glimpse into one of the most amazing and detailed worlds of fantasy and space opera ever to see publication. It's hard to imagine how anyone who loves action adventure, swashbuckling stories could go wrong in purchasing these books."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"It starts with a chase that doesn't slow down until the very end.In this third of many tales that occur on Barsoom (Mars), John Carter is hunting down his beloved princess, Dejah Thoris and Thuvia, Maid of Mars.Just barely over 100 pages, this is yet another quick, enjoyable read in the Sword and Planet subgenre of Science Fiction. Having read all but two of the Martian Tales of ERB I felt a bit too much Dejah Vu, if you catch my meaning. Indeed it makes one wonder why and how these women manage to get captured so frequently.There are a few notable moments to be had. I especially liked the brief encounter of John Carter with Torkar Bar and the scene in the appropriately named Pit of Plenty.There are also a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of the STAR WARS movies. The land of Okar reminded me at times of Hoth, with its cave creatures. Also the scene before John Carter is cast into the Pit reminded me a little of Jabba's palace with Princess Leia.John Carter himself comes across as a very strange character indeed. On the one hand he is clumsy enough to sneeze at the most inopportune moments, fails to realize why his Princess can't recognize him and completely forgets about things lurking behind curtains that he just spotted a moment before.On the other hand, Luck seems to favor John Carter in that despite some of these fumbles, he always manages to get out of a bind.It's hard to criticize these tales for what they are--Science Fiction of the light, buttery, fluffy popcorn variety--but just once I'd like to see John Carter get into a truly nasty situation.One where he may not even come out physically and mentally unscathed."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Burroughs' creative peak was clearly in the timeframe when he wrote this. He had begun three of his four primary series and was rapidly gaining fame and fortune because of his breathtaking tales of adventure and romance. This displays no flagging of his creative juices. Burroughs takes Carter from one end of Mars to the other with some amazing creations on display in the interim. Here Carter has matured and but for two slips, betrays none of the stupidity usually associated with pulp heroes. (Unfortunately Burroughs made up for Carter's intelligence in later books by having Gahan of Gathol and Tan Hadron of Hastor become just shy of braindead.) With all the wonders on display in the book, though, one major flaw shines through: the ending. For those who have not read the book, you may want to look away at this point. Right after a spectacular extended fight scene which must leave the reader breathless, Burroughs has Carter face Thurid and Matai Shang in what one would expect to be the tour de force finale when good conquers evil and makes all well in the world. Only--well, it doesn't quite happen. Thurid and Matai Shang are running like scared rabbits when Carter catches them just as they turn against each other. Then someone else saves the day. Why Burroughs ended the book this way will always mystify me unless he really felt the butchery Carter would wreak on these two villains would offend sensibilities. The bloody deaths of both Thurid and Matai Shang at Carter's hands would have made for a great passage in the book. Instead, a literal deus ex machina appears to rescue our superman hero. If not for this anticlimactic scene, the book would deserve five stars. Ah, well..."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs novels have been handed down to me from my father who received them from his father. I just wanted to let readers know that around the age of 15 or so, I read all of Buroughs' novels. From the Tarzan stories to Carson of Venus to John Carter and Mars to the westerns to everything. Even though you can see the similiarities in all in how they were written with the same segments, I thought all the books were fascinating and well done. Considering the fact that these were written as early as 1900, the stories of Mars and Venus show the brilliance of Rice Burroughs. Lets not forget about David Ins ( i believe that was his name ) and the stories of the earths core. Burroughs was well ahead of his time and I am greatful that I was able to enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"First written in 1914, this series of John Carter novels is perhaps the start of the science fiction writing about Mars. Ray Bradbury traces his Martian Chronicles to reading these as a child. This is high on action and around every turn there is a life-threatening event across the Barsoom landscape. John Carter \\"the prince of Helium\\" must fight with his beloved \\"pet\\" Woola, \\"As large as a Shetland pony, with hideous head and frightful fangs, he was indeed an awesome spectacle, as he crept after me on his ten short, muscular legs; but to me he was the embodiment of love and loyalty\\". One review called John Carter \\"a natural man\\", which seems appropriate. There is the undying love for Dejah Thorus and the final sly \\"Why not?\\" as he draws her close after the triumphs. Carter is a man of courage, and that word spoken from an unknown ally, leads him out of the tortuous Pit of Plenty. This might be considered the third of the trilogy started with \\"A Princes of Mars\\" and continued with \\"The Gods of Mars\\", but in fact there were 7 more John Carter stories."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"The series has great action and imagination.

Once again Burroughs does a terrific job of world building, creating another wonderfully detailed landscape. Inhabiting the polar regions are once again well developed and complex peoples with interesting cultures, heritages, traditions and histories. Punctuating the suspenseful story are great battles of epic scale and heroism befitting Burroughs' noble and honorable John Carter.Reading Gods of Mars is necessary to fully enjoy Warlord of Mars as the two form a complete story.

I first read this two volume work in the summer of 1981, and became immediately enthralled with both the subject matter and Smith's elegant but approachable writing style.&quot;A New Age Now Begins&quot; will reignite the reader's appreciation for the struggles our Founding Fathers confronted to birth a new nation. Today, at the close of The American Century, it is easy to assume that we have always been pre-eminent in the world. But this book confirms what a near miss it really was, and how--without the selfless leadership of George Washington, the wise and witty guiding hand of Benjamin Franklin, the scholarly and erudite arguments for America's legitimacy from James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, the elegant pen and clear voice of Thomas Jefferson, and the fearless voice of agitation from Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry--the America we all take for granted today might well still be subject to the Crown of England.At nearly 2,000 pages, the book is an undertaking. But it will be one of the most rewarding and entertaining reading experiences you will ever undertake!"},{"Title":"Statements : True Tales of Life, Love, and Credit Card Bills","review":"This whole idea of this book is what caught my attention, and I was pleased to see it did not disappoint. I appreciated the humor, all very well done, and I'm sure women will relate to the whole single-woman perspective. As a guy, I appreciate that the author manages to cover dating ground others have walked on in a fresh way and without crossing the line into man-bashing. In fact, in several stories, she seems very sympathetic to guys, but still manages to have enough edge to get you laughing or, in some cases, just thinking to yourself, \\"Hey, I never thought of it that way.\\"She has a couple of references to why women shouldn't buy guys expensive gifts, and I naturally take exception to that (LOL). As someone who goes to whichever barber can fit me in, I found the piece on the angst she had trying to \\"break up\\" with her longtime hairstylist a little over the top, but in the good, extreme way that's characteristic of all good comedy. She says in the dedication that her accountant was the one who advised her to save her Amex statements, but don't be scared off by the accountant reference. This is anything but dry, financial stuff. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Statements : True Tales of Life, Love, and Credit Card Bills","review":"This is a very entertaining book and, in many instances you don't really need to know exactly what was charged to enjoy the story. The items charged are merely a way to lead in to something the author remembered, a fun adventure from her real life recalled when she examined her old Amex bills. The book is not arranged chronologically, and since each story or funny essay can be read independently, it's great if you want to read a few pages at a time without losing any flow. I liked that even though it's about all the items and meals and other things she purchased, she doesn't come across as a shopaholic type. I'm not into Manolo shoes, and I could relate since she shops at places like Macy's (though a few other purchases seemed a little splurgey). But as I already mentioned, the shopping is a small part. It's about a young single woman trying to find love and trying to find herself. If this sounds like you, you will thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Statements : True Tales of Life, Love, and Credit Card Bills","review":"It seems like Amy Borkowsky has found a new art form. Instead of having to go to all the work of keeping a journal, writing things down, forgetting where you put the damn thing. And so on, you just find the things around you that are keeping records and use that as the basis for a book.What she does here is use the records on her American Express statement to jog her memory into what was behind that expense. She does a lot better at this than I do, I look at the statement and wonder 'what the hell did I buy from WalMart for $39.76.Just one example is her reflections on the Starbuck bills. Her doctor tells her that too much caffine can aggravate a migraine, and especially a kind migraine that feels like you're being stabbed in the head with an icepick.Reporting to her mother.'What if, God forbid, you're walking alone at night and someone stabs you in the back of the head with an icepick? How would you know? When you should be yelling: Help Police, you'll be calmly asking passersby, Excuse me, do you have a Tylenol?

Read it. Loved it. A quick, really fun read with some great stories that grew out of what the author found when she looked back on her American Express bills. Stories that stand out are the one where she charged a pair of underwear to throw at a Tom Jones concert (hilarious), all the dating pieces ( like when she ordered chicken soup to deliver to her sick boyfriend and he freaked), and the section where she talks about all the Chinese food she's eaten over time and makes some hilarious observations (like why do we all know what dishes the Chinese have for dinner or lunch, but we had no idea what they eat for breakfast? And her guesses on why you never see a woman delivering Chinese food). The only negatives were that it could have been a little longer, and since I've always looked at my charge bills and thought how they remind me about where I ate, who I ate with, etc., I'm just sorry someone beat me to this."},{"Title":"Statements : True Tales of Life, Love, and Credit Card Bills","review":"Garrison Keillor has his Lake Wobegon; Dave Berry has his \\"I'm not making this up!\\"; dooce.com has intestinal distress, and Amy Borkowsky in her book \\"Statements\\" has American Express. As the cover of the book says, \\"She was too busy to keep a diary... Luckily AmEx kept one for her.\\"Using what she claims are her American Express statements for the past several years and actually including lines from those statements, Borkowsky treats us to the adventures of a single thirty-something ad copywriter turned comedienne. This book is the hardbound equivalent of a chick-flick so some guys may not be able to relate but there's enough cute situations and humor that it is worth trying.An example in one of her tales is her wanting (as an adult woman) what she had always wanted as a little girl and had never gotten. She writes \\"Every birthday and ever Chanukah throughout my childhood I'd beg for one, and each year I'd get the same thing. Underwear. Fine for warming buns but totally useless for baking cakes.\\"There are plenty of credits on her American Express statements along with the charges. As she states in the chapter called Returns: I have my own Return Policy: if I happen into a store with a policy that \\"All Sales Are Final,\\" I won't return there. Closet space and money are too scarce. She even had the balls to charge a ticket to France on the Concorde to meet eligible men in the elegant Concorde airport lounge.

The book is small enough to conveniently carry around every day. It is not a textbook as the author notes. However, it contains 3 sections including General Principles of Substance Use Disorders, Substance Review (which covers every drug that any counselor will need to know about, including \\"club drugs\\", nicotine, etc.), and Substance Use Treatment. There are a number of appendices which include copies of screening examinations such as the CAGE, AUDIT, MAST, CIWA-Ar, CINA. There are also lists of published resources, certification boards, and useful websites.Throughout this highly readable book there are very helpful clinical vignettes, as well as Key Points and Notes made by the author which enhance one's understanding of the topic being discussed. There are charts and graphs, lists of which questions to ask, etc.As a clinician in a very busy Level One Trauma Center I have found this book to be invaluable. I know of none better, and if any readers do please enlighten me/us as we are always looking for helpful books such as these. Dr Gitlow has done a remarkable job of pullling together much information in a format that is quite user friendly, and reasonably priced as well. I give this guide my highest endorsement and will certainly continue to utilize it almost daily while awaiting a second addition when the time is right to release a new edition..."},{"Title":"Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide","review":"This amazing little handbook is the perfect quick reference for nurses, physicians, and drug abuse counselors. Thank you, Dr. Gitlow."},{"Title":"Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide","review":"I was looking for a book to help me study for a certifying exam by the American Board of Addictions Medicine, and the recommended textbook, weighing in around 12 pounds, was too big to carry around. So I picked up Gitlow's text, small enough to fit in most pockets, fully expecting it to be nothing more than a dry, expository, compilation of facts that I could memorize in the service of exam prep. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out Gitlow's \\"Practical Guide\\" is not written as an exam prep at all, but rather a wryly humorous, systematic, and clinically wise overview of addictions, addictive substances, and their treatment. It is rich with clinical vignettes, insightful analyses of research findings, and lively discussion of legal and ethical issues surrounding treatment of substance abusers.Gitlow's style is clever and pithy. For example, after discussing the state of 'evidence-based' studies in the field of substance abuse, he argues not for a principle of \\"evidence-based practice\\" but rather for \\"practice-based evidence\\". He helps the practitioner to understand the addict on a much deeper level than how much alcohol, how often, and for how many years. Consider this nearly meditative passage on the author's attempt to fathom the death grip of addiction, from the chapter on \\"Spirituality\\": \\"Why any of my patients would trade a warm home, good meal, loving family, well-paying job, and physical health for vomiting blood in the gutter staggered my imagination. The action appeared worse than the depressive's suicide since its agony was repetitive, diverse, and often stretched over decades. Such punishment would have been more than enough to change the course of action of even a paramecium -- but not my patients.\\" The only other authors in this field with such a gift for writing that I know of are George Vaillant (The Natural History of Alcoholism Revisited) and perhaps Craig Nakken (The Addictive Personality).The book is divided into three sections: General Principles; Review of Specific Substances; and Treatment. Individual chapters mostly run from 8 to 12 pages, so it is easy to read one or more chapters in a single sitting. The breadth and depth of the author's knowledge and experience is nothing short of Brobdingnangian. He even manages to discuss the familiar \\"C.A.G.E.\\" screening tool in a novel and interesting manner. If there are any shortcomings at all in the book, it is perhaps in two areas: (1) mechanisms of action of a number of substances and medications are given short, or no, discussion (e.g., the mechanism of action caffeine is not discussed at all, and the the mechanism of action of varenicline and any number of other medications is only vaguely and incompletely discussed). And (2) Gitlow seems unfairly opinionated against the use of medications to treat substance abuse; to explain why would be a bit longish for this forum, but in brief, he posits that reducing the amount or frequency of drinking, which medicines can help accomplish, is in no way tantamount to moving an addict into a state of recovery, which is the goal of treatment. Perhaps a new edition of this invaluable guide, which is now nearly 7 years old, will show some evolution in Dr. Gitlow's position on the role of medications in treating these challenging disorders.I would recommend this book without qualification to all practitioners wishing to increase their competence in the field of substance use disorders."},{"Title":"Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide","review":"What a great book! Finally, a readable, accurate guide--perfect for any medical clinician, his/her patients or the lay public. Dr. Gitlow uses interesting clinical vignettes to illustrate issues that are traditionally very tough to understand.

Whether used as a reference guide or as a textbook, it will serve as a standard in the industry for years to come. No interested party should be without a copy!! Thanks Dr. Gitlow!"},{"Title":"Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide","review":"Information in book is very valuable.

What greater recommendation do you need?But beware. This book is not for sub-master players. You might still enjoy it, but following along will be challenging.Strangely, there are tons of diagrams, nearly 500 for only 24 games. Normally, I would expect lots of diagrams for a beginner's book, but this is for advanced players. Well, it turns out that the diagrams ALWAYS go with the move immediately preceding, not necessarily the bold-faced game move. Seirawan has diagrammed the variations! Once you get used to this, it's actually a great boon. It means that a player advanced enough to understand the variations can read this book without a board.However, I am only about 1500, and I simply cannot follow Mr. Seirawan without a chess board. I'm not sure I can follow him at all. The variations are much more extensive than in his Winning Chess Brilliancies, which I highly recommend to intermediate players.Do not buy this book to learn chess strategy. You won't. Buy it for the dramatic history of the match. Buy it to have some fun seeing the relative strengths and weaknesses of these 2 great players. Buy it for serious study. And buy my copy from me, because it's way over my head."},{"Title":"Five Crowns","review":"Simply put, this is one of the finest chess books of all time. Yasser Seirawan analyses all the games of the 1990 New York/Lyon World Championship Match between Gary Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov, two of the greatest players ever. The deeply annotated games bring to the reader the creativity and depth of chess thinking at the highest levels. Many strong players have praised this book, including Bobby Fischer (see the book \`No Regrets'). This book is a must for all players who want to master the game or discover what chess is like at the top."},{"Title":"Yoga sutras of Patanjali,","review":"This book was first published in London in 1982 as Effortless Being: the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. I assume the translation of the sutras is the same while Shearer, who is a disciple of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, has updated his Introduction. The text is presented in a sky blue color that is easy on the eyes and does not distract from the meaning of the words. The design by Barbara Sturman is indeed very attractive while the small size of the book (4.75 by 6.25 by 0.75 inches) makes for easy portability.The translation itself takes up about one-third of the book while Shearer's commentary takes up most of the rest. The translation is strikingly original and interpretative. Patanjali's famous first line, which I recall most agreeably as &quot;Now, instruction in yoga&quot; (which I have from Ernest Egerton Wood's Practical Yoga, 1948) is presented as &quot;And now the teaching on yoga begins.&quot; B.K.S. Iyengar, in his Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (1993), which I highly recommend in addition to this book, has &quot;With prayers for divine blessings, now begins an exposition of the sacred art of yoga.&quot;Clearly the differences with this first line are mainly stylistic with Iyengar emphasizing a spiritual and religious tone while Wood's aim was to reflect Patanjali's succinct style, with Shearer looking for lucidity and an affinity with the modern English expression. But let's look at the second sutra. Shearer's &quot;Yoga is the settling of the mind into silence&quot; is very pretty, and when one realizes that &quot;silence&quot; to Shearer is akin to godliness (he quotes Meister Eckhart on page 24: &quot;Nothing in all creation is so like God as silence&quot;), it works in a symbolic sense as well. Professor Wood's &quot;Yoga is the control of the ideas in the mind&quot; places a very different emphasis. But in Shearer's understanding, the idea of &quot;control&quot; is inappropriate. He sees instead that &quot;Once pointed in the right direction, the mind will begin to settle down of its own accord. It needs no control or forcible restraint.&quot; (p. 68)From my experience (I began my practice of yoga in 1974) both of these ideas are correct; and indeed it is a synthesis of conscious control of the ideas of the mind along with a sense of falling away that leads to meditation and samadhi. It is a mistake to imagine that one makes no effort, since it is the very essence of yoga that one does indeed make an effort and uses technique in order to find liberation (rather than, say, faith or knowledge). Yoga is above all a practice and nothing in it can be fully appreciated without practice. But it is also a mistake to think that one can through force of will achieve samadhi. What is required is a controlled practice in which one leads the reluctant mind and body to a place of relaxed concentration in which meditation is allowed to take place.But let's now look at how Iyengar translates this famous second aphorism: &quot;Yoga is the cessation of movements in the consciousness.&quot; He adds, &quot;This vital sutra contains the definition of yoga: the control or restraint of the movement of consciousness, leading to their complete cessation.&quot; (Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, p. 46)While I think Shearer's translation is very much worthwhile, I am less enthusiastic about his interpretation. He devotes the last part of his Introduction to the famous &quot;siddhas&quot; (psychic powers). He attempts to justify and explain them in terms of quantum mechanics, averring that &quot;the subatomic universe...reveals a reality that is every bit as strange as Patanjali's.&quot; (p. 79) He even compares the superfluidity of helium near absolute zero to what is possible in the &quot;least excited state of awareness&quot; (i.e., the self in samadhi). This sophistic suggestion, which has largely been discredited, at least in the scientific community, relies on the false belief that the human mind (a macro object all the way down to the molecular level) can in some way operate on the quantum level. This is &quot;New Age&quot; babble of the most annoying sort and does not in any way explain the so-called psychic powers. Anyone who has practiced yoga long enough and has become adept at meditation has experienced these psychic powers, but realizes that they are phenomena of the mind and have nothing to do with ordinary consciousness or ordinary experience. They are--and this is why they are valuable and why Patanjali mentions them--signposts on the way to samadhi. When one experiences a siddha, it is an indication that one has stilled the ordinary mind and is making progress. I don't think Shearer really understands this.I could also take exception to his interpretation of some of the limbs of Patanjali's yoga, or express my appreciation of some of his insights. For example, I think his translation of shaucha (sauca) as &quot;simplicity&quot; instead of the usual &quot;cleanliness&quot; or &quot;purity&quot; is very agreeable. On the other hand, I could disagree with his interpretation of brahmacharya as something more than celibacy. I think brahmacharya means exactly that, celibacy. Or I could find his idea that pratyahara is akin to William Blake's &quot;closing the doors of perception&quot; (p. 68) interesting and worth adding to the regular meaning of &quot;withdrawal of the senses.&quot; But these fine distinctions would be beside the point. Note well that the sole purpose of Patanjali's yoga is liberation from the pair of opposites (pleasure and pain) that dominate our lives. The word &quot;samadhi&quot; (the goal of yoga) means both the highest level of meditation and something akin to the Buddhist &quot;satori,&quot; or enlightenment. All of yoga is a means to this end.For anyone beginning their yoga practice this book can help, but it should be understood that reading this or any other translation and interpretation of Patanjali's yoga sutras is only the beginning and is actually worthless without the concomitant practice of yoga."},{"Title":"Yoga sutras of Patanjali,","review":"An excellent translation and commentary.

Werther, then Faust, Wilhem Meister, Egmont, Ellective Affinities, I also highly highly highly reccommend Goethe's conversations with Eckermann. Nietzshce called it the best book in the German languange and I have to agree. In other words, develop a taste for Goethe, then Boyle's biography will be an engrossing exploration of genius. It's not just the story of Goethe, it's a battle of enlightenment vs. romanticism, idealism vs. realism, Goethe vs. the world and Goethe vs. himself. The ideas here are bigger than the story.

This dark, water-bound environment is often a river of rebirth for Norton's heroes. In \\"Warlock of the Witch World\\" the hero, Kemoc is guided through a watery underworld by the amphibious, amorphous Orsya who defies her own people to aid him in his quest.Kemoc Tregarth was born one of three triplets. His birth-sister Kaththea was gifted with witchery. His brother, Kyllan became a warrior. Kemoc himself was gifted with wisdom, but as he states it, \\"...my wisdom consists in knowing that I know very little, though the thirst for learning has ever been in me.\\"At the very least, you probably need to read \\"Three Against the Witch World\\" (1965) as a precursor to 'Warlock' (1967), in order to learn about the hidden land of Escore, the magical sister-state of witch-ruled Estcarp that lies to the forbidden East in \\"trembling balance between the forces of Light and those of the Dark.\\" When Kaththea, Kemoc, and Kyllan flee to Escore, they accidentally destroy the false peace that had long abode there between the great powers of Light and Dark. \\"Things awoke and gathered, and the land was troubled...\\" and the three learn that they must fight with the forces of Light, or be utterly annihilated by the Dark.Kemoc sets out to win allies among the Krogan, who made their homes in the lakes, rivers, and waterways of Escore. When he returns from this failed mission, there are many other battles to be fought in the now-troubled land. During one such engagement, Kemoc is wounded and is almost captured by minions of the Dark, but is saved by the Krogan maid, Orsya. When Kemoc finally reaches the safety of the Valley of Green Silences, he discovers that his birth-sister Kaththea has ridden off to the stronghold of an apparent ally, Dinzil. However, Kemoc suspects that the fair-seeming man who wooed his sister is actually a creature of the Great Dark Ones.Off he goes on another quest into the magic-troubled land, where he meets with the gnarled Moss Wives, and Loskeetha of the Garden of Stones, Reader of Sands. Loskeetha shows Kemoc three separate futures--all which end in the death of his birth-sister, Kaththea, twice by his own hand!A greatly troubled Kemoc continues his search for Kaththea, with the help of his web-fingered, silver-haired friend, Orsya.This is an eerie, compelling fantasy with many allusions (intended or not) to Wagner's \\"Rheingold.\\" It doesn't have a happy, fairytale ending and you must certainly read the sequel, \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\" (1968) in order to experience a good, satisfying thumping of the Great Dark Ones.Andre Norton is a powerful mythmaker and world-builder, and her fantasies concerning the triplets Kemoc, Kaththea, and Kyllan (\\"Three Against the Witch World,\\" \\"Warlock of the Witch World,\\" and \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\") do not suffer in comparison with Ursula K.

But perhaps to know one's limitations is, in itself, a kind of sagecraft.&quot; A promising beginning, but Kemoc isn't given as much to work with as I'd like in this story.Kemoc, the 2nd of the Tregarth triplets, picks up where Kyllan left off in _Three Against the Witch World_, after a brief recap. (The ending of the book, as you might begin to suspect, indicates that Kaththea will conclude the story in _Sorceress of the Witch World_.) Each of these 3 books can stand on its own, since each tells a different story, but this is the weakest of the three, since it not only has to tell its own story, but bridge the gap between Kyllan's story (the cool one about the flight from Estcarp into Escore on the night of the Turning) and Kaththea's (about her recovery from the events in this story).Just as Kyllan brought in allies from Estcarp in the previous book, Kemoc sets out on a journey to rouse the various peoples of Escore (using the term a bit loosely). Many of the more interesting entries on the map of Escore come from this book - Kemoc meets the Mosswives, who send him to the seer Loskeetha, for instance.Some interesting tidbits in this book lay the groundwork for other books in the series. We have our first glimpse of Ha-Harc, the ruined city near the Valley of Green Silences, whose story we will hear in _Trey of Swords_, as well as our first meeting with some of the characters who feature in that story.As it happens, we don't get to see much of any one place on Kemoc's journey; his primary concern is with his sister, Kaththea. She is a particularly tempting target for the forces of darkness, being Witch-trained but not under the final seal of the Jewel Oath. The bad guy who's after her here, unfortunately, carries an aroma of Villains-R-Us - no real personality, and what little we know of his background isn't fleshed out. It's hard to care about him."},{"Title":"Warlock of the Witch World","review":"Many of Andre Norton's most haunting stories are set in water and/or the underworld.

Unfortunately his writing rarely rises above the level of mere journalism and a passionless chronicling of powerplays undertaken by tedious old men. It was impossible to really care about the narrator and his hopes for his daughter for he was as shallow as anyone in the book (which is to say appalingly shallow) if only slightly more intelligent. Although the initial descriptions of New York City being remade were fascinating, the rest was simply tiresome to read and completely lacked vigour and narrative drive."},{"Title":"1876","review":"Poorly written, poorly conceived and quite boring, maybe he wasn't well when he wrote this book....Gore -> you are not Thackeray!!!"},{"Title":"1876","review":"If you move in high circles and/or want to sharpen your conversation repertoir, this book is for you.

The major (and fictional) characters are Charles Shermerhorn Schuyler and is daughter Emma, the widowed Princess d'Agrigente. Schuyler, the illegitimate son of Aaron Burr, has returned to the United States inlate 1875 from many decades of residence in Europe (mainly France) as a writer in hopes of recouping his wealth, lost in the panic of 1873. His daughter, visiting the United States for the first time, is in need of a rich husband. Charles is able to use his journalistic connections to get work writing for New York Herald and his daughter's title to gain entry into New York society. He also tries to aid his fellow Democratic, Tilden, whom he hopes will make him ambassador to France. They become close to William and Denise Sanford. After Charles watches Hayes becoming president under dubious circumstances, Denise dies in childbirth and Emma marries William. Charles, distraught over the loss of his ambassadorship and of Denise, dies while writing a book about the election.The relation between the main, politics-oriented plot, and the subplot regarding the relationship of Charles and Emma to the Sanfords, was unclear to me. Perhaps the Sanfords were added in as a \\"prequel\\" to Vidal's novels set in the future (for those in 1876, that is). I especially enjoyed the interior thoughts of Charles, especially his money worries.I wrote a similar review that I posted early at goodreads.com."},{"Title":"1876","review":"This novel is Gore Vidal's fascinating look at the politics and society of the gilded age through his protagonist Charles Schuyler. After reading the first seventy-odd pages, I was thoroughly captivated (had I discovered a new favorite author?) by the observations of the expatriot Schuyler returning to New York City. The various political storylines and characters were slowly introduced, leading me to anticipate a monumental telling of that incredible election (one that I had to this point only read about in dry histories). The portrayals of politicians like Samuel Tilden, James Blaine, Ulysses Grant were magnificent. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about Mr. Schuyler's society commentary, which would have subtracted little from my enjoyment if it did not take up the majority of the book. As it is, many chapters are full of Mr. Schuyler dining and conversing with New York society, telling us over and over again of the shortcomings of these people. His daughter seems to have little purpose in the novel other than to serve as a fellow European with whom he can share a laugh about the ignorant Americans. This was amusing the first time, but must Vidal introduce so many society characters just to mock them? These entirely superfluous characters quickly grew tiresome, and I found myself waiting impatiently for Governor Tilden to make an appearance.Nearly half the novel is complete before Mr. Schuyler finally departs New York society for his job as a political reporter. When Mr. Schuyler does leave New York, important events are rushed through with little commentary. Vidal sends Mr. Schuyler to cover the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, but we are told very little of it. And while Vidal introduces Senators Conkling and Blaine in some detail, the Republican Convention where they are both defeated by Rutherford Hayes is rushed through in just three and a half pages. Hayes, the eventual president, is almost entirely ignored.I can't help but think this book is in need of some serious editing, and it's a shame since there is great book buried somewhere in here. This was my first Vidal, and I will definitely be reading more of his 'Narratives of Empire' series - even if they are all as frustrating as this one. It was definitely still worth the read."},{"Title":"1876","review":"Although written nearly thirty years ago, Gore Vidal's \\"1876\\" is a classic, elegant examination of American political corruption which remains quite relevant today, especially in light of the 2000 presidential election. Vidal's narrator and main protagonist, \\"Charlie\\" Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler, is an American expatriate journalist and author who returns with his widowed daughter Emma to the United States of America on the eve of its Centennial year 1876 (which is also the title of this novel). Charlie isn't your typical disengaged reporter, but instead, a devoted admirer and friend of Democratic New York governor Samuel Tilden, whom he hopes will win the upcoming presidential election and clean house in Washington, DC, pushing through reforms which will prevent widespread political corruption of the like seen within the administration of outgoing Republican President Ulysses S. Grant.Schuyler returns to a country he has not seen in over thirty years, still in the throes of political, social and economic chaos caused by the Civil War and political malfeasance within the Grant administration. He renews his acquaintance with several leading New York City newspaper publishers, and becomes an important political correspondent for \\"Jamie\\" James Bennett, covering the chaotic Republican convention later in the summer. In the fall, he heads to Washington DC, and becomes a \\"fly in the wall\\", paying heed to ample political intrigue while the Republicans steal the election from Tilden and his Democratic supporters, electing Rutherford B. Hayes to succeed Grant.Vidal has been criticized for his cynicism, but here he shows a keen interest in the American political process, hoping it will remain relatively immune from corruption. Alongside Schuyler, he has an amazing cast of characters - most of whom are real - ranging from Bennett and Tilden, to none other than Mark Twain himself. \\"1876\\" remains one of the finest works of historical fiction ever written about the United States of America."},{"Title":"1876","review":"Gore Vidal, as he does throughout the American Empire series, makes history come alive in a way that no pure history text could. His insights on peoples' motives and character truly are breathtaking and his fictional works, such as 1876, have the quality of a suspense novel despite the fact that the reader already knows ultimately how historical events will unfold. Vidal brings back the narrator of \\"Burr,\\" Charles Schlemmerhorn Schuyler, now in his 60s, in ill health and attempting to restore the family fortune for the sake of his daughter after having lost it in the panic of 1873. Having been gone from America for 40 years, he looks at the America of 1876 as a sort of European Rip Van Winkle, comparing the America of 1876 to the one he knew in the 1830s. It is Vidal's ability to illuminate the details of history through the interaction between historical and non-historical characters and the degree of exquisite detail that his narrative provides that makes him almost unique among writers of this genre. Through his examination of the U.S. in its centennial year, Vidal gives us insight into our prior history as well as our post-centennial history, as one is able to trace the veins of Jeffersonianism and Hamiltonianism as they course through American and world history. Those who appreciate the work of Vidal in this genre may also be interested in the novels of Herman Wouk (Winds of War, War & Rememberance) and of Ralph Peters, a/k/a Owen Parry (the Able Jones detective series set in the American Civil War). Vidal's books take you into the embrace of history and its quasi-fictional backstory in a manner that makes 1876 impossible to put down and that makes you feel a tinge of regret when the book ends, because you wish that it could have gone on forever."},{"Title":"1876","review":"I had a wonderful teacher in 11th grade, Ms. Styles, who taught American History, perhaps the best class I ever had, with an instructor who made history fun but sparked my life-long love affair with reading. She recommended THE LOVE YOU MAKE, about the Beatles, for no other reason than she thought would like it. She also recommended Gore Vidal's LINCOLN, not an easy book to read at that age, but one that made a lingering impression. I was amazed that history and fiction could be combined in a way that made the fiction more entertaining and the history more comprehensive. Throughout the years I tried a couple of other books in Vidal's American Chronicle series, including BURR and EMPIRE but for whataver reason, and wherever I was in my life I couldn't finish them. Since that time I have rediscovered Vidal, from THE CITY AND THE PILLAR, PALIMPSEST (one of my favorite biographies), DULUTH and IN A YELLOW WOOD. I even played Sheldon Marcus in a production of THE BEST MAN. I purchased a copy of 1876 at McKay's thinking I would try the Chronicles again, and it sat on my shelf for a couple of years until I pulled it out last week and thoroughly enjoyed this. Vidal's narrator, Charlie Schuyler, and his daughter weave in and out of the tapestry of 1876 New York City and Washington, mingling with such Gilded Age denizens as Ulysses S. Grant, James Garfield and Mrs. William Astor. Writer Charlie has returned to New York City in December 1875 from their European home - he is an original Knickerbocker; he had originally left in the 1830s (he is featured in BURR as well, a novel that I have ordered post-haste). The novel culminates in the scandalous 1876 election between Democrat Samuel Tilden and Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. As much as I love American History I must admit that the post-Civil War, pre-Teddy Roosevelt era has never held much appeal for me, which made so many revelations in this book crackle for me. The novel, published in 1976, echoed the recent Watergate hearings with the level of scandal and mud-slinging, but the truism is that politics is still this vicious, and Vidal's portrayals of the win-at-all-cost Republicans and the weak-willed rebuffs of the Democrats very much today rings true."},{"Title":"1876","review":"After have read and enjoyed author Vidal's Lincoln and Burr I was to some extent disappointed with this book - the third in his semi fictional American History series. The narrator, Charlie Schuyler, is Burr's illegitimate son returned from France with his titled daughter. Using his considerable skills as a writer and many contacts in New York he works to rescue the family financial fortunes.Vidal employs his sharp wit and biting sense of irony scrutinizing the last year of the scandal beset Grant administration and the 1876 election. Charlie Schuyler, employed as a political reporter, has a ringside seat to survey all of the political mischief and associated back room wheeling and dealing. He has a personal stake in the election outcome: a prior arrangement as the ambassador to France if Governor Tilton of New York is elected.When Vidal is conveying detail of the depressing tale of voter fraud and influence pedaling the story is compelling reading. Unfortunately for this reader long sections of this novel concerns the comings and going of New York high society and long forgotten politicians. I am just not seeped in the knowledge of the era so I found many chapters tedious and uninteresting. Nonetheless I would recommend this book just for the enthralling story of the 1876 election."},{"Title":"1876","review":"\\"1876\\" was written as part of a series commemorating the USA two centennial republic. Like Gore Vidal, in the year 1976 (or slightly before) other authors were invited to write a text or a book whose subject had to be related to that date (1776). For example, Isaac Asimov wrote \\"The bicentennial man\\" for the series.\\"1876\\" brings back character Charles Schuyler, who had previously appeared in \\"Burr\\". After a self-exile of forty years, Schuyler is back to his native country and begins to write his impressions for New York newspapers. 1876 is election year in USA. It is also the final year of the Grant 8-year administration, which is notorious for its corruption and scandals related to large amounts of money.Schuyler describes the race for the seat in the Oval office and his struggles to earn money in a country totally defferent from the one he left behind almost half a century before.After the ridiculous voting and election problems during the Bush-Gore dispute, the reader can see that, after 125+ years, some things (specially related to power and money) are difficult to get changed, no matter where.\\"1876\\" is about a nebulous (at least for me) period of the US history and, as always, Vidal, with his sarcasm, good prose and refined research, delivers another accurately historic fiction. The problem is, Vidal doesn't have complete respect for things he doesn't fully understand or know, so some passages of the book feature a bad taste that I don't like.This book is not so dense and enjoyable as some of Vidal's other works, like \\"Lincoln\\" or \\"Creation\\" or Burr, but still one is able to learn about the period, society, people, etc featured in the story.As part of the trilogy \\"Burr\\", \\"1876\\", \\"Washington D.C.\\", a necessary read for Vidal fans.Grade 8.6/10"},{"Title":"1876","review":"For the Bicentennial, Gore Vidal very cleverly set upon the idea of writing not about 1776 but about 1876, the year of the (somewhat underplayed) Centennial celebrations in Philadelphia. The year also was the same that Rutherford B. Hayes, the governor of Ohio, surprised everyone first by winning the Republican nomination at the national convention in Cincinnati and then, after losing the popular vote to the Democratic candidate, the governor of New York and Tweed Ring smasher Samuel Tilden, winning enough electoral votes to have himself declared the president of the Republic.What most attracted Vidal to the era, perhaps, was the enormous sense of corruption in the air: Hayes doesn't really appear in the novel at all, but his predecessor, the complex Ulysses S. Grant, makes a major appearance with all his air of mystery and ambivalence toward the venality in his administration. The corruption of the Gilded Age come front and center, although Vidal's fictional narrator, the fictional genial sexagenarian author Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler (an important character from BURR), seems more than willing to enjoy the fruits of ill-gotten money as he is to decry them publicly in his articles for journals of the era. Schuyler has lived abroad for decades, and his return with his widowed daughter, the lovely Emma, the Princess d'Agrigente, allow them to act as newcomers and foreign observers to both Washington and New York society. This might remind you of Edith Wharton's use of the Countess Olenska in her own great novel of the Gilded Age aristocracy of the 1870s, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, and indeed it should: Vidal's novel here clearly owes much to Wharton's with its settings in Manhattan, Rhinebeck, Washington and Newport, and several of the most striking of the characters in Wharton's partial roman a clef (Mrs. Manson Mingott, Sillerton Jackson, Julius Beaufort) reappear here but this time under their actual names (respectively, Wharton's aunt Mrs. Mary Mason Jones, Ward McAllister, and August Belmont). Vidal is not anywhere near the writer Wharton was in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, either in terms of his style or his command of important ethical questions and motivations; even so, his use of these characters (and others, including most impressively that grande dame of late nineteenth century NY society Mrs. Caroline Schermerhorn Astor) is quite a bit of fun. Vidal's somewhat bizarre sense of the American republic as analogous to the ancient Roman Republic--where much of everything is controlled by the old families with money, who have a responsibility to keep everything on the up and up--is very much in evidence here. This isn't the sort of novel that really sticks in the memory, and you do get the sense Vidal didn't much care about the outcome of the (likely stolen) presidential election so much as the process of it. But the novel is quite witty and brisk--it's a kind of beach read for people interested in US history and Gilded Age society."},{"Title":"1876","review":"This novel is kind of sequel to Vidal's glorious earlier novel, Burr. Though this work doesn't capture the sly and sinuous quality of that masterpiece, this is a wonderful and always compelling romp. Even when Vidal is treading water, he treads it unlike any other writer alive."},{"Title":"1876","review":"I couldn't get through this book because I found the characters uninteresting. Unlike Myra Breckenridge, which I couldn't put down and finished in two days. This one, though filled with facts regarding this time period, was boring. The characters are not interesting enough to hold you, and the history of the events clouds the motivations of all that are involved in the story. Read Myra Breckenridge, or his other books. Some other reviewers said Burr was fantastic."},{"Title":"1876","review":"As a general rule, I am almost ashamed to confess, I am not really drawn to historical fiction. I find most novels either too cheesy, too boring, or both. 1876, however, is neither. Rather, it is a terrific, timeless, timely novel. The novel is narrated by Charlie Schuyler (who apparently narrated Vidal's earlier novel Burr, one which I have not yet read), as he returns to the United States, after spending many years in Europe, in late 1875 with his 30-something, widowed daughter Emma. Charlie is in his sixties and is returning to the United States to write, earn some money, settle his daughter and hopefully, earn a diplomatic post in France. He attaches himself to Samuel Tilden, the New York governor who will surely, Charlie thinks, win the next election. As we all know, there is winning elections and then there is getting inaugurated, but more on that later. The first portion of the novel takes place in New York City and reads very much like an Edith Wharton novel: it is all balls and social events, etc., but told with Charlie's relentless cynicism and wonderful sense of humor. Charlie then travels to Washington D.C. and again regales the reader with more of that cynicism. That later portions of the novel are largely political, with the recounting of the shocking, to read them now, events surrounding the presidential election of 1876. If Vidal had published this novel say last year, I would say that much of what he has Charlie say is motivated by the politics of the present day. Perhaps it was motivated by the politics of the mid-1970s. The fact that the commentary relating to the 1870s written in the 1970s is still relevant in 2004 is a testament to just what a fine novel 1876 is. I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite my historical fiction misgivings. If only all authors of historical fiction were as talented as Vidal. Enjoy."},{"Title":"1876","review":"I started in on this book after finishing \\"Burr\\" and reading the reviews on this site (choosing to skip \\"Lincoln\\", for the time being.)After enjoying \\"Burr\\" so much, I had high expectations for this, expecting the same humor, insight on US notables of the time and their era and solid character development.My review however is not so enthusiastic. Granted, I knew next to nothing about the election of 1876 and the characters who played the major roles in the election, and now I know a great deal. But if it is sheer enlighenment on an important,but not vital to know, part of US history, consult the history or encyclopedia.I found the characters to be fairly one dimensional and, in the end, not that interesting (unlike the characters in Burr.)Plus, Gore's sly humor, so evident in \\"Burr\\", seems scarce in this book."},{"Title":"1876","review":"1876 is a stylish and thought-provoking book that functions well as both political commentary and character-driven novel.An aging expatriate writer returns to the US with his widowed French daughter to find his country changed nearly beyond recognition. He throws his strength and support behind the Democratic candidate and uses his position as journalist to explore and exploit the corruption in the Grant administration.Vidal gives us no clear heroes or villains in this book-- either in the political or private stage. The time depicted is particularly relevant given recent electoral disputes. Vidal is a skilled and smooth writer. I enjoyed the quality of the prose, but never found the styling getting in the way of the subject.1876 is my first Vidal, but I will be picking up others. Recommended for fans of history/historical fiction."},{"Title":"1876","review":"It is a great pleasure to read something by this disillusioned man that can surprise me: I have read most of the novels in his American Cycle and (with the exception of his \\"Lincoln\\") was growing tired of his cynicism. Well, I picked up this one - its theme is the corruption of the Gilded Age and its plot revolves around the stolen election of 1876 - and was delighted to learn that Gore Vidal genuinely cares about how the US democracy works/worked. Moreover, this is a wonderful accomplishment by a novelist at the height of his powers, one of the best of the series.The protagonists in the story are Charlie Schuyler, from \\"Burr\\", and his incomparable daughter as they wend their way into the New York and Washington \\"City\\" of the Gilded Age. While blatant corruption is corroding the foundations of the Republic, Charlie is wined and dined by the politically indifferent rich as a celebrated political writer (on Europe) while he seeks to find a suitable mate for his recently widowed and now penniless daughter. As a courtiers at the court of Napoleon III, they fit in brilliantly as Charlie attempts to find any writing work he can; the subtleties of the behavior of the ruling classes come across as both comic and sinister, but also realistic. It is a brutal indictment of decadence at the Centennial of America that gets worse and worse as the machinations of stealing a presidential election are revealed. Though it is from an observers eyes, which is consistent with the style of most of Vidal's series, political events take much more of the center stage and as such, there is a great deal of history to learn (of which I for one was largely ignorent).As a novel, this is also great fun. It is written in the form of a candid diary by Charlie, who is making notes for future books he is imagining as he observes unfolding events in real time. The characters he comes in contact with are fabulously well drawn. First, there is Samuel Tilden, one of the few truly decent men to appear in any of Vidal's work (and a loser, I note). Then there is the apparently corrupt President Grant and his cronies who are indisputably corrupt along with all of the top politicians in DC. And of course, there are the journalists (including a brilliant, hilarious, and yet sad cameo portrait of Mark Twain), some of whom are idealists and most of whom are simple opportunists. Finally, there is the birth of the fictional Sanford clan that re-appears in Vidal's later novels. An unexpected twist in the plot also reveals the weaknesses of Charlie as an observer, which adds a whole new dimension to the novel that shocks the reader into reassessing everything (s)he has read. It is a brilliant device.Warmly recommended. THis is a true masterpiece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"1876","review":"1876 is yet another installment in author Gore Vidal's blatantly left-slanting, non-reverent, warts and all re-telling of the parts of United States history we're never taught about in school, and far too few of us know. Bringing back the old New Yorker Charles Schlemmerhorn Schuyler, a central character from his earlier novel Burr, Vidal takes us on a journey to an America still teeming with internal turmoil as a result of the Civil War. Reconstruction is winding down but still suffocates the proud southern states, who at last, after nearly a generation, stand to play a significant role in the outcome of a national election. The corruption of the Grant administration is about to end, the depression that has hit the country in the wake of bank failures is somewhat alleviated, and the overall mood is hopeful. And then comes the photo finish 1876 Presidential election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, and New York's Democratic governor, the southern-supported Samuel Tilden. What transpired in the wake of the vote-casting is not dissimilar to that which occurred in our own era six years back, and after much back room wrangling and governmental interference, Tilden, winner at the very least of the popular vote, was declared loser, and the morally-decent but politically-controlled Mr. Hayes was given the Presidency. Forgotten today, this close election nearly set off what could almost be called a second American Civil War, as rioters throughout the south and in the big cities took to the streets and Americans by the hundred-thousand became cynically disenchanted with the political process. Vidal, it must be admitted, writes his novels---by definition works of fiction--with a definite message behind them. He has been accused of a certain nihilism or at the very least a disrespect for American institutions of government, and in 1876 as nowhere else, that is made very clear. This is a good overview of a troubling, much-concealed moment in American history, and its authenticity as far as recreating the national mood and the goings-on at the time, and in showing how there truly were and are powers behind the scenes in our government mark it as a worthy book for an intelligent readership."},{"Title":"1876","review":"Having read the preceding novels in this series I really looked forward to the subject matter that this installment promised. After reading it through I was slightly disappointed by the way Vidal approached one of the worst moments in the American Republic. I was expecting an in depth look into the politics of the late Grant Administration and the lengths those in power were willing to go to insure a Republican victory. Instead Vidal, for most of the book, examines the society in and around Washington and New York at the time. While this made for an interesting sociological study I kept feeling like I was looking for the real book to start with every new chapter.When Vidal does finally come around to the politics and presidential election of 1876 the book becomes as gripping as all the preceding books in this series. In fact the final 100 pages of 1876 kept me more enthralled than did any one portion of Lincoln or Burr.Also if you are interested in reading all the books in the line Empire does take much from the characters in 1876 so just skipping this book will leave you slightly lost as you read the novels that come next."},{"Title":"1876","review":"In the afterword of &quot;1876,&quot; a novel about the centennial written in the bicentennial, Gore Vidal calls the portentous year &quot;probably the low point in our republic's history&quot; and warns us that history repeats itself in the most interesting ways. This was the year of the presidential election in which Democratic candidate Samuel Tilden received the majority of the popular vote *and* the electoral vote -- but Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was &quot;elected&quot; and inaugurated. This scandal was somewhat of a turning point in American history, for it set a deleterious precedent for the influence of partisan politics in directly altering the outcome of an election.The details of the election are narrated by Charlie Schuyler, an American journalist who has been living in France as a diplomat for over three decades and has just returned to the United States with his widowed daughter Emma, a French princess. Facing unemployment, he accepts jobs covering timely events like the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia for various periodicals including the New York Times, edited by his friend William Cullen Bryant, the country's most celebrated poet, and the New York Herald, a newspaper of lesser distinction, published by an impulsive young man named Jamie Bennett. Meanwhile, Emma's status as part of the stock of European aristocracy permits her (and her father) entry into the upper echelons of New York society as she considers options for a new husband.The country has changed considerably during Schuyler's absence; what was once a nation of farmers is now a nation of factories and railroads with money as the prime mover, driving and corrupting the current federal government under Grant's administration. Schuyler passionately supports as candidate for president his friend Tilden -- the governor of New York, a wealthy, popular lawyer, and a sickly, dyspeptic man -- because of Tilden's ideas of reform and resistance of the will of rich men who would pass laws to protect their own fortunes while allowing them to steal from others.There is plenty of calm before the storm with regard to the election. James G. Blaine, Speaker of the House of Representatives, appears to be the front runner for the Republican nominee up until the last minute at the Republican Convention when Hayes, the little-known governor of Ohio and Civil War general, comes out of nowhere to sweep the ballots. As November and December pass into 1877, the assessment of the results of the presidential election is prolonged as several states are disputed even though Tilden's victory is evident. The country is brought to the brink of a new civil war (in Schuyler's estimation), or at least a military coup d'etat, when Grant dispatches federal troops to various locations in the South to prevent riots and rebellion by protesting Democrats.&quot;1876&quot; is as much a polemic as a novel; Vidal is never ambiguous about his opinions on what he believes to be debacles in the American political arena, and his tone, delivered here through the voice of Schuyler, is clear as a bell and sharp as a tack. Schuyler is an ideal narrator for a historical novel -- cynical, smug, a little vain and conceited, but disdainful of greed and very serious about the nation's political ethos. In this sense, it is odd that he does not like the work of Mark Twain, whom he happens to meet in one memorable exchange; but when your literary taste is more for Flaubert, Twain can be a tough nut to crack."},{"Title":"1876","review":"The year is 1876, and social ills plague both New York and Washington, DC. Charles Schuyler returns to the U.S. with his daughter Emma with the duel intentions of marrying her off to an eligible bachelor and finding himself means to regenerate his meager funds. He finds the democratic utopia corrupted by a greedy and detached aristocracy. The corrupt Ulysses Grant presidency marks the transition of America from its puritan roots to an ostentatious imperial empire. Charles finds the gentry of New York City to be fatuous and fastidious, oblivious to current events and thriving off ill-begotten fortunes. In Washington, unheard of Ohio Governor Rutherford Hayes steals the presidential election despite losing the popular vote.Vidal presents the basic formula that war begets large sums of money changing hands, which in turn incites greed, hence corruption. In the New York City of the post civil war era, a stratification of the classes has begun. The men with the officer titles (Commodore, Colonel, Major, General) divide the spoils of wars, hoarding fortunes, while the common grunts are beggars on the streets, doomed to petty theft for survival.In Washington DC, Vidal paints a picture of America where democracy has not been a success. The presidential election of 1876 puts America at the verge of another civil war. States are sending conflicting poll returns to the Congress and the Electoral College. Votes are for sale. The Republican Party and troops under the republican President U.S. Grant have openly been trying to reverse the popular vote won by Democrat Tilden. Tilden, portrayed by Vidal as honest with the ill-conceived notion of winning an election by scholarly arbitration and argument of political ideals, is given the dilemma. He ran for president on the platform of reform, but to win the election, he must outspend the incumbent Republican Party.Vidal's strength is his immense vivid characterizations and poignant observations. Only with fictional characters can he provide a first hand perspective of so many historical events and persons. Although the setting of the book is 1876, and the main narrator is Charles Schuyler, Vidal is clearly providing his critique of modern America. Vidal is obviously opinionated and is not writing as an objective historian. The federal government is portrayed the most corrupt in the western world while the press is preoccupied with idiotic irrelevancies such as the wardrobes of the aristocratic rich. Vidal is at his best when describing the ceremonies of court and the accouchements of power battles. Whether writing about roman emperors or centennial presidents, his views of the current social and political milieu are clearly reflected."},{"Title":"1876","review":"Listen up! As a general proposition I like my history straight up- facts, footnotes and all. There is enough work just keeping up with that so that historical novels don't generally get a lot of my attention. In this space I have reviewed some works of the old American Stalinist Howard Fast around the American Revolution and the ex-Communist International official and Trotsky biographer Victor Serge about Stalinist times in Russia of the 1930's, but not much else. However, one of the purposes of this space is to acquaint the new generation with a sense of history and an ability to draw some lessons from that history, if possible.That is particularly true for American history- the main arena that we have to glean some progressive ideas from. Thus, an occasional foray, using the historical novel in order to get a sense of the times, is warranted. Frankly, there are few better at this craft that the old bourgeois historical novelist and social commentator Gore Vidal. Although his politics are somewhere back in the Camelot/FDR period (I don't think he ever got over being related to Jacqueline Kennedy) he has a very good ear for the foibles of the American experience- read him with that caveat in mind.In 2008, a presidential election year, it may not be inappropriate to look back to an earlier time when a presidential election was seriously in dispute. No, not the hanging chads of Florida in 2000 but the granddaddy of bourgeois electoral boondoggles with the Electoral College victory (but not popular vote) of Ohio Governor Rutherfraud B. Hayes over Governor Samuel Tilden of New York in 1876. Vidal, as is his style, combines fictional characters with the makings and doings of real characters who brought the American experience to the brink of another 'civil war' just shortly after the end of the truly bloody one that preserved the union and abolished slavery in 1865. He does this by using a literary man, a long time American expatriate ( in France) journalist (who else, right?) the fictional Charles Schuyler to narrate (and who also narrated Vida''s novel Burr back in the early part of the century) the scenes. To add motive to his literary efforts and carry the story line along, dear Charles, is desperate for Governor Tilden to win the presidency so that he can return to Europe in some style as an American ambassador to France under a Tilden administration.Along the way brother Schuyler (and his noble, but penniless, widowed daughter Emma) brings into focus the beginnings of the dominance of the \\"robber barons\\", up close and personal, that we have heard about from our high school history tests, during the last part of the 19th century. Interestingly, this novel is populated with plenty of characters who came of political age during the immediate Civil War period and who populated the Lincoln administration or the various Union military commands of the Civil War period. Gone are those political figures like Seward, Chase and obviously Lincoln who actually led that political fight. This is the age of the upstart General Grant, for better or worst.This is, moreover, a period that had more than its fair share of political graft and boondoggles. Seemingly half the book is spend explaining why some politician be he a Grant Administration official, Roscoe Conkling, James Blaine or some other \`angel of mercy' should not be behind bars. Today's politicians seem tame compared to these giants of out-front, in-your-face corruption. In the end, one is not really surprised when the America presidency goes on sale to the highest bidder- it's just another day of politics. All of this with the American Centennial celebration as a backdrop. Fortunately Vidal tells this tale with some wit and some kind of hope that all will work out for the best- in short this American Republic the \\"last, best hope of mankind\\" will muddle through. Remember the 2000 presidential election though as a sobering thought about how far we have not come. That undemocratic but decisive Electoral College is still there, for starters. More on Vidal's works later."},{"Title":"1876","review":"A great novel by even a greater author. Vidal writes with a lyrical tone that imparts a dual lesson in history and a women's struggle (desire) to advance. Perhaps Vidal's greatest triumph is that he draws you in with unsurpassed structure, content, facts, and tone that leaves the grocery store authors gasping for air. I bet you can't read just one of his books. 1876 will just be the beginning...Empire, Hollywood, and Lincoln will soon be added to your library. Of course, if you think Stephen King is some kind of genius...then you probably won't enjoy true literature.."},{"Title":"The discovered country","review":"\\"The Undiscovered Country\\", written in 1939 by psychic sensitive Redington Washburn, includes an amazing account of many of his & other's spirit encounters, as well as his viewpoints re: spirituality.Some of the main viewpoints brought up by Washburn pretty frequently include: If one is to believe what is written in the bible, then one must also believe the passages where Jesus spoke of communicating with spirits. And, if one believes in the resurrection of Jesus, as well as the \\"rising of the dead\\" of several other's within the bible, than why would one question that such a thing is still occurring? If it happened 2,000 years ago, what would make one think that it's impossible for it to happen now? What wonderful questions/ideas to ponder!Overall, I found this book to be extremely interesting & thought provoking - as such, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in spirituality in general, and spirit communication in particular. It's definitely worth searching for!"},{"Title":"The Lion's Roar: A Beginner's Bible Study on the Gospel of St. Mark","review":"Synopsis:We've found the perfect Bible study in Lion's Roar! It is truly a rare find in that it manages to accomplish all the following: an easy writing style yet full of insightful commentaries and introspective questions, an excellent format, and solid Catholic teaching!Details:We in our Catholic men's study group have been hard-pressed to find a decent Bible study that is appropriate for our group's format. The Bible study material we have considered have either been lacking in solid Catholic teaching, or had a format and flow that didn't quite meet our group's needs.That is, until we came upon The Lion's Roar. Here are the reasons why this Bible study appealed to us like no other material:1) the 1-hour format of the discussion section fits our group's format. This section is further divided into 3 subsections, with a time duration sugggested for each subsection. To further help the flow, the subsections are named so as to serve as metaphors for the steps that a carpenter (like Jesus) would take to create a fine piece of woodwork.2) the self-study questions are smartly separated from the group discussion questions. Usually, there is a general slew of questions that are asked with each study unit, not all of which are appropriate for group discussion. Questions that elicit factual, one-line answers are great for self-study, but can be awkward in a group setting. The self-study portion does require that you do your homework beforehand, so you show up to the study armed with ideas that make for more fruitful discussions.3) it is based on solid Catholic-based teaching of scripture, even containing both Imprimatur and Nihil obstat stamps of approval, which is rare these days.4) the writing style is easy and relaxed, yet very insightful and full of interesting facts and commentaries.5) St. Mark's gospel lends itself well to Bible study because of its relative brevity compared to the other gospels."},{"Title":"Aerobic Sports Log (Weddington's Running)","review":"I have used this log book for 5 years and I swear by it.It has a compact space for logging time and distance for walking/running; Swimming;bicycling and &quot;other.&quot; Over the years I have used other for such things as Tai Chi which can be strenous but are not actually aerobic. There is also a checkoff place for foods and water intake; a place for health notes such as injuries; minutes spent stretching; waking pulse (a clue you are overdoing your aerobics); and a simple graph to log how hilly your workout was.At the end of each week you can summarize your mileage, your time and even specify which shoes you were wearing!The back of the book has a graph to chart your overall improvement and a space for Favorite Courses where you can chart your improving time over a familiar route.I began using this book when I was recovering from surgery so I especially recommend this book to others who may need to report their progress or lack of it to a doctor.

For those who wants to get a Mini, don't hesitate to grab one of these books because many sellers would mismatch parts thru different years.

From that point on you'll be hooked on one of the best time-travel novels since \\"A Connetticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\\" And if you're not a big baseball fan, don't worry. Neither am I. This book is so good it transcends the subject matter and creates fully-developed characters you can't help but love. This is one you'll return to for second and third readings in the years to come. A pity its out of print!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas gift from a friend. Talk about a great gift! Daryl Brock masterfully spins this tale of fiction mixed with fact that makes it difficult to put down. My favorite part was the invention of the bunt. My only problem is I lent it out and haven't gotten it back and now I can't find it. I want to pass it along to my father(after I read it again of course)who I know will enjoy it. Any suggestions?"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I was given this book by a friend and it took me 6 months to finally pick it up. It then took me less than two days to read it! I was completely taken in by the story and could not put it down. The way Brock combined baseball history with Americn history and added a fictional sub-plot was masterful. I also enjoyed the way the author described organized baseball in its infancy and incorporated a modern variable who could introduce aspects of today's game...like the invention of the hot dog. He made me wish I could see baseball when it had the innocence it did back then. I am shocked this book did not get more acclaim. A must read for baseball fans!!!!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Loved the book,read it twice,reminded me of Time and Time Again.Much more than just historical fiction about the Red Stockings,it also gives some of the political sidelines going on after the war of northern aggresion.This book actually took me back in time."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I can't believe this wasn't a huge seller. It is the most absorbing story I've ever read, full of passion, adventure, humor and more. To tell you the plot line is difficult -- there is so much involved! It's a time-travel story, but not science fiction. It is a historical novel, but not completely devoid of modern connections. It is a love story, but not a romance novel. My favorite subplot is the get-rich-quick scheme with Mark Twain! If you like history, baseball, adventures, time-travel, or just good books, find this one!!!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"In &quot;If I never get back&quot;, Brock masterfully weaves his fictional story telling ability with the genesis of the American pastime. This book is not just for baseball and sport enthusiasts but it is for all who are interested in history, colorful characters and a story sure to keep you up til the morning paper comes. In &quot;If I never get back&quot; Brocks main character goes from an Amtrak train traveling from Clevland to Cincinatti to a steam locomotive with the first professional baseball team the Cincinatti Red Stockings. He is not sure how he got there, he only knows that he passed out and awoke to be with the very first boys of summer. He does not how or if he will ever get back or whether or not he will ever see his children again. While in the year 1869 he meets Mark Twain, President Grant and even invents the bunt in baseball. The storytelling is fluid and absorbing. I was left with just one question. When is the sequel due"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your \\"helpful\\" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksA very short review is not necessarily a bad review. You don't want to re-tell the whole story. I try for the hook that will make a person want to read this book. In my opinion, you should read long reviews after you read the novel. Read a short review first.I love this novel! A modern man goes back to 1869 and joins the Cincinnati \\"Red Stockings\\" baseball team. He falls in love and also introduces many new ideas, including the selling of hotdogs and bunting. He also finds a treasure. A super fun mystery and time-travel story."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I read this book as a teenager and it sparked my life long interest in the history of the greatest game. I would recommend this book for teens and adults alike. I bought a copy for my personal collection."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I first read this book when I was in college and I really haven't stopped. It is simply one of my favorites books period, and I've read it many times and will continue to do so. Even if you aren't a baseball fan, there is plenty for you to enjoy; Mark Twain as a major character, romance, adventure, grave robbing, treasure hunting, and much much more. Brock does a great job of making the reader care about the major characters and hate the bad guys. The mark of a good author. If I Never Get Back is a great book, especially in the summer."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Time travel to the early days of baseball? You gotta love it! This story is well written, the characters are real, and the setting is extremely interesting. I was fascinated by the description of the early days of the game where pitchers threw underarm, outfielders could catch the ball on one out, and the state of the ball had a huge impact on the game and the gamblers that surrounded it. The main character, Sam, is not just a spectator in this rough time period. He wants in and he's not afraid to use his fists.Oh, and like any great time travel book, this one doesn't bother explaining how Sam goes back in time and how he has to be careful not to kill his great-great -grandfather."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Darryl Brock has hit a home run with this well-crafted time-travel novel that revisits the early years of baseball in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Brock is transported from contemporary San Francisco to 1869, where he encounters the first great professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings. The resulting story is engrossing and is chock full of information and lore concerning the early years of our national pastime. As a bonus, Brock writes perceptively about social and cultural customs and attitudes from this earlier time, and this renders *If I Never Get Back* more than just another baseball yarn. The romantic aspect of the story borders on the corny at times, but within the context of the overall novel a bit of schmaltz is certainly forgivable. All baseball fans with an interest both in good reading and the history of the game will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"My baseball loving wife bought me this book and for years it sat on my shelf. Finally I picked it up and was enamored with it. It rekindled my love of old time baseball. I thoroughly enjoyed the depiction of George &amp; Harry Wright along with the rest of the original Cinc. Reds. I also loved the plot line about Mark Twain and the Fenians. A few years after I read the book I visited Cooperstown and on the top floor was the very same picture of the Reds that was on the cover of the book. I had to then reread the book and enjoyed just as much. I wish brock would write another."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Is this science fiction? It is science fiction in that If I Never Get Back is a time travel book like you have never read before. This book takes Sam Fowler from modern San Francisco back to the early days of baseball (post-Civil War) and the newly formed Cincinnati Red Stockings. What makes this book so interesting is the description of how baseball was played in 1869 - so different than what it is today even as to the way pitchers pitched.Sam Fowler begins riding the rails with the fledgling Cincinnati Red Stockings and their trip around the U.S. to play other early baseball teams. It also goes into the atmosphere of the time, as in the description when the team played in New York City in a park that now is no more in these modern times.Ah, but then it is also a love story. But is it unrequited love? Is it a lost love? And does Sam ever find her again?Great baseball book and would make a great movie also."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"what an awesome book! I was on the comp and my grandma had this book and she was showing it to my dad, saying she had only got it because me and my dad were like obsessed with baseball.

Sorta like a history book...now i'm reading everything i can about the red socks undefeted season thing...why the heck is this book out of print?? it was awesome!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"The story was tremendously appealing. Sam Fowler, a washed up reporter drinking his life away suddenly finds himself making a Twilight Zone-like leap into post Civil War America with the first professional baseball team, The Cincinnati Red Legs. Joining the team as a substitute player and assistant, he begins a roller coaster ride involving political scandal, organized crime and even a get rich scheme with Mark Twain! There's something for everybody in this novel and you'll find yourself unable to put it down. Every bit as good as Field of Dreams or The Natural."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I bought this book when it first came out, in part because I am a huge baseball fan, love history, and love books about time travel, but also because Mr. Brock was at the time a history teacher at my high school. I did not have the pleasure of being in his class but his students always raved about his teaching and loved being in his classes. When I read the book, I wished very much he'd been my teacher too. I am delighted to see he has authored some other books. I can't wait to read them! I will, after I replace the copy of &quot;If I Never Get Back&quot; I bought, loaned, and never got returned. A great book to get lost in! I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I picked this book up at my Mom's yard sale, and had a hard time putting it down. I've been to a few baseball games, so I can visualize the game, but I'm not a fan by any means. Still, I enjoyed the protagonist; he is a rough and tumble guy--very masculine, and it was fun inhabiting a man's world for a while. I mostly skipped over the details of the ball games, but enjoyed the glimpse of 19th century life. I was convinced he was there, I was even persuaded that Mark Twain would have talked and acted as he was described. I think the author did his homework. Very enjoyable and highly entertaining."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"\\"If I Never Get Back\\" by Darryl Brock has something enjoyable for everybody. It's a historical novel with adventure,danger,action,humor,fantasy and romance, but will be especially loved by those who love time travel and baseball(and train enthusiasts as well). You'll go back in time and escape to a time with no electricity,phones, credit cards, TV, radio or cars, but in the just post civil war era of 1869, there was our National Pastime - Baseball.Sam Fowler does not start out as the most likeable character. He's a drinker,has a bit of an anger management problem, and is brooding over the separation from his beloved little girls due to a messy divorce. On top of that he has just been notified of the death of his own absentee father(no great loss to Sam) but has the dubious job of burying him.The boozing had led Sam to \\"milky\\" periods where things are just not quite in focus. While at the train station on his way back from dealing with his father, he is having one of his episodes and falls into unconsciousness. He awakes on the same platform but things are quite different. He hops the train - some old classic - and finds himself aboard with one of the first pro ball teams - The Cincinnati Red Stockings.Not knowing at first, if he is hallucinating or just having a bad day, he eventually comes to realize he has somehow gone back in time and forms a relationship with the team. He travels with this extraordinary group of young men and becomes a big part of their world.On his transcontinental travels- using the early RR system, horse and buggys, etc)there is one adventure after another. He falls in love with a woman he feels a deep connection, gets in hot water with some real toughs who are after him throughout, befriends the great Mark Twain, has a spiritual connection with an apparition,and plays baseball 19th century style - a might rougher and faster then today's version of the game. He's even involved in a shoot out in a poker game in a western saloon! While searching for the reason he is there(an enjoying the change of pace quite a bit), he becomes a new man. One we can't help but cheer for as his life is in danger at so many turns.The book is a page turner. You can't help but become attached to Sam and the boys. Brock puts you right there in the 19th century, with remarkable detail of each city,the trains,food,clothes,dress,etc and through Sam we are living the life of someone who has gone back over a hundred years(this book was published in 1990, so there are even more differences now!).The Civil War plays a small but integral part of the story too. And then there is Baseball - we are treated to a real look at how the game was played, and feel the intensity with which they played.Even then, the game was popular and the players heroes. But think of never seeing them play unless you were fortunate enough to actually be at a game.Also available in hardcoverIF I NEVER GET BACK.

This has to be one of the best fictional sports books ever. It certainly is my favorite and one which I've enjoyed re-reading during spring training. The variant backdrops - time displacement, political conspiracy, historical characters, love affairs and, oh yes, baseball - will keep every reader totally engaged.The basic story begins when protagonist Sam Fowler steps off a modern day Amtrak train and finds himself transported back into 1869 where he becomes involved with, amongst many other things, the legendary Cincinnati Red Stockings. But in this era baseball is in its infancy. The game, the rules and the players are not the same as today. Just how Fowler manages to cleverly integrate the modern game with its colorful past is but one of the many intriguing storylines in this wonderful novel. Throw in a couple of gamblers, treasonous villains and romantic love interests and you pretty much have something for everyone.\\"If I Never Get Back\\" is a captivating fast-paced book that shouldn't disappoint any avid reader. It's no fluke that the vast majority of Amazon.com reviewers give it their 5-star rating. Highly recommended for a great summer read."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Mr. Brock has written a masterful yarn that combines a wonderful feel for the period along with a deeply imbedded love for the game. While the baseball may seem purer, the era certainly is not and that comes through in this novel as well. A mere historical recounting of the legendary 1869 Cincinnati Redstockings would not deliver the precise picture of the times that Mr. Brock's book delivers. I see that this book is now out of print and that is a true shame. This book belongs on the bookshelf of every true baseball fan."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"This is one of the best books I've read, along with others...but I really enjoyed this book. The characters come alive, and you learn about life a little bit during the Industrial Revolution, and just about things back in 1869. I read this book in two and a half days, I literally couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I was dissapointed that it was over already, and went on to read it again. I've read it nearly ten times now. The only part I didn't like was the ending, I want a sequel!

Okay I'm calming down now!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I have read this book three or four times now, and still can't get enough. Darryl Brock absolutely brings these characters to life. I can just picture Andy Leonard and Johnny and Cait, and even Bull Craver and LeCaron (ugh!). It's as if you're along for the ride. And what a ride it is. Fabulous book. A prized book. Ought to be made into a movie (Just please do it the right way, Hollywood!). Since the movie does not seem to be forthcoming, like many of these readers, I hope Brock writes a sequel to &quot;If I Never Get Back.&quot; I'll be the first one in line at the bookstore."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Darryl Brock does a fine job of telling why baseball has always captured the minds and hearts of so many people. His fictional characters are compliments to the actual ballpllayers in this time travel novel."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"The Internet has made us a nation a amateur and amateurish reviewers so consider this, like all others in this skein, just another layman's opinion.This book is a mix of upsides and downsides. The backdrop of baseball's early roots is inventive. The stories around the games are entertaining, although the newness wears off quickly. Baseball is the not the subject of this book, only its background.This is really a time travel book where the main character dabbles in gambling, grave-robbing, gold speculation, the nascent Irish Reublican Army and of course, love. A tour de force of 19th-century pop culture. Several of the protagonsist's daliances are enlightening. So is his feverish attempt at profiteering by applying 20th merchanidising techniques to baseball.The book's weakness is its choopy writing. There are paragraphs scattered throughout that seem like drug-trips, demanding several re-reads to conclude they should have been edited out. A few characters are developed to the point of madness, while others are ignored.The book could have ended many ways, but concludes flatly. I desired no sequel and certainly no movie version.Where the book suprised me was its unwillingness to touch on post-Civil War race relations or the divisions between the North and the South. We get instead a contrived valentine to Mark Twain.As entertaining reading, the book succeeds and a love of baseball is hardly required."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I don't usually like \\"fantasy\\" books, but this one is exceptional. It's sort of like Harry Potter: you suspend disbelief on about page 15, and from there on it's a joyous, rollicking ride! The author did a magnificent job of researching his subject and all the other historical events that he interweaves in his story. The hard part was when I was down to 25 pages or so and knew that it was all going to end. I didn't want it to end! Wonderful book for baseball fans, those who enjoy Mark Twain, and historical buffs."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I loved this book. I could hardly put it down. It provides some excellent history about the first pro baseball team, the Boston Red Stockings and also accurately portrays the way of life immediately following the civil war. The main character is down on his luck, life is just not treating him right. He is a journalist, heavy into drinking when he steps off a train right into 1869. He meets up with some players from the Boston Red Stockings and travels with them. While with the team, he meets the sister of one of the players and falls in love. It is a great story line that is also very believeable.

Once I started reading it, I could not put it down."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"This was truly an adventure worth taking. To journey with Sam Fowler and the Red Stockings is to re-live a glorious baseball season and to learn a bit about 1869 America. It is thrilling, scary and most of all, fun to be along for the ride. The more I read about baseball history and the people who shaped it, the more I find that the content on the Red Stockings and their season is very accurate.

If your a baseball purist or historian, you'll love this book. Mr. Brocks research of the Cincinnati red stockings was excellent and the whole plot of travelling back in time was captivating.

Love, murder, laughter and suspense just a great escape and a great read..."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"This is the best baseball book I have ever read. It should be made into a movie. It has great scenes on the history of baseball and how it was drastically different from today's game. It also gives a history of the 1860's era. Great descriptions of life during that time."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"This is the story of a divorced man who has an alcohol problem, who has just said goodbye to his deceased father, riding home on a train and passing out. When he awakens he finds himself back in 1869 and hooks up on a train from that time with the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first all professional baseball team. All of the players he interacts with are the real guys. A fun tale that transports you back to baseball's beginnings. The game was so much different then. The hero also runs into Mark Twain and Jessie James along the way. Good, fun story. Sometimes lost in too much baseball detail describing the games but still worth a read. Four out of 5 stars. If you are baseball fan, you'll like it even more. Good historical fiction book.Also recommend Finney's \\"Time and Time Again.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"When I looked up Darryl Brock to see Havana Heat, I was thrilled to see that If I Never Get Back was rated 5 stars by *SO* many people. So I'm adding my own rave.I read a library copy of this book shortly after it was published. I loved it so much that I immediately bought my own copy and some extras to give away. I even wrote a fan letter to Darryl Brock, who wrote back and included some cartoons & other items that were apropos to the story.I love the entire book, but want to add special mention about the last page or 2. The ending is unique and charming and absolutely perfect. I can't help but smile whenever I think about it.The book is like a grown-up fairy tale based on an actual historic era. If this appeals to you, READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"This is a book I've read several times. I'd like to know where Mr. Brock found out so much about Charlie sweazy, Asa Brainard et al, to make these characters come alive the way they do. There were a few political issue editorials Darryl brought into the story. But these surely do not detract from the book. I wish I had Andy Leonard as a brother as well.You will hate to see the end of this book as it is entertaining(and historically accurate) from first page to last. As I said earlier, it's my favorite baseball book and one of my favorite of any genre."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I love time travel novels and I love baseball; so this is one of my all-time favorite books. I enjoyed reading how baseball was played in its infancy and learned things that I never knew. A great book!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"There is apparantly a film version of this bizarre and interesting novel coming out but the book itself seemed to sink like a stone, not arousing much mainstream interest. It is a very interesting book, depending more on setting than on character but with strong characters nonetheless.The problem may have been in the marketing. Since the book involves baseball, it might have been better promoted as a baseball novel. Since it involves time travel, it is clearly science fiction. Instead of using either \\"hook,\\" the publishers apparently insisted on treating it as a mainstream novel and it didn't take off.I ought to qualify this by saying that I have been out of the bookstore business for several years and the book might have sold better recently than it did."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"An enthralling book. Brock is meticulous in his research, down to duplicating the style of speech used in 1869. The more you read of this book, the harder it is to put down. After a few pages, you find the seemingly implausible aspect of time travel entirely plausible due to the deft skill of the author. I'm not a big baseball fan, but I really got into this book, far more that I had anticipated. The only low point happened when I finished reading it. I then promptly ordered the sequel,\\"Two in the Field,\\" which I'm sure I will enjoy because I like the characters in this book."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"A great book for anyone who's a fan of baseball, the late 1800s, period fiction, Mark Twain, or great books in general; This book has it all. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of it."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"When I first decided to sit down and read this book I was very skeptical, it seemed an older man's book to me, me being only 17 at the time, but as I sat down and read the book I found myself sucked into the descriptive nature that the author uses, allowing me to explore and project every word he said into a colorful yet young America that i didn't know as well as I thought. All in all, this book is a must read, and can be enjoyed by readers of all ages."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"If I Never Get Back combines the best qualities of both Jack Finney (in historically set novels)and George Will (in baseball history). At the same time, Brock includes the likes of Samuel Clements and the Fenians to add bredth to the story. The best of baseball history and time travel."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"The historical facts in this book are impeccable and it was veru suspenseful. Brock has created a real world in 1869, and has done it well. I find it interesting that Sam Fowler was real, something I didn't know before..."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"The man was a history and English teach, so perhaps some of this information was just acquired over the years. But there were single paragraphs that didn't advance the narrative a bit, but created authenticity and were obviously historically accurate. I read the book when it was published, and just re-read it, wondering if it would be as good as I recalled. It was better. I really couldn't suggest a better baseball novel. Too bad this guy hasn't written anything else that I've been able to locate."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"This was a great book. Very well written. I wish he would write a sequal."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I read this book when it first came out and itgrabbed me,making me interested in a sport that I had never really had any interest in before. The author makes you feel that you are right there, playing along with the characters."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"This is one of the greatest baseball novels ever written. If you like baseball,time travel,romance and \\"rooting for the good guys\\" this is a book that will never get old. I'm sorry they never made a movie if it. However I doubt Hollywood could do it justice. Superb!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"read &quot;Perfect Silence&quot; by Jeff Hutton.Another book about the begginings of our national pastime."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"The device used in this book to recount the saga of the Cincinnati Red Stockings is a good one, I suppose, if you gobble up fantasy. But the idea of present day person living in 1869 and knowing all that has happened since is a difficult one. Conrad Richter uses a similar device in The Waters of Kronos and I liked that book. But the author here did not succeed in making me believe in the scenario, and this got in the way of enjoying the book. But I suppose the scores and the like are authentic? The author could have at least given us a bibliography, if there is one. Thus those who wanted to know about the winning streak could check on it."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I've always been mystified by the reverance with which this thoroughly mediocre novel is treated to by fans of baseball's dead ball era. On the surface, I suppose it delivers some pleasures: reasonably colorful and historically accurate descriptions of game play when equipment, strategies, and styles were considerably different from those of today; some sense of the historical contexts and localities in which American baseball emerged.But the writing itself is pedestrian, dull, and at times awkward, the characters are both hackneyed and flat, and the careful descriptions that form the book's core appeal are all too obviously cobbled together from historical research in a somewhat amateurishly paint-by-numbers fashion. Also, the veneer of contemporary relevance grafted on to the story only serves to foreground an aura of paternalism and condescension with regard to issues of race and gender. In the end, this novel is just another wish-fulfillment fantasy constructed by and for the white male version of what were once called (at the time the book was written) yuppies."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I've read this classic book four times, the only novel I've read more than once. Brock combines a fascinating account of baseball's infancy, a close-up look at special friendship and love, and a touch of adventure. The result is a remarkable book that is impossible to put down. Baseball has such a rich history, but most people know nothing about the game that existed prior to Babe Ruth. The fact is, however, that Brock used the history lesson on baseball simply as an avenue to tell the tale of Sam Fowler's discovery of himself. Mr. Brock, if you're out there, I would love to see this book reprinted. My copy is showing it's age."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Brock won me over with the many layers of his fine novel. I enjoyed baseball as it was played by &quot;real people,&quot; and I'm not even a current day fan. I enjoyed the well-drawn characters as much as I delighted in the curiosities of 19th century America. I loved the &quot;exotic&quot; locales of Troy and Elmira and Cincinnati, as well as the more standard San Francisco and NYC of 1869---not the stuff of average tales, and all the better. But mostly I enjoyed the ending, because this was above all else a love story, the love of life and the love of a woman, and the ending has to carry it. I approached it as a reader, drawn along by events and circumstances, but Darryl Brock was wiser than that. He approached it as a writer who knew better. The more I think about it, the more I admire the author's skill in crafting it just so. It was perfect. My thanks to Amazon.com for making this &quot;Out of Print&quot; volume available through their excellent search service. And thanks to other online reviewers for bringing this book to my attention in the first place!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Like a few others, this one of the few books that I regularly read every year. All winter long, I look forward to the springtime so I can read this again (along with Two in the Field, which I think is is great as well). This is perhaps my only baseball fiction in my library of baseball books but it is my very favorite."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I first read this in high school. I reread it recently and am happy to say that is still one my top favorite books."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I just got done reading this again and like most here, I think this book really captures the time period with an engaging story. However, the reason for only 4 stars is that the book jacket lied about the ending. It said something like a 'climactic ending' with 'answers to why Sam went back'. I disagree, the ending was anti-climactic with Sam only guessing as to why he went back (didn't know if he was Colm or not). Therefore, the reader is left not knowing why as well."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Darryl Brock's &quot; If I Never Get Back &quot; acount of a young sportswriter who through incredible stress goes somehow back in time is without question one of the best stories I ever read .Each chapter mixes fact with delightful fiction . From the song &quot;Take Me Out To The Ballgame&quot; to the first baseball stadium hot dog you are rooting for Brock's characters.Imagine if you could go back in time and positively direct the game you love while finding at the same time a woman with great love and affection who's willing to share her life with you.Yet there is a background dilemma that involves the 'present'.I'm reading this book and trying to figure out if Brock's character should &quot;walk back&quot; to the present or remain in the past ? Brock guides you throughout the pages and decides on a heart rendering ending . My brother ,father and I read this book 10 years ago and still talk about it . If you like baseball; I don't mean the 2000 version of spoiled millionaires but the truly great players before &quot; out of control &quot; free agency then you will love this book; placing it in a first rate position on your shelf. Mr. Brock you need to do a reprinting .This deserves to be a best seller, and now with 252 million dollar contracts it's worth the read.It would also be a tribute to those who played for the love of the game.Chuck Hurley budlaurie@aol.com"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I must admit I was a bit reticent about this book when I read the premise. I love baseball history and I am somewhat of a science fiction fan. But the combination sounded...... well a little \\"cheesy\\". However from the start this book captured my interest and I could not put it down. I found myself lost in a era when the game was truly more than just a game. Baseball was woven into the fabric of every town, and while disliked but some as a game for thugs, drunks, and ruffians kids were the ones that caught on and saw the beauty and excitement of baseball. The author really takes you on a tour of post Civil War America, and the beginnings of \\"our game\\". The relationship between Sam and Caitlin while a little implausible at times, does not distract but adds to the story in an overall positive way. Same can be said for the Mark Twain storyline. I highly recommend this book to all, especially these that enjoy historical novels set in early US. But most of all those that love our \\"National Pastime\\", and want a look at its beginnings this is the book for you."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I loved this novel. It has everything a good yarn needs. It isn't just a baseball book.It is a Time Travel story, a glimpse of life in 1869, an enduring mystical love story, a cameo by Mark Twain, and a wonderful way to understand how the game of baseball was played at its inception. Bravo Mr. Brock-I loved it all.I was sad to realize it had come to an end."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Baseball, time travel, romance, mystery - what more could one ask for? As a dyed in the wool, life time, Cincinnati Reds(tockings) fan and an author who has used time travel more than once in my writings, I was enthralled by Sam Fowler's adventures through time. And what a treat to get an in depth look at baseball in its infancy, especially as played by the Redstockings. I'm waiting expectantly for the movie to come out!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I'm not the type of person who reads fiction or novels. But I like baseball, and I thought I could try a baseball novel.Right off the bat, this is a very nice work about 19th century baseball. If you wish to know what was it like to be a baseball player when the game turned from amateur status to pro, this novel will show you exactly how it was. Even if I know my baseball history very well, the book made a strong impression on me, regarding the lifes and time of Asa Brainard, George Wright, Andrew Leonard and so on...The story around Sam Fowler, a reporter taken back in time against his will, his also very good. It is well written, and your interest will built up pages after pages.Bottom line, if you like fiction, time-travel and baseball, this book was written for you."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Shortly after I read If I Never Get Back, I lost it during a move. In time, I forgot the name and the author's name too. But this book is one you will never forget. I told friends about it, and at times wished I were Sam - or wished that I had Darryl Brook's (the author's) creativity. I can still visualize the train station where Sam went back in time. I can also still see the crowds at the ballgames, the players - playing without gloves or numbers on their backs, and the total absense of greed. It was wonderful learning about baseball played in a much simplier time. Thank you, Amazon.com for providing an easy search mechansim to help me remember the title and author, and for filling my out of print order."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"An absolutely ripping book; expected to dislike it and I loved it!This could easily be brushed off as just another time-travel book, but it's much more than that. The lead character of the book, Sam, steps off a modern day train and finds himself back in 1869 where he meets up with and eventually becomes a part of baseball's first professional team; the Cincinnati Red Stockings.The book not only overlays the story on to the actual undefeated season the Stockings had in '69 (as in, it actually happened - not the time travel, the undefeated season), but in the way introduces in the most minute detail the game and the era as it was 150 years ago (i.e. very tough game, no gloves, and the batter called where he wanted the underarm pitch to be thrown!).It weaves in the almost compulsory love story, contrasts modern and period attitudes to racism; has Sam being stalked by Irish Republicans (threatens to jump the shark here); and takes us on an absolutely cracking tour of 1869 baseball nostalgia in a real education, at least for this reader, about how baseball used to be played.If you love history, baseball and a ripping yard, read this it's fun."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Sam Fowler, is like many middle aged, middle class men. Stuck! His job, his relationship, his family. Nothing is quite where he wants or needs it to be. He ends up on a fateful train ride that thrusts him back in time.He is able to reconnect with his first and biggest passion baseball.I thoroughly enjoyed this tale. And have traveled through the mid-west a fair amount, I've come to appreciate, the towns and people that the author wrote about in his book.It is a different spin on baseball, but the old time baseball was such a unique and different sport than the way we think of it in 2012.Check it out"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"If one is a fan of old time basball,or a well done fantasy, this book is a guarenteed page turner."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I'm new to Amazon, but not to reading mysteries.

Can you tell that I LOVED IT?"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Amazing! I have spent hours scouring the web to buy this book after I left my dog-eared copy at college six years ago. This is a fantastic tale of time travel back to the beginnings of baseball. Darryl Brock has crafted a wonderful world in which each fan of 19th Century baseball can easily get lost.I am only saddened by the fact that I cannot find the book more easily!! Buy it if you can find it!"},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"I read this book many years ago and recommend it as often as I can. Tremendous amount of background and historical information about the roots of the game. The story was entertaining as well."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"The book, If I Never Get Back, is an extremely excellent book that will leave you at the edge of your seat the whole time you're reading it. It is a mind-blowing novel about a man from modern day San-Francisco with a horrible life. One day at the train station, he falls into deep unconsciousness and finds himself in 1869. He meets up with America's first all-pro baseball team, The Cincinnati Redstockings. He meets up with some pretty odd characters and even meets his hero, Mark Twain. I highly recommend this book about a man and his travel through time."},{"Title":"If I Never Get Back","review":"Mr. Brock obviously has a deep love for the game of baseball. As a work of historical fiction, &quot;If I Never Get Back&quot; rivals the the best of the genre, regardless of subject matter. This book is a must read for those who love baseball.

Sam Fowler's adventure with the 1869 Cincinnati Red Legs made me fall in love with baseball all over again."},{"Title":"Prehistoric World","review":"My wife bought this for my son from Scholastic Book service and then it ended up becoming a bit of an obsession for my son and I. We have spent hours looking up the various creatures and studying fossils. This book is brief, but the illustrations are fantastic and evocative and give a good grounding of the great ages in the evolution of life on earth. The focus is broad an inclusive - from the rise of single celled life through the Burgess Shale, Cambrian, Silurian seas, fishes, advent of life on land, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals - broken out by continents with a nice section on marsupials - and finally a about 1/4 of the book focuses on the rise of humans. There are pages for Austrolopithicines, Homo Habilus, Erectus, Neanderthals, Homo Sapiens, and a mention about rise of animal husbandry and agriculture. The scholarship is pretty up to date and the sins are mostly of omission. The strength is that the illustrations are so beautiful and dynamic (some have narrative elements which captivate kids). Books like this are gateways - they do not have enough content to provide a great education - but that brevity is a strength: they provide just enough to draw kids in.The one mis-step of this book is that it attempts to provide that next step by the so-called \\"internet-linked\\" feature. Visiting the usborne-quicklinks web site proved frustrating. The site is poorly laid out and is hampered by a terribly poor search functionality and some content that requires real player (which we choose not to run since it introduces spam IM messages). I found just going to Google far superior. There is GREAT pedogological content on this site - but you have to dig around for it - work better done by a grown up than a child. Other than this quibble this book was definitely worth it. We all had a ball and I learned a lot myself (which was probably a factor in it getting my son so fired up too)."},{"Title":"Prehistoric World","review":"Great segment of their World History Encyclopedia which I own.

While the book necessarily reflects Churchill's own experiences in the war,it is reasonably unbiased and balanced,although he certainly presents his own case forcefully and convincingly. The only limitation of the book is that it was written only afew years after the end of the war so it did not have access to all the government arhives released later.Despite this,I believe that Churhill's conclusions have stood up well even in the light of subsequently released archive material. However,one might consider reading the book together with a &quot;modern&quot; history--such as Martin Gilbert's--for a more complete perspective."},{"Title":"The World Crisis: An Abridgement of the Classic Four-Volume History of World War I","review":"This magnificent abridgement, published eight years before Hitler invaded Poland, clearly illustrates the fatal miscalculations with which the European nations entered and waged The Great War of 1914-18, and presages the dreadful and continuing consequences of having pursed them to the end. The final pages are as moving a condemnation of war as is found in English, made all the more poignant by our foreknowledge of Churchill's subsequent achievements. If you want to know how our world got to be the way it is today, start with this book."},{"Title":"The World Crisis: An Abridgement of the Classic Four-Volume History of World War I","review":"Being on a bit of a Churchill kick led to me finding this abridgment of the class 4 volume work of Chuchill's on Amazon on the cheap. And an easy purchase it was to make. This is not a blow by blow view of World War I, but it does cover the Great War with Churchill's views. The Dardanelles, as you might expect, is a large part of this. His views that the Naval assault wasn't pressed hard enough is pretty convincing to me. His almost apologetic views of David Beatty aren't as strong - interesting he choose that side of the Beatty-Jellicoe issues, but as a former cavalryman I suppose it wasn't too shocking.You do wonder what would have happened if Germany hadn't resorted to unrestricted submarine warfare, and then the Russian Revolution happened.I did hope for some more about Churchill's time at the front, but I suppose he didn't believe that should be discussed in detail in a history of the Great War. Pity, as it would have been great to show the life on the soldiers at the front, as Churchill saw them.Recommend for any WWI or Churchill enthusiast."},{"Title":"Mike and Phani's Essential C++ Techniques","review":"This book lists 160 techniques, as compared to the lesser count of 55 tips put together by Scott Meyers in the classic \\"Effective C++\\".However, especially in the first half of Mike and Phani's book, I had a hard time finding anything beyond \\"obvious\\" tips, most of which were not specific to C++.What do I consider obvious tips? Here are some examples: The customer is always right. Keep it simple, stupid. Don't work when you are sleepy. Check for 0 before dividing. Use header sentinels. Know what functions do if you use them.These \\"filler\\" tips are each only followed by a mere few sentences of elaboration.I cannot deny that there is SOME good advice to be found in a few scattered areas of this book. However, the good advice was simply too scattered. It was extremely frustrating to read through 10 or 15 lame tips before getting to a good one.Also, the lack of unified focus in this book also decreases the book's value greatly.This book tries to teach you about: designing class hierarchies; performance tuning; inline assembly; debugging; testing; memory management.As you can probably guess, a small book divided into 160 tips cannot possibly cover ALL of those topics well. You might also guess that it doesn't even cover any one topic well. You would be correct.As other reviewers have said, if you are looking for general advice on becoming a better programming professional, turn to \\"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master.\\"If you are looking for advice on performance, or on debugging, or on object oriented design, then you owe it to yourself to find a complete book that covers ONE of those topics at length.If you are looking for advice SPECIFICALLY on using C++ better, then I recommend the following, listed in order with the highest-recommended text listed first:Effective C++ by Scott MeyersEffective STL by Scott MeyersC++ Common Knowledge by Stephen C.

I also agree with the entire content of the two-star review posted by glossman."},{"Title":"Mike and Phani's Essential C++ Techniques","review":"My two big gripes about this book are the subject matter and the code examples.Subject matter:You would find this book useful if you already knew the basics of C++ fairly well, had a few years of experience, and you were looking for advanced tips and tricks, or perhaps an alternate discussion of common techniques ... but if you were truly looking for ESSENTIAL techniques, a superior book is &quot;C++ FAQs&quot; (well worth the money), followed by &quot;Effective C++&quot;. And if you were looking for a good, short book on C++ essentials, try Lippman's &quot;Essential C++&quot;.If you want to flesh out your knowledge of general programming practices, I highly recommend &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot;, &quot;The Practice of Programming&quot; or &quot;Writing Solid Code&quot;.Code:I don't understand why this book includes a CD of the code printed within the book. I don't see how running the code would provide any information that you wouldn't receive from reading the book, and ... if there were any benefit of running the code, the code should have been placed on a web site for free access to book owners, instead of inflating the cost of the book by several bucks for the physical medium of the CD. I don't like paying for something I don't need.And speaking of code, the examples should have been edited and formatted for understandability. There is a poor use of white space ... and why did they use real variables such as &quot;m_rgdw&quot; when the examples would have been much more understandable with common metasyntatic variables such as &quot;foo&quot;?Summary: an OK book, with a few tips that you won't find elsewhere, and a fairly likeable reading style ... but the code examples needed editing (don't use production code for training examples!) and the book's cost is high (probably due to the useless CD). Not a book for a beginner, and certainly there are other books that are more essential for beginning to intermediate programmers ... but good advice for serious programmers who want a different perspective on common situations or who want to finesse their art."},{"Title":"Mike and Phani's Essential C++ Techniques","review":"The authors of this book clearly have no experience in modern C++. Even considering the book was written in 1999, it is woefully outdated. No C++ strings, no C++ standard headers, no STL. Further, the book clearly targets Visual C++ 6.0 users. It has little value if you use a modern C++ compiler, whether that compiler is a more recent edition of Visual C++, or whether it is gcc, Borland C++, or any of the other options.Even ignoring those problems, the book claims to be for intermediate or advanced programmers.

As a thinly plotted remake of &quot;the Battle for Britan&quot; the rescues and adventures are somewhat tired and predictable. As an author, Baldwin has succumbed to the hazards of writting a series. However, that does not mean that it fails to carry the plot to a conclusion that leaves room for the next book in the series.This book is predicatable to anyone who has read the series. But it does carry the story of the Helmsman on to the next with Baldwin's usual mix of technical and piloting skills. Perhaps more interface with politics and the Emperor could have spiced the story line up a bit"},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"I HAVE READ THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE HELMSMAN SERIES AND FOUND THE DEFENDERS TO BE AS FINE A READ AS THE PRECEEDING BOOKS.

I thought I had something after reading the first one. Not so. Brim was a great character to start with but goes down hill after book 1 I guess Baldwin turns him into what Baldwin secretly wants too be, a Lothario who gets all the beautiful, big breasted women including wives plus the action becomes very predictable and unvaried. Brim flies, fights, takes a lot of damage, kills a lot of bad guys and a lot of his crews.Very uneven, poor continuity, terrible morals. I will not be buying the new book coming out this year."},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"Baldwin takes the battle of Britain and rehashes it in space with &quot;Starfuries&quot; replacing Spitfires.

Enough Already!And although I really liked the others in the series before this, I'll never buy another Bill Baldwin book again."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders;: A Christmas story,","review":"This European tear-jerker is considered the first modern dog story, published in 1872, by an Englishwoman of French extraction. Ouida, as she called her literary alter-ego, obviously traveled in the Low Countries, for she is conversant with both the Flemish people (city life, country life, general customs) and the foibles of human nature. The tale is frankly sentimental; one wonders if she is making a plea for social reform or communal conscience. I suspect that this story was not well received abroad; the city of Antwerp and the selfish villagers come off quite badly as a result of their shallow attitudes and callous indifference to povery, pain and hunger.A dog is elevated to having almost human feelings, while an innocent youth is rewarded for his simple faith--only after death. Too late for Society to make amends; all they can do is grant the pair a single grave. Few teens of the 90's would appreciate this syrupy tale of Patrasche's devotion and Nello's artistic apotheosis. Still the book may strike a responsive chord in the hearts of sensitive readers of all ages. A good read-aloud story for bedtime. This emotional tragedy highlights the art of the Baroque master, Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640). This Dover PB edition contains the original pen and ink sketches, which greatly enhance the story and our ability to &quot;see&quot; the characters."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders;: A Christmas story,","review":"I read A Dog of Flanders by Ouida mainly out of curiosity. I wanted to read the first &quot;boy and his dog&quot; book written for children. I didn't expect much, and I was surprised when I began to enjoy the story late in the book.The story is of a peasant boy, Nello, and his dog, Patrasche. The boy just wants to be an artist and see a painting by Rubens. The dog (who has very human feelings) just wants to help the boy reach his goal. The two face absolutely every hardship possible in their attempts.To enjoy this story, you have to take it in the context of the time it was written. The book is really, really sentimental. Every play for emotion possible is made by the author. Early in the book, it even says (in a literal tone) that Nello and his grandfather would just lay down and die if anything ever happened to the dog. Patrasche was their &quot;alpha and omega.&quot; All of the sentimentality really bothered me at the beginning. I'm used to modern writing and didn't take the overplay of emotion well. I had to take into account, though, that Ouida wrote in the romantic tradition, when this type of writing was common, especially in children's books. Looking at A Dog of Flanders as an example from the time period helped me to enjoy the novel even through its oversentimentality. Overall, A Dog of Flanders is a pretty decent read. Most children of today wouldn't love it. A Dog of Flanders is definately a worthy read as a curiosity piece, though."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders;: A Christmas story,","review":"\`A Dog of Flanders: A Christmas Story\` is a young adult book written by the Victorian English author Marie Louise de la Ram&eacute;e (aka \\"Ouida\\"). It's a sentimental animal fable, part of her lifelong campaign to draw attention to the problem of cruelty to dogs. It's set in Flanders where dogs are routinely worked to death. The hero of the story, a peasant boy named Nello, saves an old dog Patrsche from such a fate. When Nello falls impossibly in love outside his class with the millers daughter, Alois, his heart is broken when she is denied to him by her cruel father.I found the story pleasant and emotionally moving. It can be overly sentimental in that Victorian way, and has some Romantic Nationalism, but the story is good and leaves one with a positive feeling in the end. Although Ouida wrote over 40 novels and was very popular in her time, she is hardly read anymore, this childrens books appears now to be the most popular of her works. But in her time her most famous work wasUnder Two Flags(1867), which was still being published and read in the 20th century, including 4 different movie adaptations. Likewise \`A Dog of Flanders\` seems to have inspired at least 7 movies, as recently as 1999. It also sells well in Japan.For an audio version and scans of the original book with illustrations - see the comment below of this review."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders;: A Christmas story,","review":"I have had a little copy of this book with 2 other Ouida tales in it for years. It is a perennial favorite of mine and my children in spite of, or perhaps because of, its shamelessly emotional nature.The writing is lyrical and lovely, as are the illustrations."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders;: A Christmas story,","review":"I first read this book when I was about 9 or 10, and yes...it is sad, and yes, I cried everytime I read it...but I kept reading it, all through my teens and into adulthood. Yes, it is full of Victorian sentimentality, but it was written and published during sentimental Victorian times, and is typical of children's literature of that time.It is a wonderful children's book of kindness, faithfulness (not just on the part of the dog to the humans, but on the part of humans to the dog), hope and longing. It is suitable for 8 to 12 year olds, I think, and is a good way to bring up difficult topics of animal cruelty and humane treatment of animals."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders;: A Christmas story,","review":"Very famous story in Japan. After many hardships, a boy and a dog could glance a Rubens in Notre Dam de Antwerp to be relieved from their lives.

It is insisted that working hard at any work is important for this work.@Simultaneously, this work expresses the discrimination to a poor person.Nello who believed his future is a manly boy, being equal to the cold treatment by villagers."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders;: A Christmas story,","review":"Though I have known this story long time for 25 years or so, it was from animation. So it was different from waht I know. Basically it was same and I found the more details but I also foud some conflicts. Johan was 80 years old when Nello was 2 years old. His mother was very old or Johan was very old when he got his daughter. Nello died when he was 15 but animation was much younger. The problem I see is 15 years old boy is old enough to live by himself 100 years ago ( I might be wrong). Anyway setting of age is kinda wrong. By the way I read a book which is published in 1910 not this book. If this book is different, please let me know."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"The Hardy Boys find themselves in an unusual situation. Their father asked them to break into someone's home to retrieve a mysterious package. The boys find a way into the house, but almost as quickly as they have entered the house they see car headlights. Soon another set of thieves enter the house. After a tussle with the thieves the Hardy Boys are able to locate the mysterious package in a secret hiding place.Soon the Hardy Boys are in the midst of one of their most dangerous cases. One of the boys is kidnapped. The boys tail a criminal to New York City and are nearly run down in a subway. Later the boys are in a plane that develops serious engine trouble, threatening the boys with death! Even with all the danger the boys face, there is yet more to come when the boys learn what is in the mysterious package and why the crooks want the package.The author seems to be hooked on caves. The caves that appeared in \\"The Shore Road Mystery\\" appear prominently in this book. I think that once crooks find a good set of caves they must pass the location on to their friends.I noticed a couple of rough spots where it appeared the more recent authors who revised the story may have eliminated some prose and struggled to smooth out transitions. I also thought the description of the electronics was a bit weak. Why were the electronics so valuable? Of course, today we expect electronics to be inexpensive. In another update perhaps the author will describe the electronics as the only prototype of a new video game in existence, or something similar.This story moved along briskly, with a lot of action. This story is reasonably well written and held my attention from beginning to end. I think this story is one of the better stories in the series.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"This is the best Hardy Boys book. The excitement never ends. If I could only own one this would be it. They get to do all kinds of cool stuff, meet neat people and even jump out of a crashing plane. And the end eludes to technology available today."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"This is a good story but, it's got some things that annoy me.For one thing, Leslie McFarlane seems to be pandering to his audience here. The \\"innocent horseplay\\" that is so glibly dismissed as youthful hijinks in the first two chapters is only slightly short of criminal behavior and certainly is not what we expect of our heroes or their chums.And how about that party at Chet's for 15 to 17 year olds that goes on until 2 AM, complete with orchestra and in the middle of the greatest economic depression in the country's history?For another thing, Aunt Gertrude is at her obnoxious, overbearing worst in this story. For whatever other faults the villian Chris may have had, one can only admire his audacity for standing up to the old hag. Just once I'd like to see perennial jellyfish Laura Hardy get enough gumption to stand up to Gertie and say something along the lines of \\"Gertrude, you old battle axe, this is my house and these are my boys, so kindly shut up and mind your own business if you wish to continue sponging off us!\\" but, alas, Laura has never said a word.Another odd thing is the complete absence of Fenton, who is out west on a case. Not a word from him or to him, even when Joe is kidnapped! I kept expecting him to show up and somehow tie his current case into the plot but he never did. Instead, those two dopey government agents show up for the climax. It would have been just as easy to tie Fenton into the plot, so why use those two dopes at all?....We also discover another Hardy relative, a \\"Cousin Hattie\\" of Gresham. Just who she is related to is open for speculation but it is Gertie who refers to her as cousin. We also learn the Gertie is 65 years of age, which has to make her Fenton's elder, if not eldest, sister.The one part of the story I particularly enjoyed was the Boys' trip to the city. Their adventures there are plausible and well written. The recounting of their trek back to Bayport (sleeping in Central Park, taking trollies etc.) lends an air of authenticity to the story.Rating: B-Originally reviewed by me in my Bayport Times Issue #21"},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"This review concerns the revised 1967 edition. Mr. Hardy asks Frank and Joe to \\"break into\\" the house of a neighbour and retrieve a secret invention to prevent it from being stolen by a gang of thieves he is currently investigating. Later, at a party at Chet's home, Joe is kidnapped at the stroke of midnight. Frank, along with some friends, must find Joe and learn why he was kidnapped; as well, the Hardy's have to keep the gang from stealing the invention. Personally, I preferred this edition to the original. The original edition was better written; although, that is true in most cases. However, I found that revised edition had a more interesting mystery and it had a lot more action. I don't consider this book to be one of the best of the series, but it is far from being one of the worst."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"Hi guys!

I'd more accurately give the book a rating of 3.5 stars. The writing, like with all previous volumes, is excellent and the mystery is alright, but the book doesn't quite live up to the intriguing title. Mr. Hardy does not make an appearance in the book as he is said to be on a case out West and, in my opinion, his omission only hurts the story.

It is an engaging parental account of one family's discovery of their children's extreme asynchrony leading ultimately to the author's discovery of her own. In their struggle to understand the complex and unusual needs of their children, Rebecca Hein and her husband Ellis must also learn how to best meet those needs. This journey of discovery reveals much about their own lives, bringing them full circle to a greater understanding of themselves and what is required for them to live their lives most fully.Rebecca Hein details with clarity and insight the unusual ways her children learn, perceive and think. She chronicles the family's home schooling as she finds new ways to teach the children, all the while relating these to her own experiences as both student and teacher. Through Rebecca's keen observations, we accompany her family through this journey and in doing so find a familiar understanding of their experience.This book can further the understanding of that experience for educators and professionals working with profoundly gifted children. It makes a compelling case for both the unusual educational and emotional needs of this population, and for the reasons these needs must be served. Even more important, is the book's value for those families who might see themselves in its pages and know that they are not alone. There is both comfort and optimism to be found in the ways this family chose to meet their challenges."},{"Title":"A Case of Brilliance","review":"This mom struggles with what to do with her musically gifted kids.

This is not the target audience of this book, nor is this, for the most part, the kind of instruction it seeks to provide. The majority of this book is an in-depth examination of almost-joseki; &quot;these first moves are a common sequence, but then white plays X; how should black respond?&quot; is the question repeated throughout the book. Since a thorough understanding of joseki includes knowing why not to deviate from it, and what to do when your opponent does, this book is as much a guide to understanding joseki than anything else.Though amazon lists the book as having been written by Ishida Yoshio, the book is in fact comprised of four chapters written by four different authors. Fittingly, much of the book has an impish air to it; one can almost feel the smirk of one of the authors as he describes the imaginary dialogue between Dogaku Sensei (&quot;Honinbo of the Alleyways&quot;) and Joe Patzer, a parody of just the kind of player one imagines would buy a book about trick plays. The book even includes a comical eight page cartoon, translated into English.

Prof. Gomez-Lobo's approach to ethics is that of a moral philosopher, not that of a moral theologian, so he deals strictly in reason, not in Revelation. He does not include religion as a basic human good (a judgment I would dispute), but explores (and advocates) the viewpoint that the natural law/human goods approach to ethics is \\"accessible to anyone and therefore is binding on everyone without distinction\\" (p. 129). He points out, however, that his approach does not necessarily result in a moral chasm between religious conviction and the natural logic he employs. Asking the question, \\"Who did what, and why?\\" (p. 48) requires us, he says, to look at agents, acts, outcomes, and intentions, leading to the system of natural law ethics he explains and instantiates for readers. The formal principle, he maintains, is that we are to pursue good and to avoid evil (p. 2). We can differentiate the one from the other by analyzing and applying human goods reasoning, which is to say we must appreciate the \\"set of goods that provide the foundation for the objective moral order\\" (126). These goods are life and health, family, friendship, work and play, beauty, knowledge, and integrity. \\"The primary moral question when passing a moral judgment,\\" he says, \\"is, how will human goods be affected in the action itself? Good consequences do not justify an evil deed\\" (p. 116). That principle--and this: \\"What is good for us is not just to choose freely but freely to choose what is good\\" (p. 28)--should constitute the ethical worldview of anyone judging virtue from vice, right from wrong. For example, he writes that the innocent may never morally be killed, which creates a practical and prudential guideline for considering warfare (criminals and aggressors fall outside the scope of such protection [p. 61]), abortion (always wrong [p. 94]), and euthanasia (\\"the ultimate failure to care for someone in need\\" [p. 110]). He contends, quite correctly I believe, that such philosophies as utilitarianism and libertarianism are inadequate moral guides (p. 119), and there is always the danger of corruption of conscience resulting from the utilitarian notions \\"that entail that sometimes we ought to do unjust deeds\\" (p. 122). Gomez-Lobo explains a great deal of ethical thought economically and effectively. This is an excellent short introduction to ethics and could serve particularly well as a college course \\"textbook\\" if complemented a by a number of ancillary readings. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Morality and the Human Goods: An Introduction to Natural Law Ethics","review":"This is a primer on natural law ethics. Inspired by Aristotle and developed by Aquinas, this was for centuries the predominant European approach to ethics, in large part because it carried the imprimateur of the Catholic Church. This book is written clearly and organized well. The natural law approach is interesting and has been supported by some impressive thinkers. This book, unfortunately, slides by some of the real problems with this approach and is consequently not very convincing. A basic approach here is to think or converse about what constitutes appropriate goals (basic goods) for human existence. From these goals, some type of moral standards are constructed. Leaving aside the powerful Humean criticism that one can't easily move from &quot;is&quot; to &quot;ought&quot;, this is only one form of moral realism. There are other forms of moral realism which yield very different conclusions. For example, the philosopher Judith Thomson produced a book on the nature and application of rights which is based on trying to clarify and abstract our moral intuitions about rights. Some of Thomson's applications of her lines of reasoning lead to very different conclusions that those reached by Gomez-Lobo. The point is not that Thomson is correct and Gomez-Lobo incorrect (though Thomson's arguments, written for an academic audience, are much more rigorous) but that this general approach is difficult to apply and doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusions Gomez-Lobo affirms. Even conceding that Gomez-Lobo's basic approach, there are difficulties with his list of basic goods. Why this particular list? Why not add power or dominance over others? Why not other features that we would generally find repulsive? Aristotle, for example, found subordination of women and the existence of slavery quite acceptable. Even individuals within the natural law tradition differ on the basic goods. As Gomez-Lobo concedes, other contemporary natural law theorists have somewhat different lists of basic goods.Within Gomez-Lobo's list, there are some difficulties. For example, he identifies life as a basic good. He subsequently discusses some other goods, such as freedom and dignity, but doesn't accord them the status of basic goods. In an interesting piece of rhetoric, he states that freedom is in some sense antecedent to the basic goods but not a basic good because it is a necessary condition for achieving the basic goods. If this reasoning is correct for freedom, it applies equally to life, which is a precondition for pursuing all goods, basic or not. Based on his reasoning, Gomez-Lobo would have to classify freedom as a basic good or treat life the same way as freedom. The consequences for the development of actual moral guidelines are significant and would lead to very different conclusions that the ones he affirms. I think similar problems occur with his classification of dignity. Another difficulty is that Gomez-Lobo argues for equivalence of all basic goods. Well and good, but what happens when there is conflict? There is no obvious procedure for resolving conflicts. At one point, he argues that negative responsibilities (do not do something) take precedence over positive claims (you must do this) but provides no convincing argument for this distinction. Further, what happens when positive claims conflict with positive claims, or negative with negative? He also places a good deal of emphasis on the so-called principle of double effect as a decision making device, which is often difficult to apply because it places a great deal of weight on agent intentions.A good deal of the book is relatively vague about actual moral problems. He does discuss two major problems, abortion and euthanasia. Neither of these discussion is satisfactory. In the abortion section, Gomez-Lobo developments his own line of reasoning well but misrepresents the arguments of some abortion freedom advocates. In the euthanasia section, he slides by some really difficult issues and simplifies problems is a very unrealistic way. While I actually agree with most, perhaps even all of his conclusions, the way in which he purports to reach conclusions about euthanasia is suspect. If this is an example of how natural law ethics is to be applied, then it is not very useful in addressing real moral problems.To be fair, trying to develop a single scheme to encompass and guide human moral behavior is extremely difficult, probably impossible. As recognized by Hume and affirmed by some contemporary moral philosophers, moral philosophy is not going to be reducible to a single system. Natural law theories do have something to offer but readers interested in pursuing these ideas should turn to other sources. A very good starting place is the article by Mark Murphy in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which is available on the Internet. This is a concise, sympathetic yet critical overview with a superior bibliography."},{"Title":"Morality and the Human Goods: An Introduction to Natural Law Ethics","review":"Gomez-Lobo does a good job of bringing together neatly and systematically the basic lines of thought of the new natural law theory developed by John Finnis and Germain Grisez. It is crisp and concise. However because it lacks a discussion of the dialectical defense of the precepts, this book needs to be read with John Finnis' Fundamentals of Ethics for those who want to better appreciate the force of the claims of natural law theory, in particular claims that certain precepts are self-evident; or else one can leave with the wrong impression that the said evident precepts are mere assertions."},{"Title":"Horowitz His Life and Music","review":"Harold SchonbergHorowitzHis Life and MusicSimon & Schuster, Hardback, 1992.First published in 1992.ContentsPreface1.

Writing a full-scale biography of Vladimir Horowitz, I mean. If one must restrict oneself with only one name as the greatest pianist of the XX century, one could hardly choose better than Vladimir Horowitz (1903-1989). To describe him as legend, icon, myth, or genius is an understatement so trite that it hardly applies to such a phenomenon. No other pianist of the XX century has had so tremendous an influence over several generations young pianists, nor has any other master of the keyboard held so many of his contemporary colleagues in awe; it goes without saying of course that Horowitz could, and did, always mesmerise the audience. He lived to the ripe old age of 86, spending virtually all his life playing the piano - his graduation recital from the Kiev conservatory as well as his first public concerts were in 1920, when he was not yet 17 years old, and his last concert was in Hamburg in June 1987, months before his 84th birthday. Though not without a precedent in the musical history, a pianistic career of 67 years is a staggering achievement nonetheless, despite the fact that at least 20 of these years Horowitz spent without giving a single concert due to his four famous retirements from the stage (1936-38, 1953-65, 1969-74, and 1983-85). All his life Horowitz suffered from intermittent depressions as well as from constant insecurity about his position between the hammer and the anvil, between an electrifying virtuoso and a serious musician. Despite all that, with fewer and shorter pauses than above, Horowitz dedicated to recording at least 61 years of his life - his first electrical recording for RCA Victor was made in 1928 and his last recording was a digital one, made for Sony literally few days before his death in 1989. He lived through one of the most spectacular technical evolutions ever: from the piano roll, through the 78-rpm records, the LP and the stereo, until well into the digital age and the compact disc. Horowitz recorded for all these mediums and, despite his highly restricted repertoire, he left a colossal recording legacy that has divided the piano world once and for good to Horowitz lovers and Horowitz bashers. Certainly many of his best recordings rank as some of the most stupendous technical achievements in the history of piano recordings; their frightening power and orchestral sonority are not likely to be equaled in future; I am sure they will never be surpassed. His unique personality and musicianship have caused reactions that range from exaltation and adoration all the way down to aversion and detestation. One thing is absolutely certain: nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody, who cares about piano playing can remain indifferent to Vladimir Horowitz; love him, hate him, adore him, detest him, there is only one thing you can never do: ignore him. Yes, I am pretty sure, writing this biography must have been a formidable task.The amazing thing is that Harold Schonberg has actually done a fantastic job.Obviously, Mr Schonberg was neither senior music critic in The New York Times for 20 years (1960-80) nor the first music critic to win the Pulitzer prize for nothing. What is more, he knew Horowitz since the mid 1950s although he never was on intimate terms with him; quite understandable considering the fact that he was a critic and Horowitz was part of his work. Another thing of utmost importance which Mr Schonberg mentions in his excellent preface is that in 1987 he was officially engaged to write the biography of Horowitz in collaboration with the great pianist. Unfortunately, nothing came out of the project but Horowitz and Schonberg did have several long interviews together. They were taped and extensive quotes from them are published in Horowitz: His Life and Music providing the reader with invaluable, if not always entirely reliable, reminiscences of Horowitz about almost every significant event in his life. In the same preface, Mr Schonberg sets the tone of the whole book: informal, chatty, a trifle gossipy even, highly amusing but very often rather serious, always eminently readable. I am fully aware that it does sound like a perfect cliche but I must say it: this biography reads like a novel. Now, there is one thing about cliches I like very much, namely that they are very often quite true and so is the case here. Just by way, in this very same preface Harold Schonberg makes a very perceptive point saying that the desire of all young pianists to copy Horowitz had of course been an impossible quest since personality cannot be copied. (Later in the book he says pretty much the same but in other, and often quoted, words: ''Horowitz had the magic, and that cannot be taught.'') I was very impressed by Mr Schonberg's claim that Horowitz had in his fingers (as well as in his head, no doubt) all 32 of Beethoven's sonatas, no matter that he never played more than a dozen or so at his concerts; Horowitz, apparently, was a great opera lover and an ardent record collector when it comes to old singers; his main objective in playing the piano was the formidable challenge to turn a percussive instrument into the most perfect imitation of human voice; he was fond of playing in private long stretches of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin or Wagner's Ring, sometimes his own transcription of the Dance of the Seven Veils from Richard Strauss' Salome (What a waste that nothing of all that was ever recorded!); he used to express his dislike with the young generation of pianists in a very revealing way indeed: ''They don't sing!''. We may well accept Mr Schonberg's information as reliable; not only was he often guest in Horowitz's home, sometimes turning pages on the piano for him, but he always keeps his head cool, no matter how much he likes given Horowitz recording or not. His preface is in many ways the perfect one, namely the one that compels the reader to read the whole book. It also says flatly what might well be called the the leitmotif of the whole book: few people ever realised how serious a musician Vladimir Horowitz really was and that nothing can be further from the truth than the popular preconception that he was a mere virtuoso, stunning technician but third-rate musician. Indeed, in the next 300 pages or so Harold Schonberg makes a very strong case that Vladimir Horowitz was first and foremost a great musician. The Last Romantic he was often called - and rightly so; Horowitz was the last descendant of the great tradition of Romantic piano playing that has its roots in mythical figures such as Franz Liszt and Anton Rubinstein.Mr Schonberg chooses as a starting point of his narrative what he considers the most important moment in Horowitz's life: the return to his homeland after absence of 61 years and his now legendary Moscow recital in April 1986, fortunately preserved for posterity on both compact disc and DVD with spectacular quality. Then Mr Schonberg bring us more than 80 years back until the birth of Volodya (affectionate nickname of Vladimir) and then goes on to follow in great detail his long and complicated life with remarkable clarity and objectivity; the small army of musicians, producers, directors, managers and such like is managed skilfully as not to interfere at all with the delight of reading. The style of Mr Schonberg is a really curious mixture, but very far from unpleasant. The book is full of amusing anecdotes, some of them are downright hilarious actually; the author usually doesn't bother too much if they are entirely reliable; that's wise since the opposite would have spoiled many of the most charming stories. The galaxy of names is staggering: Rachmaninoff, Toscanini, Rubinstein, Serkin, Schnabel, Busoni, Stern, Milstein and many, many more; they all are provided with certain amount of background, pretty extensive in the cases of the first two, and are sometimes exposed to a serious critical study (when the anecdote deserves it). There is hardly a single page in the whole book which is not hugely readable. Actually, for the most part the book is as absorbing and gripping as there ever was one.But what really makes Mr Schonberg's book invaluable is that he does far more than just stating the facts; collating them from numerous different sources is hard enough but the eminent critic goes a great deal further. His analysis of Horowitz's personality and most important relationships is often very shrewd, sometimes amazingly perceptive. Mr Schonberg explains in the greatest possible detail and fairly convincingly the reasons for all four retirements of Horowitz from the stage and how he always came to concertize again like Phoenix from the ashes. The only little blank spot here is his last resurrection: what exactly happened between 1983 and 1985, between the notorious \\"funeral\\" concert in Tokyo and Horowitz's return to what was to become his outstanding Indian summer, still remains largely a mystery. Horowitz's two most important personal and professional relationships, those with Toscanini and Rachmaninoff, are analysed in detail but concisely and with admirable perspicacity. His complicated marriage with Wanda Toscanini is also discussed in great detail, and rightly so; it was a curious love-and-hate, cat-and-mouse relationship, a weird mixture of mutual affection and mutual dislike but ultimately Vladimir and Wanda could not live without one another; they were married for 56 years, from 1933 until the pianist's death. Mr Schonberg, by the way, makes also a number of fascinating points about Wanda's character, more than for anybody else in the book - except Horowitz, of course. Her lot must indeed have been hard: daughter of the greatest conductor of the first half of the XX century (or the whole, according to many) and wife of the greatest pianist of the whole XX century (or only the second half, according to some). There is also a special chapter which describes the tragic story of their daughter, Sonia, whom both parents outlived with more than a decade: in 1975 she was found dead in her apartment in Geneva, aged 40, apparently died from overdose sleeping pills, suicide or accident no one ever knew. Mr Schonberg points out without mincing words how Sonia's upbringing was a perfect preparation for the tragic end and he doesn't spare either Horowitz or Wanda a somewhat harsh, but just, criticism for being far from good parents. Indeed, one of Mr Schonberg's best qualities is extremely well balanced style which is often critical but never scathing; he neither raves nor rants; he observes coolly and dispassionately. Horowitz's alleged homosexuality is mentioned several times in passing as a well-known fact but is never elaborated upon - which is highly commendable indeed. Mr Schonberg is only too well aware of Horowitz's unique place in the musical history and he is ready to shrug his shoulders at much that would fill the faint-hearted with dismay. Horowitz's craving for publicity late in his life or his vanity and egoism are viewed as amusing rather than annoying as well as understandable and all too human faults, especially considering the superhuman status of artists of his calibre; so are the inaccuracies of his memory or the whims and peculiarities of his personality, some of which have been exaggerated a great deal through the years. Ultimately, Mr Schonberg gives an overwhelming body of evidence, quoting a number of people and often sharing bits of his own reflections, that completely gives the lie to the most famous preconception about Vladimir Horowitz: that he ever was a superficial musician, his early and most virtuoso years included. This is a contribution to Horowitz's biography of paramount importance. As a special bonus to it, one may learn not only tons of interesting things about good many other great people (see above) but also some revealing details about the process of audio recording and its evolution, the business aspects of classical music industry, the psychology of the prodigy and the elusive relationship between composer, music and performer, to name but a few.Few caveats, however, should be mentioned as well. From time to time Harold Schonberg is in the habit of making the usual mistake of everybody who writes a musician's biography: quoting one review after another for pages on. This makes for exceedingly tedious reading and the effect is positively debilitating. What critics write is exclusively their personal opinions, often in a rather florid language bursting out with affectation; no matter positive or negative, the reader is well advised to skip all excerpts from musical criticism in the book; he needn't worry that he will miss something important. But since Harold Schonberg was a critic himself, it is to be expected that he will exaggerate the importance of critics even more than it is usually done. He also does something else typical for critics: when he talks about recordings he is often presumptuous and high-handed; of course I know that his opinions come from immense knowledge and experience, but that don't make them more valuable to me, especially when we're talking about a deeply personal and intimate phenomenon like music. But one must show understanding for the critics; the poor fellows have listened to so much music and have analysed it in so great a detail that they have long since lost completely the ability to enjoy it. Still, it is very much to Mr Schonberg's credit that even in his most severe criticism to some recordings, he never harped on it and he never rambles; moreover, he always gives more or less coherent reasons for his opinions; nobody is obliged to agree with them, nor should one be angry when one disagrees, of course. The four Appendices are generally a pleasant read and a fairly comprehensive overview of Horowitz's not exactly small discography; and they don't lack some fascinating insights into Horowitz on record or the recording industry in general. The Digression on Mozart and Horowitz is especially charming and contains lots of revealing comments about the art of interpretation, or what should more appropriately be called recreation. Some of them, by the way, come directly from Horowitz's own liner notes to his late CDs with Mozart's music; there are certainly worth reading and they prove yet again how deeply and indefatigably Horowitz studied the music which he played with such inimitable virtuosity.Few words about the discography. Since it dates from 1992, it is of course dated. From the numerous CD releases of Horowitz recordings you will find only the old RCA Gold and CBS Masterworks series. All subsequent remasters are missing, including the now almost legendary nine volumes of The Complete Masterworks issued by Sony Classical in 1993. It is relevant to note that since 1992 a good deal of new material has been released: at least four discs from the so called The Private Collection series, RCA's Horowitz reDiscovered as well as two recitals in the new Original Jacket Collection box set of 70 CDs; they all consist entirely of recordings never released before, among them there are even some pieces new to Horowitz's discography given here. For the most comprehensive current one the reader is advised to visit the invaluable site of Christian Johansson on Internet where, except all commercially released recordings of Horowitz, are listed numerous pirate ones, bootlegs and such like that are stored in private collections or in the vaults of the great companies. One can only hope that many of these treasures will be released in the future, carefully selected and remastered for the best possible sound quality.Despite this, the discography in Horowitz: His Life and Music is still useful. Compiled by John Samuels, it contains a Chronological section that lists 133 recording sessions of Horowitz together with all pieces that were released from them; it must be noted, however, that in many cases Horowitz recorded far more than it was later released; perfectionist to the bone, many recordings, albeit complete, were never approved by the great artist and so remained unreleased and are omitted here. The Alphabetical section lists the recordings by composer and in alphabetical order, of course; for every piece there is a number that shows in which recording session from the Chronological section it can be found. So at least to find quickly when and where most (almost all, actually) recordings of Horowitz were made, it is very useful indeed.In conclusion, Harold Schonberg's Horowitz: His Life and Music is quite simply a wonderful book; considering the almost total lack of literature about Horowitz (rather strange, given his legendary status!), this biography is actually priceless. In the Preface Harold Schonberg mentions that only one other biography and a volume of recollections by a friend exists, so since virtually all material in the book was collected from interviews and such like, bibliography would make no sense; that's why the book has none but it is to Mr Schonberg's credit that he generally (except for some of the anecdotes) makes clear where his information comes from and how reliable it is. (Of course this was written in 1992, but a good many years later, that is today, a bibliography of books about Horowitz wouldn't look very different.) It goes without saying that the book is indispensable for every Horowitz lover; I venture to claim that everybody who is even remotely interested in the art of piano will find it an absorbing read. Horowitz bashers needn't waste their money and time with it since they won't find anything to satisfy their doubtless remarkable intelligence. All other piano lovers, who have not read the book yet, are in for a fascinating and unforgettable journey."},{"Title":"Horowitz His Life and Music","review":"This biography of the legendary pianist is very impressive and interesting to read -- what is interesting is the life and anecdote of the pianist; what is impressive is the style of the author. It is a detailed account punctuated by humor and insight. On the other hand, compared to the 'Great Pianists'(also by Mr. Schonberg), the author's stylistic whimsical jokes are handled with much greater care - perhaps not to cause unwanted bitterness among Horowitz fans! Like Hilary and Jacky, this book dashed the mystery most people have towards geniuses. The success of geniuses often results in pain for others, especially those who are close to them -- Sonia Horowitz is an acute example. Personally, I find this one of the most touching episodes in the book. If Rachmaninov is 'god for many pianists', as Pletnev says, Horowitz is surely idol for them."},{"Title":"Horowitz His Life and Music","review":"Of course, the greatest testimony to Horowitz that we have left are his recordings. Nothing could capture the magic of a live performance with this genius. I have heard hundreds of magnificent pianists, but there was truly something special about the sound Horowitz made at the piano. He had more shades and colors than anyone else. And I have never heard anyone play with such a soft and quite sound that still had this ability to fill a large hall like Hill Auditorium. I believe it was his ability to play so soft that made his ability to play loud seem so much more powerful than anyone else.Still, we like to read about his life. This is a good book life treatment of his life. Since you can pick it up used for a few dollars, you should do it. We get to learn about his life and travails (and he had many). We get lots of anecdotes that are certainly worth re-telling. Schonberg also gives us a better idea of what the life of a performing artist is and the stresses of life on the road.The author also provides an interesting discography that gives us a great idea of what his recording career was like. Of course, in our time of CDs, not too many of us are going to seek out vinyl, but it provides ideas of what to look for on CD."},{"Title":"Horowitz His Life and Music","review":"Mr Schonberg demonstrated expert musical criticism and personal devotion to his difficult subject. Biographical information is plentiful and accurate, including insight into Horowitz' everyday life and manners. Musical comments on recordings are somewhate more controversial, with a bitterness in respect to Horowitz' last recordings that I find hard to understand. Anyway, an indispensable book."},{"Title":"Horowitz His Life and Music","review":"After finishing this book, I was struck by the saddening thought that Horowitz was lonely. That sounds strange given his large publicity, but I got the sense that he lived around people who would not understand him on an emotional level. I even argue that this may have been the cause of the blue phases of his life. He could paint pictures with his music and show people his emotions that way, but he had no way of removing those emotions away from music, sharing them and realizing them. He suppressed his homosexual inclinations, and to me he seemed never to have been around people who realized that buried behind such an incredible musician, there must inevitably lie, even if hidden behind a faade, an incredible human being. I don't think people were ever able to reach him on that level. Even in this book, I don't find the author to get anywhere close to the persona of Horowitz; his life is treated superficially in my view, judged more by external appearance than intrinsic value. The source of his emotional downfalls is not shown, which of course I don't intend to say would have been an easy thing to do, and may not be the author's fault as he merely used the information at his disposal. Overall, I highly recommend this biography because it does allow one to realize that Horowitz was extraordinary, and one appreciates the number of people he must have touched, and still touches, with his life and music."},{"Title":"Horowitz His Life and Music","review":"Most biographies are boring, but this one is not!

Seems like every old-time cowboy remembers it in a different way, and thus our picture of that time takes on new depth. Cowboying in Wyoming in the 1880s, Reuben Mullins was an almost exact contemporary of Owen Wister (\\"The Virginian\\"). Each saw the rawness of life in the frontier towns, loved the beauty of the open ranges, enjoyed the company of working men and admired those whose courage, stoicism and valor made them top hands. Like Wister, Mullins subscribed to the he-man mystique celebrated by Theodore Roosevelt. Both men were also disturbed by the prevalence of mob violence and lynching on the frontier.Each lamented the passing of the Old West, and while Wister returned East to become famous as a writer, Mullins went to med school and practiced medicine in Nebraska, first as a doctor and then as a dentist. He didn't write his memoir of cowboying until the 1920s, when he was in his 60s. He died in 1935, his memoir unpublished. It wasn't discovered until the 1980s and was published then by western scholars.In his short career as a young cowboy, Mullins was known first as a blacksmith, a skill he had learned in Iowa before going out West. He also supplemented his income with coal mining during the winter months. For a time he ran a goods store in Douglas, Wyoming. Neither a drinker nor gambler, he saved his money and counted among his friends future bankers, senators, and governors. He regarded cowboying as an irresistible \\"addiction\\" even while his memories are often of being unhappy - the weather being too wet, too hot or cold, the days too long, the down time dispiriting, the foreman too seldom granting him the appreciation Mullins felt he deserved.A reader will find the usual accounts of roundups, cattle drives, good and bad horses, accidents, the cook's food, and pranks played on greenhorns. Interesting are descriptions of bunkhouse pastimes, including boxing, foot races, and games. There's also a curious exchange of letters with women back East interested in marrying a cowboy. (On a return trip to Iowa, Mullins actually looks up the girl he's written to.) We witness the impact of a respectable woman's presence at the ranch; Mullins also reports a sighting of Calamity Jane, sleeping off what he assumes to be a drunk.The book includes five period photographs, two of them of the author. It's an excellent companion to Teddy Blue Abbott's \\"We Pointed Them North\\" and Ike Blasingame's \\"Dakota Cowboy.\\""},{"Title":"Pulling Leather: Being the Early Recollections of a Cowboy on the Wyoming Range, 1884-1889","review":"What a great book! I grew up in that area and know all the places and have seen them for myself. What a great experience to hear a voice from the late 1800's tellin' it like it was.The book is a fast read with footnotes at the end of the chapters explaining terms and items used by the people of that era who laid claim to the land in an effort to tame the old west.There is a fascinating prologue explaining how this book almost didn't come to be and how it was rushed into print in an effort to make it in time for Wyoming's Centennial.Come visit the Old West today!"},{"Title":"Pulling Leather: Being the Early Recollections of a Cowboy on the Wyoming Range, 1884-1889","review":"This book is a wonderful, if unedited, piece of history. The original manuscript was apparently found after many years and was published here in its entirety. It gives us a first-hand look at what it was really like to be a working cowboy (and blacksmith) in southeastern Wyoming during the open range ranching period. It's partly a defense of the cowboys who have been portrayed in movies and dime novels as drunken, wild and wooly shoot-em-ups; here, he contends that the majority were hard-working, often well-educated men. He rarely misses an opportunity to criticize the popular Hollywood portrayal.The only problem with publishing the actual, found manuscript is that it could use some editing; it's a little redundant in parts. And Mullins' rendering of a southern accent is downright embarassing. But luckily, Mullins is basically a good writer, and these issues should not discredit the wonderful descriptions of how roundups worked, the sometimes exhausting work, the cowboys' relationships with their employers and with the other cowboys, and trading and gambling with Indian tribes. He defends the cowboys, even in their common practice of \\"mavericking,\\" secretly branding mavericks with their own brands to supplement their income.And we learn the details of cattle work: how a roundup actually works, the various jobs the cowboys performed, like the basic work of holding the herd and the \\"top work\\" of cutting the cows and calves from the beef herd; how horses were used on a roundup; why cowboys always sang to the cattle; and the importance of being assigned good horses by the foreman. There's a great story of how ranchers would extract capital from English or Scottish investors by parading the same, small herd past the unsuspecting Brit, who would be impressed at the bounty and jump at the chance to invest.One wonders if his recollections, written in the 1920s, are accurate. Mullins sent copies of the book to men he worked with, and some of their letters to him appear at the end of the book, verifying the accuracy of his stories.In all, an enjoyable and extremely informative read!"},{"Title":"Pulling Leather: Being the Early Recollections of a Cowboy on the Wyoming Range, 1884-1889","review":"This is a great book if you grew up in the West and love historical onfo. about the cowboy life.

Considering this, the grammar section is very nice: concise but easy to understand, and giving a good basic introduction to how the language works.As for what the book does claim to be, a travel-sized dictionary and phrasebook, it accomplishes this in spades. There is both a Welsh-to-English section and an English-to-Welsh lexicon, with each entry including information on part-of-speech, gender, and plural forms. The phrasebook section is packed full of useful phrases in categories like \\"Eating out\\" and \\"Shopping\\", with extra information on what to expect and how to go about things. Of course, it is true that in the kinds of places that tourists usually visit, such as hotels, restaurants and shopping centers, the locals will often be more comfortable speaking with you in English.Serious students of Welsh will of course want to move on to bigger dictionaries and proper grammars with workbooks and CDs for practice, but as an introductory volume or a travel companion, this is a truly well done and useful book."},{"Title":"Welsh-English/English-Welsh Dictionary & Phrasebook (Hippocrene Dictionary & Phrasebook) (Welsh Edition)","review":"Okay, this is a nice little dictionary if you want to be a tourist in Wales.

Hotels abound, but are they any good? And hotels are usually crowded, so if you don't like yours, you might be stuck. Fodor's is some help, but its reviews are short. This book spends the better part of a page on an average review, and some are longer. Prices are up to date and evaluations are accurate. The book is arranged by District, so once you know about where you'd like to be you can research in detail. I do wish, however, that she would mention hotels she didn't like that she saw, because there are many hotels one encounters while in Paris and it would be nice to know why she didn't pick the ones she didn't. A minor complaint, however. A good bonus is her inclusion of many more hotel web sites than Fodor's. And believe me, most of the decent hotels have sites with photos and info, as well as reservation capabilities.

The last true wilderness remaining on earth. A land where diverse and warring nations co-exist together to work, study and explore in peace. A land where Man can watch Mother Nature act alone, undisturbed. The highest, windiest, driest continent and yet the one containing the most water. Jeff Rubin gives profound insights on this last continent, this last true frontier. This book is packed with facts about history, geology as well as environmental issues (by Dr.Maj de Porteer) and antarctic science (by Dr.David Walton).This book also contains a wildlife guide with more than sixty entries packed with pictures and with information essential for those who want to go and observe the wilderness of Antarctica.Practical tips on when, how and with whom to go is both up to date, independent and as complete as one can get.Plenty of information on the main Antarctic gateways is also provided as well as my most treasured part of the book - the chapter on the Sub-Antarctic Islands packed with information which is very diffuclt to find anywhere else with details on such isolated islands like Bouvetoya - the most isolated land on earth, Ile Crozet, Ile Kerguelen and many many others.There are more than 20 maps in this book including, believe it or not, a map of non-existent islands. Throughout his book Rubin adds boxed text which provide to-the-point information on varied subjects ranging from Helicopter Safety, Taking Photos in Antarctica, Why one should not collect anything from Antarctica, Glaciology, the Aurora Australis and How to cope with isolation.It is a pity that Rubin does not deal with such sensitive issues such as the exploration of the undergroung lake Vostok and attempts by many groups to ban sampling from this lake so as to avoid contamination.A selection of photos is also present in this book, although unfortuantely not even one new photo has been added when compared to the first edition.This book is a must for all those who are going to Antarctica as well for all those are interested in Antarctica but who do not have the good fortune, or the necessary finances to go to the most beautiful place on earth in person. Instead through Jeff Rubin one can practice on a regular basis armchair tourism. The only pity is that here in Malta the temperature is 35 degress Celsius. To feel truly there, I need a 2 metre tall freezer so as to at least feel what is it like to be in a very hot Antarctican summer day!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","review":"This book from Lonely Planet is, as always, the ultimate choice of guidebook for travelers. It provides excellent and up-to-date information which any type of traveler will find invaluable. Despite the fact that Antarctica is probably the least visited of the many regions of the world covered by LP, the authors have managed to put together an outstanding agglomeration of data and advice, well edited and excellently written. But... furthermore, on top of being an excellent travel book, this LP guide is also (like many other LP guides, but even more outstandingly) a great book about Antarctica's reality: the place itself, the peculiar or unique characters of this wonderful land, etc. Truly wonderful material is provided in this book, ensuring excellent reading for the armchair traveler, or the Antarctica beginner alike. Its many chapters and additional text boxes about a variety of topics, contain and provide extremely rich information on matters from history to politics, from geography to biology. All in all, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","review":"This book, while relatively well written with a good survey of the exploration history of the continent and much detail on the many parts of Antarctica where virtually no one goes, is almost totally useless as a travel guide.The single, by far most important decision that a prospective traveler makes is to choose the type of ship and, within the type, which individual ship. According to IAATO there were some 38,000 visitors to Antarctica during the 2009/2010 season. Almost exactly half were passengers on large standard cruise ships that the big operators reposition to the Valparaiso (Chile) to Buenos Aires route during the Northern Hemisphere winter. As a little \\"bonus extra\\" these ships skirt Antarctica as they round the Horn and let their passengers view the continent between trips to the groaning buffet tables. Ships of more than 1000 passengers make no landings, while ships with between 400 and 1000 do sometime make a single landing of groups of 100 or less. The same is the case for ships of between 100 and 400 passengers which may venture to make a couple of landings.The other half, some 19,000, opt for one of the \\"expedition travel\\" choices. The vast majority of these book a cruise on one of the roughly 20 ice strengthened ships that are able to navigate in Antarctic waters and, since they carry less than 100 passengers, can land passengers on the continent. As Mr. Rubin points out in the book, 80% of these travelers visit 30 different spots on the Antarctic Peninsula and half of these visit just 10 of the sites, and finally 30% visit only 5.Therefore, while the 19 pages on the Antarctic Peninsula are useful, I question what value the other 200 pages on East Antarctica, Ross Sea, Weddell Sea, pre-Antarctic Islands and even South Georgia, the Falklands etc are since no more than a handful of tourists visit these locations.But the real failure is that there is almost no information that could help prospective visitors choose with whom they will travel. There are obviously vast differences between the big cruise ships and the expedition ones. For the purpose of this discussion let's put aside passengers on the big cruise ships; they are at best accidental visitors to Antarctica. But there are also huge differences between the expedition ships. About half are Russian research vessels that are chartered out to large tour operators for the season. They are technically good ships but accommodations are often Spartan and onboard service frequently spotty. At the other end of the spectrum are the Lindblad ships and the Hapag-Lloyd ones which are super luxury and with price tags in accordance.Then there are several ships in between, including the only two locally owned ships, the Chilean Antarctic Dream ( [...] ) and the Argentine Ushuaia ([...] ). Both offer typical cuisine of the two countries with notable examples of both countries wines. The Antarctic Dream is a bit more upscale while the Ushuaia is somewhat more for the backpacker set.In short what this guide book lacks is guidance on the most important decision that an Antarctic traveler will make; how to get there."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","review":"If you plan a trip to The Ice, you will find this book invaluable. If you do not, you will find it fascinating, and it will make you want to go.

It's not necessarily the best for planning a trip -- you'll get more up-to-date cruise ship info. online. But Lonely Planet will tell you all about the different possible landing spots, which can help you choose which tour to take. There's also good details about the most common embarkation points for Antarctica cruises.

She took a copy with her and I had a copy with me. I read the majority of the book while she was preparing and continued to consult the book while she traveled. I found it to have an amazing amount of information and I really could not find anything missing from the book that I thought I needed. In addition, my daughter found it incredibly useful as the ship she was aboard traveled from site to site. She could research the next stop at night, and be totally prepared for arrival by morning.If you are planning to get only one guide book for a trip to Antarctica, I would recommend this book highly.

However, Lonely Planet did a great job with this tour guide for Antarctica. I used it this past winter during my cruise to Antarctica. It provides very useful background on the key sites and maps on the continent. It covers the history of exploration and international treaties covering the continent. It also has a decent section on Antarctic wildlife (although I would still recommend a dedicated book on the wildlife). More importantly, the book suggests the best sites for pictures and wildlife-viewing. While Lonely Planet isn't a replacement for a book on Antarctic wildlife, this book will help you take advantage of everything the \\"white continent\\" has to offer."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","review":"While visiting the Antarctic Circle isn't in most people's plans when they think of traveling the globe, there is a great deal to interest both the causal visitor, the scientist, and the commercial traveler.

Much more than a travel guide, this book teaches you about the history and culture of Antarctica and its surrounding islands. As might be expected, wildlife also comprises a significant portion of the book.A few shortcomings:I wish that more detail would have been given to the sub-Antarctic islands. Wikipedia covers these in more detail than the book, and that is disappointing. I also expected more maps, particularly in the islands component. I would have also liked to see more color pictures and would have gladly paid extra for them - LP should realize that most purchasers of this book are not going to be able to go to Antarctica anytime soon and so we are experiencing it through these images.Again, outstanding book - be sure to pick up the Falkland Islands LP guide if you like this one!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend who wants to go to Antarctica. She LOVED it! It's really the best guide book I could find on Antarctica and I looked EVERYWHERE. It came quickly with Amazon Prime."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","review":"Outdated:- The listings in Ushuaia are terribly outdated. Many no longer exist. If your Antarctic journey begins in Ushuaia, I would strongly recommend purchasing a Tierra del Fuego chapter from a more recent Lonely Planet guide (e.g.Lonely Planet Chile & Easter Island: Tierra del Fuego)- The volcanic hot spots on Deception Island shift, and expeditions are discouraged from digging into the sand on the beach, so the prospect of a less than authentic swim in Antarctic waters is becoming extremely unlikely. (But the advice to pack a swimsuit still holds true, as visitors still go swimming, and you might otherwise be persuaded to make the icy plunge in your thermals. Or au naturel.)Awkward:- If you're really headed to Antarctica, chances are that you're headed to the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, the peninsula comprises just one chapter of the book, and that chapter is nestled somewhere in the middle of the book. Even after a week of landings in the area, I still found that I had trouble locating the one chapter that covered nearly everywhere we visited. If nothing else, pack a bookmark!Penguin Clip-over-the-page Bookmark By Re-marks- Even the most detailed map of the Antarctic Peninsula is not particularly useful, since the Lonely Planet map conventions don't make much sense in a place devoid of traditional landmarks. The attractions here are the places themselves (islands, bays, waterways, etc) which are not indexed in the map legend. This means that you're forced to scour a map of a huge region, hoping that the tiny spot where your next landing will be actually made it onto the map.- I agree wholeheartedly with dickh's review that this book is a bit of a failure as a travel guide. There are very few logistical details on the different expedition companies and the different kinds of ships.- When to go? Every trip to Antarctica is different, but there are relatively well-defined differences in the seasons. The \\"When to Go\\" section is a few short paragraphs with vague comments. Basically, the book's answer is \\"summer,\\" but ask someone who's spent a full summer there, and they can elaborate quite a bit on the differences between the beginning of the season and the end of the season. The temperatures, the landscape, the wildlife all change from month to month. There are no guarantees in Antarctica, but you can certainly schedule your trip to improve your chances of seeing what you hope to see.- The sections covering wildlife do the best that they can (since Lonely Planet books have very few color photos), but a text-only wildlife guide leaves much to be desired. It is well worth looking into another book to cover this if your trip does not include one.Antarctica Cruising Guide: Includes Falkland Islands, South Georgia and Ross Seahas great photos and descriptions of the wildlife as well as descriptions of common landing sites.Good Points:- The history section is excellent! It provides a wonderfully detailed history of the key expeditions and the exploration of the continent. I was also surprised to find that the history of the Scott and Amundsen's race to the pole was reasonably unbiased (Many accounts come across as very one-sided).- The book contains a map of the various research stations and bases around the peninsula, which I found extremely useful and referred to quite often. But again, I always had trouble locating it when I needed it.- Antarctica is a vast area to cover in a single guidebook, and I appreciate that LP made the effort to even produce this book. A very few visitors do explore the other islands and other parts of the continent, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I already own the guidebook that covers some of my most obscure travel goals (e.g. Tristan da Cunha, Bouvetya), so it will definitely stay on my shelf for years to come."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","review":"This book is a good start in discovering the many and varied ways to explore Antarctica. While the southern continent is not the usual destination for the weak of heart or wallet, Lonely Planet does give a very good presentation on the possibilities of travel to the deep south. While it mostly concentrates on the Penninsular side of Antarctica, it does give sufficient information to plan a trip there, as well as the difficulties and options for travel. Most travellers to the southland will find it to be quite expensive, though for many it is a worthwhile trip to see such a magnificent place that so few have had the opportunity to visit.Unfortunately it does not always give the most up to date information, particularly for the rest of the continent. It also glosses over the various scientific research projects that go on down there sponsored by the many countries that operate research stations on the continent. While Antarctica is an amazing place, increased tourism will likely lead to damage and pollution to this mostly pristine environment.

Childhood dreams scarred, political upheaval, hippie communes, bikers, drugs and sit-downs.By 1969 burning up his draft card, Rom Tom became an anti-war activist, and a homeless vagabond wanted by the FBI. Only after ingesting half belladonna pod and two years later did the FBI catch up to him. Imprisoned, the author reveals his torturous stay in shocking detail, and much of what readers' will find disturbing.It was 1975, and dues were paid when Rom Tom met his soul mate. A beautiful French- Canadian 16 year-old, named Owl. Love blossomed. But their journey of gypsy bliss quickly turned into turmoil, with one incident after another. Ultimately, and tragically leading to the loss of their children.Comporting Roadwise is not just about events through time; it's also about one man's love for life, and his family. In a sense, a touching love story. Readers heart will surely feel for this struggling family, who desperately tries to hang on.This reviewer did not experience the 60's, but reading about it was an eye opening experience, as readers will quickly find out. It's hard to imagine one keeping track of a single year in life, but a lifetime of data? Comporting Roadwise is well written, with amazing detail, and also a compelling story of inspiration.The only drawback this reviewer could find is sitting at the computer, although the digital web format is an impressive 3D effect, and beautiful full color illustrations add depth to this amazing book.

All the stages of the path of liberation are covered in their natural, logical sequence.It is wonderful that such a thing exists: that it is possible to have a general and complete understanding of the path.Reading and hearing, studying the teachings allows us to then contemplate their true meaning, that is, come to a personal understanding and conviction that the topic at hand is indeed true, relevant and workable. That is what contemplation is all about: coming to such a workable conviction.Contemplative understanding is then the basis for meditation, or applying the workable conviction in daily life, until it becomes second nature, thereby transforming our life.In this way we progress, step by step, from understanding to natural conviction to application to effortless realization.It is therefore very, very beneficial to acquire a taste for this type of literature - which is itself often a gradual process. It may seem very dry in the beginning, but once you acquire a taste for a certain aspect of the teachings, you will want to read the entire chapter, and then marvel at the profound logic. Once you have a few of such experiences you will understand that other chapters just \\"might\\" contain equally valuable treasures, and slowly acquire a taste for them as well, by reading the text and pondering its profound meaning. Drawing our attention to the parts that we tend to ignore then proves to be the quickest way to true understanding!This is why it is taught that by these very teachings you come to understand how all of the scripture are instructions for actual practice, and that these teachings cover all stages of the path in their natural sequence. Marvelous! Your intelligence, no matter what your present level, will develop naturally, and soon you will encounter understandings not previously met.I started out with some attractive chapters or topics, and only much later my curiosity for the other parts of the book developed. And even then it took a while to translate the \\"script\\" into recognition in daily life. But now I use it as a reference: when I want to have a more thorough understanding of a certain aspect, I study from this book, by looking at its various parts and looking how it fits into the total picture (or mandala of the teachings).Once you learn how to acquire a taste for this basic, foundational literature of \\"lam-rim\\" (graded path) and \\"lojong\\" (mind training), you can soon continue into the wisdom literature of \\"prajnaparamita\\" (transcendent perfection of wisdom), \\"tathagatagarbha\\" (primordially enlightened disposition), \\"madyamika\\" (middle way of no dualistic extreme), \\"secret mantra\\" (path of swift accomplishment through deity meditation), \\"mahamudra\\" (great seal of ultimate bliss), \\"dzogchen\\" (great completion in total awareness), and so on.This \\"Lam Rim Chen Mo\\" belongs to a category of literature that is a direct legacy of Atisha, the great Indian master of the early 11th century, whose student founded the Kadampa school, one of the earliest denominations of Tibetan buddism.These Kadampa teachings still form the basis of training in all four Buddhist schools and their monastic colleges, each school having its own slight variation in interpretation. Most of these have now been translated in English, so you can choose from among the following:* Geluk school: the \\"Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Lam Rim Chen Mo)\\" (subject of the present review) is the classic that belongs to this school;* Kagyu school: \\"The Jewel Ornament of Liberation\\" (ISBN 1559390921) is the famous classic by Gampopa, founder of the Kagyu school, by seamlessly integrating the Kadampa teachings of the gradual path with the Mahamudra teachings of the non-gradual path;* Sakya school: \\"The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception\\" (ISBN 0861713680);* Nyingma school\\": \\"Treasury of Precious Qualities\\" (ISBN 1570625980) by Jigme Lingpa.Although each of these four works cover the same main subject, they are not necessarily exactly the same. Which work you choose for study will probably depend on your main spiritual teacher, if you have one.What I particularly like about the \\"Lam Rim Chen Mo\\" in its present English edition, is that the subject is covered in full detail, separated by chapters with clear titles, for easy reference. So it is very suitable as a Western student's manual.From the Editor's Preface: \\"The \\"Lam Rim Chen Mo\\" has the special feature of blending the three types of persons (those of small, medium, or great capacities) with the three principal aspects of the path (the determination to be free, the spirit of enlightenment, and correct view.\\"For those of higher capacity this means: travelling from the intent of acquiring a better life in the future; to the intent of liberation from samsara; to the mahayana intent of an open, compassionate heart with sacred outlook and pure vision, in order to liberate all sentient beings.In this English edition, there are three volumes: the first volume covers the training of small and medium scope; volume two covers the mahayana training of superior scope; of which volume three covers the training in meditative serenity (shamatha) and wisdom insight (vipashyana).From the Foreword: \\"Jey Tsongh-kha-pa's \\"Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment\\" is one of the greatest religious or secular works in the library of our human heritage. It presents a stunning vision (...) locating the precious jewel of an individual human embodiment at a critical moment of personal evolution. It provides this revelation in such a way that individual readers can be moved to achieve a fundamental paradigm shift in their vision of their lives: from having been a self-centered, this-life-oriented personal agent struggling with the currents and obstacles around them (...) to becoming a magnificent awakening being, soaring (...) in marvelous evolutionary flight toward an unimaginably beautiful destiny of wisdom, love, and bliss - buddhahood, or simply the supreme evolutionary glory attainable by any conscious being.I like this literature tremendously, because it allows me to understand the foundation of the entire spiritual path, in the context of Tibetan buddhism in particular, but comparatively in the context of many other wisdom traditions and religions as well. Acquiring its taste has provided the condition, for me, for opening into endless study, imagination, reflection, meditation."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"The Lam Rim Chen Mo is unquestionably one of the most cherished books in the Tibetan tradition. In it is lucidly and extensively detailed the precise stages of training the mind in the path to enlightenment. It is adorned with quotations from the Sutras, Indian Commentaries and Early Kadampa masters such as Lama Atisha. This particular translation is very clear and well done, with well written annotations and a glossary of terms.I would recommend this book to any serious student of Buddhism. I found the lam rim in general difficult to understand at first so if you are a newer student I would recommend a shorter lamrim like The Path to Freedom by His Holiness.Also :) I just wanted to answer some of the criticisms of the previous review:Lama Tsong Khapa is not telling people that they should hire a prostitute, he is merely saying that it is not a path of non-virtue to do so. This is not Lama Tsong Khapa's assertion but one that comes from the Sutras themselves.Also about the assertion in the last review that we should not tolerate other religious traditions, I don't know where in the Lam Rim the previous review got this idea from. In the section on taking refuge it mentions that we should refuse to acknowledge other refuges, but this is not saying we should not tolerate them. What Lama Tsong Khapa appears to be saying is that for our own individal practice of refuge we should understand the Triple Gem as the unique and worthy object of our refuge. Lama Tsong Khapa himself studied under teachers from many traditions including Nying-ma, Sakya and Kargyu so it would be difficult to accuse him of being biased to one tradition.I do not mean to criticize the previous reviewer, just correct some misinterpretations that might discourage people from buying this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"The work that this is a translation of has been the foundation and guide for my life for more than twenty years.I consider the source work itself to be a useful component to any person studying or practicing ANY spiritual path.Tsonkhapa was a great academic, and his writing is particularly rigourous. He lays his thoughts out with clarity and deliberation, and this work is no exception.As a guide for life, it is my opinion that it is better if one can find someone to guide one through the book, -there are many references to stories and events that are not all explained by footnotes, however, this edition is definately a superb reader and essential companion.The translation committee have had to work very hard in order to achieve an exemplar, and definitive English translation, and in my humble opinion, have done very well indeed.There is the occasional Americanism, (so it is translated into American English, rather than International English), and sometimes the choice of term is not so intuitive for the well-read student of Buddhism (e.g. 'trailblazer' for 'Mahayana')Regardless, other than posting the translation into a CVS repository for the global Buddhist community, I cannot imagine a better approach to this essential work.We wait with respect for the second and third volumes."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"Tsong Kha Pa tends to be very analytical in his discussions. This book is no exception. It is the first of a series of 3 to translate his Lam Rim text, bringing the reader through teachings for the small and middle capacity to Bodhichitta. The second text, when published will describe the Bodhisattva path, followed by the third which will focus on concentration and wisdom.For those who wish to thoroughly investigate or understand the entire Buddhist path, this compendium is absolutely wonderful. It is a great complement to Yin Shun's &quot;The Way to Buddhahood.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"This book is a must read for people familiar with the Buddhist path. It provides a general framework for how all the different practices and teachings fit, in relation to one another and the Buddhist path more generally. In response to some of the critiques of the book below, the book must be taken within its historical context. Tibet was a patriarchial culture and Tsong-kha-pa did see Buddhism as a superior path to other paths. That said, Tsong-kha-pa's comments on these things need to be taken with a grain of salt and it is much better to look to current teachers, such as the Dalai Lama, for advice on these topics."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"To read the &lt;Jang Chub Lamrim Chenmo>, &lt;The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Volumes One, Two and Three: The Lamrim Chenmo> by Tsong-kha-pa demands great patience and diligence for the average reader.In particular, the difficulty is partly due to the excellent and faithful translation of the three volumes of the author's work from Tibetan to English. And since the original work was written scholaric language during Je Tsong Khapa's time six hundred years ago, I reckoned that I needed some help when I purchased all three volumes of the Great Treatise several months ago after reading the first few chapters.Help has come in the form of an useful preliminary reading. A companion, compendium, discourse-commentary on Je Tsong Khapa's profound and scholarly work has long been translated and available in English and in print for decades before as &lt;Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment>.It is to my knowledge that some Tibetan Buddhist monks from the Gelug/Gelupa school are actually using &lt;Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment> as a course outline to teach Je Tsong Khapa's &lt;The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment> to members of the Sangha in 24 days.&lt;Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment> is a document of a series lecture delivered by Pabongka Rinpoche over 24 days in Tibet the 1920s,the book is authored by Trijang Rinpoche and translated into English by Michael Richards.Based on Je Tsong Khapa's work in The Lamrim Chenmo,&lt;Liberation...> delivers an \\"executive summary\\" of the three volumes of &lt;The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment> into 898 pages vis-a-vis three volumes of Je Tsong Khapa's detailed scholarly work.This book &lt;Liberation...> is not a Great Treatise on the Path to Enlightenment for Dummies, it is a concise commentary on &lt;The Treatise...> which readers of The Great Treatise may find as a useful companion to the three profound and wonderfully translated volumes of &lt;The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment: The Lamrim Chenmo>.For readers who do not know what really to expect from three volumes of the &lt;The Great Treatise...>, I would stongly recommend &lt;Liberation in the Palms of Your Hand> as a preliminary read.

Lama Tsong-Kha-Pa elucidates the nature of life and of meditation so clearly and beautifully. Using pure reason, this book leads one through to an understanding of many subtle points about the spiritual path that would otherwise be extremely difficult to understand. The translators seem to have done an excellent job, and I'm so very thankful to them for providing us with this book which is certainly worth more than its weight in jewels."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"Je Tsong Kha Pa's Stages of the Path of Enlightenment, is arguably the single most important work ever produced about Tibetan Buddhism. This great Buddhist adept masterfully fashioned a cogent and logical exploration of the steps, that faithfully followed, could lead to Enlightenment in a single lifetime. The scholars involved in this translation are a veritable \\"Who's Who\\" of Tibetan Buddhist thought in the West. This eminently readable and thoroughly researched volume should be in the library of anyone who is interested in this rich spiritual tradition."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"If you want to know what you must do to become enlightened, these three volumes are the ones to read. The steps are laid out very plainly. Be prepared -- these books are not a quick-read. It took 6 months of daily effort just to read through them once because the reading is heavy and thought-provoking. The third volume is the hardest to understand because it goes into Buddhist logic (Madhyamaka) so people who have not been exposed to those ideas before reading this book might find the third volume challenging. (My suggestion is to listen to Chapter 9: Wisdom and the Bodhisattva Path of Pema Chodron's CD set on the Way of the Bodhisattvah available at http://www.pemachodrontapes.org/bodhisattva.htm#bodhi or read Center of the Sunlit Sky by Karl Brunnholzl available through Amazon.com atThe Center of the Sunlit Sky: Madhyamaka in the Kagyu Tradition (Nitartha Institute Series).) I have read a lot of books on this topic and this set is the most comprehensive and easiest to follow, albeit longest. Of course, putting what is contained within is the hard part, but at least the explanation is there so you have a leg up on the work. If I was only allowed three books to own for the rest of my life, these would be the ones I would keep."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"I have been trying my best to follow Je Tsongkapa's advice for years now. These teachings are very special as they are the 'Lam Rim' or 'Stages of The Path' teachings originally formulated by Atisha for Tibetans. It is a very condensed yet essential presentation of all Buddha's teachings. In Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's Lam Rim texts, the number of meditations is 21. In other contemporary Lam Rim texts like that of Geshe Rabten, H.H. Dalai Lama, or Geshe Sopa, the number varies.What is amazing is the Lam Rim's simplicity and clarity. Add to that Je Tsongkapa's stainless reasoning and vast scriptural knowledge and you have a spiritual masterpiece.This is not to say other texts from other traditions aren't valid. I just relate to these teachings most powerfully.If I have any complaints about the text it would be in the translation the word 'sin' is used instead of 'negativity' or something less charged. Also, there was not one Tibetan out of like 20 people on the translation committee for this book. That's why 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"If you are very well versed in Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism, this is a great book. But it's not for the casual reader. It's a hard read. But for someone with a good Buddhist background, this is a must-read. I did, however, has a problem with some of the guidelines laid down in the book. I felt they were not the true teachings that I have come to learn about Buddhism. For example, in the teaching about sexuality, it admonished men that it was okay to hire a prostitute. I didn't think that was an especially enlightened admonishment. Furthermore, it totally ignored how a woman should behave. This is quite a turn off as it is one reason many women turn off of all religions. It also didn't allow tolerance for other traditions. This goes against everything I hear HH The Dalai Lama speak about. So I did have some problems with the text and I'm not sure how true to the traditional oral tradition of Tibetan Buddhism it remains. I would welcome other thoughts on this."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"The books are a great help in doing essays on refuge and boddh. vows great learning tool for those that only get to see their teacher once a month"},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"In short, this is THE manual for life.Based on ancient findings and universal laws, the most in depth exploration of the mind by Indian and Tibetan masters, it provides the A to Z 'operational guidelines' for every human being. That includes the ones with lesser, as well the ones with greatest capacity.If you're sincerely interested in developing your potential to any degree - ultimately fully to enlightenment - this is the ultimate and perfect instruction, provided you've found yourself a qualified teacher. If you haven't, the text provides instructions on how to find one and identify the fonies out there.And one final advice - yes, find a qualified teacher ASAP. We're reluctant on this issue, but it's obvious to us to have teacher when learning a new language, music instrument etc. So, a person with higher capacities and exemplary conduct and attainments is inevitable to lead us on the path of our personal/spiritual development.Finally, the text is best studied with the original Atisha's work and the commentaries. Also, try to attend the teachings on this subject you can find online. H.H. Dalai Lama's recent teaching in Mundgod, Southern India is a good start.The knowledge will expand your consciousness to a new extent that will be visible to you, and that you'll be able to use in your daily life.

If you can laugh and cry at his poetry than you will begin to understand the Buddha's dharma.If you still believe that words such as sacred, enlightenment, liberation have meaning than you will never really know the truth beyond words and concepts.Never really know what the Buddha's liberation was all about.All the best."},{"Title":"The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightenment Vol 1","review":"for those who desire a strongly structured spiritual path, then the Lam-Rim would be a good choice for you.

This is an element of ownership not usually dealt with in other buyer's guides.The writer's style is concise and amusing and if you are even thinking about buying a Porsche, this is a great place to start.

Although having owned Porsches--mostly 911s--since the late sixties, I found lots of things in Peter's book I never knew about. He is very, very knowledgeable with regard to these cars and he has a unique and very readable style by which he shares this information with his readers.

In searching for a used 911, you probably know that its essential to have a comprehensive service record, but this book will give you some clues as to specifically what to look for in the service record for specific model years such as head studs, clutch work, etc. Also, the chapter on gray market Porches was very informative. The section on the prepurchase inspection was also quite interesting - its alot more involved than I thought. My only complaints is that he doe not spend a great deal on the turbos and what is involved with them like how long do the components last for specific years, how much to repair and such.

We still get Lili, the sexy superstar in search of her mother. We get the three school chums who stay united through thick and thin (or through \\"sick and sin\\" according to French Maxine), the men in their lives, the Valentine dance ball, and the birth of an illegitimate child. But what's added to this already rich cast of characters is a brochette of less than colorful ones, like Guy, the struggling designer who's storyline about stolen creations doesn't really go anywhere, and the introduction of a fourth friend named Kate who's presence only ends up being lukewarm. Yet author Conran knows how to create some effective moments. Lili's trapped-in-a-spiderweb-like lifestyle is a page-turning experience that adds depth to her thinly veiled character, and Abdullah's political marginality is a riveting take from the already established views of the Frenches and the Americans. But moments like those aren't a dime a dozen in this novel. What could have been a fun, unique experience of getting into the psyche of all the main characters already introduced on TV turned out to be an overlong, under-edited unimpressiveness that shouldn't have been. A shame.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Gossips, Gorgons and Crones: The Fates of the Earth","review":"People use that phrase all the time til it has no meaning but when I read this book it really did blow my mind. A powerful trip through modern culture that really holds nothing back. I was in a daze after reading this book but am so very glad I did. It gave me a whole new perspective on why modern society is so messed up. It condems the social construct that allows people to hurt and even distroy one another and our home the earth with out remorse. I totally love this book and wish more people would read it.Do Not read this book if you are attached to the cultural ideal of Men being automatically better than Women &amp; that they only have worth if the are dominating somesome.I just wish I could write a review as brilliently as Jane Caputi writes so more people would check out this awesome book!"},{"Title":"Gossips, Gorgons and Crones: The Fates of the Earth","review":"I'm sorry, but this book just did not work for me. I sympathize with many eco-feminist notions, but this book makes poorly researched and shaky claims, seeking to link together variables that have no connection, making generalized, fluffy arguments.The main point of this book is, of course, the linkage between patriarchial society and the nuclear age. The writer provides very strange and eclectic examples from popular culture which are vague, at best, and more often it seems that the writer sought to locate casual references to suit her claim. For example, in several places, the writer refers to titles of different articles about nuclear weapons and about the dangers of maleness (incest - which she seems to regard as a general trait of fatherhood) which happen to appear in the same issue of Time or Newsweek - not as a coincidence, but as a joint issue. She looks at the cover of a magazine, citing different article names, and we're supposed to reach a conclusion that this linkage is not coincidental, and that it is part of the alleged male-nuclear conspiracy.The writer analyzes similar material in opposite ways when it supports her argument - first identifying the bomb with the male, then with the female. She seems to have thrown the darts before marking the target.Another disturbing factor is the generalized and problematic, to say the least, condemnation of what the writer describes as \\"nuclear fatherhood\\". All fathers are compared, as a general group, to Reagan and Freddy Krueger. Need I say more?I did find the spiritual contents of this book (such as the idea of the Gorgon) fascinating and useful - especially due to the (regrettable) lack of serious and intelligent discussion of Feminist spirituality as a deserving issue and not merely a bag of love spells. I wish these contents could be given to us separately, and not within a poorly researched scholarly work that does not give credit to its readers as intelligent beings who can evaluate material by themselves, without being spoonfed the conclusions which by no means stem from the material. As a woman who cares deeply about women's issues and about this planet, I believe this book does damage to the general cause by alienating 99.99% of the people who could be responsive to eco-feminism and its ideas. It's sad, really."},{"Title":"Children of the Storm: The True Story of the Pleasant Hill School Bus Tragedy","review":"Children of the Storm: The True Story of the Pleasant Hill School Bus TragedyAriana Harner and Clark SecrestOn a clear, sunny spring day in 1931 the bus driver, Carl Miller, made his route to bring the twenty children to the Pleasant Hill school house, a one room building located on the plains of Kiowa County, Colorado. Upon arriving, a terrible storm cloud came up from the north. Carl Miller and the teachers decided they should send the children home, instead of keeping them at the one room school house without food or water. The bus started out in what was then a blinding blizzard. It was not long before he was lost, finally ran off the road, and the bus was stranded.Finally, Mr. Miller thought that it would be best for him to try to find help. He asked the oldest child on the bus, Bryan Untiedt, to make sure the other children do not go to sleep. Do whatever he could to keep them from freezing to death. Some of the children had very little for coats. Mr. Miller was soon lost and later found frozen to death. There were no phones and the only help was from families and friends, who were unable to find them until the second day. They found three children had already frozen to death and seventeen were still alive. They were all taken to the hospital for treatment of frostbite on their hands, feet, etc...The Denver Post interviewed the children and families. Bryan Untiedt was promoted as a \\"hero\\" by the Post. Other newspapers were interviewing and photographing the survivors, as well.Nineteen days after the tragedy, all the survivors and their families were invited to Denver for one week to see different sites. Mr. Bonfils, the owner of the Denver Post, presented all the survivors with some cash and a gold-plated heroism medal. Bryan Untiedt was also invited to Washington, D.C. by President Herbert Hoover.This story was very informative about what can happen in a short time with spring storms and how dangerous they can be on the plains of Colorado. I did not like how the media made Bryan Untiedt a hero more than the other survivors. I feel that you should read this book called Children of the Storm. Ages 8 to Adult.

As we were leaving the grounds of the monument, we noticed the Big Indian Tepee Trading Post (or something to that effect) across the road (\\"Gifts, Souvenirs, T-Shirts, Cold Drinks, Food, Whatever\\"). I didn't feel like getting scalped in a tourist ambush, but my wife wanted to check it out. So, of course, we stopped. And, I'm glad we did, because I came across this absolutely marvelous book.Owen Tully Stratton was a medicine show pitchman from 1898 to 1904, and a licensed, small town MD from 1906 to 1950. MEDICINE MAN is his memoir, as edited by his son. In the book's first 100 pages, Owen recounts his crisscrossing of Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Montana and Idaho as a medicine show huckster. While today one might view such an entrepreneur as not much better than a used car salesman at best, or scam artist at worst, I learned one very surprising fact. Owen's medicine show, and the others he talks about, regularly employed an MD licensed in the state they were traveling through. In any town the show happened to be working, the physician would set up a temporary office to see patients referred to him by the pitchman. The show's MD was not necessarily any more of a quack than the local medicos, so he was actually in a position to provide legitimate medical care - and often did. Of course the medicine show and its tame MD were bitterly resented by the local sawbones and pill pushers.The remainder of the volume is Owen's recollection of his life as a degreed and licensed MD, practicing at various times in Washington, Idaho and Montana. It was a hard existence, both on himself and his family. But Dr. Stratton reminisces with a perceptive wit that calls to mind the writings of the great Mark Twain. At one point, the author, a self-confident general practitioner (GP) but reluctant surgeon, recounts the time he assisted on an appendectomy with a more experienced, but inebriated, cutter:\\"My surgeon, in his drunken enthusiasm, discarded contaminated instruments by throwing them against the wall. The patient knew nothing of that, and her convalescence was uneventful. With that experience, my surgical feet warmed up a trifle.\\"Evident to the reader are the striking differences between the practice of medicine then and now, with some not necessarily for the better. Take, for example, \\"house calls\\". For those of you too young to be acquainted with the concept, a house call was a visit by a physician to a patient's home to render care. This was simply the way medicine was practiced in those days, and up until the time of the mid 20th century. (As a young boy in the early 50's, I remember accompanying my father, also a GP, on his house call rounds.)I cannot recommend this book to highly. I was particularly impressed by the circumstances surrounding the good doctor's own death, as related by his son in an Editor's Epilog. His departure from life was pure class.My own father is deceased these past 25 years, but I shall give this volume to my mother, also an MD. Her maternal grandfather was a physician in rural Missouri at the end of the 19th century, and I'm sure she'll find it as fascinating as I did."},{"Title":"Medicine Man (Western Frontier Library)","review":"I enjoy US History and initially bought this book thinking it would shed some light on frontier life. It did but was I ever pleasantly surprised. Medicine Man is the autobiography of Owen Tully Stratton. Born and raised in Litchfield, Illinois during the 1870's, he attends pharmacy school in St. Louis. But upon graduating, instead of tending a drug store, he becomes a gambler simply because he liked the hours better. Down on his luck he heads west to Washington Territory and, after a stint in the Yukon goldfields, he becomes a Medicine Man, partnering with a variety of fellow flimflam men to fleece unsuspecting audiences with phony and some not so phony treatments for various ailments. He spent over 10 years traveling throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho, the Dakotas and California swindling local populations.Deciding to exit this business he attends medical school and becomes a Doctor, constantly moving from town to town in his elusive search for financial security. Along the way he serves several terms in the Idaho Senate and even takes a run at the US Senate. His was an interesting life and he appears to have been quite a conscientious physician returning multiple times for post graduate training in Chicago and Minnesota's Mayo Clinic at a time when continuing professional education was not required.Three things jumped out to me from this book. First, the state of medical knowledge was in its infancy when Stratton practiced. Thus his self motivated efforts at continued professional education were quite atypical of his time. Despite his earlier profession he was no quack. He liked what he did, was conscientious and was good at it. Second was his dedication to his patients. Practicing general medicine on the frontier from a horse and buggy, often without consulting physicians or hospitals as we know them today, was an adventure in guesswork. Third was his amazing sense of humor which shows through on almost every page of this interesting work.I found this book a complete hoot, yet quite instructive of the geography and the economics of its time. Owen Stratton was a crusty humorist, a man who related his life's story as he saw it and a person who would have made an excellent neighbor, hunting or fishing companion.Dr. Stratton was uncommonly witty and the writing is excellent.

In this audiobook, her words are conversational but there are some very profound insights about Femininity and our roles as women in society.While there are lots of books on Female Wisdom (including much recycled knowledge), what Sobonfu Some reveals about women in her culture is more specific and rather unique. Hardly any indigenous women have revealed the secrets and understandings of their culture to the Western world. (Men like Malidoma Some and Martin Prechtel have made some inroads from the male perspective.) I found her views helpful in bringing a richer dimension to being a woman in our culture that expects women (and their concomitant biology) to conform to expectations set by spiritual amnesiacs.Don't expect her to sound like a scholar or a deep-throated wise woman.

This is an elegant, witty, and very readable translation which adds much to the appreciation of Balzac. The translator, Henry Reed, was a well regarded poet in the UK. His only other Balzac translation is of Eugenie Grandet, out of print, but worth looking for."},{"Title":"Pere Goriot (Signet Classics)","review":"I had four days to read this for a class, so I budgeted my time and decided to read around 70 pages a day. But this book was so enjoyable that I couldn't put it down, and I ended up reading 90 pages on the first day and the remaining 190 on the second. This is an engrossing story of devotion, betrayal, ambition, humility, crime, and innocence, told at a pleasantly brisk pace and peppered with profound observations on human nature. Goriot, Rastignac, and Vautrin are amazing characters, right up there with the creations of Dickens and Shakespeare.As for the translation, I don't know French and therefore can't judge Henry Reed's faithfulness to Balzac's expression. But as English, Reed's prose is flawless."},{"Title":"Pere Goriot (Signet Classics)","review":"Getting involved in the works of Balzac is like entering a magnificently equipped library with an insatiable appetite for books. His output was prodigious: novels, short stories, and essays, but it is primarily the HUMAN COMEDY for which he is best known. The complexity that is that book had its origins much earlier in his novel FATHER GORIOT (PERE GORIOT). Balzac liked to move characters back and forth from book to book like chess pieces. In much of his fiction, he places his characters in cities like Paris that are center of dissolution and corruption that test their moral mettle. Most often they fail, but it is in their failures that give his work their distinctive flavor.Father Goriot is an old, sick pensioner who has raised his two daughters improperly such that they now return his earlier parental errors with daughterly ingratitude that elevates him to the status of a wounded Lear. He lives in a boarding house on the third floor, the cheapest floor. He had once been able to avoid the more expensive lower, but as he has given far too much of his dwindling resources to his greedy daughters, he is now facing poverty. This boarding house is a bustling center of activity, with Goriot only one part. A young and money hungry lawyer Eugene de Rastignac lives there too. He is handsome, witty, and definitely willing to bend a few rules to advance in the cesspool that is Parisian society. Eugene becomes the lover to one of Goriot's wealthy daughters, hoping that she can open doors to him that might otherwise have been closed. This daughter Delphine is only slightly less mercenary than her sister Anastasie, with whom Delphine is not on speaking terms. A friend of Eugene, Vautrin, who is aware of Eugene's poverty, offers to kill the brother of a woman that Eugene is dating, thus ensuring that in the event of a marriage, Eugene will marry into money. The primary focus of the story is on the disintegrating relation between Goriot and his daughters. They take his money until there is no more. For his part, Goriot remains inexplicably oblivious to their machinations. When he dies, both daughters find reasons not to attend the funeral which only Eugene attends. FATHER GORIOT is a novel of pessimism. It is not an unpleasant read, just an unpleasant topic, yet in Balzac's dramatic portrayal of the origins and consequences of greed and betrayal, it shows the depths to which people may plunge, while an uncaring city does little more than sit back and not take notice."},{"Title":"Pere Goriot (Signet Classics)","review":"In these brilliantly written studies of the \`human heart', Honor&eacute; de Balzac proves to be a master of suspense, creating mysteries and revealing the hidden histories, goals, truths, motives, emotions, desires and strategies behind the differently marked faces in this novel which represent all segments of the \`human comedy'.Through his mouthpiece, Vautrin, he shouts loudly his view on human society and the bold strategies needed to survive in \`an ocean of mud'.Characters, not typesBalzac doesn't work with \`types' (G. Luk&aacute;cs) but with \`characters': P&egrave;re Goriot's loving daughters become harpies in the hands of their husbands, who squeeze the juicy orange and throw away the peel in the gutter.Mankind and societyThe author's mouthpiece, the criminal Vautrin, describes \`the world as it is: laws and morality powerless against wealth, and success the ultimo ratio mundi. Wealth can buy everything. At the bottom of every great fortune without apparent source, there's always some crime - a crime overlooked because it's been carried out respectably.' \`How corrupt are women here, and how despicably vain the men.'StrategiesAt the bottom, there are only two strategies to survive: stupid obedience or revolt.\`The poor drones which do the hard work without getting the slightest reward for their labors, the ones I call the Brotherhood of God's Down-at-Heels. To be sure that's virtue at the height of its stupidity.'The right strategies are: \`the more coldly you calculate, the further you'll go. Strike without pity; and you'll be feared. Look at men and women simply as post-horses, and leave them behind as soon as they're exhausted. And if you have any feeling, hide it like treasure.'In this superbly built novel, Balzac combines formidably cunning writing strategies to keep the reader on the edge of his seat, while at the same time painting extraordinary vivid and highly emotional scenes of the human \`comedy'.This novel is a must read for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"Pere Goriot (Signet Classics)","review":"When I began reading \\"P&egrave;re Goriot\\", I wasn't sure I would like it, because for the first dozen pages or so, Balzac let the narrative voice run riot. Granted, the narrative voice has its place in terms of creating for the reader setting, mood, and characters. But once those elements have been established, I prefer that the narrator step aside and let the main characters have their say.Thankfully, Balzac spared me further agonies upon introducing the young Rastignac (a rube and law student from Southern France keen to make his mark in genteel Parisian society), the wily and mysterious Vautrin, Goriot himself, and a few of the other characters in Madame's Vauquer's boarding house. They, together with their friends, lovers, and rivals, made this novel well worth reading.Simply put, \\"P&egrave;re Goriot\\" succeeds as a morality play on French society in the immediate post-Napoleonic era"},{"Title":"Pere Goriot (Signet Classics)","review":"Towards the end of the book there is brilliantly crafted dialogue between the two sisters, back and forth: make a point, loose a point on the counter attack.

I mean, jaw on the floor, gaping as I read, type of floored me. Who knew Balzac could be so approachable? I picked up this book fully expecting to struggle through it, much like my earlier trials with Middlemarch, and instead I found myself thoroughly intrigued by this drama. And Balzac himself, as narrator of the story of Father Goriot, calls it a drama, although he hastens to explain that it isn't quite the same as those other dramas of the time.The word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature; but it must do service again here, not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over. - Father Goriot by BalzacThe story is focused around two characters - Father Goriot and a young, law student named Eugene Rastignac. They are acquainted by being one of several boarders in a respectable, if a bit shabby, boarding house in Paris, France. Goriot is the father of two married daughters, and Rastignac is, at the expense of his parents and two sisters, attempting to marry into society and wealth - but in a respectful way!This drama has everything - murder and intrigue through the character of Vautrin, the Trick of Death. It has humor - there is an entire scene which made me think of our modern day Snoop Dog \\"shizzle\\" moments - Balzac talks about how the diorama has recently been unveiled, and as a result, in passing, humorous conversation, the morpheme \\"orama\\" is added to the end of random words - such as Goriot-orama. There is an entire scene at the dinner table in which words are bantered about, and even referenced later in the book that had me laughing out loud in sheer delight. It has tragedy - the outcome of Father Goriot and his daughters relationship is one that, as Balzac foretells, worthy of tears. It showcases both the good and bad sides of the human character, and provides an interesting commentary on situations and feelings that are relevant still today.Some day you will find out that there is far more happiness in another's happiness than in your own - BalzacThe human heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height of affection, but we seldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred - BalzacI wish I could go further into the quotes and how many things I highlighted on my Kindle - but then this entire review would be just repeated quote after quote, since there are quite a few of them. I have to encourage you to pick up this book and read it - I hope you will find it as fascinating as I did. Such an incredible story of the tragedy of life."},{"Title":"Pere Goriot (Signet Classics)","review":"Hesitant at first, I rapidly developed an interest in the book. On the surface it provides a snapshot of Paris in the early 1800s. Dig a little deeper and you get a feel for what de Balzac called \\"The Human Comedy.\\" Would recommend a few minutes on the internet researching the author before you begin this book. Understanding de Balzac and the place \\"Pere Goriot\\" occupies in his rich collection of books adds to the enjoyment. A very good read."},{"Title":"Pere Goriot (Signet Classics)","review":"This is a great novel. Read it for an English course and enjoyed it. Great experience ordering book and was a great price.

There are exhaustingly long descriptions of places and characters, and endless monologues. In the end we don't find out what happens to one of the key characters, and it just seemed like a grand waste of time to me. Also, some of the prose is written in an unnecessarily flowery way making it a slow read where you are not even sure what he is talking about. I would have preferred to spend my time bouncing a ball off a wall."},{"Title":"Plates and buckles of the American military, 1795-1874","review":"WILL BUY FROM THIS PERSON AGAINVERY NICE,THE BOOK WAS IN GREAT SHAPE,JUST A GREAT JOB OVER ALL."},{"Title":"20-Minute Super Suppers (Better Homes & Gardens Fresh & Simple)","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, as I am a gourmet cook and like only the best. In fact, my whole family cooks. My son is a chef and I am use to spending a lot of time preparing a fine dining experience. However, like most of us, through the week I don't have the time nor the inclination to spends hours cooking. I have made more than 20 of the meals so far in this book and we love them. They are simple with fresh ingredients and spices that are a delight to the palate. The suppers are also healthy and often low in calories, which is an added bonus. I believe this will be become my favorite cookbook for quick and delicious meals."},{"Title":"20-Minute Super Suppers (Better Homes & Gardens Fresh & Simple)","review":"The first recipe I tried was the Thai Chicken Wraps. There were heating instructions for the tortillas for both microwave and oven. The vegetables called for a packaged shredded broccoli slaw mix which definitely sped up the process because you're not slicing and dicing all those vegetables. The seasoning was salt, pepper, gingerroot and peanut sauce. I would have preferredKikkoman Thai Style Chili Saucebecause the gingerroot is so expensive and not easily kept and the peanut sauce did not remind me of Thai flavors. Nevertheless it was a good meal and ready in about 20 minutes or so.The Fabulous Focaccia Sandwiches are deli cooked rotisserie chicken that you shred and a jar of roasted red peppers. You add the spinach and mayo. I don't know if I needed a recipe to make a cold-cut sandwich?? But it wasn't ready in 15 minutes as it says because it took me a half hour to get the chicken off the bone.The Tuscan Lamb Shop Skillet called for cooking lamb rib chops without adding any seasoning, not even salt and pepper. They were then placed on a bed of cannellini beans, stewed tomatoes and balsamic vinegar. That's the dish on the cover.There are pictures for about every 5th recipe. Most are what you'd expect, there are fresh ingredients, but you're to buy the pre-cut washed vegetables for faster prep and cooking times. Other shortcuts are quick cooking rice, use of the microwave, meat cut into small pieces for cooking, Boboli crusts, jar of pesto, refrigerator pasta, minced jar of garlic (not fresh), etc. So the cost of the meals goes up for this convenience.Some of the meals are too small for even a family of 4. The sea scallops meal is just one pound of sea scallops cooked with cajun seasoning over a bed of wilted spinach. I think each person got 3-4 scallops and 1/4 c. spinach. That's too small and certainly would have anybody coming back for more food an hour later.The Trattoria-style Spinach Fettuccine is fettuccine and cut up red and yellow tomatoes with a little feta cheese. No protein is in this recipe, so unless you're a vegetarian you'd have to add something to make it an entree.Bottom line this cookbook delivers on what it says, the meals are fresh and simple. I don't think many had more than 5-6 ingredients. Just realize you'll probably have to add additional time if you want to add sides, salad or bread. This cookbook does provide nutritional data and you know Better Homes and Gardens produces a well put together book, the pictures are nice, pages are glossy so they wipe clean, and the binding is good.The best part I liked about the book and the reason I kept it was the wonderful Caponata sauce recipe in the back. I let it simmer for half the afternoon and it was delicious. You can then freeze it in portions for future use.Another good cookbook option isExpress Lane Cookbook: Real Meals for Really Busy PeopleorRachael Ray Express Lane Meals: What to Keep on Hand, What to Buy Fresh for the Easiest-Ever 30-Minute Meals."},{"Title":"20-Minute Super Suppers (Better Homes & Gardens Fresh & Simple)","review":"This is my favorite cookbook for so many reasons. It has a variety of gourmet meals that cater to all appetites, the recipes are simple, quick, and healthy, and everything that I've made from it is delicious. In fact, I am ordering other books in the series right now, and getting another copy of this book for a friend.I would recommend this cookbook to anyone - beginner or expert cook. It doesn't require a lot of effort to create impressive meals quickly. Favorite recipes include Thai Chicken Wraps, Scallops with Bacon and Spinach, Honey Glazed Tuna Steaks, and Pork with Sweet Cherry Sauce. Mmmm, don't those sound good?If you don't have a lot of time or inclination to cook, this book is for you!

Unfortunately, many chauvinistic Cubans have attributed to Marti qualities that simply were not there. One of them is that this novel by him was a masterpiece which, in reality, was nothing of the sort. In fact, Marti himself admits to it being an inferior work on his part, written simply at the orders of his editor as a filler for the newspaper that he was working. It says much for the author that he admitted the deficiencies himself. As such, the work is mostly of historical worth rather than a literary one."},{"Title":"Roots of Confrontation in South Asia: Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and the Superpowers","review":"The book is a great introduction for anybody who just wants to know a little bit more about the region and why things are the way they are. Woolpert throws a lot of relevant (and irrelevant) historical data at the reader. However, the presentation is not always fluid. He has a tendency to jump around from event to event. He also keeps coming back to the same events at different points in the book, making it a bit jarring.Taking all the information he has provided, most sane minded strategic thinkers would reach conclusions far removed from the authors. His viewpoint is simply idealistic. Realpolitik demands that we look at the situation from a more pragmatic perspective. What is &quot;right&quot; is not always &quot;good&quot;.The other thing is that with time (and especially recent events) this book is begging for a rewrite. A lot of his conclusions are already flat out wrong. Many others seem misguided in view of recent events.There are other better books on the subject (&quot;the great game&quot;) that stand the tests of time and pragmatism better than this one. If you read it because your library does not have any of the others, fine. Don't go out and buy it."},{"Title":"The SAGE","review":"Highly enjoyable!A very interesting plot that leads the characters through the jungles of Panama in search of a lost Spanish treasure...what more can you ask for?????My compliments to the author for his narrative skills that take us with great precision through the complicated set of emotions that the search party goes through in their quest.Also exceptional in the descriptions of Panama.

And from reading this book trading will also be part of his future.This book also introduces everyone to William O'Neil's famous newspaper Investor's Business Daily.

Countless pages are wasted as blanks, which allow for this book to be read in an hour or two.

The majority of this book concerns itself with the application of an investment model closely tied to Mr O'neil's Investment Business Daily, and Daily Graphs. And that model is only relevant within the working practices of the American Stock Market, and its performance characteristics over the last forty years.It seems to me, that by following the recommended procedures, to the letter, in conjunction with the much heralded Investment Business Daily, Mr O'Neil's assertions will be mostly self fulfilling: after all, if you only buy expensive stocks imbued with all the requisite characteristics and religiously sell at 8% below the buying price to minimise losses there's not much risk. But in order to maintain that security you need to keep up with IBD and Daily Graphs at further dollars, since the model is graphically based.It was, also, quite a hoot to read Bill's opinion of foreign stocks and how they were dubious in comparison to those from the States because of uncertain political climates. As I type this, Microsoft, one of Bill's greatest examples, is being well marked down by the uncertainty of the ongoing anti-trust action, that looks to me, over here, in the UK, as sheer bloody mindedness by the American courts. So much then for the greatly lauded system of free enterprise. For further insight to this, read the, Brokers, chapter of Studs Terkel's, \`Working' in which a long serving stockbroker, Ray Wax, talks about his time in the Market, Jesse Livermore, and the 1066.Anyway, 24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success , is good to read in itself, but care should be exercised if contemplating any further investment in Mr O'Neil's publications, since the not inconsiderable sums of money might be more gainfully employed in some of those less than $15.00 shares, he so dislikes.

Yes, O'Neil does make many references to his newspaper &quot;Investor's Business Daily&quot; but, &quot;24 Essential Lessons...&quot; is such an abridged version of his other work, it only makes sense that he would direct us to his other publicatons so that we can read his elaborated thoughts on any and every topic."},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"Bill O'Neil is certainly an experienced Wall Street trader, but he, talking bussiness, \\"tends\\" to use his books as an advertisement campaign for Investor's Business Daily, a newspaper he created and own.

I viewed it simply as a place to start. Halfway through the book I had already trained myself not to be irritated by the excessive advertising for IBD because I liked what I was learning.Bottom line? I guess the value of the book is not what it costs, but how we individually can relate to the information presented.

The same applies to books and you usually can't go wrong reading any one of them. O'Neil's book is no exception and there is lots in it especially for the beginning investor. Perhaps that's why the crass commercialism in favor of IBD hurts so much. Also disturbing are the frequent errors in logic that include begging the question (buy a stock that will go up), false analogy (the stock market is a battlefield), and over generalization (cut losses when your stock falls 8% from where you bought it). On the other hand I like the ideas that paper trading does not cut it: does not give you the real experience of being in the market and I certainly agree that you should sell your worst performing stocks first otherwise you will end up with a portfolio of dogs.

It's fairily basic and so those with a good amount of previous stock market knowledge will get much less than those who are fairily new.That being said the techniques are optimized (e.g. he gives 7-8% as maximum for stop-loss) for the \\"CAN SLIM\\" (an acronym) strategy that is explained in \\"How To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Edition\\" by William J.

No doubt much of the book discusses how to interpret content of IBD, but there are useful buy and sell criteria.

The emphasis on the information contained in his paper stems from the fact that it is the same information that he uses for his selection process. You could get the same information from the Wall Street Journal, you'd just have to set up complicated spreadsheets to arrive at those results. That said, this, like all other investment books, should be read critically as no investment strategy is without faults."},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"I read \`The Successful Investor' and \`How To Make Money in Stocks' by O'Neil.

The author says that the most important lesson that investors should follow is to cut investment losses after an 8% decline.Unlike other investment books that either preach following fundamental or technical analysis, this book recommends using both before making purchasing and selling decisions. Fundamental analysis tells investors about the quality of the companies and technical analysis explains price movements. For those who master these lessons, investment success is more likely to happen.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

It takes time, study diligence and patience coupled with controlling ones emotions to become an excellent investor.William O'Neil, who started a successful financial paper known as Investors Business Daily, wrote How to Make Money in Stocks. Decade of research, critical thinking and common sense has helped O'Neil to create some very powerful ways of investing successfully. He melds both the technical and fundamental aspects of investing.Each of the 24 lessons in this book is provided in a chapter form. Just a few of the powerful lessons are: Follow a system Rather Than your Emotions (Lesson 3), How to Buy a Stock at Just the Right Moment (Lesson 9) How to Gauge the Stock market's Health (Lesson 12) and many more.I have read many books, magazines and articles on investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds and more over the years. O'Neil's ideas are some of the most solid and consistent I have found to apply to the stock market. They are easy to read and understand the basic...but like anything worth while...it takes years to be good. I have read three of O'Neil's books and have found rich ideas in all of them.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"O'Neill doesn't waste a lot of time with arguments and research. This book presents his trading program, the nuts and bolts of selecting winning stocks. This is the antithesis of the traditional \\"buy and hold, diversify\\" approach. He advocates picking stocks that the market currently favors (Upward momentum) and that show strong earnings growth. In part this book is an advertisement (or, in more positive terms, a guide) for Investor's Business Daily, which the writer is closely affiliated with. There are other approaches to the stock market, but this is one approach which many investors find profitable."},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"This book is a great tool for a serious investor, but can be difficult to understand if you are new to the stock market. Bill O'Neil reveals many of his own strategies for timing the market and investing in quality stocks. If you are serious about making money in the stock market, I would definitely recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"I liked this book although I would recommend you read O'Neil's classic, How to Make Money in Stocks, before reading this one. That's because this book basically begins where that one leaves off, and concentrates on which indicators and information to focus on as a further aid to analyzing and buying a stock. And not too surprisingly, O'Neil emphasizes that you can get all this information from the IBD. I recently looked at getting a subscription, but unfortunately, the relative strength and sector strengths info only come with the premium, or more expensive version of the subscription, but many experts regard getting and reading the IBD an essential component of their investing success.While I myself have never used that particular info myself, and have been able to do just fine in the market without it, the stock tables and indicators in the IBD do boil a lot of information and research down into such famous indicators as O'Neil's relative strength and sector strength ratings, EPS and volume information, and so on. Although you could get most of this information from other sources for no charge, IBD puts it all under one cover, and the relative strength indicator is something you can't get anywhere else. This is probably worth the price of the subscription as a time-saver, especially if it helps you make money. So I would essentially say this book is mainly for those who want to use O'Neil's system in conjunction with the info contained in the IBD, and are willing to put out the money for a subscription to get it."},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"\\"Praise for 24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success,\\" explains what every investor should know going into the stock market. O'Neil does a great job of explicating that when it comes to getting started, there's no time like the present. Passages on fundamental and technical analysis elaborate on how you are to use the stock market to your benefit. I think he has radiant ideas pertaining to ways of picking big winners in the stock market. Such as, most all of the brokers encourage you to buy low and sell high. O' Neil on the other hand takes a different approach in figuring to buy high and sell higher. The madness behind that theory is that you buy the best performers in the market which will be priced high. He creates a splendid scenario of his thesis for you. When you go purchase a car do you want a good car or a bad one? The obvious answer is a good one. Well in stocks it's the same way. It's worth the price to buy a good stock and as for the cheap stocks, there's a reason why there cheap. The best advice he gave was to cut your loses by selling your worst performing stocks rather then holding on to them for a possible comeback.

It contains a lot of buying/selling rules without any explanations as to why these rules work or as to how the author came up with these rules. Maybe I'm just not the person who would buy a stock solely based on the shapes of the stock and volume charts. (As an example, only 7 pages of this book are devoted to the fundamentals of companies. The remaining 150 pages are all about the shape of the stock chart!).If you really want to buy a good book, go and get &quot;One up on Wall Street&quot; by Peter Lynch and you'll know what I mean."},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"This book is an elaboration on the investment techniques in Mr. O'Neil's prior book, How to Make Money in Stocks. The elaboration focuses on additional insights into avoiding losses and using technical analysis (examining stock price and volume charts) to pick optimal stocks and times to buy and sell. If you haven't already read How to Make Money in Stocks, this book will lack context. I suggest that you not read this book until you have read that one. If you have read that one, this book will be valuable to you only if you plan to do your own stock picking and wish to use the Momentum Growth Investing model that Mr. O'Neil recommends in that book, and supports in Investors Business Daily. If this book is not yet right for you, based on these qualifications, you need read no further.If this book fits, then, let me go on to provide some caveats. First, it is often hard to limit your losses in the kinds of stocks recommended by this technique. Following a company warning about earnings, it is not unusual for these stocks to fall 15-40 percent without ever trading at any price in between. So your losses may well be larger than he suggests here.Second, technical analysis is a field that is filled with ambiguity. Your success in reading charts will not be as good as these examples suggest. Many academic studies fail to find any value in technical analysis.Third, the kind of stocks that are recommended can perform very poorly if the market goes through a prolonged drop in valuation (as last occurred from 1973-1975). You will be buying stocks that are trading at enormous multiples. You could experience more sustained losses than Mr. O'Neil suggests in such a changed market environment, if it were to recur.Fourth, few individuals have the discipline to adopt and follow a philosophy like this over a long enough time period to be successful.Fifth, if you are curious, it doesn't hurt to look. But remember that over most time periods 90 percent of professional investors do not match the market averages. And they have a lot of advantages you don't have. Be sure to also look at John Bogle's, Common Sense About Mutual Funds, to get the other side of the story.Having heard the caveats, let me say that Mr. O'Neil's advice is basically sound, well articulated, easy to follow, and balanced. It will make good reading for those who want to move toward developing the skills needed to be a self-directed investor in growth stocks being pushed along by earnings and investor momentum.Good luck with your investments! May they do well regardless of the philosophy you follow!"},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"O'Neil has attracted a wide and deep following as founder of Investor's Business Daily and as author of a previous best-selling book, How to Make Money in Stocks. In this book, he offers 24 \\"essential lessons\\" which he has learned from his extensive prior experience. Each of the \\"essential lessons\\" makes sense but I think they have the greatest value only when used together (in combination) as you formulate an investment plan. Once you have your plan and begin to implement it, understand that your work has only begun...not ended. Track earnings and sales, frequently check relative price strength, follow chart patterns, etc. (O'Neil's Lesson 11 explains \\"How to Read Stock Charts Like a Pro\\", not occasionally but \\"frequently\\" and better yet daily.) No doubt sophisticated investors view this book as \\"simplistic\\" and \\"obvious.\\" For them, it probably is. But for most of the rest of us, this book provides helpful explanations and sound advice. Also, as more people participate in 401 (k) plans and exercise stock options, a book such as this can give them a better understanding of their investments. I also recommend this book as a gift to recent graduates of college and universities.

It should also do well as a reference for experienced traders. O'Neil has taught his methods to thousands of traders over the years and made a lot of people very happy.The advice here isn't anything that hasn't been seen elsewhere, but it hasn't been put together in quite this way before either.If you aren't quite sure of the success of his methods, go no further than a terrific set of interviews with two of his top disciples.

If you keep that in mind you'll stay happy reading William O'Neil's latest book. You'll draw out useful nuggets and basic investing principles, but most of all, you'll better understand how basic principles well help you get the most out of IBD.The book is written in a basic interview approach-- someone probably asked questions and then recorded the answers over a period of years. That makes the volume consise and very easy to read. In fact, you'll barrel through it in no time.If you are relatively new to IBD, you need to read this. And, if you are a new subscriber you've probably received a copy with your subscription! If you didn't-- with patience, over time you can read through the book as it is reprinted chapter by chapter in the paper itself. O'Neil does this from time to time.Someone in another review said this book is a giant advertizement for the Daily. No denying that-- but rather than seeing the comment as a criticism, look at it as a worthwhile suggestion. If you are considering getting into investing, I'd strongly recommend Investor's Business Daily as one of your first steps toward starting your learning curve.And, if the book isn't included with your subscription, then be sure to pick it up at the same time."},{"Title":"24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success: Learn the Most Important Investment Techniques from the Founder of Investor's Business Daily","review":"For those just entering the stock market &quot;24 Essential Lessons...&quot; serves as an excellent primer.

Despite his tremendous knowledge in stocks, O'Neil's writing style is simple and is not full of confusing jargon. Although, some may find O'Neil's references to &quot;Investor's Business Daily&quot; to be self-serving, can you blame him for describing a method that has made him millions of dollars?

O'Neil states that one has to pay close attention to each stock, mutual fund, etc... Also, he points out that investing in too many stocks can come back to haunt you. Keep it simple and you will see results. O'Neil is a big advocate of keeping your basket small.O'Neil goes over buying and selling stocks in depth.

O'Neil's major concepts are higher highs in enormous volume, double bottom, flat base, and cup with a handle. Even looking at some charts he has in the book in hindsight appear misleading. I think IBD is an excellent resource, but here are my criticisms of this book. It was written during the tech boom. Anyone could have plopped money down and doubled it in a month. Too many times O'Neil brags about making 200% on a stock. He tells how one should never be afraid to jump into a stock with a PE over 100. In 2000 they were prominent, today, extreme rarity. Gee I wonder why. A cup and handle to you may be different to me and besides, by time you really realize it's a cup and handle or double bottom, you're already late to the party. Though I'm not too crazy about his steps for buying a stock, he does a thorough job explaining how he goes about establishing a position.

They range from \\"brilliant\\" and \\"essential\\" and \\"solid\\" to \\"caution.\\" William J. O'Neil is one of the great investors of our era if not of all time. Jack Schwager includes an interview with O'Neil in his first Market Wizards book, noting his ebullient optimism about the American economic system. O'Neil is a classic American success story who built dual fortunes as an investor and in business.24 Essential Lessons is a distillation of all that O'Neil has learned about selecting and timing in the stock market. He identifies seven common characteristics of the greatest growth stocks of all time, based on the extensive research published in his more comprehensive book \\"How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad.\\"The Preface to 24 Essential Lessons encourages those thinking about investing to get involved in stocks because \\"rarely have bull markets lasted so long or climbed so high.\\" This observation, written at the 2000 market top, might give one reason to pause to consider how markets work and then do further research before taking the plunge. However, O'Neil says \\"in my experience, fear and uncertainty are the great inhibitors to success of any kind.\\"Of the 24 lessons these are the key elements that stand out in my mind:- Follow a system rather than your emotions.- You must buy at just the right moment.- Learn how to spot market tops and bottoms.- Don't try to be a jack-of-all-trades.- Key sell rules (read them in the book).Two appendices add value for the reader: How to Learn from Models of Success, and Tales of Investors' Successes and Failures.Some caution is in order that is not made clear in the book. This stuff is not easy. If it were there would be a lot of market wizards flying around in their G550s. Or as one hedge fund manager says on his website, \\"it's a fact that many individuals who try to implement [O'Neil's] investment system get their proverbial heads lopped off.\\" That is not because it does not work. It is because implementation is hard for the average investor to do on a regular basis.This book is valuable for both novice and experienced investors. It is eye-opening, includes specifics that are of immediate use, and is written in a clear and understandable style. I rate it a 3-star book and recommend that those who are serious about investing read O'Neil's masterpiece, the \\"How to Make Money ...\\" book mentioned above, to get the bigger picture of his style."},{"Title":"Jung on Evil","review":"This is an excellent introduction to a central area in Jung's thought Evil, the Shadow Side and its integration with the rest of the personality.The selections from Jung's writings are excellent and there are extensive explanatory footnotes from the editor.Jung will convince you that those who supress their shadow side soon see it in others and that one's shadow side has to be accepted not denied.The book contains extensive selections from Answer to Job as well as hard to obtain Jung writings (unless you want to shell out a thousand dollars for his Collected Works).Throught the book, Jung's compassion, vast erudition, and many and varied insights shine through."},{"Title":"Jung on Evil","review":"a lesser known work by the master that explores the darkest elements of the human experience.Elaine Pagels is the only one I can think of who comes close to the wisdom of Jung on this particular subject.A classic, profound exploration of the dark side."},{"Title":"The history and power of mind,","review":"This book, more than most, requires interpretive reading.

In his preface, Mr. Smith states:\\"I have not attempted to give detailed accounts of the various battles and clashes that took place; many other books cover them in great detail. This work concentrates on the individuals and their experiences.\\"Translation: another account of Napoleon's Russian Campaign that spends much of its time, too much of its time, on the \\"sensational\\" aspects of the campaign, at the expense of a more objective historical account.Mr. Smith's apparent bias against Napoleon has been noted elsewhere (on Amazon), and evidence that such bias is real may be found in the prologue, where he writes, \\"What a monument to the incredible folly of one man.\\" Should not such conclusions be left to the reader, or do we need the professional historians hitting us over the head because we might somehow miss, or even disagree, with such conculsions?The bias gets worse further into the text. On page 110, Mr. Smith writes, in the context of the upcoming battle at Borodino:\\"So, in just two days the scales had suddently fallen from his [Napoleon's] eyes as to the efficiency of his general staff and his commissariat and to the extreme strategic attrition that his army was suffering, deep in hostile Russia. But why only now? --------- The truth is that the welfare of his army only became a matter of concern to him when it was painfully obvious that it was falling apart, melting away. A state of affairs that might endanger his own personal aims.\\"Mr. Smith is well-entitled to hold this point of view. What he fails to mention, seemingly every time he is critical of Napoleon, is that there is more than one side to the man, just as there is more than one side to the story.Other historians have written of Napoleon crying over the loss of life at battles. He could be callous; he could weap. My point is that Mr. Smith, the historian, fails to interact with points of view that are contrary to his. What we are left with is another piece of historical \\"pulp,\\" and a pricy one at that.When Mr. Smith writes of those loyal to Napoleon, he seems to feel the need to degrade such people because these contemporaries of Napoleon held views of him contary to Mr. Smith's. For example, after giving a lengthy quote from General de Fezensac, on pp. 73-74, where the general praised Napoleon's preparations for the campaign, Mr. Smith feels the need to follow this up by saying, \\"And if you'll believe that . . .\\" Yes, Mr. Smith, if I take General de Fezensac's word over yours concerning Napoleon's efforts at preparing for the Russian Campaign, I will what? Buy swampland in Florida from you? It isn't enough to insult Napoleon; Mr. Smith feels the need to insult readers who dare to disagree.At the end of one chapter, I think Mr. Smith makes an effort at humour, which, well, you decide. On page 108, he writes:\\"On hearing that Te Deums were being sung in St Petersburg to celebrate alleged Russian victories at Witebsk and Smolensk, Napoleon burst out indignantly: 'What! Te Deums? Then they dare to lie to God as they lie to men!' The Emperor was obviously annoyed that anyone else had dared to infringe his copywright.\\"If this is a joke? Regardless of what it is, is it necessary?I looked over my master's thesis. In roughly 160 pages, I have over 440 footnotes and a ten page bibliography. Mr. Smith provides us with roughly 235 pages, roughly 105 end-of-chapter notes, and a two page bibliography. Thank goodness Mr. Smith's reputation as an historian was not based on this book; I'm doubtful that my graduate school would have accepted it as a master's thesis without significant improvements. Then again, I am heavily biased towards the need to have \\"supporting evidence\\" to back-up and elaboarte on one's opinions. Is Mr. Smith wanting us to simply accept his word for it?The book does provide many, many valuable, interesting and lengthy quotations from various participants of the campaign. It is a shame that few (are any?) footnoted so that the interested reader, with the appropriate language skills, could attempt to follow-up and check Mr. Smith's sources. We must once again accept Mr. Smith's word.I may have missed it, but I do not belive that there is nary a map to be found that provides a context for the campaign as a whole. There are numerous maps of battles, weak in both detail and artistic skill (and this comes from someone who cannot draw a straight line without the help of a ruler; I speak of myself).Perhaps the most valuable aspect of the book is the attention given to the sections of the campaign, northern and southern, all too often ignored in other history books on the Russian Campaign.And no, Mr. Smith, I am not the reader who wrote one (two?) nasty reviews of your book on Leipzig, which is sitting on my shelf, waiting to be read. If I see the same Napoleonic bias and ill-humour as in Napoleon Against Russia, I'll feel twice burned.Mr. Smith, could you please tell me the titles of the best Napoleonic historical books that you have written? I would like to give you another chance or two."},{"Title":"Napoleon Against Russia","review":"Digby Smith, a proud self-avowed hater of Napoleon, again reveals his total lack of objectivity in his latest book on the Russian campaign (but then, someone who hates cannot be objective).Look elsewhere for far better histories of 1812 and far, far better Napoleonic historians.Jim ScottWailea, Maui, Hawai'i"},{"Title":"Napoleon Against Russia","review":"The author states clearly that on the Russian Campaign, this book will focus on the Northern and Southern flanks, mostly ignored in other books on Napoleon's invasion of Moscow. This coverage based on new and sometimes unfamiliar eye-witnesses' accounts constitutes the good bits about this book.The bad part is the clear anti-Napoleonic bias throughout the book, sometimes well-presented but at other times, made as sweeping statements without basis. It devalues the contents.This book would have benefitted from a strong editorial input."},{"Title":"Napoleon Against Russia","review":"The story of this campaign can be quickly summed up in just a few words: Napoleon's Grand Armee went from 500,000 to 20,000 in six months. It remains one of the biggest disasters in military history. In addition to the French casualties, there were untold Russian casualties. Not the least of these was the battle at Borodino, 70,000+ men killed in one day. Then came General Winter.This book concentrates on just this escapade of Napoleon. It is based on the diaries and letters of soldiers, many of which have not been published in English before. It goes far beyond the bare facts often cited in traditional histories to more clearly show Napoleon's actions as the primary general of his time making several mistakes that would eventually cause his downfall.This book is far more complete than most, giving much better coverage of the north and side flanks of Napoleon's army than is generally found.Exceedingly well done, this book is going to remain the definitive book on this campaign."},{"Title":"The Californian wildlife region (American wildlife region series)","review":"Before dismissing this title due to the previous review written by another reader of the 2nd. edition, let me fill you in on the usefulness of the new (and old editions). The reader must understand this book is written for the person who wants to study or identify some of California's common vast wildlife (both animals and plants), from the perspective of the &quot;region&quot; that they live in. This means that one can find out what plants and animals are common to various California biomes or plant communities. This might be of little use to most general readers, but this is very useful to teachers and students working on a California biome project.True, the lavishly illustrated field guides by &quot;Peterson,&quot; &quot;the Audubon Society,&quot; &quot;University of California Press&quot; and many others, are great in their own ways. Believe I have scores of these. But these books are mainly useful for identification and the range of a species, they give little information about how the species in a &quot;region&quot; interact.

Her words are always wise and quietly moving. Her story is rich and engaging. This is an awesome inside view to an amazing woman and author."},{"Title":"Louisa May Alcott: Her life, letters, and journals","review":"Compiled and edited in 1889 by Ednah Cheney, this book offers an interesting look into the life of Louisa May Alcott. Cheney intersperses the letters and journal entries with some biographical information. The Alcotts were very poor and lived off the money Louisa made from her writing; Alcott keeps track of how much money she gets for each story, even after the success of \\"Little Women\\". Unfortunately, the amount of time she spent writing (up to 14 hours a day), plus the illness she caught after nursing civil war soldiers took a toll on her and many of her letters, plus many of the journal entries mention her various illnesses and describe how she had to take morphine to help her sleep.Fans of \\"Little Women\\" will be most interested in the segments regarding that book and may be surprised to find out that Alcott thought the book was boring. It's hard to believe she really meant that because it's clear from her letters and journal entries how very biographical \\"Little Women\\" is. In fact, Alcott's journal description of Beth's death in real life is used almost word for word in the book. Other elements in \\"Little Women\\" are fiction (there was, alas, no real life Professor Bhaer and Alcott included him against her better judgement - she would have preferred Jo remain single, as Alcott herself did) and Teddy was based on a Polish acquaintance, not a next door neighbor. However, the four sisters are based on Louisa and her sisters and the journal entries and letters make you realize how perfectly she caught them on paper.This is an interesting book about not only a fascinating woman but also a fascinating family. The Alcotts' friends included the Emersons, the Thoreaus and the Hawthornes, all whose influences helped shape Louisa May Alcott's writings. Despite her success, her life was not an easy one and was often filled with sorrow. Yet, despite her sorrow and illnesses, Louise May Alcott's works enchanted children then and now."},{"Title":"New World Symphonies: How American Culture Changed European Music","review":"The book purportedly tells the story of classical music in America, how Old World traditions were transformed and revitalized, and how concert music came to interact with popular trends. I flipped to the chapter on film music, and to his credit the author makes some very defensible claims for the genre, at it's best, as being the equivalent of incidental music written for plays, or even singspiel music composed by Purcell, Telemann, Mozart and others. (Opera would be a little more of a stretch, since the film composer cannot ordinarily manipulate the &quot;libretto&quot; -- in this case, the screenplay -- where he would be able to, in the case of the genuine article.)However, despite these commonsensical claims and pleas for critical tolerance, the author doesn't seem to know very much about his subject matter. He's got the &quot;sense&quot; right, but his facts are all wrong. I read maybe a dozen pages and, over the course, found at least four factual errors. He claims that Erich Wolfgang Korngold quotes thematic material from his score to the &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; in the slow movement of his String Quartet No. 2 (when, in reality, it is the Quartet No. 3); he claims the same composer's Symphony in F#, while reminiscent of his film music, is comprised solely of original material (when, in fact, the melody of the slow movement was lifted from his score for &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex;&quot; and the finale uses a motif associated with the Maria Ouspenskaya character in &quot;Kings Row&quot; -- something I have never seen mentioned by any annotator); and that Dimitri Tiomkin wrote the score for Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Spellbound&quot; (it was actually Miklos Rozsa, who won an Oscar!). On top of it, I suspected his claim that Victor Herbert wrote the score for D.W. Griffith's &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; was equally false, but THAT I had to double-check. The score is mostly a hodgepodge of pre-existing classics, like &quot;Ride of the Valkyries,&quot; anyway. As it turns out, I was right -- it was written by Karl Breil. In any case, it's not my job to research these things. You'd think Yale University Press would hire a fact-checker.Breil aside, I could have written the chapter off the top of my head, virtually complete, right down to the historical dates, and not made so many errors. I don't know if it was sloppy note-taking or faulty memory, but the book never should have gone to publication in this state. What if someone comes across this thing in a university library somewhere and takes it as fact? We'll have all these theses on film music that reiterate the heinous error that Dimitri Tiomkin wrote &quot;Spellbound!&quot;For a good general survey of American music, you might try Wilfred Meller's now-classic &quot;Music in a Newfound Land,&quot; or even H. Wiley Hitchcock's &quot;Music in the United States.&quot; However, film music is a weak link in both studies. For that, I would refer you to &quot;Film Score: the Art and Craft of Movie Music,&quot; by Tony Thomas. Thomas highlights most of the major composers, and many of them contribute in their own words. It's an interesting read, and you learn a lot about the unique challenges faced by the composer in Hollywood."},{"Title":"New World Symphonies: How American Culture Changed European Music","review":"The influence of American culture on European composers has been extensive, shaping the course of music history. Author Jack Sullivan, a faculty member of Rider University in New Jersey (of which the famed Westminster Choir College is a part), has traced this connection in an illuminating book which should give Americans pause when considering their own cultural history. Though Sullivan's point of view is one of exploring how Europeans drew on American sources, what becomes increasingly clear to the astute reader is the lack of enthusiasm Americans had and continue to have for their own creative history.In a first chapter, which is alone worth the price of the book, he traces the route of African-American sorrow songs from the Black experience back to Europe through Dvor&aacute;k and Delius to Debussy and to the Afro-British composer Samuel Coleridge Taylor, who was considered by most Americans to be the greatest composer alive a century ago.We learn that many of the ideas of W. E. B. DuBois grew from Dvor&aacute;k's defenses of his assertion that the basis of American music should be Black Spirituals. The Czech composer's letter to the New York Herald were often quoted by DuBois (sometimes credited, sometimes not) and are here quoted by Sullivan.We also learn the impact on Delius of hearing songs from the African-American shanty towns in Florida's orange plantations as they drifted on the air to the porch of his house. Simple though it is, the photograph of the house where Delius lived in Florida carries with it a sense of the space in which he could hear songs from afar.Other chapters elucidate the effect on European composers of Poe, Whitman, the landscape, cities, and jazz and pop music. Sullivan's research is strong, his ability to connect disparate facts is engaging, and his writing is clear and lucid. Wonderful anecdotes occur throughout the book.For anyone who (like Sullivan) writes program notes or is interested in the roots of much 20th century European music, this book is a must. I found it difficult to put down and refer to it often as I write articles and reviews.Paul SomersEditorClassical New Jersey Society Journalclassicnj@home.com"},{"Title":"The Living Bread","review":"Father Thomas Merton was a 20th Century monk, mystic and writer whose works on mysticism and theology within the Roman Catholic tradition were both controversial and growundbreaking.In The Living Bread, Fr. Merton descibes some of the theology of the euacharist, as well as the mysticism behind it. His common theme, that the eucharist transcends the sacrafice of the Mass to a living representation of the love of God is a powerful message.Utilizing traditional apologetics and references, Fr. Merton brings the reader through such theological minefields as the metaphor versus the actuality of the sacrafice of the Mass, the doctrine of transubstantiation and the effacy of the real presence. The discussion in each chapter invariably turns to the eucharist as a mystical expression of God's love. One of the more profound quotes from the book references that instead of us taking Christ within us, like food, the sacrament of the eucharist creates a mystical union whereby Christ takes us into him.A good, approachble, profound and well researched and written source for understanding the mystical and theological aspects of the sacrament of the eucharist through the eyes of a Catholic priest and mystic."},{"Title":"The Living Bread","review":"If there was a required reading list for Catholics, this book would at least be in the top five. Thomas Merton sheds light on the beauty and mystical qualities of the eucharist like no one I've ever read. He helps the reader understand the experience that takes place for each person individually and for the entire body of Christ each time the eucharist is celebrated. I will never be the same after reading \\"The Living Bread\\". Reading it (several times at this point) has increased my sensitivity and reverence for the mass and enables me to enter into the mystical experience of the consecration in a unique way. My understanding and appreciation of the eucharist is changed forever. I am truly thankful for this book."},{"Title":"The Living Bread","review":"Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was a Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, as well as a best-selling writer, poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion. Tragically, he was accidentally electrocuted while in Thailand at a conference of Christian and non-Christian monks. He wrote in the Prologue of this 1956 book, \\"This book was written primarily as a summary of the Church's teaching on the Eucharist... the central theme... is the intimate connection between the two mysteries of the Eucharist and of the Church... This book is not a defense of a doctrine, but a meditation on a sacred mystery.\\" (Pg. 28-29)He laments, \\"The great tragedy of our age is the fact... that there are so many godless Christians---Christians, that is, whose religion is a matter of pure conformism and expediency.\\" (Pg. 21-22)He asserts, \\"we must be reminded that our view of the Sacrifice of the Mass must not be distorted and caricatured by too close a contact with pagan and natural ideas of sacrifice.\\" (Pg. 69) Later, he adds, \\"True contemplation of the mystery of the Eucharist is not possible, in the last analysis, if we do not resist the temptations to anthropomorphism or to spiritism which beset us when we try to explain to ourselves the real presence and its conseqences.\\" (Pg. 80)He states, \\"The life of every man is a mystery of solitude and communion: solitude in the secrecy of his own soul, where he is alone with God; communion with his brethren, who share the same nature, who reproduce in themselves his solitude, who are his 'other selves' isolated from him and yet one with him.\\" (Pg. 146) He optimistically suggests, \\"We live, perhaps, on the threshold of the greatest eucharistic era of the world---the era that may well witness the final union of all mankind. If that is true, then we are within the reach of a tremendous fulfillment: the visible union close to the whole world in Christ.\\" (Pg. 158)One of Merton's more \\"orthodox\\" and mystical works, this will be of considerable interest to his fans."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"A serviceable summary of one of the Church's most tumultuous periods. A pretty quick read as the text is written at a reasonable level for most introductory readers. Provides good coverage of the whole church during this period, including Catholic and Orthodox reformations.

Not referenced, light recommended readings, good index. On the whole an enjoyable and helpful book for the front end of a study of the reformation, but not my favorite."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"Owen Chadwick tackles the world of the 16th century. Anyone familiar with this period knows that religion, politics, and sociological factors in each of the countries in Europe created a tangled web which requires much study to understand.Chadwick goes for the big picture, touching lightly on major factors, as well as some of the smaller people and problems. The chapters on Luther, Calvin, and radicals read quickly and enjoyably. Other chapters are complex, particularly the Reformation in England. It is easy to get lost or bored trying to follow the key people and events as the author gives the reader a barrage of information.It appeared to me that Chadwick assumes the reader will have some knowledge of the 16th century prior to reading the book. He will at times mention someone without explaining who that person was, as he did on page 298 when he mentions Luis de Molina only by last name.Overall, Chadwick's book presents the historical information in an interesting way. He gives you the big picture, wetting the appetite for more studies on some of the people events he discusses in his book."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"This begins Owen Chadwick's the Reformation and as he recounts the histories of those who either by religious conviction or by political consolidation and ambition rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church and its waning power during the 16th century. The first part provides an overview of Europe with the rise of monarchies, the corruption and inadequacies of the Roman Catholic Church, and its growing resentment among the masses of its ineffective policies and practices among a continent experiencing a renaissance. Amongst this volatile and changing civilization, Chadwick presents many individuals and their roles in bringing about the Reformation from Erasmus, Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and those in the Church of England, and the paroxysms that resulted.In addition to the development of the Protestant Churches, there is also the struggle of national independence from the Papal Authority, and the residue of Medieval Society, which resulted in riots and wars among many countries and communities. In addition to the more prevalent churches that resulted amongst the Lutherans, the Reformed and Anglican Churches, Chadwick includes smaller radical groups of Christians that came about with very isolated followings.Furthermore, the Council of Trent, the Jesuits, and Conquistadores in the Counter-Reformation providing the Vatican's response to the growing influence of Protestantism.Interestingly enough one surprising fact was that the Roman Catholic Church made efforts to educate its clergy, many of whom were illiterate; this being one of the complaints of the masses of Europe. Despite the best efforts of Catholicism and Protestantism, the Reformation and subsequent events divided the European continent. Many societies were scarred by the violence and rather than receiving the liberty which is promised in the Scriptures. Chadwick alludes that Europe would attempt to find a more secular meaning in the successive Age of Reason.This reading was a good primer for the Reformation and introduces the reader to an overview which calls for more in-depth reading to gain a fuller understanding of the times the Reformation took place. What made it difficult for me, being an American Protestant, is that there are many Europeans, which I had no familiarity, especially amongst the English Reformers. Despite this Rev. Chadwick does an adequate presentation of a complex and confusing time in European History."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"Having studied the history of the early Church for many, many years at the neglect of later ecclesiastical history, the time seemed right to begin learning more about the Reformation. Most of my knowledge of the Reformation derives from apologetics and reading other books which make mention of one or two items in passing. Of course, I've read some of Luther's works on occasion, but I never really had the context to place those words into; as a result, Luther's arguments lose their acerbic bite.I happened upon this book at a used bookseller. I didn't have to pay anything for it thanks to the contemporary marvel that is \\"store credit.\\" In an undergraduate class of mine, we read Henry Chadwick's volume on the Early Church, and my copy of that book is so full of underlinings and marginal notes that it's quite unreadable now. It seemed natural that another volume in Penguin's History of the Church series would profit me greatly.Unfortunately, having just finished all 450 pages of text, I reflect upon what I've learned and it's really only the barest of bones about what the Reformation was actually about. For all of those words and all of those pages, I imagined that I could walk away confidently from the book capable of putting all of those earlier fragments of knowledge in their respective places - but, no, I can't really say that I can do that. Furthermore, I can't really say that those writings of Luther which I've read make much more sense. I can see the framework of what happened, but there's almost an entire lack of substance.I think this lack of substance can be attributed to how the author bounces from general, abstract topic to topic, never really surveying the particulars for more than a sentence or two. It's rather consistent in its inconsistency. It reads much like the intelligent ramblings of a history professor who knows so much about the subject that he's constrained for time and space to share his breadth of knowledge which ultimately leads to a jumbled, misinformed lecture. He tries to provide examples, but these examples are thrown in like only the tiniest pinch of salt and pepper for seasoning. One moment the author is discussing the Reformation in Sweden and then he jumps to the English Reformation and ends up discussing what was happening in southern Germany - and all of this within the span of a couple of paragraphs. When he does discuss the particulars, he drops names as if every reader should know precisely about whom he is speaking. And then there are the moments where it quite honestly feels like your history professor has taken you out to the pub for a post-exam drink and jabs you in the ribs with a few wry jokes that only intellectuals would get.I can only recommend this book to someone who's already versed in the history of the Reformation. I know that I will continue reading others, and perhaps return to this book in another couple years to see if my opinion about it has changed. However, without a doubt, the final chapters of this book may prove to be the most invaluable already considering its survey of the how and why Christendom was capable of splintering as it did, the decline in ecclesiastical power during the 16th and 17th centuries, and the various liturgical reactions of the Catholics, Lutherans and Reformed Christians during the Reformation. This section, though, would be worth imminently more if the previous two sections covering the actual Reformation and Counter-Reformation were more cohesive and didn't suffer from the ails mentioned above."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"This is a classic in its field and well worth reading. The Penguin History of the Church is an excellent series,even if dated. One would need to read more recent historians such as Diarmaid MacCulloch, Carter Lindberg and Christopher Haigh to get an up to date picture but then it would never do to overlook the classics. Chadwick has great literary style. Consider his description of the survival of some kind of tolerance even in the era of religious wars - \\"charity, whipped and bleeding, limped up the ladder into the ark.\\" (p.374). He knows the period well, and is the master of the well chosen anecdote to illustrate his historical analysis. It is a joy to read a master in his field."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"This is a book for anyone who does not know anything about how the Christian church developed into the denominations and then came to America. Anyone that wants to understand Calvinism and Arminianism, and their opposing ideas on predestination and the priest hood of the believer needs to read their impact on the Reformation."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"Chadwick's perspective on the Reformation Era contains a lot of great material for those interested in learning about the important and notable historical factors in the Age of Theological Reform. His work is dated in number of respects however, and should be read in conjunction with a more recent work of scholarship. Chadwick is also rather hard to fact-check in his own work, as he fails to directly cite sources for a number of his claims. His overall perspective is solidly historical; however, this book should not be read and understood as a critically-accurate account of the Reformation."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"I enjoyed hearing the other side of the picture presented. Catholic bias was always my concern in reading the history of Europe and the Catholic church; and this series has helped me find a more balanced view. I was intrigued by the many facets that influenced people in the pew and how they, in the long run, have purified ideas that are not helpful for a relationship with God, who calls us into being and is there at the door of death."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"Chadwick's history is a solid conclusion to this 3-part history of the Church. Though avoiding the theological debates few of the Protestant, Catholic, or Anabaptist partisans will be pleased. Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road easy read that assumes some knowledge of the topic already. It is a fair introduction in a way but the assumptions of additional learning will leave some puzzled with unexplained references. This would be a fine companion, for instance, to one working through a more detailed lecture series such as,The Teaching Company: History of Christianity in the Reformation Era 18 Audio Cds with Course Outline Booklet (The Great Courses).We would have enjoyed also a more thorough coverage of the proto-reformation movements such as the Lollards and Hussites of the preceding centuries. True, there is a limit in the amount that can be covered in under 500 pages but those movements in particular seem especially relevant to this study. For a more in-depth study that takes those earlier reformation movements into account, seeThe Reformation (The Story of Civilization VI).For a study of this period, there are many works that cover the material with far greater detail. Others may provide a reasonable introduction to the reformation. This one falls somewhere in between. A solid, conventional history that attempts not to offend any of the Christian traditions involved. Despite the rather drab approach to history, it still manages to entertain and incite a desire to learn more. For that we can highly recommend this well-respected work."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"Don't look here.Chadwick's book is steeped in the conventional and now-discredited \\"Whig\\" view of history, which posits that the Reformation was both inevitable and progressive. It is typified by sentences like the following from Chadwick: \\"The Reformation came because limitation of the power of the Church was necessary to the further development of efficient government.\\"This view has since been demolished by the likes of Eamon Duffy, who has shown that much of the Reformation was a violent, top-down imposition -- a \\"revolt of the rich\\" as another scholar put it.Readers are advised to consult Diarmaid MacCulloch's masterful \\"The Reformation: A History,\\" a book likely to be the standard work on the subject for years to come."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"The only other short introduction to the Reformation that I've read is the one by G.R. Elton, and this one is not as good. Chadwick treats his subject casually and judges movements or people without making us privy to the reasons why he does so. There are also inexplicable biases in what is treated: for example, he gives us quite a few pages (a chapter?) on the religious life of England under Cromwell (1640s and 50s), but barely spends more than a sentence or two on the religious wars in France (1562-98).On the whole, the tone wasn't my thing either. On the few occasions he referred to women (remember them?) it was in an casual and sometimes apparently joking way. Not quite sexist, but it makes you wonder.Skip it. There are hundreds of histories of the Reformation. Most will be better than this."},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"Being a proud Protestant as I am, I wanted to research the Reformation, so I read this book. This book is excellent.

I'm a big fan of Luther, and his works - and Owens dealings with Luther were wonderful and right on target!Owens take on the Counter-Reformation was also great, and his describtion of the spread of Christianity soon after, the rise of the Jesuits, etc. were wonderful.Overall it was a great book!"},{"Title":"The Reformation","review":"I am a Catholic and I wanted to know more about the protestant church.

When I see the catholic church today I just realized that it has not evolved much since those days in the sense of its dogma, for example, the theory of not to have sexual relations before marriage .. in Africa lots of people are dying because of that.

I've made several of these recipes and have been very pleasantly surprised by how good they taste; I particularly like the Pseudo Szechwan Ramen recipe. Another plus is that many of these recipes do not use the ramen seasoning packet for flavoring, which is great given its extremely high sodium content.I've always liked ramen and have often made up my own recipes by adding some veggies or cheese. However, these recipes are a step beyond anything I've ever created with ramen. The only problem is that some of the recipes call for either a relatively long list of ingredients or use an ingredient that the average person is unlikely to have on hand, such as Szechwan sauce or gorgonzola.

While I rolled my eyes reading through the first 20 pages, I eventually gave in and allowed myself to enjoy the text.\\"Author\\" is a writer-to-be, a procrastinator, with an extensive collection of quick notes and facts, loosely surrounding the comments, actions, works, criticisms, and deaths of largely Western Civilization's writers, musicians, painters, and philosophers. Too scattered notes for any single text, most likely, but reading them over and over and over again creates a very hypnotic and satisfying experience.How someone can read Markson and not conjure up Thomas Bernhard, I don't know. WITTGENSTEIN'S NEPHEW vs. WITTGENSTEIN'S MISTRESS? Markson feels like counter-point to Berhard's insane genius. VANISHING POINT a response to CONCRETE.Berhard's protagonist Rudolph has also done extensive research. For a biography on Mendelssohn. Only he's unable to begin, needing the perfect opening sentence. Markson's Author has a collection of index cards consisting solely of, albeit poor, opening sentences. Where each sentence for Author is almost its own paragraph, Rudoph's entire rant is one long paragraph for 200+ vociferous pages. Each man is ill, if only in mind, and each man's procrastination and self-indulgent obsession ultimately points to his mortality.VANISHING POINT is a quick read. An entertaining, artful read. Perhaps not a must read, however.I must say giving the shorter, inverted bits (\\"Haarlem, Frans Hals died in.\\") the voice of Yoda made the book a bit more entertaining."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"I am not sure that I have the full measure of this, but it was an entertaining read. Highly allusive, I can imagine it could irritate anyone whose knowledge didn't match up with Markson's to any degree."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"Interesting little tidbits of information all written in a novel. The author writes that\\" he finally put all of his notes into a manuscript\\" Notes that were taken from shoeboxes containing all different kinds of information.Definately one of a kind!"},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book a bit apprehensively, being aware of Markson's experimental style of narration. How could this possibly be termed a &quot;novel&quot; if it is merely a collection of facts from literature, history, music, politics, philosophy and religion? On a foundation such as this, how can one build the basic elements of plot, character and setting? As I read the book, however, I found myself marvelling at Markson's unique skill and vision. The &quot;Author&quot; of the novel arranges his massive collection of information in such a way that the elements in question are completed in the mind of the reader, like looking at an incomplete picture and mentally filling in the blanks. By the end of the book, I was acutely aware of having been moved - remarkably by a superficially disjointed series of anecdotes. Like Author, I was unwittingly swept into the vaguely existant narrative and pressed together the covers with a satisfying sense of enrichment. The flawless blend of tragedy, humor, ambition and madness in the world of human creativity (and destruction) remind the reader of the pleasures and pains of being in touch with truth. Markson will be remembered for this one."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"i loved this narrative. anyone who finds rilke's date of death an important detail has my undying attention.the author is a great voice.a poet's dream."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"With &quot;Vanishing Point,&quot; the amazing David Markson lifts himself from cult status to author of what should be a popular instant classic.

Its &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; quality is invigorated by courage and introspection, its contantly renewed variety educates and deepens with each reading."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"David Markson is one of the most well read and literary people I know. Conrad Aiken, Malcolm Lowry, William Gaddis, and Frederick Exley were among his friends. He is the author of Wittgenstein's Mistress, which Ann Beattie has called \\"An absolute masterpiece.\\" He is also the author of Springer's Progress and Reader's Block. He has lived in Greenwich Village for almost fifty years.Markson was a big reader of literary allusions and quotations. When he first read Under The Volcano, he wrote a fan letter to Malcolm Lowry. They met in Canada a while letter. Markson went on a personal crusade to draw attention to Lowry's work: \\"Which is why I wrote a master's thesis (at Columbia) on Lowry's Under The Volcano only four years after it was published, for instance, when nobody else had written anything except the original reviews, and so I had the allusions all to myself to dig out.\\"Markson was also the first person to give William Gaddis' The Recognitions its high rank also. He called it the most important American novel since Moby Dick? \\"Actually it was just a throwaway passage in an old detective novel I wrote,\\" Markson confesses, \\"but there too it was only three years after Gaddis had published. I'm delighted, or even honored, when I'm still given credit for it.Although he would give his right arm to have written The Recognitions, Markson is looks down at Gaddis' later work: \\"That business of the nonstop conversation, with all the repetitions and digressions and so forth that are supposed to be precisely like real life--except that art is selectivity, damn it. I read an interview where he talked about authorial absense, but what happens instead is that what he hopes will sound natural simply sounds faked. It's a gimmick, and it ultimately makes us infinitely more conscious of the writer than we'd ever be otherwise.\\"Markson has little interest in current fiction, although he occasionally reads it. His all-time list would include Moby Dick, Wuthering Heights, The Stranger, early Celine, The Sot-Weed Factor, Nightwood, The Ginger Man, early Beckett. He thought very little of Thomas Pynchon. \\"I've got an odd bias against him. I've always believed that it's a serious reader's responsibility to pick up on virtually any valid literary allusion--even though a shrewd novelist tries to bury such things too, of course, so that the context makes sense even if the resonances are missed.\\"Markson did read Infinite Jest when it came out, but would make no comment. He remarked \\"Most of your enthusiasm is for the major stuff just before your own time. But deep down I know, know, that there are books out there just as good as Under The Volcano or The Recognitions--and it's my own damned loss that I've misread them.\\""},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"David Markson has written this book 4 times, 5 if you include Wittgenstein's Mistress. They're all worth reading but this one is perfect. Markson uses quotations and literary anecdotes almost exclusively to paint a portrait of the author character. That may sound like a difficult read but it's not. It's actually a real page turner. In the ratio of wisdom extracted to reading time invested, this book is one of the highest (Gatsby maybe, Elizabeth Costello, Ficciones, around that level). What else do you want out of literature?I can't believe this is out of print, I've bought 4 copies of this because I keep giving it away to friends in the midst of drunken literary discussions."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"Markson has created something wonderful in his latest work. The idea of an elderly author gathering up all these little tidbits in order to compose what may turn out to be his last work IS the novel. What a great idea. Markson's originality ranks right up there with the works of Beckett and Gaddis. There are many great references re Einstein, Picasso, Fitzgerald, Dickens, Sophocles. Aristotle, Galileo, Hitler, and even 9-11. He also shows the utter personal idiocy of Heideger and Wagner, their brilliant artistry notwithstanding. Never has someone taken so many disparate items and yet synthesized them into a unified, cohesive sequence of thought. This is what great writing is all about."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"David Markson's book, Vanishing Point, is the third book in a tetralogy of experimental novels concerning an aging author. The other works in the tetralogy are: Reader's Block, the ironically titled This Is Not a Novel, and The Last Novel. Like Markson's other works, Vanishing Point is avante-garde and highly original. It has no narrative or plot to speak of, yet conveys its theme in a remarkably engaging fashion.The novel begins by telling us that \\"Author has finally started to put his notes into manuscript form,\\" that he has been scribbling notes onto 3x5 index cards and that the cards now fill two shoeboxes. With that, the novel launches into nearly 200 pages of the scribblings and notes themselves. The notes are a seemingly random reiteration of trivia and musings concerning art, literature, history, science and civilization. Sometimes the notes contain anecdotes or facts; at other times the notes consist of little more than a name or phrase. Gradually, we learn that Author is elderly, enervated and without motivation to do much more than rearrange the order of the cards. Here and there, we learn what Author has in mind --\\"a novel of intellectual reference and allusion...minus much of the novel.\\" A sense of order begins to appear and the theme of approching death emerges.This novel is never boring and, despite its formlessness, is actually quite difficult to put down. There is an almost addictive quality to the notes. Markson's protagonists are often isolated and almost hermetically sealed off from social contact and relationships. Yet these characters have genuine insight into the human condition and express humanist feelings. The protagonist in this novel is no exception. By the book's end, I found myself laughing with and shedding a tear over a sparsely-developed, unnamed character whose inner life I was only allowed to glimpse through a collection of jotted notes. In that sense, Vanishing Point is an amazing work."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"When I read the description about the 3x5 cards to my wife, she started laughing - and pointed to my shirt pocket.

Also fortunately, Markson made his \\"Author's\\" into a book.I love to read those little snippets that usually show up in sidebars of magazines and books that have that AHA! factor. This book is filled with AHA's.There is not the scent of a plot; nor is there any hint of a character other than the mysterious Author who seems to be going through something much worse than writer's block.The reason to read this book is to enjoy the factoids while hoping for some insight to any message hidden in them. Make sure you read this while around at least one other person - you WILL have an uncontrollable urge to read many AHA's aloud to someone."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"Its true. Reading Markson is like a validation of one's education. The reader encounters the known and the faintly known in precise, almost monadic, moments. There is a sly narrative behind all this but it's a non-event- the real stuff is the telling anecdote, the revealing humaness and culpability of the living and their witnesses: artists themselves. Everything pushes towards annihilation, except pleasure. This book is a one of many."},{"Title":"Vanishing Point: A Novel","review":"It seems that &quot;Author&quot; has been collecting materials for his next novel on 3x5 index cards, and is about ready to start pulling the book together, but somehow he can't do it. We are presented with the cards--snippets of history, criticism, lines of poetry, dates, places where famous people died, dates when famous people died, snide remarks of famous people about other famous people, thoughts about death and dying, phrases in Italian, French, Latin, Aramaic, Hebrew.This is not a novel in any conventional sense. There is no plot, there are no characters, there are no chapters. Nothing happens. The book is an extended meditation on the transitoriness of life and fame. Snippets and sayings and epigrams and bon mots from the ages. One senses that the &quot;Author&quot; is an old Jewish man, who has spent his life immersed in literature, art, poetry and history. He reveals little else about himself.The actual Author, David Markson, is obviously a man of great erudition. Whether he is a good writer, I really cannot say. I know that the book was hard to finish, tedious, with moments of high entertainment and humor. I'm glad that I finished it, but I can say, it's not for everyone. Reviewed by Louis N.

She incorporates many of the learning principles and teaching practices her text espouses by using colorfully illustrated and highlighted multiple formats throughout, such as summaries, case studies, classroom applications and examples, emphasis of major points, and learning exercises. The three major sections address learner diversity, how students learn, and becoming an effective teacher. She outlines seven themes for effective learning which she addresses in every section: interaction, information processing, relevance, classroom climate, challenge, expectations, and diversity. The text cites educational research throughout (there is an index with 44 pages of references) yet the paragraphs have a readibility and easy flow to them. Ormrod's chapters consistently address her goals as an author: focusing on cores principles, relating them to our own behavior, processing them effectively and applying them in the classroom. The phrase &quot;interesting textbook,&quot; usually an oxymoron, in this case is well-deserved praise."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology: Developing Learners","review":"I found this book to be very informitive in how the mind works and respect to how people learn. I have improved my personal study habits because after reading this book I realized that I was not using the most effective way of keeping things in my long term memory. This book gives a detailed explanation with real life examples of how to approach situations as a teacher or parent who wants to know the inner tickings of the developing learner. If you are more concerned with toddlers though this book only briefly touches on them. This book deals more with school age children. If I were to try and write a review that this book deserves, I would be writing all night. I know that the description of this book is written above and I believe it to be a really good description of the book.

Her father has invested the family savings in a floundering newspaper. Julie becomes its star reporter and, in the year the book covers, she matures into a lovely young woman.Exploitative labor practices in the local steel mill, a minister who defies the town powers to provide support for downtrodden workers, Julie's youthful idealism, her father's illness and struggle to build his newspaper and establish himself in the community all combine with teenage awakening and a couple of natural disasters to make a highly entertaining and spiritually enlightening book. Turns out the book is autobiographical and it's at least as successful as Marshall's CHRISTY.Marshall's style is light and entertaining, never &quot;preachy.&quot; But she gets a message across by demonstrating the power of faith and love in her characters' lives. Characters are full and vibrant, the story line moves tantalizingly and the language of the book is delightful.I can't imagine anyone not enjoying JULIE."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"Now after reading both Christy and Julie, Catherine Marshall has made herself and her books a home in my heart for all time. Julie especially is a special story that I know will never leave my memory nor heart. Julie, forced to move from her home town in Alabama to a flood-prone town in Pennsylvania, helps her dad take over a small and dying newspaper. She meets alot of interesting people, some welcoming her family to the community and others discriminating against her. Randolf Wilkinson, a man from the Hunting and Fishing Club, an elite place of gathering for Alderton's wealthy, instantly provides comfort and protection for Julie and her family. Rand and Julie's love is a very special part of this book, and in the end provides the strength and courage Julie needs to survive. Spencer Meloy, a local preacher, inspires Julie to keep reaching for her dreams and offers a friendship from the very start. Other characters, such as Margo, Julie's best friend, and Dean Fleming, an instant friend to Julie's father and the struggling newspaper, also help illistrate the love and meaning of this extremely well-written book. With all her family, friends, and most importantly, God, by her side, Julie finally starts on her quest to fullfill her hopes and dreams- her life."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"If you are a Christian female or a female curious about Christianity, I highly suggest you read this fine piece of fiction, which is both highly entertaining and educational as well. I plan on rereading it soon. It is about a young woman who grows up when her family moves and experiences many struggles. Julie learns to make her faith in God her own (instead of just relying on her folks' faith) and falls in love for the first time. This is definitely a coming of age novel, although I think most females ages 13 to 80 would enjoy it. My mom recommended it to me when I was about 17.I can't help wondering why this excellent book wasn't made into a movie or tv series like Christy was. I hope someday soon it is. It has to be true to the book, thought, like Christy was. Otherwise it will fail."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I read &quot;Christy&quot; several years ago and watched every episode of the television series when it was aired. I enjoyed &quot;Christy&quot; so much that I was anxious to read &quot;Julie.&quot; I just finished reading &quot;Julie&quot; and it was excellent. The story is captivating and will keep you interested until the very end. Once I got to the last 100 pages, I couldn't put it down. Catherine Marshall has a way of allowing the reader into the hearts, minds, and emotions of her lead characters. I highly recommend this book. Curl up in a comfy chair with some hot chocolate and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Julie","review":"My mother introduced me to this book when I was a teenager and years later I still love reading it. It's got a bit of everything: action, suspense, politics, history, romance, social justice, theology. It never ceases to amaze me how much Catherine Marshall packed into this book. No wonder it took her years to write it! The majority of the story reads at a moderate to slow pace; it's all build-up and background for a spectacular climax unlike anything I've ever read. There are a few parts that are overly slow or cheesy -- keeping me from giving it a full five stars. Yet, I keep coming back to it and have probably read it ten times. Better than \\"Christy\\" in my opinion. Read it and find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I had read other books by Catherine Marshall years ago. My daughter-in-law put me in touch with this one - don' know how I missed it. It has everything, humor,romance, mystery, human interest, plus the Christian viewpoint. A well-written, meaty story which, I think, is hard to come by these days."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"Normally I do not enjoy historical fiction, but this one is modern enough that I could relate to Julie and much of what she went through. The book is set in the 1930's (forty-some years after the actual Great Flood), but the details of the flood itself are quite accurate and well-researched. The story itself is very engaging and kept me interested the entire time. The flood scene was almost overwhelming to me (I had no prior knowledge of the flood before reading the book) and was expecting some water damage to the newspaper offices or something. Despite what I'd read on the book jacket I had no idea that (SPOILER) hundreds of people were going to die, including some characters I had grown to care for. The only thing I did not like about the book was the scene in which Julie finally allows herself to feel God's overpowering love. It was a little less powerful than I felt it might have been. In this scene, Julie's clothes have been ripped off of her body and she is riding the rushing waters on a huge, uprooted tree. As she speaks with God, she realizes how vain she is and stands up straight and tall, deciding to not be ashamed of the way the Lord made her. She wonders why she feels ashamed, noting that she had admired her body in the privacy of her room. I see what the author was trying to do in this scene (the whole point is that nothing matters except our relationship with God) yet I found the image of her standing up straight, tall and naked while other people were around distracted me from what was taking place between her and God. Overall, however, this is a very wonderful book on multiple levels."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"&quot;Julie&quot;, written by Catherine Marshall, was a book that I enjoyed reading. It was a realistic account of a girl's life during a couple of her teenage years. Julie and her family moved to Alderton, in an effort to get away from some problems they had run into in their old town of Timmeton. Julie's father buys the town's newspaper business, to try to bring it back to life. The family suffers through many trials such as poverty, flood damage, and disagreements with other town folks. Because the story is realistic, it provoked different emotions within me as I read along. I felt a love for Julie and an appreciation for those who were involved in her life. I thought this was a good book that showed how important God is in a person's life, and how things seem to work out when people stick together during good times and bad, mountains and valleys."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"Julie is a young woman who falls in love for the first time, while her family faces many problems. While the book is interesting, it's also a bit preachy, and I quickly tired of hearing about the Promise Keepers. And now that I think about it, Rand was really kind of a creep, leading Julie on. I didn't think that their love story was very romantic...it was more annoying to see how bipolar he was.Having said all of that, it's not as good as Christy, but it's not a bad read."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I loved &quot;Christy&quot; and &quot;Julie&quot; is just as wonderful! Julie is a high school senior who works for her father's small newspaper and her family's and minister's beliefs and concerns for the town and its people secure the wrath of the wealthiest man in town and several others. It's inspiring how they deal with it and rise above it and find deeper faith in God. Also, I loved Julie and Randolph's romance. What girl wouldn't want to marry a man like Rand? A WONDEFUL book!"},{"Title":"Julie","review":"Julie was and is one of the most amazing works of literature that i have ever read. In my entire life. Granted, I'm only 16, but I've still read a lot of books. It may be because of my youth that this book has touched me so tremendously, but, if it be, so be it. It follows the life of Julie Paige Wallace who struggles with love and above all, her faith. She comes across many people when she moves from Timmeton to Alderton, some she likes, some she doesn't. It's a wonderful tale of love, adventure and faith. I've read that it took 7 years to write and that Catherine Marshall's husband had to finish it because she died before it was completed, well, i must say, she should be proud. It'll make you laugh, make you cry and most definetly leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I simply loved it. It's a must read. Emotionally it really choked me up."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I have moved overseas and decided to purchase the book on audio to save on weight in my shipment. I was laid up sick and decided to pull out the \\"book\\" to listen to it. I have read other books of the author in previous years but this was my first of her's to listen to. I was captivated and couldn't put it down. Fourteen hours of words that painted such a picture for this visual learner that I am. I highly recommend this book. Especially a great read for anyone that has experienced pain by other Christians in church. It's a powerful book. And for the romantic side in all of us it leaves one wondering all the way until the last few pages (not predictable).A book written about a time so long ago and yet so relevant for today. A fantastic read."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"This book was a bit of a disappointment after reading Christy. Christy is so well written, and Julie just didn't live up to it. It's ok, but not great."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"Catherine Marshall's Julie: in a word, incredible. But not always incredibly good.We meet Julie Wallace, a young lady going into her senior year in high school, first while she is with her family in their car going towards their new home. Within the first five pages, she is covered in mud. (This event happens several times over the course of the book, and each time it is less funny.) The reason Julie is in the mud? A young British man named Randolph \\"Rand\\" Wilkinson. Like a typical teenage girl, Julie is giggly and clumsy in front of a cute guy.The Wallace family is heading to Alderton, where Mr. Wallace (formerly Rev.) has decided he wants to run Alderton's paper, The Sentinel. In a another typical fashion, the Wallace family is mostly ill-received after proving to be a \\"stuck-together, hard-working family\\" who always, always, seems to do the right thing. One of these \\"right things\\" is taking a great stand on the Yoder Steel/McKeevers issue.The McKeevers are a very important family in Alderton. They control almost every store, company, and house. They also control the Yoder Steel plant, where they treat their workers like dirt. After several members of the Alderton community try to help this by wanting to have it be a Union company, Mr. McKeever, Sr., just turns downright nasty. The Wallaces run pieces in The Sentinel criticizing the conditions of the dam and, in a very unlikely fashion, Mr. McKeever pays people to go in and destroy The Sentinel press, office, and workers.One day, however, it starts to rain. Alderton has suffered many terrible floods before, but this one is simply devastation. The huge dam (the one that caused so much controversy) breaks, sending thousands and thousands of gallons of water crashing into Alderton and its surrounding counties.The flood is Catherine Marshall's strong point. While during the rest of the book writing is somewhat weak and young, her ability to so accurately describe the flood of 1937 is incredible. Her details and graphic descriptions are both horrifying and gruesome, and the only part of the book that captivated me. Her epilogue is also one of the strongest points in the book. You see how everything has turned out 50 years after the flood. You see that Julie and Rand have been married (of course), and how they are still so happily in love after all these years (of course), and that they have a wonderful family (of course), and how they still have joyful reunions (of course).All in all, reading the beginning of the book was like trudging through sludge. The language and dialogue were very young and boring. There were so many subplots that it was hard to keep track of them all and to stay interested. But the ending is likeable and certainly provides for excitement. Grade: C+"},{"Title":"Julie","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. I first read Christy, and thought it was good, then read this book, and thought it was even better! I loved the entire story. It keeps you wanting to read and read, and when the book is over, you wish it was longer! If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"Julie","review":"After seeing the television series &quot;Christy&quot; I was very interested in reading more of Catherine Marshall's book. I went to my local library and found Julie. Julie is the daughter of a former preacher, now editor of a the local paper in Alderton, Pennsylvania. The story is set during the heart of the depression in the 1930's. Julie Wallace is an 18 year old senior and an up and coming reporter for her father's extremly small paper. Julie now becoming a fine woman is dealing with her emontions of both a family and romantic nature. The main conflict in the story is within Julie herself, but the physical climax is when the area dam breaks. After this the whole town must pull together and become one again. Julie is a wonderful book, so much so that I couldn't put it down. I'd recommend it to anyone with the soul for old fashion romance and time for a good book"},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I read this book with a book club and was hesitant at first. Once I started to read it I was so enthralled with it, I could not put it down. It is a beautiful story about a family, a young girl coming of age. It is also about social ills and how individuals can influence situations that affect many. It was believable and touching without being too sappy."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"it was ok I thought it would have been a bit more exciting. I thought that she could have put a bit moe action in the story."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"This has been my favorite book since I read it as a teen. As a preacher's daughter myself, I could really identify with Julie. I purchased the book this time for some great teen girls. I hope they enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I loved the Christy TV series, movies and books, so I looked for recommendations by Amazon. I found this book, also by Catherine Marshall. It is just as good. Wish she had written more books! It's wholesome, which is refreshing compared to many stories out there these days."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"As Julie becomes of age in 1930's Alderton, Pennsylvania, she discovers not only her writing talent but also her sleuting talent, while doing research for her senior project. She begins to uncover something mysterious about a dam just outside of town that some very powerful people would rather she leave in the dark. Julie is undaunted by the fact that she has so much trouble getting information about the dam and the environmental damage it could cause to the town, if it has not been properly maintained. She her father hope to use his newspaper, the Sentinel,Julieto expose Julie's findings. Julie will have to be very determined. She wants her own byline someday, she has to work with her father's crochety secretary, Ms. Cruley and she's falling for Rand Wilkinson, the Hunting and Fishing Club's assistant who may know something about the dam that she is investigating. She must go forward with her investigation if she is expose any wrongdoing. But she must also tread softly.This book is not like Christy. It is not about a young girl who went into a backwood community to bring hope and a better life to them. I would like to have known that but I have to admit that I like Catherine Marshall's writing so much I probably would have purchased it anyway.I would like to have known about the mystery and intrigue as you read toward the middle of the book. That definitely would have pushed me to make a purchase and maybe others too. The beginning of the book had me wondering if I did the right thing by buying it but it does get better so keep reading."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"I am generally not a fan of Christian fiction because of the inferior quality of the writing. *Julie* however is an exception.While the plot does get a little bogged-down in places, the characters are real - not the models of ultimate perfection that some fiction contains. Equally impressive is their timeless quality. Even 60 years removed from the the setting of this novel, their world seems surprisingly similar to our own.Particularly, young women can and do benefit from this story. The lead character is idealistic, and she learns that all idealism must be balanced with \\"real world\\" practicality. She also learns that all decisions have a price. These principles are well-illustrated through an entertaining format.Overall, this book is enjoyable and, while Christian in tone, it evades the pitfall of selling out plot for \\"message.\\" Well worth the time it takes to read - the story will stick with you!"},{"Title":"Julie","review":"This book was fairly enjoyable, but not first rate. Perhaps I'm just a snob, but the style impressed me as too editorial; it wasn't half as well written as Christy. The story line was engaging and suspensful and the characters wern't half bad, but that (in my opinion) isn't enough to salvage the book.Also Marshal's theology (if you can call it that) is rather shaky. The focus seems to be all to much on the wrongs that need to be righted, instead of on the relationships of the specific charaters with God. Not that as Chritians we aren't called to action, but it becomes apparent as the book opens that Julie does not yet know Jesus as her savior. In fact for a Christian family, it strikes me, that the Wallace family knows very little about the God they profess to serve; the Holy Spirit has to be explained to Julie as if she had never heard of it before.If you want to hear more about the plot, the other reviews have plenty about that, and as they note the tone of the book is neither preachy nor sappy. I think the part of this that I enjoyed most was the occasional peice of poetry that Julie writes, but overall I was unimpressed."},{"Title":"Julie","review":"Julie is a story about a southern girl who moves to Pennsylvania with her family because her father mysteriously gave up ministering and bought a Printing Shop.

My lower back pain is in full retreat, I sleep more easily and deeply, and I have this wonderful book and those who put it together to thank. So very well done."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"Every fitness professional should own this classic text by Bob Anderson. Be careful with static stretching before a workout though - it can temporarily weaken muscle and impair performance. There are certain applications as outlined in theWarm-Up to Strength Training DVDbut only if used appropriately. Overall, this book is well-illustrated and will make a great addition to your library."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"My husband is a chiropractor and recommends all his patients use this book. It is THE industry bible. \\"Stretching\\" helps you get limber before a sport (and many sports with specific exercises for that particular sport) are included in the book. It also is a godsend to anyone over age 50 who wants to stay flexible, and decrease the aches and pains or just plain feel better --and be able to DO MORE!Love this book --my husband & I use it daily. IT'S a MUST HAVE - MUST USE kind of book."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"The past couple years I had been searching for a good stretching book. I stumbled upon this book during the search. Seeing excellent reviews across the board, I decided to give it a try. And..I am not disappointed at all. The illustrations alone make it worthwhile. However the illustrations plus the detailed explanation for each stretch make it an excellent book. The book is outlined by the stretch for each part of the body. Towards the end it provides a set of stretches for each sports/activity such as cycling, swimming, tennis etc which can come very handy. I highly recommend it even for those who have already done stretches like myself. I found more stretching positions or a better alternative to my current routine. This book is worth it!!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"An excellent book! The stretches are described and illustrated in a way that enables even the most inflexible reader to do them. Several stretches are shown for each area of the body, then routines for different activities such as running, bicycling, walking, or even watching TV (!) are shown. This book was extremely helpful to me not only in my chiropractic treatment, but also in my new walking program. You'll be amazed at how much better you feel after a few simple stretches. I have recommended this book to many people, and do so again here."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"My chiropracter recommended this book to me and I am glad that he did. It is an excellent resource of those of us who are getting along in years and stiffening up with age. I would suspect that it is also an excellent recourse of younder, more atletic individuals as well.Well written with decent illustrations, I would recommend this book to tohers."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I am a massage therapist who is frequently recommending to clients that they incorporate more stretching into their lives. This is the book I point them to if they ask for a reference. It shows you various stretches for all parts of your body. It also combines those stretches in more than 30 routines for different parts of the day and almost two dozen sports and activities.The strength of this book is two-fold: first, the illustrations are simple but detailed enough to be useful (something that a lot of books don't accomplish) and, second, the text is clear, easy to follow, and friendly. The author understands that most of us need to stretch and don't stretch nearly enough. No guilt trips, no technical terminology, no unreasonable expectations.This book is written for the general public and also for athletes. I use it myself and recommend it comfortably."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"The book is easy to read and easy to use, and the written descriptions and line drawings are very helpful for someone who wants to stretch correctly (i.e. without injury). The one thing better than the book would be to see Bob demonstrate each stretch personally. Thankfully, Bob and Jean have produced a wonderful video as well as this groundbreaking book. The video offers a 45-minute demonstration of various stretches, then a 14-minute routine of everyday stretches that are sure to limber up the stiffest sleeper in the morning and relax the most stressed worker at the end of the day. I highly recommend both the book and the video. END"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I am a middle aged man struggling to advance in martial arts. My instructors are all young men who still take flexibility for granted. Despairing of advancing any farther, I turned to ... to provide some books on flexibility and I found this gem. Useful, practical, instructional, excellent. I have developed my own stretching regimen using the clearly illustrated stretches from this book and it has paid off big time. What I had thought were symptoms of tendinitis were really just symptoms of stiff and aging muscles. Where I had been convinced that I could never advance again due to damaged tendons, I am now convinced that my limits are much farther out so long as I continue the stretching outlined in this book.I bought 4 books about stretching, some of which were aimed directly at the martial arts. This one has them all beat. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"\\"Stretching\\" is a fantastic book that will meet the needs of just about everyone - from the desk worker who wants to get a bit more blood flow to the cranium, to the sports and exercise enthusiast who participates in a wide variety of activities. Perhaps the only audience the book would miss is the hard-core athlete or sports physiologist.The book begins with a down-to-earth introduction and then spends a good amount of time on dozens and dozens of different stretches. These are broken down by what part of the body is getting the benefit of the stretch, such as legs, hips, wrists, etc. These exercises are then combined into 18 various \\"every day\\" stretching routines, such as a morning or evening routine, desk stretches, stretches to help lower back tension, etc. Following this are 35 routines for various sports activities. Each stretch is clearly illustrated with an illustration, and each routine has a summary that shows miniature illustrations for the exercises in the routine. This is a great book, and will give you some good ideas for different stretches."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This is an excellent book about stretching!! All exercises in this book are easy to perform, can be done without warm up and give great results. I have tried several different stretching methodes, but I prefer Andersons type of stretching!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"When I bought this book , I wanted a good book on static stretching. This book fills the bill -- sort of. It has a number of useful stretches. It also groups the stretches in several different ways (by body area, by activity, by time of day). However, it has some noticeable deficincies. The drawings of the stretches are hard to interpret and often inaccurate. The instructions for the stretches are often sketchy; they don't always tell you what you are trying to stretch and how to know whether you're doing the stretch right (or wrong). I got past most of these problems successfully (I think) but it took time and experimentation.I hope that the new 20th anniversary edition of this book has corrected some of the problems above (I hear that many of the drawings have been replaced by photographs). If so, consider buying it."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This is a new edition of a wonderful book that just got much better. The drawings continue to be simple and easy to follow and I think the popularity of the book over the years is that there are stretching routines, so you can do a series of stretches (while watching TV, or before taking a run for example) by looking (and maybe photocopying) just one page.It's a gentle approach, easy to follow. I notice one of the reviews refers to Pavel Tsatsouline's book Beyond Stretching. Believe me, the latter is the pedal-to-the-medal tough guy approach that's not appropriate for stretching, or the average person, and could get people injured.Keep it up, Bob Anderson, you're the people's stretching guru."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This book was recommended to me in the early 80's by a yoga instructor, and over the years I've found it immensely helpful. Even today, when the benefits of moderate and regular exercise are well known, too many people still believe that you should &quot;go for the burn&quot; and &quot;no pain, no gain.&quot;Anderson isn't your high school football coach: the exercises he recommends will, if practiced regularly, increase your strength and flexibility without agony or the risk of injury. His stretches are effective on their own, or you can use them to supplement other types of exercise. And they're fun, too: a good stretch, done properly, should be pleasurable rather than painful!The book itself is very well designed: the text provides just enough explanation, the illustrations are clear, and the large format allows you to keep the book open (and out of your way) while you do the stretches. This is a program you can follow for your whole life -- it's not just for young jocks. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This is an excellent book about stretching!!

I wasn't sure how they were going to improve on the original. (I've been using the first edition for years.) The illustrations are easier to follow with the two color format and the groupings for task/sport specific stretches is expanded.

I am a single mom who is working and going back to college and frankly after reading so much that includes helping my kid with his middle school, I really dont want to read too much to perform a stretch.

The simple yet thorough pen and ink sketches by Jean Anderson have a 'homey' appearance harking back to the seventies, when the book came out. The descriptions are easy to follow, there are stretches for every muscle in the body, and routines for various sports and every day activities. There are many glitzier stretching manuals out now, with high gloss photos and price tags to match. If you own this one, you'll never have to buy another stretching book.

While Stretching is, of course, the primary focus of this book, it gives tangible and practical advice for many aspects of fitness, including strength developing exercises, running and cycling techniques, and \\"Light, Nutritious Eating.\\"As a guide to stretching, this book is complete and inclusive. I love that Anderson heavily stresses that a stretch that is easy to one person may not be easy to another and that a stretch that is easy one day might not be the next. Many stretches are noted as being less difficult for women and more demanding variations are offered. He urges teachers and coaches not to single out students who are less flexible or to compare them with other students. From the beginning, Anderson assures the reader, that \\"no gain without pain\\" is a dangerous mentality. Stretching should feel good!!, and should be used to make your favorite sport or athletic pastime easier and more enjoyable.There are many stretching routines that Anderson presents including: Getting Started, Everyday, and Before and After Sports (Baseball/Softball, Basketball, Cycling, Football/Rugby, Golf, Gymanastics/Figure Skating/Dance, Hiking, Ice Hockey, Martial Arts, Racquetball/Handball/Squash, Running, Downhill Skiing, Cross Country Skiing, Soccer, Surfing, Swimming/Water Polo, Tennis, Volleyball, Weight Training, and Wrestling). He also presnts a 10 week plan for beginners that includes stretching, walking, and jogging."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"The book is very thorough and if you want something to review or study if you're away from home this would be an excellent source book. Does a great job of breaking down the exercises for each body group or part. Well written and illustrated, easily understood.

He's a first rate instructor and you can't really go wrong whichever you decide to choose."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This book incorporates the full compendium of fundamental stretching movements that many of us may have forgotten as we pursue the newest class at our gym.I have had a weak lower back for some years and always search for exercises that help alleviate the pain and stiffness. Bob Anderson's book was perfect for helping me eliminate back pain, as well as speed up muscle recovery through strategic stretching in the evening and morning. I feel sooo much better even after only a few days. I feel that my body has gotten stronger, which is surely the result of muscles that are more flexible and in my own control.There is no downside with this book-if you do the exercises, you will surely feel more comfortable and stronger. You will not have any negative effects...Buy it!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This is the best book I've ever read about stretching. The book starts off by explaining the importance of stretching and some common over looked areas. Such as back pain due to not stretching you hamstrings. The book then breaks down stretches by body parts. The diagrams not only show the correct way but also show the incorrect ways the stretch is done.But the best part is the routines that the author put together at the end of the book. The author put in common stretching routines for everything from daily stretches to sports, travel, and problem area stretch routines. By far the best book about stretching that I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I am a martial artist and flexibility is essential for me. This type of stretching is comfortable and give good results. I highly recomending this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I am an athlete and am constantly stiff and sore due to being smaller (less muscle and smaller bones) and also from being stressed out. I also have ADD, which makes the transfer of information from the eye to the brain harder than most people. For this reason, I require visual representations of things to help me understand it better (written words confuse me sometimes).I have confered with massage therapists and sports med docs about what to do about my sore back, messed up sholder (from swimming) and my stiff neck and shoulders (from heavy knapsack relative to my size, as well as due to stress and sitting at my computer). The information didn't stick, and the routines abandonded after a week. This book has made it more fun to stretch!I have looked at other books which have actual pictures of people stretching, but didn't have the area shaded where I should feel the stretch. When you stretch, that is what is important - where you feel it. This book get the job done fast and simple. After reading the introductory pages, now I feel a stiff or sore muscle somewhere, I pull out this book, look up a body part and get myself into the position. If I don't feel the stretch in the shaded area, I try adjusting a little, and read the paragraph. The sequence of stretches at the end of each section is great as well, since I have a hard time deciding what order to do things in. With this book it is all laid out for those people who like (and need) routine.The quick reference summaries at the end are great. This ensures that people will be more likely to stick to the routine if they have a 'program' made for them already. The benefits of having a regualr strethcing program has been widely documented in many sports articles, medical articles and such. The olympic swim coaches where I work are all for stretching for and hour and a half four times a week for the athletes.My one major qualm is the section called &quot;Blue Collar Stretches&quot;. I think it should be corrected to something else more politically correct. My one minor qualm is that the summary pictographs do not have the shaded area on them. It would've been great if they had the shaded area to make an even better reference.As mentioned in other reviews, the book is good for the average person who isn't into a super stretching regimen, but rather for the person who would like guidance in knowing what kind of sports require what kind of stretching. People who just want to start feeling more relaxed and good about doing so without pressure of all the technicalities and long muscle names will love this book. It is not intimidating or condescending, it encourages everyone to slow down and carefully stretch, at any level, at any age.I didn't know how to stretch a particular muscle in my thigh, and friends weren't able to find a stretch either. The runner guy who comes water running while I lifeguard didn't even know either! I was greatful when I foudn that this book had this uncommon stretch. I was impressed!!I am so pleased that I already recommended it on a triathlete message board!The guy in the ski hat with the 70's party hairstyle is all good. Is it just me, or is he wearing those old skool athletic short shorts?Go and buy this book! You will be glad the next time you wake up in the morning after a hard workout the day before and find your ________ is sore. Happy stretching everyone!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I am a 60 year old seamstress and one of my clients recommended Bob anderson's book on stretching.

This book is a must for all."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"Bob Anderson covers a tremendous number of stretches of all sorts. The descriptions are very good, and the line drawings are excellent. I have two quibbles though:1) Bob has quite a few stretches that involve extreme folding of the knee joint, a very difficult positions for anyone with knee problems. I wish he would have optional stretches that didn't involve the knee being bent so much.2) Bob categorizes his stretches by the area of the body that is stretched. It would be helpful to consistently list the muscle(s) stretched in the index so, for example, if one needed to stretch out her/his psoas muscle, one could simply look up the stretches that will do that.In spite of these, I use the book every day, it is well worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I've studied goju ryu karate for almost ten years now and as a result have several orthopedic injuries (my knee, neck, and shoulder). They all make working out rather hard to do without agrivating injuries for several days, so I've gotten rather out of shape and fallen out of karate.This book, however, has me on the mend. The stretches are great--very well thought out, safe, and easy to follow. The directions are easy to read, but most of the illustrations alone show you what to do without reading a word (though I do agree with other reviewers, they are a bit cheesey--but if it ain't broke, don't fix it!). I use the stretches to CAREFULLY isolate my injured muscle groups before and after I work out, and I've reduced my pain drastically.I've stretched for years using the traditional stretches of my dojo that my sensei has shown me. These stretches go way beyond that level. In fact, I intend to give it to my sensei for xmas this year.Another great feature of this book is the sections in the back for different activities. It has a quick run down of what stretches to do for various sports--karate, running, ball games, stretches in the office while sitting down, whatever suits your fancy.If you're looking for a book on stretching, look no more. Add this bad boy to your shopping cart and move on. If my injuries were worse, I may not be able to use the stretches, but after seeing physical therapists and a personal trainer, I know enough about my body and my injuries to not push it.

Without being preachy, it recommends moderation; without being childish, it emphasizes care, conditioning and attention to body messages. It is gentle, generic, and non-aggressive.

Stretches include not only illustrations which show exactly what muscle groups will be stretched, but also specific advice on positioning and execution along with cautions, when relevant. The cross-referencing of muscles, stretches, and sequences is extremely valuable, as are the pages devoted to stretches in the office, before specific sports, after sitting, on an airplane, etc. You name it.

At the time, I was a weekend warrior playing on a softball team, and my friend was a very experienced weighlifter and martial artist. The sport-by-sport organization is really useful, and the illustrations for each stretch are simple but easy to follow. I also like that the part of the body where you should feel the stretch is covered with dots, making it easy to identify. I recently gave the book as a gift to a couple I know: a police officer in his late 30s who plays rugby on the weekends, and his wife, a runner who has also taken up horseback riding. They both love it.

The only drawback was that it gave insufficient warning for people with back injuries. I broke my back a few years ago and need to keep limber.

Secondly, there are drawings, which demonstrate the correct way to do these stretches. Stretching is an important part of any exercise regime and this book helps out by providing a necessary guide to stretching. The author points out the dangers of overstretching and gives the reader good advice for their regimes."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I'm a fitness professional and I've been scouring bookstores for a decent stretch book that I could use to plan comprehensive stretch routines for my classes. Finally I found it. Stretching by Bob Anderson is the best stretch book I've found yet for my purposes.The illustrations are quite good. They show a man with longish, curly hair wearing a wool ski hat--which struck me as funny. But then again, it was published in the 70s.I like how this book is organized. It's separated into parts of the body, i.e. legs, neck etc. It also outlines sports specific stretch sequences which is helpful for the general public.I don't like the fact that you have to read the text of each stretch to learn which specific muscles each stretch emphasizes.Overall, I intend to use this book to plan stretch routines routinely. If you're a fitness professional looking for a stretch reference book, this is a pretty good one."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"If you are looking for a book on stretching, go no place else, this is it. While there are other new theories on proper stretching technique for specific results, or muscle fibers or sports, this book and the techniques it teaches are widely considered the mainstream of stretching technique.You will find stretches for almost every single muscle in your body. Diagrams of each stretch show proper stretching technique and where the tension should be felt. The book runs through each of the main stretches, suggests a program for everyday stretching, and has a number of sport-specific programs. Yes, the pencil diagrams are corny, but as soon as you get over that, you will realize there is a wealth of information in here.Should you do yoga or stretching? Yoga w/ a tape or a class is certainly a mind/body event that many people enjoy as a part of their fitness routine. But for a fitness regimen, a 20 minute stretching routine every morning or night has advantages over yoga. Yoga is essentially stretching exercises combined with isometric weight resistance. But yoga can often overextend or place undue stress on the ligaments/tendons and often the positions are not stretching the full length of the muscle, and if they are the positions often stretch the muscle to its limit immediately, rather than gradually, which has been shown to provide better flexibility results. With regard to the isometrics, if you are looking to build strength and/or muscle you need the progressive weight resistance that free weights or machines will provide - the isometrics will not provide significant results.Stretching on a regular basis (along w/ aerobics and eating right) will leave you feeling relaxed and energized and if there is one stretching book you should own, this has got to be it."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"Excellent content. Many stretches, reasonably well-organized, and displayed using simple diagrams.What I don't like- There are many effective stretches that aren't included. Especially: Isometric Stretching is not mentioned. Isometric stretching is considered (at least by the author of \\"Warrior Speed\\") to be by far the most effective way to increase your flexibility. It seems kind of ridiculous to me that it isn't covered in this book.Overall its a great book, although you'll find plenty of info elsewhere that is not covered by this book. (Therefore it shouldn't be considered a *complete* guide to stretching IMHO.) A large section of this book is dedicated to sports-specific stretches, but you'll probably find this section almost useless compared to other books specific to your sport of choice."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"A basic reference book of stretching exercises used to stretch different body-areas before and after sports and/or daily activities. The pictures are very well-done and are especially descriptive with arrows illustrating clearly the correct movement when doing the stretch. My favorite 2 pages in the book are &quot;Everyday Stretches&quot; used for 10-15 min per day to fine-tune your muscles and reduce stress. These daily exercises are clearly outlined with pictures and can easily be completed once a day even with a busy lifestyle!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I'm writing to add to the praise that the other reviewers have heaped on this book. It's easy to read, and you really do feel better when you do the stretches. I'm a middle aged man, overweight, and not at all flexible, and I've found that it helps a lot. If you do the stretches, you'll literally start to feel better after two or three days. This is the only physical activity I've run across that pays off so quickly.Someone else complained that certain types of stretches weren't included in the book. According to the text, some stretches were left out because they were risky -- people who don't know what they're doing might hurt themselves. Perhaps the missing isometric stretches that were mentioned fall into that category.I don't have any back problems, but I do several stretches that target the back and spine as part of my daily routine. That's when I most appreciate the conservative approach taken by the authors, as it seems like there would be a lot of potential for trouble there. The fact that so many people with back problems do these stretches safely, and receive benefits from them, says something important about the book's approach.I don't know if this is the quickest way to become more flexible. I do know that it's a good way to become more flexible, that it works, and that I haven't had any problems at all -- no pain, no injuries, nothing.I like it a lot."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"In the good old days of typewriters, carbon papers, and stencil sheets, literary authorship served society at highest ethical, scientific, and artistic standards. In contrast, today's word processors and graphic software attracted to the field of book publishing plenty of con artists and commercial profiteers. This book on stretching by Anderson demonstrates the utmost dedication of its author to public welfare. Without sophisticated cameras or elegant graphing capabilities, the author was able to present all aspects of motion of human stretching by relying on hand-drawn sketches.And what sketches? All his males wore vegetables-dried hats (trade marked Bob Anderson). Travelers wore proper attire; sun glasses and ties. Athletes from different sports wore proper costumes for weightlifting, wrestling, swimming, or figure skating. The angles, curves, and proportions of his candidates are flawless. Such dedication to presentation of artwork allows the author to engage his gifted talent in mastering his subject in believable and respectful fashion.Then, there come the scientific contribution. The author reasonably covers the various physiological facets of stretching.1. Stretching enhances mind over body control and tunes up performance.2. Stretching overcomes muscular overtone and stress.3. Stretching prevents injury and stiffness.4. Stretching enhances awareness of body motion.5. Stretching strengthens muscles by avoiding shortness of tendons and maintaining proper range of motion.6. Stretching enhances physical performance as we age. All animals stretch frequently and instinctually in order to stay mobile.Each stretching exercise entails a shadowed area where its effect is expected without arcane scientific jargon. The depth of knowledge of the author is demonstrated in the diverse combination of complex planes of motions, wide ranges of motion, and logical sequences of executing exercises. It recommends few minutes of warming up before commencing stretching.In conclusion, you should consider this book an essential reference not only for stretching but also for strengthening and overall conditioning. It even could be used as a substitute for all other exercises if the reader is interested in healthy and fit living but dreaming to get to the Olympics.Mohamed F.

Robert and Jean Anderson of Englewood Colorado published a landmark book on the subject in 1975.Their first book \\"Stretching\\" was published on a typewriter or simple word processor and illustrated by Jean Anderson in simple clear line drawings. Jean decorated many of the figures with hand knitted caps which she sold by mail.Bob Anderson was discovered by professional athletes and soon worked with players on national football and baseball teams. So called ballistic stretching to a national standard of flexibility had been the norm. Anderson's program is based on a two-phase slow, static stretching only up to the physical potential of each unique individual. Stretching is now a million copy best seller available on the web in paperback at a nominal cost.Here is a quote from the original edition in 1975:\\"When you begin a stretch, the first twenty to thirty seconds of the stretch is spent in the \\"easy stretch\\". Here you can totally relax while you feel an easy stretch. After this phase of stretching, slowly go into the \\"developmental stretch\\". Here the feeling of the stretch will become more intense but it should not be actual pain. Straining will keep you from relaxing, both mentally and physically. You should not stretch in the \\"drastic stretch\\". Here the body is uneasy and it is impossible to relax. Here the mind becomes dull. Here you may injure yourself.When stretching, your breathing should be slow, rhythmical and under control. If you are bending forward to do a stretch, exhale as you bend forward and then breathe at a slow, rhythmical pace as you hold the stretch. Do not hold your breath while stretching. If the position of a stretch inhibits your natural breathing pattern, then obviously you are not in a relaxed position. Just ease up on the stretch to where natural, slow, rhythmical breathing is possible. If breathing is difficult, then you are straining, and straining is negative and leads to not doing.There is absolutely no place for straining in stretching. Straining is very negative. Actually, it is absurd. So you must understand from the beginning that relaxation and a feeling of a \\"good stretch\\" is really the essence of stretching.If you learn how to stretch without straining, every movement you make will become easier. It takes time to loosen up tight muscles or muscle groups, but time is quickly forgotten when you become regular with stretching. If you stretch to feel good and not to look different or to become flexible, you will surely find that how you feel is vastly more important than how you look. Stretching will help you more if you stretch for good feelings. Let your mind and body feel. If you learn to enjoy stretching and movement, then all the results of being regular with stretching will be yours.As you become familiar with stretching, you will naturally find that your flexibility increases when you stretch in the developmental phase. As you learn to stretch and relax, the feelings of the stretch will change and you must gradually increase the stretch until the developmental phase is reached again. By gradually working within your own comfortable and painless limits, you will be able to go beyond your present limits and come closer to your personal potential.\\"This diagram will give you an idea of a \\"good stretch\\":&lt;-------------------------------------------------A STRETCH---------------------------------------------------->&lt;----AN EASY STRETCH------>&lt;-------THE DEVELOPMENTAL PART OF STRETCHING-------->&lt;--------A DRASTIC STRETCH----->&lt;--(HOLD FOR 20-30 SECONDS)-->&lt;-------(HOLD FOR 30 SECONDS OR LONGER)----- ---->&lt;--(DO NOT DRASTIC STREACH!)--->There are several sport specific routines for traditional mountaineering in this valuable book.This inexpensive paperback belongs in the library of every Traditional Mountaineer.-Robert Speik, [...]Former Chair of the Mountaineering Training Committee, Sierra Club's Angeles Chapter"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I will admit I buy quite a lot of books and many end up just sitting on a bookshelf. This one has already gotten quite a bit of use, however. I was having trouble with posture and aches from working long hours on a computer at a desk job. This book is a really good antidote along with working out. The intro is quick and easy to read through and then the routines are all pictured so you don't have to sit and study, you can just prop the book open and go through the routine pretty quickly. It does have important notes of how to do the stretch, but once you learn it well enough you can just go through the pictures. It helps a lot when you're learning though. I thought I knew about stretching, but realized how useful this book is and also learned to stretch with sensitivity. I've actually made greater gains in flexibility while seemingly exerting less effort, just because I know I am stretching correctly now, instead of just harder. Plus you can look up stretches by what muscle groups you want to work (perfect for example when you want to work out a tight neck or back) and also routines using those stretches for various sports and activities. I also got the Stretching Anatomy book and that one has been opened once and is sitting gathering dust already. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"At sixty years young I decided to incorporate stretching exercises into my bike training program.

If you are an active athelete that trains for a specific sport, you will not find much in here that is earth shattering.

Its really very useful.Because of this book I have not injured myself exercising. Stretching is now a part of my life, and I owe it all to Bob and his fantastic book.I was just asked about stretching and so recommended this book (as I have done many times over the years), I noticed a 20yr anniversary version is available.

The book uses static stretches. Static stretching has since been shown to actually tighten muscles - in fact, worse than ballistic stretching. And you should never stretch before an activity beyond a few dynamic stretches.The stretches in this book hurt my muscles and definitely lowered my performance in sports. I kept on doing the stretches anyway because it seemed like it should work. I regret that.I would recommend a different technique over simple static stretching - either active isolated stretching or relax-contract stretching for real results."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"Whether you start with the Book of Genesis or the Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, we humans have long loved tales about creating a new world--or building one from scratch. Lloyd Kahn's new book, Builders of the Pacific Coast, is primarily an account of builders and hand-crafted structures dating from the 60s to the 80s. Yet the rugged coastal setting of his odyssey--a blue and green world from Point Reyes Peninsula to Vancouver Island--invokes a simpler, more pristine time, an Eden of sorts. When forests grew down to the sea, building codes were few, lumber was plentiful (often free) and anyone with skill, a strong back and the courage to try could create something beautiful and enduring.On every page of this book is something shocking and delightful. A boat with legs. A roof like a leaf. A caravan with eyes. A split-cedar woodshed shaped like a bird. Stair rails so sinuous and snakey they might come to life and grab you. Sculpted earth walls. Round windows and arched doors. Roofs curved like seagull wings. Grottos choked with ferns and flowers.Not that there's any shortage of creatures and fantastical characters. Just off-camera lurk orcas, eagles and bears. And then there are the builders themselves. There hasn't been a cast of characters this colorful since Ken Kesey packed up his Underwood.Builders of the Pacific Coast rolls on, mile after mile, in an odyssey so firsthand and vivid that you feel every rut in the road. And come to know, as Lloyd Kahn did, the soul of the place. The strong hands and big hearts of the people, the staggering abundance of the land and sea, the leaping joy that such a place still exists."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"Just as described and received in a timely manner.

I got nowhere with it."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This method of stretching is not the best way to get flexible and relieve pain or whatever you're trying to do. It is about relaxed stretching, the actual lengthening of your muscles. Everyone is already capable of doing the splits, their body just doesn't know it yet(your muscles are plenty long enough already). You do not need to stretch anything. You must make your nervous system believe it's safe to move into that new position. It is also dangerous because it messes with your stretch reflex. Check out Pavel Tsatsouline's book Beyond Stretching. This Russian knows much more than Bob. Trust me."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"as a massage therapist i come across many books on health. this is the basic STANDARD so to speak ... a great book on stetching, even if it isn't 'high tech' on illustrations. the drawings are clear, and show you where you should be feeling the stretch .. and if you don't.. maybe you should actually READ THE INSTRUCTIONS :)haa. clear and well written. i often copy a page for personal use and paste to the wall to remind me what to do, until it becomes routine. instructions for basic do and don'ts, as well as for trouble areas of the body, and then detailing stretching for activities from skiing, golf, TV:) , even rodeo!!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"It's a no brainer, stretching is good for you and this book takes you through the muscle groups.

This book not only did that, but it hammered home the message that you shouldn't compare your flexibility to that of others, and that stretching has a multitude of practical benefits, besides flexibility. This is not a book for extremists trying to do the splits on two folding chairs with a child perched on their shoulders.

It has many different stretches for all activities, as well as isolated stretches for particular parts of the body. An inexpensive addition to a home or professional library."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I purchased this based on my chiropractors recommendation. She strongly encouraged me to read the beginning chapters so that I understood how the book was written and how to interpret the illustrations. (I am still getting through this - I hate instructions!!) I have been a dancer for years, but never had a resource to search for the exact muscle group that I was trying to work when my normal routine did not stretch the right area. My favorite feature is the body diagram (pg 24-25) which acts as a quick reference to select the group of muscles (and corresponding page) that you are looking to stretch. The section that details specific stretches for different activities has been exceptionally handy as I don't always realize all of the muscles a certain activity uses. I just picked up golf and have been using these stretches before and after playing - it has made a noticeable difference in how I feel when I play and most importantly, the next day! Simply great for visual people and when you need a reference for a muscle group that you aren't used to stretching. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"This is an excellent book.

After many months of physical therapy I figured out that stretching properly 2 to 3 times a day helped my knees the most. That is why I purchased this book, and it helped me quite a bit to get into a regular stretch routine, and to figure out which stretches helped me the most (although that is not exactly the purpose of this book).The only thing I do not like about the book is that it is difficult to lay it flat on the floor with the pages open. You will need something to hold the pages open; I ended up photo-copying the pages that I used the most (even though you will most likely end up memorizing everything you need).Also I should say that the book/stretching did not completely fix my knee problems, in fact I had to have surgery on both of my knees. But, then the book helped me again in recovery when at home."},{"Title":"Stretching","review":"I was looking for a complete guide about stretching and I've found this book. I started from the very first page without jumping directly to the last section with all figures but read the guidelines about stretching. Once you've done this, you can jump back and forth through the various sections and stretch what you need according to your sport activity. Believe me it works as long as you follow the author's suggestions. I sleep better, I run better, I feel better.

In fact, I think it was the first stretching book I ever bought and I've recently updated my worn out copy. If you want a quick reference or organized stretching workouts for any of the most popular sports, this is a good book to have on your shelf. For some more in depth instruction, more unusual exercises and the \\"why\\" behind stretching and flexibility, I would also recommend Ultimate Flexibility.

I make a conscious effort to learn new things each day and bring my business to higher and higher levels. It was in this spirit that I bought this item.The author gives a &quot;test&quot; at the beginning to &quot;qualify&quot; people considering self-employment. If you &quot;fail&quot; as many as two questions, he says, you won't succeed in business. Better keep your day job. I &quot;failed&quot; several of the questions. So why am I successfully self-employed, making a six-figure income? The answer is that Mr. Schiffman's test is highly flawed. It pains me to think that people who could succeed in business, as I did, will take this &quot;test,&quot; &quot;fail&quot; it, and then be discouraged.The author comes across as a very sincere person, someone who is decent and well-intentioned. But his &quot;definitive guide&quot; consists of tired platitudes (admit your mistakes, consult a financial advisor, take time off to relax, etc.) that are of little value to anyone with common sense.The author asserts that you have to spend more money (on your infrastructure) as you become more successful. If that ever was a valid business model, it certainly no longer is and my own experience is testimony to that. Each year, I spend less, because I know what doesn't work, because technology is improving and I can harness technology to work for me.In short, I'm afraid that this guide can potentially do people more harm than good."},{"Title":"Make It Your Business: The Definitive Guide to Launching and Succeeding in Your Own Business","review":"Schiffman does a good job of outlining the dos and don'ts of starting your own business. As a small business owner, I was looking forward to reading the book.However, like many business books, this book disappoints. All you get is common sense solutions and advice. While I did manage to get a few pieces of advice that I can use, I didn't snag much more than that."},{"Title":"The Other Rules: Never Wear Panties on a First Date and Other Tips","review":"Watch out Tom, Harry, and especially Dick! We girls are coming for YOU! &quot;Never Wear Panties On The First Date&quot; is by far the most liberating book I have ever read. As a single girl, I have often fought with the &quot;rules&quot; that my mother passed down to me and I have never felt comfortable with the &quot;double standard&quot; between the sexes! Finally, along comes a book that is bold enough to throw out the old &quot;rules&quot; and level the playing field for us girls...this is that book! I strongly believe that every girl should be given this book on her sixteenth birthday instead of the usual pretty panties...after she reads this book, she won't need them! After all, no girl likes sitting at home waiting for her boyfriend to call...if he calls at all--Well, when he doesn't call, this book gives girls the courage to not just go out, but to go out (minus panties) and get laid! There are a ton of great ideas in this book for some of the hottest sex imaginable for single, engaged, and married women...and it doesn't always involve their boyfriends or husbands! What they don't know can't hurt them, right? Don't miss out on this one, girls!!

I don't intend to spend my life catering to some guy - trying to make his life great while mine sucks.) Sex and seduction should be fun - whatever style you choose. This book teaches (or reminds) you different ways to be sexy (for yourself or someone else). Feel sexy for yourself first - someone else will catch on eventually."},{"Title":"The Other Rules: Never Wear Panties on a First Date and Other Tips","review":"SEX for the sheer sake of SEX! And a book to make us girls feel GOOD about it! NO GUILT! I was never allowed to fully enjoy the experience of just 'doing it' for the sheer sake of doing it! I was always told it had to involve LOVE! Well, it DOESN'T...Just ask any guy. And it's time that WE girls start treating it that way! This book has given me a healthy respect for the power of a man's penis. It explained the unprovoked erections ruling his thoughts and actions. No wonder men are obsessed with sex practically from birth. Girls are not as blessed or fortunate with the same direction and motivation. Instead we think about love and marriage from a very early age, which sets the stage for the rest of our lives. Life would be a lot easier and much more satisfying if, from the start, we thought of only satisfying the craving between our thighs! Then we wouldn't feel guilty when we have that \\"one night stand\\" and realized that we, too, just wanted to get \`laid' and not necessarily to have a baby. Guys and girls wouldn't have to play games with one another. Men wouldn't have to pretend to love a girl that they just wanted to 'sleep' with a few times and girls could finally relax and not stress out so much over whether or not they meant it. We'd all get along and have lots of fun, free, and UNCONDITIONAL sex! I think a little bit of \\"sex awareness\\" in our gender could go a long way toward creating harmonious relationships with the guys. I concur with the Authors that the harmony of those relationships will only occur after girls begin to understand the true nature of the penis. To prove my next point, I will put forth a question to the female audience: How many of you girls buy Playgirl Magazine? The answer, of course, is not many. Sure, all of us have picked up an issue once or twice out of curiosity, but very few of us subscribe or even occasionally purchase the magazine. It often makes me wonder how in the world the damn publication doesn't go bankrupt. On the flip side of this question, how many of us girls know guys who buy Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, or any of the hundreds of other magazines dedicated to the relentless pursuit of separating very pretty girls from their panties? That's right, every one of us knows a guy-hell that covers just about every guy I've ever known! I know this is a subject that is of considerable irritation to many girls, and that is precisely why I have chosen to mention it. Like many of my female friends, I was crushed when I first found out that one of my boyfriends was \`looking' at pictures of other girls in these magazines. I immediately felt inadequate, unattractive, and unappreciated. Not that he had ever expressed any dissatisfaction with me as a girlfriend, but still, I felt inept in almost every area. Within a matter of a week, I was secretly having sex with his best friend out of hurt and revenge. At the time, I felt justified in my actions. Now, I'm not so sure...that I had sex with his best friend for the \`right' reasons.Some time ago, an ex-boyfriend finally sat me down and explained to me that men don't necessarily \`look' at these magazines because of feelings of inadequate girlfriends, but rather because men have realized one important truth: Variety is the spice of life! I know what most of you girls would say to that, so let me say it for you-Yes, Girls love variety too, but there is an important difference. When a girl wants to see a guy naked, she doesn't have to buy a magazine. All she has to do is simply ask. All of us girls know this to be true. How many guys would strip out of their Levi jeans in a heartbeat from nothing more than the sweet request of a pretty girl? Yep, all of them would! But how many girls would do the same for a guy? Almost none of us would. No, as girls, we want a commitment from the guys before we'll drop our panties. We want our guys to promise and profess their undying love for us, which includes their inability to ever even think about any other girl. While that's all fine and dandy, if the guy really feels that way, I have yet to meet a guy who wanted anything more than a \`sweet piece of our pie' after just a few dates. So why do we hold them accountable for &quot;undying love&quot; and all that jazz. As the book states, what we inevitably get 9 out of 10 times is a LIE so that they can get into our pants! Girls must understand the incredible urges that a man is subjected to from his penis. A penis loves to have sex! It wants his girlfriend! It wants his girlfriend's best friend! It wants the whole cheerleading squad! Trust me, I know. It WASN'T hard at all to convince my boyfriend's best friend to have sex with me. At the time, I did it out of revenge; he did it because he couldn't help himself. His penis made the decision for him! That, of course, brings me back to my original point, which is that I shouldn't have retaliated against my boyfriend after discovering his hidden supply of Girlie magazines. Don't misunderstand me, I'm NOT sorry I had sex with his best friend, he was after all, a \`fantastic lay,' I'm just sorry I did it out of revenge. I know I would have ENJOYED it even more, if I had relaxed and enjoyed the ride instead of simmering with feelings of betrayal as his best friend pounded me from behind.

The lead author, Sharpe has produced a very uneven work. A look at the bibiliography shows how little research & editorial effort went into this. Most of the LAH photos are non-combat ceremonial while most of the frontline photos cannot be specifically identified to the LAH. Many of the captions are a joke. A photo of a SS-VT soldier firing a Mauser Schnellfeuer is identified as a Luger. A rare photo of Sepp Dietrich in black SS uniform shows him with his lower right tunic button undone and his swastika armband (kampfbinde) slipped down below his elbow to his lower left forearm, so it rests just above the Adolf Hitler cufftitle. A single rejected photo never previously published is not enough to warrant purchase of this title. The maps are virtually useless. This book is just adequate for a budding high school military history buff but it's insufficient when compared to the many other superior books on the subject."},{"Title":"Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler: 1st SS Panzer Division (Spearhead)","review":"There are far better books available than this one for only a bit more money."},{"Title":"Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler: 1st SS Panzer Division (Spearhead)","review":"In response to L.Wong's critique of Brian Davis' and my book, he is correct in that I was the lead author on this title.

That said, I fail to see how a photograph depicting Deitrich at such an unguarded moment is somehow faulty. Is it implied that he should be potrayed in a better light?Due to the format of this series, certain brevity was necessary. We attempted to provide an accessible book at a reasonable price. Of course it is not as comprehensive as the twin-volume books that are on the market(although at a much greater price) but I am confident that Brian and I have produced for Ian Allen a very useful history of the Leibstandarte.Mike Sharpe"},{"Title":"Artificial Reality","review":"This book shows Myron's advanced view on interactive art.

(i.e., putting kids in Daycare before the age of 3).She talks about the dangers of kids who come home from school and are alone until parents return from work.She also devotes considerable time to the rise in childhood obesity and how the above factors contribute to that.This is certainly not a mere \\"Blame the mom\\" screed as some might call it. THere is a nuanced and deep look at parenting in these busy times."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"There is a lot of noise in our society about our troubled young. And that is well because it is true. There are also an almost infinite number of suggestions on how to \\"manage\\" these problems: counseling, more counseling, medication, raising daycare standards, yet more counseling and more medication, and on and on it goes.This powerful book asks a somewhat different question. What if the problem isn't the kids? What if their reactions are reasonable responses to a toxic environment of outsourced childrearing (to daycare and medication), of absent fathers, of transient relationships in their relationship role models, and in consistently bad advice given them on sex, careers, and marriage?She points out the current themes in popular music are abandonment, hurt from missing parents, rage against parental neglect, and the need for oblivion to escape the pain of loneliness. It isn't rebelling against mom and pop anymore. It is more like where are mom and dad and why don't they care about me. This is sad and painful on all fronts.Mary Eberstadt is clear and honest in her facts and analysis. She admits there is neither simple panacea nor even a complex solution. She advocates beginning with a new consensus that it would be better for both children and adults if more American parents were with their kids more of the time. I know that sounds simplistic, but it is not simple. Given the financial burdens most families have taken on, it is very hard to make something like this happen. However, if we decide we believe we need our kids and they need us and that time together is important, we can make adjustments in our lives to make that happen.I hope this book is widely read and widely discussed in thoughtful ways rather than just the normal political yelling at the other side. The topic affects us all. We all have an important stake in this and we all shoulder some of the blame.

For instance, the amount of medication our children are taking to make them \\"normal.\\" The rise of aggression in our youngest children. The rise in childhood obsesity, because we no longer live in a world where children play, outside of highly structured, controlled events.I don't disagree with anything descriptive she says about these issues. (And in fact, her chapter on GenX and Hip Hop music is quite well done.) But she blames this on a current culture where women (and men) leave their children in daycare, too focused on their own careers to care about them.And given her personal experience, there is much that probably bears this out. She lives in Washington DC, in a very nice, very expensive neighborhood. The mood around her is definitely a liberal, career driven one.However, I live in a red town, in a red county, in a red state. I live in a neighborhood of stay at home mothers, and fathers who are able to attend games and volunteer for boy scouting events. And what do I see? Children who are aggressive. Children who are obese. Children who are on medication. Most children do not play outside on our cul-de-sac because it \\"isn't safe.\\" (I honestly have no idea what that means -- it is far safer from anywhere else I've ever lived.)So even the right knows there is a problem with parenting. They blame the left, perhaps because they live in a left-wing world themselves. But for those of us who are NOT living in left-wing cultural milieus, those explanations fall flat.But the parenting problem remains in the US today. One of the few things the left and the right agree on."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"The author explores a number of issues arising from children not being raised by their parents. Over the last couple decades more and more children no longer have a parent to greet them at the door when school is over. This is largely driven by the mother going into the workforce, and to some extent by the huge increase in divorce. Children are now being raised by daycare centers, by the schools, and sometimes they are raising themselves. The author covers in detail many of the problems that have resulted from these changes.There is no easy way to summarize all the types of problems explored in the book. I'll just mention of few of them. The author shows how many daycare centers are germ factories, for children are much more likely to catch a disease in a daycare center. The less time a parent spends with a young child, the more likely the young child will become violent. There has been a huge increase in the percentage of children who are fat and truly obese. Historically parents controlled how much children got to eat, but now often children get to decide. There are a lot more mental health problems now, versus a couple decades ago. Teachers and daycare centers are turning to drugs to medicate children for what had been considered normal juvenile behavior. Many of these drugs haven't been fully tested. It was fascinating to read about how much of the popular teenage music now is a cry for parents to be parents. Five of the top ten most frequently reported diseases in 1995 were STDs. Most children having sex are having sex in an unsupervised home. This is just a small sample of the dozens of problems children in America are now facing.If you have children, this is a good book to read. It will help you understand the true costs and potential dangers your children may be exposed to if you try to outsource the raising of your children."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"Contrary to popular belief, not even a \\"village\\" can substitute for a mother.Unlike many \\"committed\\" treatments of this subject, this author adopts a scientific approach, citing studies and reasoning in a clear and cogent way.The problem: (p. 20)In 1975, 33 percent of children under six had employed mothers.In 1993, 55 percent of children under six had employed mothers.In 2000, 70 percent of children under six had employed mothers.The ideological battles are exactly what you would expect. Militant feminists regard these numbers as good news: more women are employed. Family people regard these numbers as bad news: children are growing up without their mothers (or fathers or grandmothers, as it turns out).But there is more bad news: enraged children, fat children, drug-addicted children (not yesterday's drugs like marijuana but prescribed drugs, legal drugs), rage-driven pop-music-addicted children. With a younger generation like this on the way, who needs terrorists, Reconquistadores and the like? We've got them anyway, of course, and nothing is being done about them.

The results of this grand social experiment are beginning to come in. And Mary Eberstadt does not like what she sees. Nor should we.We have embarked upon a unique historical trial of seeing what life is like for children who have been for the most part separated from their parents. And while there may have been some benefits for the parents, few people were asking the really important questions: What about the children? Is parent-absence good for the kids?While Eberstadt recognises that correlation does not always equal causation, she rightly questions why adults always try to put a positive spin on child separation when children seem to take a much different view. We need to stop looking at this problem as if it is all about adult choices, and start focusing on the possible harm our children are experiencing.And there seems to be plenty of harm. We have witnessed in the past few decades a huge rise in childhood problems, whether sexual promiscuity, mental health problems, the rise of the prescription drug generation, childhood obesity, and many more worrying symptoms.Eberstadt argues that all of these problems, at least to some extent, can be tied in to parental absence. Consider the issue of obesity. Eberstadt looks at possible reasons for this, but then focuses on the real culprit: absent parents. When kids are kept home-alone, they are usually kept inside for safety sake. Thus they usually end up in front of the TV or computer, instead of running around outside.Also, without a parent at home to prepare a healthy meal, kids are often left to live on junk food. These two factors alone explain much of the childhood obesity problem. Common sense bears this out, and research helps to confirm it. For example, we know that kids are less at risk of obesity problems if breastfed. But absent mums means no or little breast-feeding.Eberstatd also looks at the alarming rise in psychotropic medicines. Kids are being plied with various drugs at an unprecedented level, be it for ADHD, for depression, or whatever. Yet a growing body of literature is showing that there are many risks associated with drugs such as Ritalin, Paxil, Risperdal and the various anti-depressants, and stimulants such as methylphenidate.Why are we drugging our children as such high levels, even with the known risks? Eberstadt again suggests that parental absence is part of the reason our children are experiencing so many problems. Most of these drugs are really behaviour-management or performance-enhancing drugs, designed to give a technological quick-fix to what may just be old-fashioned discipline problems, or what may be largely manageable when a parent is around.But with parents absent in such great numbers, more and more of our child-carers resort to drugs to fix the problem. And the ironic thing is, it may well be the stresses and unhappiness caused by parental separation that is getting the kids into more trouble to begin with.Eberstadt also looks at the day-care industry, and how we are allowing a generation of kids to be looked after by strangers. She examines the huge increase in emotional and psychological problems plaguing our children. She also looks at the rise of violence among children.All in all, our kids are experiencing an unprecedented tidal wave of physical, social and psychological problems that we normally associate with adults. And these problems have arisen at exactly the same time that we have seen absentee parenting mushroom.Adults living in denial will want to say that the two are simply not connected. Perhaps they are right. But the correlation seems to be strong, and some type of causality seems to be involved. If so, then for the sake of our children we need to slow down and take stock of how this rise in parent-separation is affecting our children.Eberstadt finishes her volume with a simple plea. She does not offer a checklist of policy options or steps on what must be done. She instead summarises the findings of this book by stating what most of us should know by common sense and experience: children do better, generally speaking, when parental absence is minimised, and they do worse, generally speaking, when it is not.Parental presence will not solve all the problems mentioned in this book, but it will help quite a bit. But unless we are ready to get real about the damage being done to our children by parental absence, things will continue to worsen. We can turn things around if we are really concerned about the welfare of our children. And this book helps point us in the right direction."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"If you think our schools are bad today - read this book. If you think throwing more money at our schools will help, read this book. If you think everyone else is at fault except the parents with regards to today's children, read this book. This is by far the most profound book of the century. Mary Eberstadt is a genious! The problem with our schools, our children, our society is THE PARENTS! I take responsibility for my kids, for their actions, for their grades, for their troubles because I am at home raising them to be good sound citizens and human beings. I do not blame the schools, the government and mother earth...it is me! I wish every teacher, every mom and dad, every person even thinking of becoming a mom or dad would read this book. It's the best book I've read in my entire 30 years of studying and taking care of children. Mary Eberstadt is telling the truth - it is about parents taking responsibility. I would give this book the highest mark available. I would recommend this book to everyone that has any dealings with, or contact with, children...Basically this book is about how no one is watching the children, referencing them as ferel kids. Children of today are raising themselves then we expect the schools to do all the disciplinary duties when in actuality it should have been done already at home. Teachers of today can't possibly teach a room full of children that are totally unable to sit still in their chairs, that lack respect, and that are either too tired or too hung-over to learn and pay attention. Looking at children from the 50's and today's children, there is a very strong and common thread of unsupervised kids...everyone wants to go to work, pursue their careers while leaving the children for some stranger to raise, or worse yet, locked up in their own homes alone after school. Do people today even know why babies cry when mommy leaves the room - why? It's a built in safety-valve that tells mom to stay close, to be there, to love and nurture. It wasn't there just to push mom's buttons! It's there to tell mom and dad that they NEED them! Nothing more, nothing less.Ms. Eberstadt's other most astounding fact is the importance of the music of today. Everyone blames the music - read her chapter on this matter and you'll see that the kids themselves have written the music because this is what they live, this is what they see, this is how they FEEL and this is how they are poorly parented, if at all! Songs of yesterday were about beaches, hot cars, relationships, love, the Beatles and the Beachboys...today's songs are about being alone, witnessing abuse, neglect, drugs, and about dad's leaving and especially about divorce. Wow! It's not what the music's doing to the kids - it's what we parents are doing to our children! They are sending a very profound message to us all. We just don't get it!I hope that Mary Eberstadt will write more on this very basic and forgotten art...being a plugged-in mom and dad. If one or other parent can't be home to raise their own children, why have them? We won't even let our neighbor borrow our family car, but we turn our most valued, treasured and blessed offspring over to some strangers for the better part of the day to raise. Why?"},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"Finally, an author who's willing to call it as she sees it. More than that, Mary Eberstadt is an author willing to voice dangerously un-PC views about the status of American children and families. This book exposes some of the deceptive research and antequated theory used to support the use of behavior drugs. Eberstadt voices what most people already know, but may be unwilling to admit: kids who have the love and support of their parents when they need it (not at their parent's convenience) do better in the long run.This book forces parents to remove the rose-colored glasses through which they may have once viewed the world."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"In a society that subordinates children's needs to adult freedoms, this book should give anyone pause. It offers a compelling case that the large-scale absence of parents from their children's lives via day care, video games,empty homes for schoolkids to return to (and have sex in), and so forth have a devastating impact on children and young people. The adult response of pathologizing and medicating the kids, or interning them in prison-like private boarding schools, only compounds the problem. It reflects and reinforces adult denial of children's needs and suffering.As Eberstadt points out, the kinds of critique she offers call down a ton of ideological abuse on the heads of those few who dare to make them--in academia these do not include scholars without secure employment! They are points and evidence that get brushed off as reactionary or sexist or unhelpfully guilt-inducing. Contrary to some reviews, this is not an attack on working mothers. Those many women who have no choice but to work full-time have no reason to feel guilt. But those parents--mothers and fathers both--who do have choice have reason to feel guilt and need to face the truth about the costs of their choices for their children.Any one of the studies Eberstadt cites, could be questioned for its methodological flaws, and some links between adult behavior and child suffering are not as strong as others. But the cumulative effect of the arguments and evidence the author presents is powerful. It merits serious and open discussion instead of the usual dismissal and denunciation from most feminists and liberals.The case is not just a matter of personal choices. Such cultural shifts are reflected and amplified in social policies. The normalizing of out-of-wedlock teen sex as reflected in much sex education; the assumption that mothers should (re)join the workforce as early as possible reflected in welfare reform; the assumption that women should adopt and adapt to the male model of subordinating family to work as reflected in so-called family-friendly policies that promote increased labor force participation of mothers (see Gilbert's excellent analysis,A Mother's Work: How Feminism, the Market, and Policy Shape Family Life--all these and related policies are redefining parenthood at the expense of children. (For more on this theme see my blog at [...] )This book focuses on the toll on children of these cultural and policy shifts of the past half century. For a recent critique of the misguided project of treating both sexes as if they were essentially identical except for anatomical details and the social construction of gender--and of squeezing women into male norms of work and family, see Susan Pinker's excellent study,The Sexual Paradox: Men, Women and the Real Gender Gap. But this book is about children. It is a bold challenge to the taboo on discussing the extent and nature of children's needs for their parents.As Eberstadt indicates, we need not a quick policy fix here and there, but a fundamental and honest re-assessment of our priorities in relation to children and young people--both personally and in the policy choices we make."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"Many books have been written recently telling women that they can Have It All; motherhood and a career. Few, if any, books look at the child's point of view.Even the best day care centers are little better than germ factories. If one child is sick, which happens frequently, it is nearly guaranteed that all of the other children, and the day care provider, will also get sick. There is also a large increase in aggressive and violent behavior among 3 and 4-year-olds. Pro-day care groups, who the author calls separationists, think that this is a good thing. Getting sick now means they will get fewer illnesses as they grow up, and being an aggressive bully means that they will grow up to be the sort of person not afraid to fight for what they want. (Really?)A major reason for the epidemic in childhood obesity is the lack of parental involvement. There are no adults around to keep an eye on children as they play in the backyard, or the local playground, so children are told to stay inside and lock the door. Children also go right for the junk food, skipping the fruit, because there are no adults around to teach them otherwise.Symptoms of conditions like Attention Deficit Disorder include fidgeting, losing things, interrupting, squirming and ignoring adults. These seem to be very close to normal childhood and adolescent behavior. No doubt, there are some children with an actual disability who are really helped by drugs like Prozac and Ritalin. For everyone else, is there some disease or mutation sweeping America causing the \\"wiring\\" in millions of adolescent brains to be faulty, requiring such psychotropic drugs?The teen pregnancy rate in America is going down, which is a good thing, but the rate of sexually transmitted disease is way up. The use of contraceptives does not always equal safe sex. Where do they do \\"it\\"? At home, or their partner's home, because their parents aren't around.What is to be done? Every adult must look at their own situation. Many parents work full time out of total necessity. For the others, can you be one of the adults to keep an eye on children allowing them to actually play outside? Can you coach an after-school sport or be a tutor? Can you simply be an adult figure for a child, like a Big Brother or Big Sister?This is a gem of a book that should be read, and talked about, by parents across America. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"This book was a great read and jammed packed with statistics and pertinent information.

Busy, overwhelmed and stressed working mothers are still blindly believing the spiels that these savvy center directors are delivering. These child center directors may be visionary managers who strive to provide the best care possible, but there are plenty of center directors out there who don't seem to have the children's best interests at heart. These misguided directors seem to be overwhelmed and they are pushed by the owners to keep costs way down so that they can maximize their profits. Since the youngest children in their care don't have voices of their own, it is so easy to exploit their vulnerability. If you have a child in day care who is under the age of three, you must educate yourself about how to recognize poor to mediocre quality child care. Children over the age of three will probably tell you if they are unhappy at their day care. They'll say, \\"Teacher mean!\\", or (God forbid), \\"Teacher hit me!\\" Preschool age children will probably tell you if there's something amiss in their classroom. Unfortunately, the younger children may not be able to articulate or demonstrate that they're not happy with the care they are receiving at their center. They may not be able to tell you about the overcrowding, the intimidation they feel when they are bullied by bigger and older students, and about how few opportunities they given to get a drink of water. Lots of times, the problems with poor quality child care are not easy to detect even by adults. Even savvy business people can't easily detect when a child is afraid of their day care teacher. They may think that the child is just showing respect by being very well-behaved. The parent may think that the child is sitting still and being quiet because he's learned to be very well behaved. The parent may not know that the child is actually afraid of this very \\"strict\\" and controlling day care teacher.Here is an important clue to look for in a quality child care center: It involves the methods in place where a parent can remotely monitor her childs classroom from the directors office without being detected by the day care teacher and her students.1. Does your center have state-of-the-art intercoms in the classrooms? These are the intercoms where the director can listen in from her office while on mute. They're usually small white plastic wall-mounted devices with several capabilities for announcements and two-way conversation. These intercoms are used for monitoring teacher-child interactions without the classroom occupants knowing they're being monitored. If your center only has the old-fashioned big brown boxes mounted high on the wall where the principal can make crackly announcements, then you should be very wary. If your child's classroom does not have a way for you to monitor your child via audio without being detected by the day care teacher, then you should be worried. In this day and age of tiny video cameras, Video Barbies, Nanny Cams, and more; shouldn't your child care center be equipt with technology where you can listen-in on what your child's day care teacher is saying to her class? Wouldn't you want to know what your child's day care teacher is saying to him when they don't think you're listening in? What if your child's day care teacher is controlling him with threats? Wouldn't you want to know about it? What if she's saying, \\"If you don't sit down in your chair right now, I'm going to give you a spanking.\\" What if the day care worker is \\"spanking hands\\" when the kids touch things in the room that she doesn't want them to touch? Children under the age of three may not report this to the parent. They may be too scared to say anything to you about it. They may not know that there is anything wrong with an adult saying this to them since they believe they're supposed to \\"listen to the teacher\\". My point is this: If there isn't an intercom in the room for undetectable remote audio monitoring from the director's office, then you should be asking some questions or you should wonder why they don't want you to hear what the day care teacher is saying to these children.Here's another clue about quality day care centers: Did you know that most day care centers have a policy that prohibits cell phone use by the day care staff? Many center directors just ignore this policy since it seems to be nearly impossible to enforce.2. Does your child's day care center allow the day care workers to keep their cell phones on their person? Have you noticed the day care workers texting or calling on their phones when they're supposed to be watching the kids? Day care workers should not be allowed to have their cell phones on their person at all. The phones stay in the purses which should be kept in a locked closet or in their locker. These day care teachers are pretty savvy. If a parent and the director are standing out in the hall listening-in to your class, then it's really easy to know they're out there. Usually another day care teacher will see them coming down the hall and the teacher will send a text message or will call the teacher next door. The next day care teacher will pass the message along down to the next day care teacher. Everyone knows if the director and a concerned parent are on the hall since they use their personal cell phones to pass along important news. If your day care center tells you that they have made arrangements for parents to be able to observe their child's classroom without the day care teacher knowing about it, then you need to ask some additional questions. If these observation opportunities involve you standing outside the classroom door in the shadows, then the center director is either lying to you or she's absolutely wrong. The day care workers spread the news to each other like wild fire by text message. Everyone knows you're out there observing and I promise that they'll put on a really good show for you.I won't spill the beans about all the advice and tips that the author has included in this book. I just want to say that if you really care about quality child care, then you must read this book.PSI've worked in child care for years and I refuse to work with under three's. Children under the age of three need to be home with Mom or with a grandparent or another close relative who loves the child. If you put your infant or toddler in a group child care program, I think that you probably are just too ignorant to know how harmful groups child care is for children under the age of three. If you must place your child in an infant/toddler group child care program, then I would advise that you stop by often and at irregular times so you can observe your child's behavior. Get references and by all means make sure that the center is licensed and has ratings by the health department that are at least 96%. Centers that rank 94% or below quite often have alot of problems that the health department conveniently \\"over looks\\". Be aware and be educated when you choose group child care for your infant or toddler!"},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"I live in a blue state, and mostly agree with what most people think of when they think \\"blue state\\". However, I questioned my liberal thinkiing while reading this book. Why? Because I have been concerned this year with how many 6th graders in my neighborhood come home to an empty house. And I see how divorce has affected my son's young friends.I have two children, both for whom medication has been recommended. We tried it with one, and the best school year he's had was this year when he was off ANY meds. Why? We have focused on teaching the skills my son's lacked, among them: study skills, organizational skills, social skills and using behavior modification. I can't say they will never be on any meds for their entire school career, but so far what we are doing is working better than any medication did - and with no side effects! I took my one son to many doctors and psychiatrists to learn to deal with his \\"problem behaviors\\". All agreed we should medicate, and prescribed increasingly serious meds. I wanted advice on how to help them, instead I received numerous prescriptions.My younger son is on the autistic spectrum, and I do disagree with some of Eberstadt's \\"findings\\". She states how the media or medical establishment does not relate studies showing how increased breast feeding can lower the incidence of autism. Yet, many autistic kids have been breast fed. More significant, she relates how autism is being diagnosed at an alarming rate compared to even 10 years ago.

(Right now, they're with their father: their biological father who is married to their biological mother, both of whom live in the same house with them. Yep, liberals do this too.)That said--the treatment of what's wrong and what might be done to solve it isn't entirely bad here. I think there's a missing point, though.If you're a mother, chances are you fall into one of three categories: 1. You stay at home, because you want to and can afford it, even at some sacrifice. 2. You work outside the home, but you sacrifice in order to pay for high-quality child care (or for someone else in your family to stay at home). 3. You work outside the home and can't afford high-quality child care, so you make do with what you can afford even though it isn't your first choice.There isn't a whole lot bad to say about these mothers. If you're in category #1 or #2, your children are already being well cared for. If you're in category #3, you can't very well be expected to come up with money you don't have. As I have seldom if ever met a mother who did not fall into one of these three categories, I have a hard time imagining what mothers are supposed to do differently from what they're already doing.I think the problem is the basic assumption that individual hard work and responsibility will always solve every problem. Of course those things are important, and necessary! But some individuals will always fail, often because of circumstances outside their control. When individuals fail to take proper care of their children for ANY reason, society suffers as a result. I agree with the author that society suffers when children are improperly cared for, but I disagree with her about how to solve the problem.Telling individuals, No you can't have contraception, no you can't have abortion, no you can't have publicly funded child care or food stamps or housing or medical care or education or afterschool care--it's ALL up to you to work hard and be responsible and procure ALL of these things for yourself--and then for some reason some people fail to do so, then pointing the finger at them and saying, See, society's problems are all YOUR fault for not working hard and being responsible enough...well, there may be a grain of truth to that, but it's not helping solve any problems.

And, part-time employees are not eligible for medical benefits.\\" America's employers aren't interested in flexible solutions for parents, and our child-free co-workers file grievances whenever policies seem to give parents leeway to attend to their families.And it's great to shake her disapproving finger at single parent families, but it's not like all of those women rushed joyfully into single-dom. Plenty of women have been shocked to see their husbands walk out the door... and those women have to rush out to get work, because even though men seethe and insist they're being bled dry, child support is a laughably small amount. Oh wait, that's assuming you're even getting your child support - it's still fairly simple to not live up to the responsibility of supporting a child. Not that I am bashing the gentlemen, though Mary essentially does so in her left-handed way for the entire book. Hey fellas, how do you menfolk feel about the constant implication that only mommies are important enough to be primary parents?She misses the mark so broadly on so many levels, the book ends up feeling like a deliberate propaganda piece.So look, Mary...When we have domestic policies that:- Requires that employers provide flexible employment options for parents (mommy and daddy hours that accommodate a parent's family schedule, the RIGHT to reduce your work week when you have children, no penalty for medical benefits when you reduce your work week -- just for starters)- Gives 6-month paid parental leave for BOTH parents (letting a child stay at home for the first year of their life if mom and dad switch off)- Make parents a protected population, so we won't be constantly written up and harassed by our employers when our kids are sick, injured, and other inconveniences to the company bottom line- Truly puts the needs of children first, by creating innovative and exciting educational offerings (why can Finland do it, but we're helpless?) as well as after-school and community programs that enrich children and adolescentsI think you'd see a little bit of positive change with kids. But blaming mommies for these ills makes about as much sense as blaming the crops for not growing bigger when it's the middle of a drought.So again - is it that parents don't care? Or is the uglier truth that SOCIETY doesn't care?A MUCH better book is Ann Crittenden's \\"The Price of Motherhood: Why The Most Important Job In The World Is Still The Least Valued\\". She acknowledges the problems of our current structure - and doesn't kick parents when they're down."},{"Title":"Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes","review":"Let's blame the poor working mother for all the woes in our society.

The work's greatest asset is its connections to ancient, modern, and post-modern cultures with many references to movies, literature, historical figures, etc. Walsh's textbook speaks well to two audiences: the student who is satisfied with a reader-friendly introduction and the reader who is eager for a challenging in-depth approach. Walsh accomplishes this dual approach by isolating the more demanding (but also, more rewarding) material--&gt;insets which appear throughout each chapter. They are a book in themselves!"},{"Title":"Reading the Bible: An Introduction","review":"Having taken Richard Walsh, the text is a wonderful way to approach reading the Bible.

Some of her stories originate from personal experiences, others from those who shared their experiences, only to portray the presence of something, someone special coming into their lives and bringing about a sense of peace.In one of her stories, on a snowy winter day, the rescue of her son comes to light through a mysterious event, and a stranger who brings her son through a nearly catastrophic event. Not that anyone actually saw a winged angelic spirit; it was more of realizing the presence of someone who suddenly came into his life and helped him through a situation.Reading these short stories may touch your heart enough to have you recall an event which seemed hopeless.......until a special happening brought someone close enough for you to feel God's presence in the form of a messenger who bears an angelic character.If you've ever come through a car accident safely, despite damage to the car, or if you've stepped away from something that looked dangerous, perhaps, you, too, were walking with an angel. Maybe, even if you look deeper, someone was in need of help, and you were the angel in their life. Don't be too surprised if you've had several such experiences.Today, these stories are syndicated and featured in several publications.

When reading it I was inspired to research the concept of guardian angels further. A lot of the stories are very convincing, others seem more coincedental and not necessarily the work of angels. But above all there was one aspect I did not like about the book. I was under the impression that this was going to be a more open minded book to different religions and ideas. But throughout the book the author went back to Christianity and especially Catholicism. If that is what people believe then that is great, but I was expecting to see more stories that were not necessarily religious in nature, or at least are not only Christian. Angels are supposed to work miracles in everyone's lives, not just Christians'. I believe the author, being raised a Christian and still being a Christian, chose to only use stories that were Christian in nature.

What we read about angels in the Bible tells us how they quickly move in and out of people's lives, often to carry a message or to help in time of need (Peter's prison scene, one of my favorites!).

Olivos (2007)Edward M. Olivos' book (2007) \\"The Power of Parents: a Critical Perspective of Bicultural Parent Involvement in Public schools\\" points to the struggle of some bicultural parents to defend and protect the academic development of their children as well as their social future in an adverse education system. Throughout the book, the readers learn how low-income bicultural parents from the Hispanic culture see, feel and react to a school system that \\"alleges that the cause of these students' disadvantages lies within the group itself\\" (bicultural students, their parents and their communities) (p.45). The author gives the theoretical viewpoint of both school system and parents and offers recommendations on what to do for the bicultural parents involvement including expected challenges, tensions and conflicts (home school vs. school culture; home knowledge vs. school knowledge; and home power vs. school power (p 79) due to \\"the structures of inequality which have constituted the foundation of public schooling in the United States\\" (p. 120) for centuries.To begin to understand Edward Olivos' analysis of bicultural parent involvement (2007), the readers need to be clear about Ethnocentrism and Eurocentrism where undervalued and misjudged non-European societies and cultures are considered \\"bicultural\\" and the belief that bicultural communities are deficient (p 58), underachieving, socially maladjusted (p 45), and problematic. Moreover, Olivos' term \\"bicultural: depicts living \\"individuals or social groups\\" under \\"a dominant mainstream culture\\" (p. 14). However, among \\"WHITE\\" people, there is a vast variety of cultures, languages and national origins, for example Russians, Polish, Scandinavians, Germans, White Africans and White Hispanics who are a fairly rare part of discussions of diversity issues. They have apparently little difficulty getting their needs met; probably, due to the institutionalized factors of race and the stereotyped educational level of these \\"white\\" refugees and immigrants. These immigrants get more benefits and better access to available education services without doubts or concerns about their academic abilities. I think it is important to talk about this dichotomy in Education because there are also lots of \\"white\\" refugees and immigrants coming from eastern European countries and other continents whose parents have Limited English Proficiency (LEP), as well as ethnic minorities with educational, economic, or cultural resources that influences their experiences in US schools.Some teachers might be inclined to argue that one misconception in bicultural education is the overwhelming focus on students of color due in part to the excellent educational achievement of other bicultural communities such as some Asian communities. Meanwhile others like Peggy McIntosh (1988) point out the denial of the \\"phenomenon of white privilege\\" in discussions of diversity. The issue of biculturalism /multiculturalism/ diversity is a human problem regardless of race and not teaching all children about biculturalism leads people to the erroneous assumption that whites are not part of the bicultural equation (Banks & Banks, 2006). According to the latest data, \\"the number of children ages 5-17 who spoke a language other than English at home more than doubled between 1979 and 2004\\" (U.S. Department of Education, 2006 & U.S. census 2006 estimate). These students represent diverse races, nationalities, and experiences. As mentioned before the umbrella under which bicultural communities stand is growing in the United States. Nevertheless, in Olivos' book, the primary focus in bicultural education is on children of immigrants who live in low-income households and whose parents have relatively limited education and belong to ethnic minority communities.The data mentioned in Olivos' book allow readers to find out the \\"hidden ideological biases\\" (p 120) imposed in the educational system for centuries. Even though the involvement of minority parents is viewed by the author mainly through the Hispanic community, the pattern is present in all so called low- income \\"minority\\" communities. There is a resistance to \\"difference\\" (Banks & Banks, 2006) although there are differences in approaching this issue. As Olivos explains through his case study by ignoring the differences in experiences, beliefs, traditions, geography and socio-economic-political background, the educational system limits its mission to educate students in all levels of education as well as to involve their parents in \\"school, family, community partnerships\\" for successful educational achievements (DuFour, Eaker & Dufour, 2005; Epstein, 1985 & 1995; Fullan, 2001; Manzano, Waters & Mcnulty, 2005; Patrikakou, Weissberg, Redding & Walberg, 2005; and Sanders 2005).From chapter 5 to the last chapter, Olivos depicts the situation of the school system and how students, parents, teachers and the administration maintain the current tendencies as well as parent's resistance, different models of parent involvement and home-school relations. To better comprehend his view, we have to analyze how the disparity is approached, while a great deal of public school enrollment is predominantly minority and diverse across the United States; the school staff and administration are predominantly born and raised in the United States and have achieved middle class status. The disparity is approached on one hand with multicultural training for school staffs and on the other hand with arbitrary processes of acculturation and assimilation of the students with medical treatments as remedy for the students' unexplained behaviors. This situation might mislead people in decision-making positions to place minorities inappropriately and attribute certain patterns to developmental delays (Kagan, 1991).It might still appear far fetched to say that the developmental competence is explained according to \\"establish old patterns\\" that people have challenged for ages. However educational staffs, administrators and aids make generalizations about certain families, ideas, and ways of life due to the resistance to incorporate new visions of reality that conflict with their own personal or cultural conceptions. Such generalizations prevent teachers from giving these parents their right to have \\"a voice\\" where \\"both parents and teachers develop the tools\\" to work for the same goal: student achievement (p 107). That is why Olivos' questionnaires at the end of each chapter are important in order to \\"confront what is quite possibly this nation's greatest contradiction: the inability to close the educational achievement disparity between specific social groups\\" (p 119). The inclusion of difference in our every day's lives allows us to respect each other and tolerate whatever goes beyond our understanding and acceptance. That is why in my opinion it is important to understand the \\"difference\\" in people in order not to diminish emotional resiliency and prevent school failure. It takes the combined willingness of students, parents, schools and the community to deal with Education in a bicultural environment. Olivos aims to the \\"idea that understanding and valuing\\" parents involvement as well as \\"students' individual differences allow teachers to reach the students' fullest potential\\" (Bennett, 1995).Work CitedBanks, J.

Boyer and Lee imply that Rand's novel provides a disservice by presenting the architect (Roark) as \\"hero\\" rather than \\"team player\\" (Boyer / Lee, page 8). The two constantly suggest that self-interest should always be overridden by \\"greater obligation\\" to the client and society at large. While many of their concerns are reasonable, by suggesting that there exist a \\"greater obligation\\" they imply that there is a conflict between social and self-benefit. What they do not understand is that a person can practice architecture for selfish reasons alone, i.e. monetary benefit and self-expression without a conflict of interest provided the architect uses reason to make decisions and design his/her code of ethics. The idea is this as inscribed on John Galt's power facility in Rand's Atlas Shrugged: \\"I SWEAR BY MY LIFE AND MY LOVE OF IT THAT I WILL NEVER LIVE FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER MAN, NOR ASK ANOTHER MAN TO LIVE FOR MINE\\" Rand, page 675). No social obligations, there exists only capitalism in its purest form, where decisions are based on efficiency, mutual benefit, and most importantly reason. People are hired and fired every day based on such pure idealism. Leeches and Liars do not survive long in this system.To accept a \\"greater obligation\\" would place value in socialist ideals-beliefs that have consistently destroyed nations since Marx spewed them forth. It may be that those value judgements that a society or group have are similar to your own, but there should never exist a forum of individuals making these decisions for everybody-we call those people bullies. This contagion of thought leads those who would listen into a world where all people deserve the same right to happiness and prosperity irrespective of what they produce for themselves. If I had one wish I would ask that we all be \\"shiny happy people holding hands\\" (R.E.M., Shiny Happy People), but such thinking is non-productive. Marx unleashed a world where those who would use their minds and bodies for production are punished and those that would be spoon-fed are rewarded.Objectivism is a philosophy first presented by Ayn Rand in the 1940's and 50's. In Rand's Fountainhead, the architect as \\"hero\\" is not an idea that is in direct conflict with public prosperity. It presents a man who is capable of identifying the bullies, the leeches and liars. He exists as an architect hidden behind the \\"team player\\", Peter Keating-the man who eventually learned that he could not look at his own face in the mirror without shuddering. In a later book by Rand, Atlas Shrugged, she solidifies those ideas in Heroes like Francisco, Hank, Ragnar, Dagny, and John Galt. These industrialists, people with passion, accepted no excuses, never broke their word, and did not play by socialist rules, for there is a better way-their way. Their minds provided reason devoid of contradiction, where morally gray thought and socialist ideals are nil.Most of what the Boyer / Lee report outlines is very reasonable. I agree with Lee and Boyer's ideas of more liberal, flexible, and integrated curriculum, tying studios to \\"real life problems\\", \\"acknowledging the curriculum as one phase in life-long learning\\", and \\"educating architects for a sustainable environment\\". These are all logical and valid visions of the future. Nonetheless, I have a big problem with \\"replacing the \\"architect as hero\\" model with \\"architect as team player\\". To become a \\"team player\\" is to accept decisions that do not coincide with one's own. As I stated in my February 3rd essay: \\"My self interests should never be \\"overridden by some greater obligation\\" to a client or society because the A.I.A. (a forum of lawyers), has defined the \\"right\\" and \\"good\\" in its code of ethics (Pressman, p. 49).\\" I intend to practice architecture and live under my own Objectivist ethic; the idea is that if I do not believe something, it will not be presented until I do."},{"Title":"Juxt & the cloth","review":"I had not heard of this book at all until one of my teachers began raving about it.

I highly recommend this book to everyone!Bob"},{"Title":"Baby Makes Three","review":"A warning for the readers first off: This is a historical romance only in the fact that it was written/first published almost 25 years ago. It was written as a contemporary romance and was contemporary when first released (the novel was first published as a \\"Silhouette Romance in April, 1988\\"). If you are not aware of this fact, it can definitely color your enjoyment of this novel.The basic premise is an enjoyable one - stuffy school administrator gets roped into a deception through her mother and all hell breaks loose (as well as a romance). The hero, our \\"writer under cover as a mother\\" is everything you would expect of a romance hero. Kind, attentive, good with kids, and has a hint of subterfuge on his mind. Our heroine is confused, cast into a role by her situation, and unbendable . . . until the right hero comes along, that is!Maggie's mother is a unique secondary character. She is portrayed as an eccentric, and has her own ideas on how to achieve her goals. The other secondary character is the young man who keeps bringing Maggy and Cody together - Bobby.As I was reading, I was led in the belief that this story was set in northern Wisconsin which made some of the actions very confusing. During the search for a \\"mother\\" to accept Cody's award, Cody and Maggie head to Chicago to search modeling agencies. This would be quite difficult to do as heading to Minnesota and the twin cities would be much closer. However, we find by the end of the book that they are located in Lake Geneva, which is, in fact, in one of the southern-most Wisconsin counties, thereby making a trip to Chicago much more feasible and understandable!There were other parts of the book that marred my enjoyment of this book (i.e. lack of a carseat, other child-related issues) that may not have detracted quite so much had I been reading the book in the proper historical context. Therefore, I find myself giving this story the \\"benefit of the doubt\\".So. . . if you find you are lover of a classic romance, and really enjoyed the late \`80's - this one's for you! However, as a general romance reader, pick this up with the caveat that it truly reads as a 1980's romance and enjoy from there.Originally posted at LAS Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"35 missions with the 384th Bomb Group, 8th Air Force, Grafton Underwood, Kettering, Northamps, England: A memoir","review":"This self-published pamphlet is the bare-bones war log of Lieutenant Leo Feider, a B-17 bombardier with the 384th Bomb Group. Feider, a member of Lieutenant Robert Rice's crew, was a mid-war replacement assigned to the 384th. The pamphlet details the 35 missions flown by Feider and his crew.By the summer of 1944, an 8th AF crew had to fly 35 missions before they were sent stateside. Feider's first mission was on 30 August 1944; his last on 1 February 1945. The 38-page pamphlet reproduces the mission narratives he wrote after each mission supplemented by articles from STARS AND STRIPES. Several photographs and maps are included. And that's pretty much it.By the time Feider's crew joined the 384th, the days of the great air battles between the Luftwaffe and the 8th AF were largely gone. Consequently the losses he observed and described fell to the always-deadly flak batteries.

I lost it when I was teaching Foods of the USA to my high school class. I think one of my students \\"borrowed\\" it permanently (and disposed of it) because he didn't like the historical part of the course.

By the looks of it, Sam's trust is building and I have no doubt that their romance is heading in the right direction. Can't wait to see what Suzanne Enoch will have them do next.Usually, the second book falls flat, but not this one.

They remind me a little of Eve and Roarke (J.D. Robb's romantic couple). Sam is a bit like the tough cop that Eve is except that she isn't all legal about stuff and her upbringing, though not great, is WAY better than Eve's. And Sam is more up on literature and booklearning-type stuff than Eve. Richard is a lot like Roarke in that he's rich and strong and very capable and very in love. Unlike Roarke, Rick never was poor or on the wrong side of the law.I loved reading this book. :)"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This book has more \\"sex\\" scenes than any Suzanne's historical romance books, and it's understandable why. However, all the way through half the book, I was still waiting for suspense to begin, and for action to start. The first book \\"Flirting With Danger\\" was more fast paced than this one. It's is still a great book, and the author does not disappoint with witty, funny dialogs, steamy bedroom (and not bedroom) sex scenes, suspence and action.I was reluctant to even buy Suzanne's first contemporary title, but I'm so glad I gave her a chance. She is absolutely great at modern romance!"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"It has been three months since the events chronicled in FLIRTING WITH DANGER, and we open to Rick and Sam trying to settled into a settled relationship. Emotionally, Sam still has one foot out the door, terrified of commitment, whereas Rick is trying *not* to use the \\"L\\" word and scare Sam off. Sam also feels like Rick is trying to take over the security firm she is trying to start-her first legitimate venture-but all Rick is really trying to do in his take-charge kind of way is to get Sam so entrenched in his life and in a legit business that she won't want to leave it all behind for her former life as a cat burglar.All this relationship angst happens against the backdrop of Sam's first case-one that never officially gets off the ground because her client is killed before their first meeting. Sam is determined to find the killer, and Rick fears for her involvement, which leads them to make a little bet: Rick bets Sam that the police will solve the case without her help before she can. And the game is afoot.Further complicating matters is Patricia, Rick's viper of an ex-wife, trying to work her non-existent wiles on Rick, and Stoney, Sam's old fence and current office partner, trying to entice Sam to pull a job in Italy and furnishing their new office with questionable acquisitions.What I love about this series is that it's very much a work in progress with regard to Sam and Rick's relationship. Sometimes I get fed up with the immediacy of happily-ever-afters in books, those endless epilogues featuring the happily married couple billing and cooing over baby number umpteen. I particularly get tired of seeing this scenario in romantic suspense books, as most of the couples in this particular subgenre meet under stressful circumstances and decide they're in love with a gun pressed to their heads or some such thing that I find largely unrealistic. It's downright refreshing to read about the birth and struggle of a relationship. It feels more real to see Sam fight the temptation to go back to stealing and to see Rick worry about whether their life together is enough for Sam. Just like with other series, recurring characters (even the odious Patricia) are like old friends dropping by. I particularly enjoy the verbal sparring between Sam and Tom, Rick's lawyer and friend. I hope Ms. Enoch has many more of these books coming.DON'T LOOK DOWN combines the best bits of the IN DEATH series by J.D. Robb (the relationship development of the central figures from book to book) and the humor of the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich with none of the elements (repetitive descriptions, TSTL moments) that annoy me. DON'T LOOK DOWN gets 5/5 stars and joins my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This author never disappoints.

The book is funny and the plot flows.I look foreward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Number 2 in the Sam n Rick story arc.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel from start to finish. It has a most wonderfully imaginative denouement scene. Involving a girl-on-girl muddy catfight, cops and polo players. There's plenty of hot but not too graphic bump and grind. And a fairly decent plot. But most of all. It's about interlocking relationships. Between a guy and his attitudinous girl-friend, between an ex-wife and the main couple, between a girl and her surrogate Dad...and some more too. I loved them all.I'll say it straight out. I think Sam is a great romance heroine. Clever, resourceful, beautiful. She can talk clothes, gardens, cars, children at the drop of a hat. Also. For the record. I like the way the characters speak to each other.Definitely joining my 'to be read again' pile.This is the one where Sam slashes the tyres on Rick's BMW. The one where Sam n Rick have sticky food nookie. And the one where quite a few times Sam hugs Rick for strength and comfort. I love all that kind of mushy stuff. Plus. It's one of those novels where the beautiful heroine drives to a Palm Beach place in a Bentley with the dishy hero following behind, convoy style, in a flashy Merc. Not that I worship money or crass style but I totally relished visualising that scene in my mind.Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This the second book in the Sam and Rick seriesIn this book, Sam is trying stay good and lives with her Billionaire boyfriend Rick.

This series is similar, but doesn't have the same depth or skill in characterization as Robb's series. Don't Look Down wasn't quite as good a read as the first book in the series. The plot seemed to drag more and didn't hold my attention as well. I think that the hero is a little too angsty for me, too. Throughout the book, he has to be careful what he says and does in order to not scare off the heroine (he's more invested in their relationship than she is - or more than she admits she is). This theme got a little repetitive. I guess I prefer a little more \\"alpha\\" in my heroes after a point. That said, I enjoyed it enough to recommend it to those who want to continue with the series. (It rated more toward a 3.5, but I rounded it up.) If you want something grittier, more intense, check out the In Death series by JD Robb (starting with Naked in Death)."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Perhaps I should have read the first book in this series first because while it stood on its own reasonably well, the relationship between Sam and Rick didn't work for me. I just found the two of them to be so annoying. I wanted Sam to be funky and spicy and all she really did was just conform to Rick's ideals. I found myself wanting them to have a massive fight and for Sam to resort back to her old ways.Tough luck for me because it was a typical happy ending.It was an okay book. It took me forever to read. But I got there eventually."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Suzanne Enoch is an auto-buy for me but how well I like each one varies from 3-5 stars. Her Sam and Rick series is fun while her current Regency series about the Griffin family is played out straight.Sam and Rick are like the characters in Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief. The genders are reversed with Sam being the thief and Rick the rich socialite. Theirs would be the story after the movie ends. The attraction between the two is understandable because they are both intelligent, interesting people who could get along fine by themselves but are better together. The conflict is Sam wanting to maintain her independence and Rick being pushy because he thinks he will lose her if he cannot make her feel obligated to him for his help. One thing that still needs to be explained is Sam's skittishness about relationships. Her former occupation may have made it difficult to maintain one. However, since she is out of the thieving business, it should be easier for her to accept Rick in her life.Maybe the book could be a movie. A getaway at the beginning. A burglary in the middle. A polo match at the end. I am not sure how long this series is meant to be but I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Suzanne Enoch seems to have lost her grip on this one.It is clearly seen that she did not read her first debut novel, when she was writing this book. Samantha Jellicoe's British better half, -someone on the lines of Barbara Michaels's master thief hero of the Vicky Bliss novels Sir John Smith- suddenly turns into JD Robb's Roarke of Eve Dallas fame. His gray eyes turn into blue and he starts talking and behaving just like Roarke. I would recommend anybody who is interested in real hard-hitting stories give this one a miss, because you are going to compare it badly with her debut novel. And then you are going to compare the characters with JD Robb, or Barbara Michaels'heroes. Samantha's hero is a definitely bad copy. Even their physical appearance and billionaire businessman idea is overdone and has been picked up straight from JD Robb's in Death series.Sorry, one star, because Susanne Enoch is a much better regency and historical writer, because at least she stays constant throughout her novels. This book is a \\"delete from library\\" and not a keeper."},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"4.5/5.0As the second in the Samantha Jellicoe series, this one is just as fast paced and fun as the first and I actually enjoyed the romance aspect even more. It was fun to have an already established relationship that is busy working out the \\"new couple\\" rough spots. That's a nice change and Enoch keeps it quick, hot and unpredictable. Sam does get a little annoying with her hard-nosed stubbornness but it is understandable considering the sheer strength of personality that comes with a driven billionaire for a boyfriend. One has to love Richard Addison, though, he is every woman's dream man! The way he gives Sam 100% of his unconditional love and support is what makes this series so wonderfully addictive.For anyone who loves a great who-done-it mystery with lightening fast repartee, and lots of romance and excitement, this series can't be beat!\\"The steam factor is still high, although toned down a little from the first book*"},{"Title":"Don't Look Down (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"I loved Flirting With Danger so much that I went right out and bought Don't Look Down as soon as I finished and I don't regret that at all.This is a continuation of Sam and Rick's story that picks up a few months after Flirting ends.

This author seems to confuse modern romance with the need for excessive amounts of profane language. Apparently, it is not possible to be extremely wealthy, extremely gorgeous, and extremely attracted without being extremely filthy-mouthed. I don't happen to agree with that assessment [in fact, enjoyment of the romance dies for me], but the author does apparently believe it with all her heart.

All in all, I liked it and I'm glad I read but it didn't make me want to rush out and read everything by Eudora Welty.It's a very short book, yet it meanders slowly through a basic story. Welty does an excellent job of describing the atmosphere of the south. People in the Mississippi town where most of the novel is set have known each other for years. Most have stayed in the town with a notable exception being Laurel who is the Optimist's Daughter who has returned to care for her ailing father who eventually dies.Laurel is the center of the novel as she comes to terms with loss. This is not just about the loss of her father but is also about the previous losses of her mother and husband. She endures so many levels of stress from past and present events.One of Laurel's sources of stress is her father's silly, selfish, young second wife, Fay. She cannot understand how her father, \\"The Optimist\\" and significant presence in the town could have married such a horrible creature.I found Laurel's journey and the multiple layers of grief to be very well described and interesting. I also enjoyed the feeling and atmosphere of the South.I found the character of the second wife, Fay to be overpowering and inapprpriately extreme. She became hard to take after awhile and I would have preferred her influence to have been more muted.I liked The Optimist's Daughter and give it a middling recommendation."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"It is my first book by Eudora Welty and I am so glad I came across it. It is a story of a middle aged woman Laurel who upon learning that her father is ill comes to visit him and help him during his stay in hospital. Although his recovery seems to be going well, Laurel's 71 year old father dies within weeks. Laurel is stranded with her stepmother who is almost the same age as Laurel. The two are complete opposites in their manners, education and social background.As Laurel prepares for her father's funeral, she reflects on her parents' marriage, her childhood and the times when her mother was dying. Laurel cannot help but think about her own short lived marriage. A year after Laurel was married to a handsome Navy officer, he was killed in action and Laurel remains a widow.Ms. Welty writes such beautiful prose that almost sings in its southern way of speaking and people interactions. Her depictions of enourmous social differences between Laurel's own family and friends and her stepmother Fey's family is stunning. Fey and Laurel are complete opposites in every way. In the end, all that is left is memories that belong to Laurel and no one else. Not even Fey in her selfishness and crudeness can destroy that."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I believe Eudora Welty chose the story she tells in &quot;The Optimist's Daughter&quot; to present her own point of view (attitude) regarding the inevitable results of the confluence of culture she was witnessing in society. Through Laurel, on the train ride from Chicago to Mount Salus, Welty describes what occurs,looking down from a great distance, when the Missippi and Ohio rivers come together. What she sees is the confluence, the blurring of boundaries, the turbulent wiping out of what has been with the indefinable presence of what is. Reaction to what is in the human heart and consciousness varies. Welty indicates some choose pessimism, some choose optimism, and some choose to accept life as it is &quot;on the true.&quot; Once again, through Laurel, Welty reveals her decision regarding how she chooses to react."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's, The Optimist's Daughter, is a gorgeously written novella! In compact, stunningly written prose, Welty tells the story of the passing of a small town Southern judge, and the ensuing conflict between his patrician, well-bred daughter and his tacky, hard-scrabble second wife. Welty does not sound one wrong note in this dead-on depiction of Southern life during this era. Welty's writing itself, as well as its insights into the pinnacles and the depths of the human condition, is stupendous. She absolutely deserved the Pulitzer for this work! My absolutely favorite book, ever!"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Laurel is a quiet character; though she is the center of the book, she rarely speaks. Welty captures Laurel's greif at the death of her father with all of the accompanying conflicting emotions.Laurel's character was developed largely from the tangible details about the way she conducted herself with her father, mother, Fay, and the people from her town, as well as descriptions of her memories. She was a complete character through her interactions with the other characters and her memories which were brought on through her interaction with her surroundings. And though Fay seemed a little bit one-dimensional, she was by no means evil--there are stupid people in the world :)Contrary to some of the other reviewers I felt like the simplicity and grace of Welty's prose deserved the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"For starters, Eudora Welty is a huge name in Southern literature. Born in Mississippi, she was a contemporary of famous literary figures like Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers. The Optimist's Daughter is the first novel I've read by her. She is more well-known for her short stories than her novels. And indeed, this book is extremely short; it actually first appeared in The New Yorker in 1969.The Optimist's Daughter is centered around one person dying, his funeral, and the aftermath (reminiscent of A Death in the Family). Judge McKelva is an old man in need of eye surgery, which he undergoes despite the dangers involved in the recovery. His daughter, Laurel, sits loyally by his side in the Louisiana hospital while he is recovering. Laurel is a widow whose husband died in the war, and her mother died when she was a girl. Her only companion is the judge's wife, Fay, who is younger than him and constantly says, \\"I can't believe this is happening to me\\" (Needless to say, the two women don't have much in common). Welty was considered a \\"regionalist\\" by some people and I think that comes across loud and clear in The Optimist's Daughter: The Texas native is the evil, heartless step mother (Fay) imposing herself on the sweet, saint-like Mississippi orphan (Laurel).An embarrassingly hysterical scene unfolds at the Judge's funeral, and Welty's Southern Gothic influence comes to the surface in her macabre humor. Fay feels increasingly sorry for herself and acts out in selfish angst. Laurel just absorbs it all without open judgement like a saint. Both Fay and Laurel are infinitely boring characters, because they are so static. However, Welty's craft and her imagination mesh with astonishing harmony in the last scene, and the end of the novel culminates in an unexpected, almost violent denouement."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The style of writing is certainly light and easy to read.

The past, as captured in stories and memories, defines the people of the South and its heritage. One from the South can argue that too much time is spent dwelling on the past.The book revolves around a daughter whose father married a much younger woman. The problem, and story line, is the new woman isn't from the South and has no interest in the past (memories) of the individuals of the family into which she married or the community in which she has been living with her husband. Dad is dead. The new, young wife is vicious and is unaware of the feelings of her former husband's daughter or the Southern community.This is a book where every scene counts. I'm used to scanning parts of books that don't appeal to me. As I found out, you can not scan a 180-page, tightly written masterpiece.This book lingers. You can roar through it 100 miles an hour. Go ahead. Then read the last 10 pages or so one more time. Put it down.

I found myself identifying more with Fay (mother in law of the main character) by wanting her in the story much more than she was because of me feeling she had every right to react and feel as she did. In most of the book, she was just pretty much around in a negative way, and her grief didn't help any. Just didn't get much from a typical story in that we all have relatives (in laws) who can be as unnerving (even in death) as those in the story. The ending was pretty much an \\"I'm running out of storyline so I need pack it in with a typical see the world\\" type ending."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I've always wanted to read a Welty book and I picked this one. Unfortunately, because now, I don't think I'll try another.Why must praise be heaped upon books that make you dig into them to uncover meanings that are obvious human truths? What Laurel(the title character) comes to realize at the end was plain to see at the beginning.

Dr. Courtland had had something to do with the care of Laurel's mother, who had died.Afterwards the Judge showed unnatural patience, reticence, and silence while he had to keep his head still after the operation. Reading NICHOLAS NICKLEBY seemed endless to Laurel. In wordless communication, Laurel came to understand that her task was not to read the book aloud to her father, but to pass the time at his bedside by reading it to herself.The Judge's new wife was probably younger than his daughter. Fay was from Texas and claimed that her family was deceased. She tried to rouse Judge McKelva and she was stopped from doing so by the private duty nurse. McKelva collapsed and died. Dr. Courtland said that the eye had been healing. The Judge had helped the doctor financially while he was in medical school he told Laurel.Laurel's bride's maids met her at the train and filled the house with food. The old Garden Club members were present, too. Adele Courtland, the doctor's sister, helped. It was a surprise to Laurel that Fay's relatives appeared at the Judge's funeral. The Judge had had no use for theatrics. Laurel was confused. The mourners were saying her father was a crusader, an angel.It came to Laurel that her father had liked Gibbon, not Dickens. Mount Salus Presbyterian Church had been built by the McKelvas. Fay decided to return to Texas with her family for a visit. Family members spoke her language. Laurel faced her father's library.

The story is pointless. The protagonist is a weak, spineless woman who allows herself to be abused by her father's second wife without much resistance. I was annoyed from the moment I started reading this by every character in it. If that was Welty's goal then I give this 5 stars instead of 2. Maybe one has to be a southerner to understand this book. The pulitzer board refused to give Pynchon the prize in '74 but they give it to this terrible book. I have read a few Pulitzer prize winning novels and this is the only one that I did not enjoy at all. I give an author one chance and Welty used hers up. May I suggest Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Hersey's A Bell for Adano, Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea or Momaday's House Made of Dawn (just to name a few)if you want to read deserving pulitzer winners.

I never really cared for enough of the characters to really connect to the book, and whenever there was a glimmer of amusement or cleverness, it passed as quickly as it had begun. I never mind literary vagueness, but most of the points in the story were just a tad *too* vague. That having been said, I will comment that the ending of the book did please me - I won't give it away for future readers, but what Laurel does with her life is an enormous relief; had she done otherwise I would probably have dashed the book against a wall!"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I picked up The Optimist's Daughter on advice of several recommendations.

I'm just sorry I will never regain the time wasted on this novel."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I cannot find much that was redeeming about this book, except that it was so short. The characters were undeveloped, the story disjointed, and the story silly.

It just didn't work and am rushing out to find out what the pulitzer finalists were that lost to this book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Like love, grief is ultimately something that we must all go through alone. There can be people who help, but our emotional journeys are ours alone.And that is the heart of \\"The Optimist's Daughter,\\" a dark, quiet little novel set in the mid-20th century South. Eudora Welty explores a difficult, emotionally wringing topic -- one woman losing the last loved one she had, and the struggle to come to terms with the many people she's lost.Elderly but healthy Judge McKelva goes in for an eye operation, but seems strangely lethargic afterwards. His daughter Laurel -- who has been away for several years -- is concerned as her father continues to decline, especially since his flaky second wife Fay is treating him badly, and even has to be physically restrained by a nurse. Then the judge dies.And Laurel finds herself in her old family home, trying to deal with Fay, her weird family, and the many well-meaning-but-dense friends that McKelva had over the years. But when the house is empty and she is alone, Laurel looks back on her life -- her all-too-brief marriage to a loving man, her mother's horrible death, and her father's remarriage -- and learns how to feel again.Few books that I've read really handle the subject of grief -- usually people hug, cry, and get over it except for a few pages every now and then, when there is a mention of the Dearly Departed.But not many authors can really get to the wrenching, lonely core of grief and loss, and how it can set us free, or lock our emotions and throw away the key. And that is basically what \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is all about -- McKelva's illness and death are a prelude to Laurel's soul-searching, and the exploration of how she handles her grief.Welty wraps the slow, gradual storyline (which takes only a few days) in warm, colourful prose (\\"Sienna-bright leaves and thorns like spurts of matchflame had pierced through...\\"). She does have a tendency to let the dialogue from various people ramble, but often that rambling makes some very sharp points about loss, such as how the well-meaning often tell white lies about the dead, or ignore their dying wishes.Laurel is kind of a nonentity for the first half of the book -- she's all locked up in herself, and we don't know much about her. But then Welty paints the devastating pain and guilt that she's been feeling, and shows how you have to let go of the past in order to live the future. Quite a contrast to the childish, putrescent Fay, whose rallying cry is always \\"What about ME?\\" and who accuses her dying husband of ruining her birthday.\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is only optimistic as it ends -- up until then, it's a beautifully painful look at love, loss, and grief. A magnificent story, if a rather uncomfortable one."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I lost my mom last year following a lengthly illness--my husband and I were her primary caregivers during the last terrible, torturous months of her life. Since her death, I've had much trouble dealing with the ordeal and with her loss.Over the past year, I've read a lot about chronic illness, terminal illness, and death--trying to find some sense and understanding of my mother's tragedy. This book helped me where dozens of others couldn't.Part of my distress has been a lingering sense of guilt that I could have done more, done things better. Objectively, I know I gave everything I had. However, this book helped me examine those emotions, put them in perspective, and hopefully begin to heal. The following horrible quote describes exactly the shortcomings I saw within myself:&quot;You could have saved your mother's life. But you stood by and wouldn't intervene. I despair for you.&quot;I'm at a loss to explain why this made me feel better--but it did. This is a glorious novella which has helped me more than I can say--I recommend it highly. I apologize for the very personal nature of this review."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I tend to agree with most of the glowing reviews and I can understand some of the frustration with the few negative reviews.The complaint that \\"not much happens\\" after the funeral is valid to a point. Today's readers want to see evil and ignorance vanquished, whether it's a genuine villian or just some hillbilly white trash grabbing up an old man's estate with both hands.But this is an evil and ignorant world, and Welty does a wonderful job of telling a story that feels not so much like a story but real life itself.To me, I was impressed with Welty's incredible economy to tell this story. Anyone assigned to read this for a class or trying it out on their own should keep that in mind while reading it.It will make for a more rewarding reading experience."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I picked up this book on a remainder table. I had heard of Eudora Welty, only because of this book, which won her the Pulitzer Prize.I was not dissapointed for the following reasons:1. The book is concise. Sometimes it is nice to get through a book in 3 hours rather than 3 weeks, or like some that really drag, 3 months.2. The prose is wonderful, the descriptions colorful. The storyline is simple, I could summarize the storyline in 3 sentences or less, but what was remarkable was the beauty of the writing and the short, descriptive paragraphs which made me go back and reread a few which I thought were particularly poignant.3. The storyline, although simple, is interesting. I could relate to Laurel; I could see the old house and recognize all the neighbors as they came to her father's wake. I am surprised it has not been made into a movie. (or has it?)4. The storyline and writing style reminded me of 'A Summons to Memphis\\" by Peter Taylor, another Southern writer.If you are looking for action packed, this book isn't it. Should you want to appreciate some of the finest American Literature of the 20th century, this is a good pick."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"If you have long wondered what the fuss about Eudora Welty is all about, read THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER, the 1973 Pulitzer Prize-winner for fiction. This is no peripheral achievement but the heart of the Welty experience. As you begin reading it, you would describe it as a spare, quiet character study. By the time you finish it--the prose is sleek and straightforward, you glide through it--you are flipping back, realizing the profundities it has kicked up all the way through, hoping you did not miss anything. It is the story of Laurel McKelva Hand, fortysomething widow, who has flown back to the south from her career life in Chicago to be at her father's side as he copes with a medical emergency. It is obvious that she has come because the trophy wife/stepmother, Fay, is not considered up to the task by anyone else's standards. The first part of the novel ends with the judge's death; the second part moves back into the Mississippi house where Laurel grew up for her father's funeral. Here Welty introduces the town folk who hold her father and late mother in high esteem, who regard Fay as a white trash outsider nuisance. Fay reminds everyone that she gets all the property, everything they all view as belonging to the deceased parents and the grown daughter. The first two parts could easily translate to the screen or stage; the last two would be more difficult because Welty turns inward, helping Laurel sort out memory, loss, and what it spells for her future. The power of the book lies in how it twists and turns through the four characters--Laurel, her parents, and Fay--moving around the tensions between them until a full sense of the truth is located. What you first know about Laurel and Fay will be challenged. Neither is simple, nor is the story."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Having just finished the complete stories of Eudora Welty, I decided to read this novella, and I was not disappointed. I agree that there are challenges here: a plodding story, a rich subtext, a foggy past as seen through the eyes of the grieving daughter, Laurel, the foil to Fay, the one-dimensional, fatuous mother-in-law, and a work that requires immense concentration by the reader as the author slowly reveals the haunting mysteries of a family's past. In reading Welty's short stories, I was struck by how many of them succeed solely because of the psychological tension between the characters. \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is no different; it is a psychological drama that plays out in Laurel's mind as she attempts to explain and understand the complex mysteries of her parents and her past. In the end, Laurel seems to make peace with herself and her parents, but we are certain that she never fully understands the riddles of her or their history. I believe that this is precisely what Welty intended: that are no simple or certain explanations in life, only the inexplicable presence of memory and history."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I was expecting more from this Pulitzer Prize-winning book.It tells the story of Laurel, who spends her father's last days at his bedside, together with his second wife, Fay. After his death, she and Fay go back to his home, each to react to the past and future in their own way.Some reviewers say this book is character rather than plot driven. And that's correct. But I never got a full sense of the characters. For example, I couldn't see either Laurel or Fay. I could only hear their voices and imagine their actions.This book is a great example of showing rather than telling. Readers induce the characters from their dialogue and reactions. But I found the dialogue to become long and tedious, the secondary characters confusing, and I longed for more description of the places and characters. I finished the book unsatisfied, longing for something more."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"When Eudora Welty (1909 -- 2001) began work on the story that became \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" she had difficulty settling upon a title. At diffent times she considered \\"Poor Eyes\\", \\"An Only Child\\", \\"Baltimore\\" and even \\"The Flickering Light of Vision\\" as possible titles. Welty's editor at the \\"New Yorker\\" and close friend, William Maxwell urged her to keep her original title. In a letter to Welty of January 29, 1968, Maxwell wrote: \\"I am still partial to 'The Optimist's Daughter\\", because, by its ironic tone, it suggests a certain distance between the writer and the woman in the story, and because it also, again by its irony, suggests, matches, somehow, the full horror of the subject matter\\". Welty followed Maxwell's suggestion and retained her original title. \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" first was published as a story in the \\"New Yorker\\" in 1969 and then, in an expanded version, as a novel in 1972. In 1973, Welty received the Pulitzer Prize for the book.Maxwell was correct about the irony in the title, as between the primary character, Laurel McKelva, and her father, Judge Clint McKelva. But Welty's difficulty in deciding upon a title suggests the multi-faceted character of this dense, closely-written short work. Unusually for Welty, \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" has strong autobiographical elements. She interrupted her work on a longer project in 1966 to write the story following the death of her mother. The character of Becky McKelva, the mother of Laurel who was raised in West Virginia and became Judge McKelva's first wife, seems to have been modeled closely on Welty's mother. And a major theme of \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is coming to terms with grief and moving on with life.The story is set primarily in New Orleans and in the small town of Mount Salus, Mississippi in the early 1960's. Short but important scenes take place in West Virginia and Baltimore. When the book begins, Judge McKelva is in New Orleans to consult with his friend, a distinguished opthamologist, about an eye problem. With the Judge is his second wife, Fay, 40, to whom he has been married for about two years and his widowed daughter, Laurel, in her mid-40s. Laurel works as an artistic designer in Chicago and has returned to be with her father when she learns of his illness. After a serious operation on his eye, Judge McKelva ultimately collapses and dies. Fay and Laurel return to Mount Salus for the funeral.The book moves slowly and deliberately in both the New Orleans and the Mount Salus sections of the story. Laurel is thoughtful and reserved and grieves deeply for her father and for her own life and tragedy. She became a widow when her husband was killed in WW II. Fay, is egotistical, earthy, insensitive, crude, and dishonest. Although she tells Laurel that she has no remaining family, except for a grandfather, her mother and kin from Texas arrive in Mount Salus for the funeral. Welty makes a great deal of the contrast between the brash, vulgar Texas family of Fay, and the reserved ladies of Mount Salus, lifelong friends of the Judge and of Laurel. Welty spends a good deal of space in the description of the events leading up to and including the funeral with much character discussion of Fay and her family, and the Mississippians. The relationship between Fay and the McKelva's reminded me of the relationship between the established and wealthy Ponder family and the trashy Peacock family, also connected by marriage, in an earlier Welty short novel called \\"The Ponder Heart\\".The Ponder Heart\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is a highly internalized work. There is little in the way of overt action. The climax of the work occurs when Laurel spends three days largely alone in the old family home following her father's funeral. Surrounded with evidence of her youth, Laurel reflects on her father's life and death, and on the death of her mother, Becky, who had grown up in West Virginia. Becky died after a long, painful, and delirious illness. Laurel also reflects on the brief period of happiness she had enjoyed with her husband, Phil.The writing is terse, precise, and evocative throughout and uses a great deal of nature symbolism. Welty comes to focus on how Laurel comes to understand her life and her relationship to Fay. Welty does not utterly reject Fay, in spite of all her crudity, but comes to show her with a degree of sympathy. And Laurel comes to an understanding of herself. She is able to move forward with the remainder of her life with a sense of meaning and hope for the future.\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" explores themes of differences among people, past and present, loss and moving on with a high degree of wisdom and subtelty. The book consists of only a small number of scenes but they are developed extensively with great artistry. This is an excellent novel that bears close reading by an important American author. I was inspired to read this book by reading a recent collection of correspondence between Welty and William Maxwell, edited by Suzanne Marrs.What There Is to Say We Have Said: The Correspondence of Eudora Welty and William MaxwellMaxwell's letter to Welty about the title of the book, discussed early in this review, is drawn from Marrs' edition of the letters.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I'm not a big fan of Southern fiction in general, but this short novel is definitely a brilliant achievement. With admirable subtlety, Welty creates a portrait of the good and bad in all of us, as personified by demure Laurel and her wonderfully nasty stepmother, Fay.If most of the actual events come and go in the first 25 pages or so, the heart of the novel belongs to the more reflective remainder. Bereaved of her father but also free - for the moment - from the nagging of Fay and her relatives, Laurel experiences an emotional journey instantly recognizable to all of us who have ever stumbled into our families' past. From the thrill of reading your grandparents' childhood letters to the pungent smell of their clothes after years of smoking to the dimly lit bedroom nobody else had entered for 30 years...Welty's prose may be a bit purple, but all those sensations you love and hate at the same time are here.Character development is strong across the board as well. You won't like most of Fay's relatives and some of her friends, but then, you're not supposed to. (Isn't that what funerals are usually like in real life?) And they do blend in well with the vividly illustrated surroundings. You may not want the book to end as quickly as it does, but chances are you'll be happy for Laurel that it's over. You'll also come away with an interesting perspective on an uncomfortable event that most of us have to endure several times in our lives."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"On its face, this is a \\"little book,\\" not only because it is short in length, but because its written in simple prose, straightforward language, and tells a bittersweet, simple story. But don't be fooled; beneath the surface lies a swirling tale of frustration and betrayal. Blink, and you will miss it. I did. On my second slower reading, I found layers in the layers, resentments and disappointments, flashes of anger and bitterness-even among friends, families and lovers.Through the telling of this simple tale, the author pursues various themes, using character study, plot development, symbols (birds, flowers, and other household objects). Very few insights are given in a straightforward, declarative manner, but are unfolded slowly, in independent presentations, to which the reader gives weight by finding connections.For example, one of the larger themes the author pursues is the way love and interdependence intertwine. In that regard, the author writes:\\"But Laurel had kept the pigeons under eye in their pigeon house and had already seen a pair of them sticking their beaks down each other's throats, gagging each other, eating out of each other's craws, swallowing down all over again what had been swallowed before...They convinced her that they could not escape each other and could not themselves be escaped from.\\"Later in the novel, she revisits this theme describing how Laurel's mother, on her death bed, angrily confronted her husband's inability to \\"see\\" her pain and frustration (which the mother refers to as \\"her betrayal\\") by calling him a coward--but simultaneously and steadfastly clinging to his hands, and refusing to let go.Among other themes, as the title suggests, the author explores the notion of optimism, with the converse for the author, not being pessimism, but being realistic--the strength to face life and go on, even with its pains and difficulties. In that regard, the author writes, \\"But he was not an optimist--she knew that. Phil had learned everything he could manage to learn, and done as much as he had time for, to design houses to stand, to last, to be lived in; but he had known they could equally well, with the same devotion and tireless effort, be built of cards.\\"In conclusion, even after two readings, I feel that I have only scratched the surface of this book's depth. My suggestion for one considering a read, to achieve the maximum value this book has to offer, be prepared to do the work. If you are not (which is of course fine), its probably not the best choice."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"In the book \`The Optimist's Daughter' by Eudora Welty there is a scene where the protagonist (Laurel McKelva) who is the daughter of the deceased Judge McKelva, finds a bird in her Father's (and now her mother-in-law Fay's) house. I believe that this bird represents all Laurels life throughout the book. It is my opinion that Eudora Welty decided to simplify Laurels life into this situation with the bird showing us all the events that had happened to Laurel in the book.When Laurel first arrives home, she sees the bird, which \`shot out of the dining room and now went arrowing up the stairwell in front of her eyes' (pg 129). This first action of the bird sounds quite like Laurel after her mother died. The bird left the relative safety of the dining room, which it had been accustomed to at that point because of a sudden change (Laurels arrival) and it darted off quickly somewhere else that it had never been to before.Laurels life changed drastically when her mother died suddenly. Given the change in her life, she quickly darted of to another city, a place she did not know just like the bird did.Then, Laurel goes into the master bedroom of the house, and turns on a light, which the bird is immediately attracted to and it comes towards it, where Laurel slams the door shut on it to keep it out. Just like how, when Judge McKelva called Laurel, she came rushing out to see if he was ok and he died, just as surprisingly as the door slamming, and then he leaves everything he owns to Fay almost like a slap to the face.The bird is then restless, constantly \`touching, taping, brushing itself against the walls and closed doors, never resting' (pg 130). The bird is uncomfortable, and is restless, but no matter how much it struggles, it does not get anywhere. This is very much like Laurel once she is back in Mount Salus. She doesn't like the fact that people are telling lies about Judge McKelva, she doesn't like the fact that he isn't going to be buried with the rest of his family, she doesn't like the fact that the casket is going to be kept open and she certainly doesn't like the fact that Fay made such a scene at the funeral. However, as much as she might try to raise an objection, or tell people that that is not the way it was, she is trying to no avail.Then later, Mr. Check the carpenter is trying to help get the bird out of Laurel's room. Unfortunately all he does is make the situation worse and he simply shrugs it off when he does. This is very much alike to Laurel and her \`bridesmaids' whom thought that they were helping her and being supportive but really weren't doing anything to help.Finally, with the help of Missouri, Laurel manages to free the bird from the house and it flies away. This I believe, is the biggest section of symbolism. The house, I think, represents Laurels pass, the bird itself, representing Laurel. Laurel is trapped in the past, just like the bird is trapped in the house. Eventually however, the bird flies away back out into the unknown, free from the house, just like Laurel, will, leave Mount Salus and be free from her past and go back out to the world free from all that has happened."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a very tightly written story (almost a novella) about a daughter's coping with the death of her father.

However, I was surprised it had won a Pulitzer Prize as one of the main characters -- Fay -- was very one dimensional, and the story was slight."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I wanted to read this book because the writing style of one of my favorite authors (Fred Chappell) was compared to that of Eudora Welty. My expectations, therefore, were high and I felt disappointed and wholly unsatisfied when I finished reading it. Perhaps this is due to some failing or intellectual lacking of my own (after all, the book DID win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction) but I found her characters to be rather flat and her attempts at abstract descriptions difficult to follow. If I had reread certain passages a few times, I might have been able to follow her train of thought but I read fiction for pleasure, not to practice my study skills. Throughout the entire book, I got the feeling that she was simply trying too hard to be poetic. While her writing must appeal to others, I, most likely, will not pick up another one of her books in the future."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Laurel's developement throughout the novel makes her a wonderfully three demensional person, but all the other characters are steeped in stereotyes. Stereotyping in this novel, however, is used as a tool.While the Judge's first wife was utterly selfless (due to an obsession with the past) his second wife, Fay, is selfish to a rediculous degree. Fay is perfectly despisable, and I commend Welty for her perfect personification of that vice. The funniest lines in this novel come from Fay's childish, ego-centric perception of the world.Laurel's realization about her father's &quot;optimism&quot; for a new life with Fay is a significant one. When you read this take note of Laurel's growth, because it is in her developement that this book becomes psychologically and philosophically interesting.This book will not be for everyone because of the simple, slow plot. Welty's talent resides not giving us a riveting plot, but in creating the atmosphere and tone of the south."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This book cannot be read without, to quote Peter Medawar, &quot;a desperate gasping and flailing around for sense.&quot; Although it starts off promisingly enough, this book quickly degenerates into semi-philosophical musings and one-dimensional characters.

Staying in her childhood home with his very young self-involved second wife, re-living memories of her mother and the loss of her own husband many years before, brings on powerful awarenesses and relevations about life and relationships."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The action in The Optimist's Daughter is minimal and limited, but also fairly inconsequential. The novel's path is through Laurel's journey within herself, one that involves soul searching and coming to terms with death and grief. Laurel returns to New Orleans to care for her ailing father, but, upon returning, she has to deal with past childhood memories, former acquaintances, the grief of past and present losses, and one very antagonistic woman, Fay, her father's new wife. Searching her soul to the understanding of what memories serve, Laurel puts perspective on painful events and those who are close to her.One significant character battle is simply the battle of wills between Fay, the brash widow of the Judge, and Laurel, the Judge's daughter. Ultimately, the difference between Laurel and Fay is that Laurel can see the value and significance in people and the memories they bring; Fay, on the other hand, only sees the wall in front of her face. Laurel is quiet and reflective; Faye, brash and irrational. They both care about the Judge, but clearly have different ways of expressing it.Eudora Welty's The Optimist's Daughter is a quiet, somber, short read, but carries with it a message about how all of us deal with the difficulties and trials we experience in life--death, isolation, loneliness. Welty has a way of crafting such vivid prose in thought-provoking ways. There is so much going on under the surface level of this novel, and it becomes sort of a cathartic experience."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The book builds the characters layer by layer. We can feel their pain and their joys. The contrast of the daughter and the new younger wife if stunning. The author compares and contrast the two while comparing and contrasting the people of the town and the new wife's family. I read this with my bookclub and I think we were all struck by the love shown when the daughter remembers her father and mother (the first wife) reading to each other in bed at night while she listens through the walls. Great book for anyone who enjoys southern novels and anyone who knows sharing books with others holds its own magic."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I have to admit that I did not enjoy the book and read it very quickly. I can't stop thinking about it though and that makes me think I need to re-read it. I didn't see Fay in the negative way that most reviewers did. When Fay \\"abused\\" the judge I agreed with her. Keeping him immobile in that bed was killing him and he was losing the will to live. She was right to try to wake him up. Laurel and the townspeple irritated me far more than Fay. Does anyone else agree that Fay was not as one dimensional as she seemed and had an honesty and realism about her?"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The Optimist's Daughter was a subtle read. Yet, Welty expertly conveys the colorful nuances of New Orleans and Mississippi culture, especially Mardi Gras, the assorted southern mansions, a clownishly outfitted cat, the neighborhood as well as their compassionate yet busybody endless curiosity of their meddling behavior. That was just a small component of the novel. She really captures the essence of small town Mayberry life. It's sweet but also rather suffocating without diminishing the characters in the novel. It's like you'd want to stay there for five or ten minutes and then leave.What I found to be really true, however, was the leaving of small town life with all the attachments that belong to it and then suddenly coming back to it, and that was the case of Laurel Hand, a quiet yet strong-willed woman who returns home from Chicago. She has come back to care for her ailing father-Judge Clint McKelva, who is highly revered for his sound judicial wisdom and the help he has given to his neighbors. Upon coming back to Mount Salus, Mississippi, Laurel-modern and dignified-must deal with her annoying and shrewish stepmother who weaseled herself into the judge's life. Money is always a motive. Laurel composes herself, meets with the community and waits the bitter wait of her beloved father's demise. Does it immediately happen? Do things go sour for the money hungry Fay McKelva, who nobody in the community likes? You'll just have to read.When it is time for Fay and Laurel and all the neighbors to retreat back to normal life, because all seems well, supposedly, there is no love lost, especially with Fay. Let's just say that her annoying character rhythms with the word itch. In the end, when good or bad happens, people must always retreat back to the normal routines of day-to-day living, and that is no different for Laurel; she is a designer of some sort and has her own life. Yet, all the old biddies of the neighborhood want her to stay on, for she would be a fantastic asset to the community. However, that can't be, and she makes it quite clear. Just because she is leaving Mount Salus, she is not leaving its essence, the memories. Just as when a human passes on, so too is it the same with our old childhood homes and friends. More often-than-not, we carry those wonderful memories with us when we are far away. Those memories take us back to the epicenter of what we most long for.The optimist's daughter was a really decent read with a simple yet potent message. It was a short and sad book yet strangely affirming-and only 180 pages-but it was worthy of its 1972 Pulitzer Prize win. I think readers will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I spent this last year of school (senior year) analyzing and constructing an essay on this novel. When choosing my book, I naively put the one Welty book that was on the list as my first choice solely because Rory Gilmore Mentioned Welty in her graduation speech (in Gilmore Girls) ...and it was short, at 187 pages. I read the description and it sounded pretty good so i was all set.I had no idea what was in store for me. This small novel is a treasure of mine that i will recommend to all my friends, especially the girls. The book is separated into 4 parts-each part with 4 chapters i believe, so it makes it incredibly easy to read. As many others have said, the plot is not the concern of the story, it is the characters, especially the main character middle aged widow Laurel McKelva Hand and her emotional maturity. I especially enjoyed reading this book because there was an uncanny resemblance of Laurels life to my own-which freaked me out, but made it even more meaningful.Basic story plot is this: After Laurel's father's death she and her snooty immature step mother must go back to her little hometown in Mississippi for the funeral. During her stay at her childhood home surrounded by the people she once called friends, Laurel fights a mental battle with herself concerning the truth of the relationship between her dead parents and what her memories mean. It is an ultimately uplifting novel seeing that Laurel finally finds peace within herself and can finally 'let go' of the things that had been holding her back from true happiness for so long and be free.The complexity comes through the internal examination of the past, memories, and the distinct difference between the two. And this is what Laurel must learn in order to come to terms with her past and her relationships so that she can return to Chicago 'whole and healed' so to speak.Bottom line: If you are looking for an easy read that will move you in ways unexpected, and a story centered on careful character development rather than a fast paced plot- READ THIS BOOK Eudora Welty is an incredible author and this should be considered her best work."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a beautiful book about relationships, the past, and the present. Welty's language is moving while the story she builds is so wonderfully simple that it allows a reader to focus on the subtleties of character and language."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a wonderful novel, exactly what I would expect from Eudory Welty. She catches the absurdity, silliness and nobility of the human spirit, all those qualities that make us human and are mixed up in all of us.The story focuses on Laurel McKelva who takes care of her dying father, Judge McKelva. Her father's second wife, Fay, is younger than Laurel and Laurel must deal with Fay's impulsivity and seeming dispassion and immaturity. How Laurel deals with her father's death, memories of her family and her return home while at the same time reuniting with old friends and forced to tolerate Fay and her family from the boonies is the surface story. Underneath, we watch Laurel examine just what love is. \\"For her life, any life, she had to believe, was nothing but the continuity of its love.\\"Lauel slowly learns to understand Fay by understanding her roots and feeling a tenderness towards Fay's young nephew Wendell, whose present environment likely mirrors Fay's childhood.Gradually, her annoyance and disdain for Fay turns to pity and then tolerance. For Fay, in her dispassion can never find true solace. Laurel realizes that:\\"the past is no more open to help or hurt her than was her father in his coffin. The past is like him impervious, and can never be awakened. It is memory that is the somnambulist\\".Thus Laurel comes to terms with her past, her family and with Fay. This is a profound and wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"At the time of her death, Eudora Welty of Mississippi was generally considered America's greatest living author. Although Welty made her reputation with and is best remembered for her remarkable short stories, she also wrote a number of novels, including THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER, for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.As seen in reviews posted here, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER provokes a very divided response in readers. This largely due to the nature of the work, which is character rather than plot driven, and which although quite short requires a slow reading in order to develop clearly in mind. Perhaps more so than in any other work, Welty writes \\"below the surface\\" here: the story itself, which concerns a daughter who returns to her tiny Mississippi home town when her respected father dies, is quite slight--but Welty endows it with a surprising depth of meaning, transforming what would otherwise be pure character study into a sharply focused and deeply moving statement on the nature of love, loss, life, and the passage of time we must all endure.Although written in a deceptively simple style, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER is the mature work of a master. Given the nature of the piece, I do not think it can be much appreciated by young adults; one requires the perspective of at least middle age to fully grasp both its delicacy and beauty. But once that perspective is acquired, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER should move immediately to the top of every serious reader's list. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The sentence from this book that best describes it is: &quot;Memory lived not in initial possession but in the freed hands, pardoned and freed, and in the heart that can empty but fill again, in the patterns restored by dreams.&quot; What a beautiful piece of writing! I am so thankful for growing older and maturing. Having done so, this book can truly be enjoyed. It is about maturing, deepening, remembering, and honoring. It is about relationship with the persons in one's life, with the past and with the future. Obtrusively thrust in the middle of all this is Fay and the Chisom family, representing all the possible ugliness, crassness, uncaring and unfeeling meanness of today's world.I could write that there is little that happens in this book...on the surface, but as in all truly rich experiences, one has to go deeper and reflect to see the richness. After slowly enjoying the first 160 pages or so, the last 10 pages explode in complexity and interaction and meaning. Those pages comprise one of the finest endings to a novel that I have read."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1973, this moving study of memory and the progression of generations is still vibrant and relevant thirty years later. Not only does it show us the ripple effect that one person's passing has on loved ones, it also shows us the changes to society which occur as older generations pass away and new generations take their place.Welty's concern here is with values--those traditional values learned by Laurel, the daughter of a Mississippi judge, from her parents; those learned by her parents from their parents; those imparted by the town she grew up in and the people who lived there; and those which Laurel has absorbed from her life as an artist in Chicago. In her values she is in direct contrast with Fay, the judge's young second wife, a crass and selfish woman from Texas with a large, boisterous, and uneducated family--a woman whose only desire is to come out a winner. When the judge dies, Laurel returns temporarily to her old room in the family home, which, Fay takes great pains to remind her, now belongs to Fay. There, surrounded by family belongings, she is assailed by memories of her childhood, her mother, her mother's final illness, and her relationship with her father. Her pre-occupation with the past is in direct contrast with Fay's concern with the present and her future--these women clearly belong to different worlds, and only Laurel is capable of change or adaptation.Welty's ear for dialogue is unerring. She reveals character, class, and education in her syntax and choice of vocabulary and creates conflicts from the smallest of details--a misunderstood word, an imagined slight, a presumption. The conflict is leavened by humor in many places, some of it dark, especially when Fay's \\"no 'count\\" family arrives at the funeral. The characters themselves lack subtlety, however, and the symbolism is obvious--birds and flowers are constant motifs, and in the final scene, a handmade breadboard assumes meanings for Laurel well beyond what one would expect for such a simple item. For those of us who have lived through the death of parents and the disposal of a family home, this novel has a resonance rare in modern fiction, one which transcends the period in which it was written and the southern location in which it is set. Wonderful! Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"It is no great surprise that Eudora Welty received the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for the novel The Optimist's Daughter. Welty masterfully creates a journey through the heart of a daughter who loosens her grasp on the past while embracing the future after the death of her father, a beloved judge. The author uses motifs to reflect the past versus present theme, and symbols, and metaphors to add drama to the overall plot through insights into the characters. Eudora Welty uses the \\"judge and jury\\" metaphor through out the novel to keep the theme of the novel progressing. The metaphor describes Fay's judgement of Laurel's visit during her father's hospital stay, and like wise Laurel's judgement of Fay \`s resentment towards Becky. The metaphor is once again used after the funeral when the garden club, Becky's friends, sentence Fay to be the outcast of the town. This metaphor is the core of the novel's struggle for the truth. Welty uses numerous symbols to aid her writing. The author uses birds to signify death, every time a bird enters a reference to or an actual death occurs. Black also symbolizes death and demons, whether they are people or inner thoughts. The black clothes at the funeral symbolize the morning that accompanies death. Welty also uses a breadboard in the last chapter that symbolizes Laurel's love for her husband and her past. The motif of the mountains is the most apparent in the novel. Laurel's mother Becky never felt more alive than when she was in the mountains. The mountains are where Becky McKleva drew her strength, hence why she wanted to return to her beloved West Virginia Mountains when she was on her death bed. The mountains are also the key to unlocking parts of Laurels past which aid her in her quest for happiness in the future. Eudora Welty masterfully created an insight into America's growing trend of the second wife syndrome in this novel. Her motifs, metaphors, and symbols made her flashbacks into the past easier to understand, and aided in the understanding of the characters. Through the judgements of Laurel and the town Fay's character is revealed, and in the end the past is resolved and the future is just beginning."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Hearing this story in the author's own soft, cultivated and yet mischievous Mississippi voice is the greatest treat. I liked the story itself because it was one of those things that you just got drawn into, like family gossip. You don't maybe want to take the time at first, it's hardly blood and thunder, but you just get to wondering why people are where they are in life. How did we get to this pass? All of sudden you find yourself in some little town because your father is in need of an operation , and then you are forced to be among people not your own class because your dad gave into his sexual desires at an advanced age, and the woman he's married stomps all over the family memories and does the bedroom in hooker style. Later, the younger wife's kin will arrive and collectively freak. And you (finally) take it all like a good, believing Christian, but only because you have the gift of irony and humor. And because any other response does violence to the memory of your parents. Classical virtues act like a giant levee against the red mud tide of blind pig-squealing relatives. Is it self-control at a price? Sure. God, I love this woman. May flights of angels send her to her rest."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I enjoyed taking the time to read this short novel. Welty has crafted incredibly believable characters that carry their frustrations and inanities safely in a clip-shut purse to rest on their laps. I particularly enjoyed discovering Fay; she stands for the selfish, nasty, and brutish in all of us; she is all around us, we all know someone like her.Best of all, however, is Welty's supple gift with language. She constructs the narration with a maturity of style that is difficult to describe. She delves into the lives of the characters, their pasts, their silent struggles, and reveals it with respect. It's as if she were handling a rare vase newly unearthed from a dig, turning it in the light, pointing out the scratches and cracks and always admiring the thing.This is a character novel. The plot is secondary to the lives of the characters. Inside the story, the gossamer trace of humanity in the characters left me with a tickle--a flutter--and it made me think about things in my life in comparison."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This book is the conclusion of Welty's thematic trilogy of Southern family life: while \\"Delta Wedding\\" concerns a family gathering for a marriage ceremony and \\"Losing Battles\\" relates the events surrounding a family reunion celebrating a matriarch's 90th birthday, \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is about a funeral. Like her previous works, this last of Welty's novels deals primarily with emotions rather than actions, with character rather than plot. Unlike any of her previous novels, however, this short work has both feet planted firmly in the last half of the twentieth century.Laurel, a widow not entirely recovered from the loss of her husband many years earlier, returns home and finds herself completely without family. Her father dies, leaving in his wake the appropriately named Fay, a vulgar second wife who represents everything Laurel isn't and her mother wasn't. The rest of the novel describes the various attempts by Fay and by the friends of her father to reshape their recollections of his life to their own needs; a particular humorous scene describes four elderly neighborhood women criticizing both Fay and the deceased--more to affirm their own sense of superiority than to comfort Laurel, who endures every word of their conversation. After Fay leaves town for a few days with her trailer-trash relatives (who cause quite a stir when they show up for the funeral), Laurel is left alone to wander through her childhood home and wonder about her family's past. By the end of the novel, Laurel realizes that neither Fay nor her father's neighbors can take away the only things left in her life: her memories of her parents and her future.Because of its leisurely pacing, this book isn't for everyone. To say that nothing happens is not entirely accurate: although it's a short book, it's difficult to summarize in even a few paragraphs. It is beautifully written, it's easy to read, and the novel has richly drawn characters--but some readers may feel the novel itself lacks character. Once I finished the book, I was not sure whether or not I liked it, and I don't feel it's her best. At times the book almost collapses under the weight of its own heavy-handed symbols: the birds, the mountains, the thunderstorm, the breadboard. The novel repays a few hours of reflection and rereading, however: passages that are seemingly unrelated to the main narrative eventually make sense. What saves \\"The Optimist's Daughter,\\" in the end, is both its ability to haunt the reader and Welty's sure-handed understanding of humanity."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's Pulitzer winning novel, set in the South of 30 years ago, examines the physical mechanics of the funeral process, while placing the human heart under the microscope of social and filial stress. Laurel--a war widow deprived of the experiences and joys of normal married life, rushes back to Missisippi from her Chicago job and lifestyle. This devoted only child insists on her place at her father's bedside, as he undergoes eye surgery--a convenient medical smokescreen for the unmentionable killer: Cancer. How can a confirmed Optimist handle this grim reality?The storyline develops in the aftermath of his inevitable death, but the battle lines are drawn even before he quietly expires: between Laurel--the daughter of beloved Judge Clint McKelva and his adored wife, Becky--and Fay, the utterly selfish and emotionally crude second wife/young step-mother. Is it seemly to be disputing arrangements before the man is even enterred?What had the judge been thinking--to desecrate his wife's memory by bringing that crass Texas woman into the big house where Miss Becky was enshrined in neighborhood memory? Laurel suffers deep emotional trials as she tries to maintain her dignity at the Viewing--held in the Judge's study--then during funeral and graveside solemnities. But conditions deteriorate, as bruised egos and grieving hearts are bared in a shocking public display. The interlopers have no sense of decency or compassion for the sincere mourners who rally around their native daughter.There is brief respite for Laurel when Fay suddenly departs with her hick kin; yet being alone with kind neighbors and loving bridesmaids does not really help her penetrate the veneer of faith in her childhood memories. How can Laurel rewrite the Past so as to validate her own bleak future? Like the bird trapped inside the house, will she be able to break out on her own, to accept her parent's foibles along with their love, while honoring their role in her life? This is more of a psychological piece, with admittedly little plot, but quiet insight into the tapestry of myths and lies which we accept as our heritage."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"In Eudora Welty's book, The Optimist's Daughter, Laurel Hand, the main character, notices her father's clock has stopped. Her father has, of course, just died, and for Laurel this means that time has become an elastic proposition. If any 20th century author can be said to have the power to split a moment, it is Eudora Welty.The Optimist's Daughter is a study in grief and in love that carefully avoids clich&eacute;. Arriving from Chicago, Laurel watches her father let go of life after a seemingly successful operation. Meanwhile, his second wife, a younger woman named Fay who lacks the capacity for any kind of introspection, stages a display of raw anger. When they return for the funeral, Laurel watches again as the eccentric town, and Fay's even more eccentric family, converge upon the coffin of Mount Salus's first citizen.Welty, who spent most of her life in Mississippi, has an ear for small town vernacular, and dialogue plays an important part in the book. Yet she never permits the narrative to travel along familiar lines, and often the characters speak out into thin air, as if to themselves. Laurel's distinctive silence marks the minutes before she is able to confront the past, which she does once she is alone, examining the contents of the house.A storm, a trapped bird, and the fading correspondence of her parents' bring about the catharsis that she requires. She begins to understand the fallibility, the depth, and the complex nature of their love. \`\\"Why did I marry a coward?\\"' her mother asks while dying, and Welty, as Laurel, continues - \`then had taken his hand to help him bear it.'Of all the writer's precepts, perhaps the most difficult is simplicity, of knowing when to shut up. Welty walks a fine line between boredom and profundity at times, but as Laurel goes about erasing the traces of Fay's influence (the nail polish on the desk) and her own past (she burns her mother's letters and confronts her personal losses), we sense in her a woman of uncommon maturity. There are no literary flourishes in The Optimist's Daughter, which means that every word on the page is carefully used. Take your time with this book - it bears re-reading."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" bears two of the great hallmarks of Eudora Welty's writing: meticulously recorded conversation and an emphasis on how \\"stories\\" shape our lives. Laurel, a young woman who left the South many years ago to pursue a life in Chicago, returns when her father is suddenly taken ill and requires an operation in New Orleans. There she waits out her father's long attempt at recovery in the company of her stepmother, a self-absorbed woman younger than herself with whom she has nothing in common. After her father dies, the two women accompany the body of her father, the Judge, back to her childhood home in a small town in Mississippi. Prior to the funeral a visitation takes place, and here we hear the authentic voices of all the townspeople as well as those of the Texas clan of the stepmother Fay who has claimed that all her relatives are dead. As each of these visitors pays condolences to Laurel the entire town becomes fleshed out in the words that each uses to describe his or her relationship with the Judge. Whole characters come fully to life in a single line of dialog. On the day after the funeral, some of the neighborwomen get together with Laurel to review the funeral (and discuss the stepmother). Everyone feels dissatisfied with how the funeral came off--all feel slightly uncomfortable with their own performance and those of the other mourners--demonstrating the awkwardness and stress of all funerals and the inadequacy of most people to express their true feelings of loss in these circumstances.Throughout the book, we see the importance of the \\"stories\\" that we tell about ourselves. Already at the funeral the townspeople begin to tell stories about the Judge, exaggerating his courage and turning him into a community hero. Laurel objects to the town rewriting her father's history, but is powerless to stop them, as her father ceases to be an individual and becomes a story. Fay has worked hard to convince herself and the rest of the world that she comes from better origins than is the actual case. She is a difficult character to care about with her selfishness, distance, anger, and envy, but, as we see and hear the stories of the members of the family she has tried to distance herself from, we begin at least to understand better why she is the way she is. On her last night in her childhood home, Laurel looks through the letters and papers of her long-dead mother, who was beloved by the town, her husband, and her daughter. Through these stories (based on Welty's own memories of her mother's childhood home in West Virginia and on her mother's stories of growing up there) Laurel comes to a deeper understanding of both of her parents, their marriage, and herself.The final theme in this simple, but profound book is the deep isolation of individuals, even when surrounding by family and friends. Laurel's father appears to have been deeply isolated emotionally despite his marriages to two women to whom he was devoted, and he draws into himself again as death approaches. Laurel's mother became increasingly isolated as blindness and mental disintegration drew her into her own world of pain and anger. Fay is loved neither by her family or the town to which her husband has brought her. Her only connection was to her husband and her anger at his death, which she sees as his desertion of her, becomes understandable. Laurel, long a widow after a brief marriage, has chosen to continue living alone in the city to which her husband took her, isolated from the community of love in which she grew up. Ultimately, however, Laurel discovers that memories can bind us to the past and prevent our moving forward. Before leaving her childhood home forever, Laurel burns all of her mother's papers. Having thus broken the hold of the past, she is now free to create a life of her own. Home will now be wherever she is."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's story opens in a New Orleans hospital waiting room where Clinton McKelva awaits with his middle-aged daughter, Laurel, and his second wife, Fay, to meet with their physician to discuss some needed eye surgery. After undergoing the surgery, \\"Judge\\" McKelva's recovery goes poorly, resulting in his passing. Events surrounding his funeral reveal the wide and varied menagerie of relatives, neighbors and friends that have been part of his long life. \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is a portrait of family relationships, a reflection upon a family's past, and the story derives much of its poignancy and insight through the passage the title character faces as she looses her father and faces the future alone without parents, husband, or children.Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1973, \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is like a quiet symphony that, eventually, rises to its unexpected, long-awaited dramatic finale. The \\"pedestrian\\" chatter of various characters that seems to eclipse the presence of the title character, Lauren, suggests in the back of one's mind that her near absence in the novel's first two-thirds will lead to her prominence at its end. This is the case, and the reader's long wait for its arrival is well-rewarded."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a very straightforward book. When Laurel's father dies, she must deal not only with her own grief but that of her friends and neighbors (her father was a well-loved judge in their small town). On top of that, she also has to deal with the histrionics of her stepmother, a woman younger than herself, who does not react in a way that Laurel finds seemly.The night after the funeral, Laurel finds herself alone in her childhood home. Going through things from her past, she reminisces about her parents, and is able to come to terms with aspects of their relationship and her mother's final illness.Welty writes her scenes sparingly, allowing characters to speak for themselves. The disparity between the actions of Laurel's stepmother's family and those of the locals is told through dialogue, rather than description, to great effect. One can't help but cringe on Laurel's behalf for what she has to go through before she is free to mourn her father."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"wonderfully, really southern. Oh, how I love the classic southern writers. Rereading Eudora makes me realize the difference between mediocre and great writing, she doing the latter (and obviously I doing the former, ha ha)."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"While Eudora Welty is clearly a gifted writer -- she is able to create lines that are rich with imagery and meaning -- she struggles to write at a pace that engages the reader, at least in my opinion. While I was pulled in for the first 50 pages or so, I quickly lost interest. This is a novel that is light on plot, heavy in meaning, which is great; I do not have a problem with that. Unfortunately, I think this book is too short and does not give enough information about the characters to make the deeper context very significant. I found myself reading that last few pages thinking, \\"Okay, I'm supposed to care here. I'm supposed to feel that this character has changed, has realized how his/her life has evolved to this point...\\" I just didn't care enough. I feel that this book probably works for Southern readers who might connect with the geography, the people, the culture of the Gulf Coast. As a Californian, perhaps, these things are just lost on me. Perhaps my faster-paced, doing-three-things-at-once sort of lifestyle prevents me from feeling the patience to get through this type of book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The father lived loud and proud, but died with a whimper not a bang, that is pretty sad. The daughter was a wimp, but she became assertive. Redemption is always a rewarding end to a story. The (2nd wife/ step-mother) was the only consistent character throughout; loud and abrasive from beginning to end. The kind you love to hate. I liked this short story turned novel, I would recommend reading it. Especially after reading a big thick book. This one is short and sweet and cleans your reading palette just perfectly."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"If I had not known who wrote this book I would have guessed it was an early Anne Tyler novel. The similiarities in style and content are striking. The main character is interesting and quite well developed, but there are too many rather banal conversations involving minor characters. Welty has a fine eye for detail and a good sense of time and place but the plot is not strong enough to sustain even a short novel. I'm sure I missed half the point of this book, but I could not be bothered to read it again to find out exactly what I'd missed."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is largely told in the third person through the observations of its heroine, Laurel McKelva Hand, the daughter of a prominent and wealthy smalltown Mississippi judge who comes to New Orleans to help her father who must see a doctor for an eye affliction. On hand is the judge's second wife, the silly and vulgar Fay, whom Laurel and the doctor basically ignore. When the father unexpectedly dies, Laurel (who is older than Fay) must return to the smalltown with her stepmother for his funeral.The reasons for Welty's popularity with THE NEW YORKER editorial board are much in evidence: the story is told subtly and in small pieces, and accrues a remarkable level of hospital and genteel smalltown detail as it proceeds. Its measured rhythms are the best thing this novel has going for it. Unfortunately, it seems to proceed too much along the lines of a contest between discreet Southern gentility and refinement (embodied in the quiet and grieiving Laurel) and no-'count Southern lower-class vulgarity (championed by Fay and her obnoxious Texas relatives). Although Laurel comes to realize why her father's late-life optimism explains why he married Fay, Welty doesn't really allow Fay any sort of appeal to the reader at all, and so you finish the novel thinking how much *nicer* everything would have been had the judge never married her. (At least Tennessee Williams allowed Stanley Kowalski animal magnetism.) The novel seems too much on the side of delicacy , especially given that Welty's own fine feelings are so manifest in her method of telling of the story--though paradoxically some overobvious symbols (a carved boat, a breadboard, the judge's degenerating eye) weigh things down a bit much. The work is most interesting at the end, when Laurel must confront some truths about her real mother's final illness which complicate the overly schematic family alignments in some welcome ways."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Eudora Welty's Pulitzer prize winning novel, &quot;The Optimist's Daughter&quot;, underwhelmed me. That's my honest reaction to this quietly restrained tale of remembrance, whose floodgates were opened by the unexpected death of Judge McKelva and the ensuing funeral gathering of neighbours, in-laws and family. Welty's heroine, Laurel, through whose eyes the tale is told, is so unnaturally quiet - she barely speaks or responds to conversation - she's a Cordelia-like character from &quot;King Lear&quot;. She must also be the most underwritten protagonist ever in a novel. The reader has almost to construct her character from the dots left by the author. Wanda Fay is, on the other hand, a caricature - a southern bimbo. The story (thankfully short) moves at such a slow pace you have to pinch yourself to stay awake. The dialogue is awkward and hard to make out. Maybe that's how southerners speak or sound to foreigners. It's only in the last chapter that sparks start to fly and Laurel shows she has blood flowing through her veins. It took a trapped bird in the house to bring that out. Maybe I didn't get it, but &quot;The Optimist's Daughter&quot; must be the most disappointing prize winning book I have read in a long time. Not a priority read. For me anyway."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a book by Eudora Welty.Ms. Welty was what you would call a great \\"Southern\\" writer. Even though I am a southerner myself, such authors are not often favorites of mine - often too slow, wordy and tragic for me.Anyway, I thought this book by Ms. Welty was OK. It had some interesting subplots, characters and settings, but it seemed to end rather abruptly and not say as much as it seemed to have the capacity to say. I gather she liked the short story, so maybe this was just her way - this was a very short novel. I think that the title may be a bit ironic too.In addition to some great handling of local color, the book offers a view of the South in a transitional time of recent years, but it concentrates on issues other than race. That might make it of interest especially to people from outside the region; the South is about more than just racial issues (among the magnolias).For some reason, people hate this review. Well, to each his/her own."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"It is a mystery why this received a Pulitzer Prize. It was awful.

I'm not some one to criticize an author for what he writes because I know he has something he wants to say, or an opinion; but I just don't understand what Zane Grey was doing with this book.

This time though, that world is not a carrier-based fighter squadron, but a Special Operations team led by Roberts, a Navy SEAL. The opening scene details a seemingly successful covert mission led by Ash that has unforeseen and tragic consequences for his men. Carroll creates Lt. Roberts quickly and the reader is motivated to follow him into his new non-combat assignment as he keeps asking questions about his former teammates and the intelligence they uncovered while in the field. Although now trapped in a \\"staff\\" (i.e. boring) job, Ash is a warrior and not the unlikely hero he sometimes seems to think he is, and he is soon on the trail of international terrorism hidden in the unlikeliest of places. I think this book is more \\"mainstream\\" than the \\"Punk\\" novels, and will appeal to a broader audience than those. Readers who enjoy intrigue, a little unexpected humor, some steamy romance and even a macabre moment, will find that this is a fast and thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Aide","review":"Ward Carroll's new series about Navy SEAL Ash Roberts has started with a bang with The Aide.

(The resolution of speech sound into units of meaning is a process with various steps. The two steps that Tsur focuses upon are the reduction of a sound stream to phonemic sounds, and the isolation of a frame of reference through which one can contain and differentiate between the specific semantic and referential contents of a linguistic sequence. Once one has accomplished the former step, he can address the sound stream as speech, and the latter leads to an understanding of speech.)Expressive Sound and Double-EdgednessThe methodology that Tsur has developed to analyze the expressive nature of the sounds of poetic language relies heavily upon an approach to classifying the causal role of language structures in the synaesthetic experience of a particular linguistic articulation:The problem of synaesthetic equivalences will cease to look embarrassingly arbitrary if, hereto, we fix out attention not one likeness of elements but on structural relationships within a scale or a matrix. When we say that i is brighter than u, we find a surprising degree of general consent. If we are more careful still and say that the step from u to i is more like an upward step, I think the majority will agree, whatever explanation each of may be inclined to offer. (Tsur 1992 citing Jakobson citing Grombich)It is unnecessary and misleading to assert specific synaesthetic qualities as inhering in particular phonemes. It is better to say that a series phonemes can be arranged along a continuum which represents the extent to which each exemplifies a particular pertinent aspect of their common embodiment as sound, and that the terminal extremes of this continuum can be reasonably matched analogously to the terminal ends of a continuum measuring a some aspect that is synaesthetically experienced through the sound of language. These various mappings constitute the sound potential of a given phoneme. Double-edgedness is a result of the fact that various phonemes can be placed along various continuums measuring different aspects of their sound constitution, and that the degree to which a particular aspect of a phoneme's sound structure is foregrounded in a particular instance depends greatly upon contextual cues which determine the rhythm and intonation of our articulation of the phonemes involved. Thus, it is possible for one phoneme in different contexts to produce opposing intuitions. Tsur takes an example from Richards clearly demonstrating this phenomenon:Compare for example:Deep into a gloomy grot with Peep into a roomy cot. . .In each of the two phrases different vowel features may be used to enhance meaning; this is the source of the double-edgedness of the sounds. In peep one tends to foreground the features [BRIGHT, HIGH], in deep the features [LONG, (FAR)DOWN]. In gloomy the feature [DARK] whereas in roomy the features [LONG, HIGH] (that is spacious) are likely to be foregrounded. (Tsur 1992)It is Tsur's goal in What Makes Sound Patterns Expressive to discover the various expressive potencies of phonetic sounds and to develop this account as a way exploring the intuitions that are often experienced when reading certain poems or kinds of poetry.Throughout his arguments concerning the expressive potential of phonetic sounds, Tsur relies heavily upon a distinction between one's categorical and pre-categorical awareness of language. According to Tsur, conventionally we repress our awareness of the specific qualities of the sound stream underlying a series of phonemes and hear only phonemes, or categorical sounds. Now, this argument while it remains unqualified is rather absurd. I don't have to be yelled at or threatened by someone to know that they are angry with me. And it's sometimes the case that after a conversation I have with someone, say my mother on the telephone, I have certain intuitions about her state of mind that are inexplicable in terms of the subject matter we discussed. Furthermore, it seems that in the course of daily conversation, where our words aren't painstakingly chosen to convey finely grained conceptual distinctions that (pre-categorical) cues conveyed through the rhythm and articulation of linguistic sequence are an indispensable resource for interpretation.Tsur, despite the fact that his familiarity with linguistic research ends with the 70's offers us a practical insight-namely, to be able to respond to a particular aspect of a poem's meaning, namely the expressiveness of its sound, we must make a performance of it, in our heads or outloud. Barsalou, cites research showing that when we conceptualize or think about sounds, or rehearse them to our \\"mind's ear\\", areas of our auditory cortices show activation levels similar to those displayed when comparible sounds are actively perceived. Tsur gives us an account of one aspect of poetic significance that has eluded a systematic treatment in the field of literary theory, and consequently allows us to understand why it is that making a performance of a poem is critical to full engagement of its expressive potential. Furthermore, he gives convincing arguments concerning why it is that certain sounds produce certain effects in certain contexts."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"This book caused me to laugh out loud in several places, and not only the flower-pot scene.

As someone who struggles to get a night sleep because of pain, it was a sheer delight for me to have the tonic of reading this book peopled with its eccentric characthers and its convoluted plot where nobody is who they claim to be.The young upper class PSmith is the most striking characther here and has some of the best lines in the book and of course, we have Lord Emsworth appearing again - this time seeming even madder - starting lunch with a poet and continuing lunch with a different person (Psmith) who he thinks is the same person resulting in confusion and impersonation down in Blandings. But the plot about the stealing of a necklace is a real howl with everyone pretending to be someonelse and Baxter Lord Emsworth's sercretary really losing it in trying to track down the thief.

(And my copy of \\"Leave It to Psmith\\" now goes to my 90-year-old mother.)In addition to wonderful, loveable characters, laugh-out-loud narrative and dialogue, and a marvelously convoluted plot that almost defies summarization, the book also features semi-serious but still wryly and deftly expressed observations, such as: \\"What I like about the English rural districts * * * is that when the authorities have finished building a place they stop. Somewhere about the reign of Henry the Eighth, I imagine that the master-mason gave the final house a pat with his trowel and said, 'Well, boys, that's Market Blandings.' To which his assistants no doubt assented with many a hearty 'Grammercy!' and 'I'fackins!' these being expletives to which they were much addicted.

It is the fourth novel about the character Ronald Psmith (The \\"P\\" is silent, he explains, \\"as in phthisis, psychic, and ptarmigan.\\"), and also the secong novel that takes place at well known Blandings Castle. In the Opinion Journal from the Wall Street editorial page, Roger Kimball selected \\"leave it Psmith\\" as the first of his five favourite comic novels. And indeed, it is, even in competition with the Jeeves an Wooster stories. It is quite simple, you like this kind of stories, with this kind of humor (for instance, if you like the quote and you can see the humor in that one-lined but already multi-layered joke, you must be a Woodhouse fan, whether you know it or not), or you don't understand even the tiniest bit of what people find so funny about it at all. In that case, don't bother. There may possibly be a therapy for it, but since I don't need that I can't help you. I have (after about 15 years) rediscovered this fantastic book, and yes, reading it brings it all back, every word still in my mind.

This story tells of a debonnair young man, Psmith, and how he chases the girl of his dreams whilst at the same time, solving (and aggravating!) the problems of the people around him. Throughout all the mayhem and foibles, Psmith never loses his cool and definitely not his manners and composure.A light and engaging read, Psmith is truly a delightful character created by PG Wodehouse. Filled with beautiful prose and incredible wit, this book has to be one of Wodehouse's best.

Why it has been published with such a small and difficult print? I have been searching Amazon to try a find a used version in large print and to no avail. Even if it could be in a regular pica size print would help. But we have to put up with a bit size print version that is smaller than elite and really very hard on the eyes.

But i can't bring myself to give this book five stars. Why ?Well, Lord Emsworth is a favourite character of mine, and Blandings is the setting for many a well-loved tale. The introduction of Psmith, another big favourite, raised my expectations, perhaps a bit too much.Basically, even though it was a light, breezy read, it didn't make me laugh aloud too many times, which is unusual for a Wodehouse novel.If you're new to Wodehouse or Emsworth/Psmith, i'd suggest you try 'Summer Lightning' for an introduction to Lord Emsworth (and the great 'Uncle Fred'), and 'Psmith in the city' for Psmith.If you're a fan, chances are you'll lap this up anyways ......"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"\\"Leave It to Psmith\\" was originally published in the U.K. on November 30, 1923 by Herbert Jenkins, and in the U.S on March 14, 1924 by George H. Doran. The edition I am reviewing is from \\"The Everyman Wodehouse\\" series published by Everyman's Library in the U.K., and for those in the U.S., you may be able to find the equivalent quality in \\"The Collector's Wodehouse\\" series which is being published by Overlook Press.I did not have high expectations for this book, because I didn't think \\"Psmith in The City\\" was very good, but Wodehouse's writing clearly improved greatly over those 13 years, and the merging of the Psmith character with the cast at Blandings Castle was great chemistry. The character of Ronald Eustace Psmith (formerly known as Rupert Psmith and in both cases the P is silent), was much more interesting in this book than I found him before. He fits right in with the other Blandings characters such as Lord Emsworth, Freddie Threepwood, and a great foil for Rupert Baxter.In this story, we have a diverse set of characters, all converging on Blandings Castle, and more than a few with the idea of stealing Lady Constance's necklace. Their motives are rather diverse, but whether they want it for money, freedom, or love, there is no shortage of people out to get it. As one would expect in any Wodehouse story, there is a fair amount of assumed identities and amazing coincidences which drive the story forward. Psmith, himself takes on the identity of Mr. Ralston McTodd, a poet from Canada in his pursuit of the beautiful Eve Halliday. The best part of the book, in my opinion, is the flower pot scenes, which is some of the funniest writing I have read in a long time.As the second of the Blandings Castle novels, and the last of the Psmith novels, this was a great improvement on both of those series. The Blandings series would continue to grow from this point, and there are many more great stories in that series. I do not believe the character of Psmith appears again in any of Wodehouse's stories, but the fully developed Psmith that appears in this work does foreshadow such characters as Jeeves and Uncle Fred. If you didn't care for Psmith in the previous works, you may still want to give this one a try. This is Wodehouse at his best."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"My review is not about the contents of the book but the specific properties of Amazon's Kindle edition of this book.

First, it is not the best Wodehouse book, but its up there. I doubt I'm the first to recognize or point out this flaw, but its worth going over it again, I think, since I just read this for the first time.Anyway, the scene when the Efficient Baxter is throwing flower-pots up at Lord Emsworth's window contains a couple of passages that are factually inconsistent with the story. After Lord Emsworth wakes Psmith up at 4 a.m. to help him deal with Baxter's apparent madness, the narrator explains to us that this is the first time Psmith has seen 4 a.m. in several years. Yet, a hundred pages or so earlier, Psmith told us how he used to rise every morning at 4 a.m. for his fish job, which he only very recently quit. Even geniuses like Wodehouse can make mistakes - this is the first one I've come across. Or have I overlooked something?"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"If you own 10 Wodehouse books, this should be one of them. For years I have been a huge fan of the farcical Bertie & Jeeves stories. This book also throws some romance and a touch of mystery into the brew. Be careful that you are not in public or that you are not in the middle of having a drink when you reach page 198, because I am warning you - you will erupt into a fit of freakish laughter which probably won't subside for another 5 or 10 minutes, with intermittent relapses thereafter.The eccentric and congenially self-absorbed Wodehousian hero of this novel is Psmith - pronounced with a silent P as in Ptarmigan (he finds that his birth name, Smith, is just too boring). Although he holds a membership to London's six most exclusive clubs and never a wrinkle or misplaced crease did find its way into his impeccable attire, he finds himself in dire financial straits. To make it worse, while lounging in the smoking-room window of the Drones Club, he instantly falls in love with a passing young dainty - but he has no idea how to introduce himself into her society.Yet there might be a solution to his problems through the ad for work-wanted that he recently placed in the Morning Globe. In the caption he expresses the sentiment that he will take on any job whatever (including assassinating Aunts) except for anything relating to fish. You have a problem? \\"Leave it to Psmith!\\"He ends up impersonating a well-known Canadian poet in order to introduce himself onto the guest list at beloved Blandings Castle, presided over by the eminent Lord Emsworth. While there he must steal a diamond necklace from under the tireless eye of The Efficient One - Emsworth's flower-pot-wielding secretary Baxter. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Leave It to Psmith (pronounced \\"Smith\\") is the first P.G. Wodehouse novel about Blandings Castle and its inmates, Clarence, ninth earl of Emsworth, his daunting sister, Lady Constance Keeble and Beach, the butler. Fans of later Blandings Castle tales will be a little puzzled by this one. Clarence is obsessed with flowers and gardening rather than pigs. The Empress of Blandings is nowhere in sight. And the main plot catalyst is Psmith, that remarkable public school character from the early Wodehouse novels, rather than Galahad Threepwood or Uncle Fred.Although this is not the best of the Blandings Castle tales, it has one of the best plots and does an effective job of introducing the ongoing characters and jokes. The interrelationships of the characters in the past and present are remarkable for their complexity and present lots of deja vu scenes.Psmith and Clarence are two of Wodehouse's finest creations and the central joy of this book is found in their extended interactions.As usual, love and money are at the bottom of the plot. Psmith cannot bear to be in the fish business any longer and advertises that he will do anything -- even commit a crime -- to get a change of pace. Clarence's son, Freddie Threepwood, contacts Psmith and asks him to help with an inside-the-family theft of his aunt's necklace. Although his uncle is rolling in the stuff, Lady Constance keeps him on a short leash. Freddie's uncle will give her another necklace like the one that's \\"stolen\\" and use the money to help Freddie and his uncle's step-daughter Phyllis. Freddie needs the money to attract a bride and Phyllis needs to help her new husband get a start on life.Like the other Blandings Castle stories, the castle is full of imposters. Psmith himself is posing as a poet, but is constantly being unmasked by those who choose to keep his secret for a time.Complications come when Psmith finds himself falling in love with a young woman whom he spies outside the Drones Club needing an umbrella. The young woman turns out to be on her way to Blandings Castle as well. It also turns out that Freddie has been proposing to her, but hasn't worn her down yet. Who will win the fair maiden?The book has some of the funniest scenes in it that you can imagine involving flower pots. It's an inspired beginning to the many jokes that follow in later books about potty people residing at Blandings Castle.Capital. Capital.

This story sees Psmith enter into Blandings Castle, and though Lord Emsworth is not the dominant character he later becomes, flashes of brilliance are visible in his appearances (and in those of Lady Constance, who plays an important role in this book).&quot;Leave it to Psmith&quot; is packed full of witty dialogue, readily suited to Psmith's character, and the traditional Wodehouse farce for the plot (misunderstandings, a stolen necklace, and so forth). The ending is predictable, of course, but this is hardly the point. It is the use of language that makes this such an enjoyable tale. Wodehouse connoisseurs all have their own favourite phrases, or particular sections of books that strike them as humorous from the prolific collection of Wodehouse's works. Suffice to say, several of my personal favourite sections appear in this book - Psmith at the employment agency, or describing his career as a fishmonger spring to mind. Those who enjoy the Blandings or Jeeves and Wooster series would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Written at the request of his daughter Leonora, this is the best and most popular book by the prolific P.G. Wodehouse. Psmith was his greatest creation, and if you've read the other three Psmith books first (and you should), it's very touching and funny to see him fall in love and make the ultimate sacrifice: masquerading as a sensitive poet and a jewel thief all at once. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"In a world congested to overflowing with books, _Leave It to Psmith_ stands alone.My only complaint is Sheed's introduction--how can you bash the author of the book you're introducing?? I suppose it is higher literary criticism, but its effect on me was to make me feel like I'm reading trash only consumed by the undiscriminating public. \\"Nobody ever struggled harder to suppress his genius in the interests of amiable tripe. . . . Wodehouse wrote first and last for money. If he finally became a sort of artist, it was only because it paid to,\\" etc., etc. It's really too much. Couldn't Random House find someone better to introduce the book?"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"It's real hard to actually say whether a particular Wodehousian novel is better than any other, but this one really takes the cake (and eats it too!) A marvellous story of the mayhem, chaos and utter confusion wreaked by the suave, amiable Psmith, this book leaves you gasping for more (even if you don't smoke a gasper). For Wodehousian fans, if you haven't read this one, well, what on earth have you been doing all these years!?! And for people who have no idea who or what or when a Wodehouse is, there's no better place to start than this bundle of craziness."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"From the moment when Psmith disappears into the Senior Conservative Club to steal an umbrella for Eve Halliday - a beautifully understated comic scene - the reader is launched into a story that should be compulsory reading for anyone with even a passing interest in Wodehouse. An exquisite combination of romance and farce in which that most debonair of Wodehousian heroes finally falls in love. It has been argued that an impecunious Psmith is a mere shadow of his former self but I couldn't disagree more strongly. Penury only makes searingly obvious what the true Psmith afficianado has always known: that Psmith is never more magnificent than when confronted with adversity."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"PSMITH! The darker side of Wodehouse which is, if anything, even more hilarious than the sunny side of the street.Psmith (said to be modeled after Rupert D'Oly Carte who was known to Wodehouse in their earliest years) has a ginger beer wire monocle, a silent &quot;P&quot; in his name, an optimistic and energetic approach to life, including practical socialism (what's yours is mine) and big broad flexible outlook as well as ears that stick out like windmills.One of the great Wodehouse lines that comes to mind often is from this book. Psmith explains to the long-suffering narrator friend that the most recent creditor seeking vengeance after yet another great Psmithian disaster will be unlikely to find him, since Psmith gave him a false name. When the narrator, aghast, asks why, Psmith insouciantly explains, &quot;Ordinary business precaution&quot;.If you've loved Bertie and Jeeves, meet Psmith!I wish Mr. Wodehouse had steered him in the direction of the Wooster household just so we could see just how elaborate a scrape he could draw Bertie into, and how Jeeves would have prestidigitated his way out of it"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Wodehouse has surpassed himself with this one.

It was recommended to me by a friend who had decribed it to me as \\"English humor.\\" I took it rather hesitatingly, but as soon as I was finished with the first page I was hooked. Even for a college student, this book is laugh-out-loud hilarious. I rarely read more then a page without having to stop reading because I was laughing so hard!

I really wanted to read more about him when I finished this book ."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Far and away P.G. Wodehouse's funniest Blandings Castle story. (It might even be considered his funniest overall, even better than &#34;Joy (Jeeves) in the Morning&#34;, usually considered Wodehouse's best. The flower pot episode will have you crying with mirth."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"and one of the most enjoyable. This book was the third Wodehouse book that I read, and I have now plowed through another four. It is easily my favorite. It seamlessly blends together one of the most hilarious characters ever created (one Ronald Eustace Psmith) and one of Wodehouse's greatest settings (the delightfully bumbling Blandings castle). The three chapters on flower pots had me rolling in a way that no other book has managed.One recommendation: though Wodehouse's books do not need to be read in order, I suggest reading Mike and Psmith (the first Psmith book) before reading this one. Some of Psmith's affectations are even funnier when you know that they are unchanged from when he was a boy.Finally, these editions are really gorgeous. Well worth the extra couple of bucks you have to spend."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Leave It To Psmith is probably my favorite Wodehouse book. I think it's one of the first I read after the Jeeves and Wooster stories. There are so many delightful scenes: Baxter descending the staircase, the flower pot tossing, the dead bats scene. . . Psmith is such a fun character. Don't you wish you could handle the unexpected as beautifully as he does?It may sound weird, but I like to listen to the book just as much as I like reading it--even concurrently. (I finished the tapes a few days ago, but am still reading the book.) The interesting thing is that there are certain sentences whose funniness I miss when reading that I pick up on while listening. Listening to Wodehouse doesn't take much concentration, so it's a nice break from music while quilting.My other favorite Wodehouse book is The Catnappers (AKA Aunts Aren't Gentlemen). It took me awhile to figure out why that was my other favorite. Then I realized it is because I enjoyed Frederick Davidson's reading of it. He is my favorite Wodehouse performer. (Unfortunately he reads for Blackstone audio and their recordings are the most expensive!)In Leave It To Psmith Davidson delivers another nearly flawless performance. (The only flaw I found was when he inserted a word that didn't belong. It was a common grammatical error that I was sure Wodehouse wouldn't make. I checked and I was right. [For the curious, the mistake was something like \\"as best as I can tell\\" when it should be \\"as best I can tell.\\"]) To perform Wodehouse with the proper inflections and pauses, as well as a number of different voices, is challenging. I've tried reading it aloud to myself and I am a disappointment. Davidson handles it so smoothly, and, if not just as Wodehouse would have wished, certainly exactly as I could wish."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Before reading this, I'd read a few of Wodehouse's non-Jeeves and Wooster novels, but I always thought they didn't quite measure up to the sheer wonderfulness that Wodehouse is capable of. I was wrong. Psmith is as good a character as J&W combined, and his dialogue is as good as anything else I've read in Wodehouse."},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Psmith is clever, witty, dashing, and determined to rise above present circumstance. In short, everything one could want in a Wodehouse hero. The dialogue is scintillating, the action is non-stop, and it all leads to an uproariously mad-cap, hilarious climax with myriad story-lines and characters colliding every which way before reaching a satisfying resolution. Wodehouse is thoroughly accessible to the modern reader. I had to remind myself part way through that it was publish early last century! If you know the author, you will find familiar territory here. If you are new to him, \\"Leave it to Psmith\\" is a delectable entry to the world of Wodehouse. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Fed up with the fish trade, eccentric good guy, Ronald Psmith is keen on a career change. To facilitate this urge, he takes out a classified add offering a rather ambitious range of services:\\"Leave it to Psmith. Psmith will help you. Psmith is ready for anything. Do you want: Someone to manage your affairs. Someone to handle your business. Someone to take your dog for a run. Someone to assassinate your aunt. Psmith will do it. Crime not objected to. Whatever job you have to offer. Provided it has nothing to do with fish. Leave it to Psmith. Address applications to R. Psmith Box 365. Leave it to Psmith.\\"Not surprising the advert catches the attention of Freddie Threepwood who, as it happens, requires help stealing a pricey necklace from his aunt (all for a good cause). The job will take all the cunning and strategery Psmith can muster. Plus, if he's lucky he might be able to win the girl too...In researching this review, we discovered that Leave it to Psmith is actually the 4th book in the Psmith series - another shining example of information that would have been nice to know a few weeks ago. Fortunately, this novel was perfectly satisfactory on its own. The character of Psmith is likeable from the beginning and we found ourselves anxious to find out what he was going to say or do next. And then there was oft imprudent, Freddie Threepwood, who provided the perfect balance. Why do the names Bertie and Jeeves suddenly come to mind???The treat of any Wodehouse novel is found in the dialogue. There's probably an intelligent term for his writing method, but he has a way of striking right at the core of our funny bone (minus the tingly numb sensation). We love everything from expressions like, \\"dash it\\" and \\"right ho\\" to the more complex humor, like how Lord Emsworth reacts to the flowerpot scene.Overall, Leave it to Psmith was brilliant novel and classic literature at its funniest (or at least funnier).

Psmithis pronounced with a silent P, and he does havean optimistic and energetic outlook towards life,but there the accuracy ends. Psmith does notwear a ginger beer wire monocle - nor do his earsstick out like windmills - the gentleman (and I use theterm loosely) who fits that description is Ukridge,a completely different character who appears nowherein the novel Leave it to Psmith. Psmith, by theway, does wear a monocle, but not one made of gingerbeer wire - his costume, like his repartee, is at all timesflawless. Thank you.

Take one rich, upperclass British family; one weepy, married stepdaughter seeking a handout from the old folks; one stubborn stepmother who refuses to provide the money because the stepdaughter didn't follow her advice on choosing a husband; one sympathetic but henpecked stepfather who wants to give the girl the money but is terrified of the wrath of his wife; one plot to nick the stepmother's expensive necklace to finance the said bestowal; one out-of-work Psmith who is willing to do anything not involving fish; and eight coincidences so improbable that if they happened in real life even the most ardent advocate of Darwin's theory would be convinced that the universe is indeed controlled by an intelligent (but highly mischievous) designer. Mix these ingredients together, bring them to a boil, and you get one of the most madcap adventures in Wodehouse's entire portfolio.This novel, like most of Wodehouse's works, skewers the foibles of the British upperclass--and this is much more fun than Americans might expect. Don't expect to learn any virtues from this book, however. There is not one iota (nor any other Greek letter I could discover) of a Moral in Leave It to Psmith. There are only giggles and grins, guffaws, chortles, titters, and an occasional appreciative smirk; and Wodehouse's understated style, as always, leaves the humour wry and dry.Recommended"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"Where to begin trying to explain the comic genius of Pelham Grenville? Leave it to Psmith is a perfect example of the humor genre. It is light, bright, clean, unobjectionable (unless you adore fish), and even more importantly- hysterically, bone achingly funny.The tale covers of the triumphs and travails of genial, bemonocled, and decidedly socialistic Psmith. (The P is silent as in ptarmigan, psoriasis, and psychiatrist.) Laugh as Psmith woos the young herione, lobs flowerpots at his host, and generally runs nonchalantly amok until he heroically saves the day. A must read for anyone who loves to laugh!"},{"Title":"LEAVE IT TO PSMITH","review":"If you like Wodehouse you will probably enjoy Saki too.The forward in the book was of interest, especially after just finishing Byron who Sheed claims created an anti-artist movement in England due the general disfavor Byron had among much of the public. Gilbert and Sulivan as well as Wodehouse, among others, are the resultant anti-artist artists. School Masters throughout England were on guard to make sure they did not produce another Shelly or Byron, drowning would be pretenders to the thrown in ridicule and derision. The likes of Wodehouse, not Flauberts, were the result according to Sheed, who introduced the book.I laughed hardily some four times, chuckled some six times, felt soporific inducement twice, phantom retching feelings thrice. The plot's believability qualifies for the realm of sci-fi. Wodehouse creates a world of unique language and sophomoric hijinks, his anti-hero has a manner of speaking to everyone as if they were an affable child, without condescension, but with a co-conspirital flavor that is approving and jocund -- possibly Wodehouse's greatest quality. The book could be shorter, by some 50 pages, some jokes and jovial flavors of feeling were wrung out for everything they were worth."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This was my second Dennis Lehane novel, the first being Mystic River.It was a good book -- well written, good description, good character development. I thought at times the dialogue was a bit corny, and the middle of the story begins to drag a little. The revealing moment at the end -- who the killer is -- is only sub-par, and kind of transparent from the very beginning.One thing I'd seen other people say: the scene where Patrick Kenzie visits Alec Hardiman in jail... it was way too similar to Silence of the Lambs, from the scenary to the dialogue to the overall voice of Alec (it was a Hannibal Lecter rip). Anyway, it's a solid read, and I'll continue to read more Lehane novels. Just don't expect to be blown away."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This was my first Dennis Lehane book, and I have to say I am impressed and loved it.

One caution; don't leave it laying around for non-adults to read as it is morally complex, graphic and certainly a scary read.After reading about 130 pages I was thinking where is the gory stuff that I have heard about. Don't worry it is about here that the serial killings surface and then hang on as you turn page after page. The characters are vivid and you can feel their emotions, the highs and the lows.

I'm not giving up, though."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I really loved A Drink Before the War, but was very disappointed in this one. In fact, it was so depressing, I lost interest and never finished it. It's ok when things go bad once and awhile, but constantly, is too depressing a read to hold my interest.

Patrick, sees himself as happy for the first time in years (he loves his life, Grace and her little girl). So he seems to have the best of both world's working along side one his best childhood friends, Angie, who appears to have finally come to grips with her x husband (Patrick's former best friend). Once again, Lehane manages to intertwine the lives of almost everyone involved (and their parents) in a story that starts out like a locked room murder. How could a man who has been in jail for twenty years, and locked up in one of the toughest prisons in Massachusetts, manage to commit murder? For the murders don't look like the work of a copy cat but of the original perpertrator(s). Aye, but their's the rub. Best of all, from my point of view, things come to a denoument where it is hard to contemplate that anyone could live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is my third Lehane book, and I continue to be astounded each time I read him.Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro take on the case of a shrink who believes her son is being threatened by an Irish street gang. But it becomes clear that this has nothing to do with gangs, but everything to do with an extremely violent serial killer. What's even more frightening is that this killer has targeted Patrick and Angie, and their respective loved ones. Worst of all, the killer has some connection to their childhood that Patrick doesn't begin to understand, and the killer may not be working alone.Lehane's strength is that he doesn't make it easy to make moral pronouncements. The characters act and react based on needs and emotion (often rage)--they don't have the luxury of always doing the moral thing as prescribed by society. But, Patrick and Angie are still beautifully human and wonderfully sympathetic, even as they do the &quot;wrong&quot; thing, for both the right and the wrong reasons. They really want to be good people, but know they aren't quite there. At the core of there relationship is a fraternal love that never quite moves away from it's less platonic overtones.Lehane beautifully blends exciting action with suspense and meditations on the human condition. This isn't a nice world that our heroes live in. It's an ugly, violent world, where unfortunately, they help perpetuate that violence. Lehane makes you keep turning the page, even though you know bad things are probably going to happen. I am looking forward to reading the rest in the series, as well as Shutter Island."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"&quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; is Dennis Lehane's second Kenzie and Gennaro novel. The story starts simply, as the detectives undertake to help protect Jason, the son of a friend. For no clear reason, it appears that a singularly unpleasant gangster has taken a dislike to Jason, a student at the local college. Matters grow complicated quickly when they discover that the gangster in question is not the real source of the threat.In trying to unravel each mystery in this, the detectives discover yet another. The case appears linked to a string of horrifying killings that have baffled the police. And these crimes recall the bloody work of Alec Hardiman, who was convicted 20 years previously by the expert testimony of Jason's mother. Unfortunately, this criminal remains firmly imprisoned. The is little doubt that somehow Hardiman is influencing events, but evidence builds that there is a team of killers at work and the body count spins out of control.The horror and tension build relentlessly. Soon Patrick Kenzie realizes that his own loved ones are also intended victims. Together, he and Gennaro struggle to salvage what they can. In the final analysis, though, none of the survivors will escape unscathed. This is noir fiction at it's grimmest, delivered with spellbinding intensity by an exceptional writer.The book is populated by vivid characters, good and evil. The narrative is terse, and perfect for this kind of fiction. The dialogue between Kenzie and Gennaro sparkles with wry wit that keeps events from overwhelming the reader. I picked up the &quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; to read as a break from some more academic reading, and was literally unable to keep from finishing the book. Lehane's writing style is reminiscent of Andrew Vachss and every bit as good. This is a six star novel in a five star world!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"In the last 30 day I\`ve read all five of Lehane' Kinzie/Gennaro books, finishing Prayers for Rain last night. Lehane has created a terrific franchise in the mystery/thriller arena with his realistic and (more importantly) entertaining pair of detectives. You like these people he's created and believe their motives for what they choose to do as they trek through the plot. Clearly I've found a lot of compelling entertainment in these stories.The first book in the series, A Drink Before the War, really sucked me in, being in the same vein as the Elvis Cole series by Robert Crais which I also recommend. Both series are consistently well-written, a clear step (or two) above pop/trash/beach fiction, funny, intelligent stories where the plot make sense, and the characters seem frighteningly real. It turned out that the first Kinzie/Gennaro yarn was the lightest. Each one after has ratcheted up the twists and turns, but kept the personality of the characters growing and building. The stories definitely got blacker and bleaker in the depraved actions of the bad guys. By Prayers for Rain, the villain is a hardcore-fulltime psychopath, and Patrick and Angie are a-little-further-than-borderline vigilantes.After racing through five of the books in so short a period, I am struck with a sense of vulnerability. If some bad dude makes it their career to mess with you, and if they have no normal limits to their behavior, you're just screwed. How can a normal, follow the rules type of citizen even comprehend the introduction of aggression and violence into their regular lives? Unless you have friends to help you out like Kenzie and Gennaro you might as well move out of the country and hope you're never found. Read these, you'll like them."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"\\"A drink before the war\\" was a really good surprise. From the beginning I liked Kenzie, Gennaro and the way they relate to each other. But, compared to \\"Darkness, take my hand\\", the first book in the series looks like a mere introduction.\\"Darkness, take my hand\\" is dark, complex and violent. Extremely violent. But Lehane makes it seem also very real, because he writes about Boston and its suburbs with a passion that only a caring native of the city could feel. This time is not a war between gangs. This time Kenzie and Gennaro are hired to investigate, follow and protect the son of a friend. During the case, they find that the truth is much more complex than they can possibly imagine, involving their family past and the ones they presently love.Lehane is very graphic in his descriptions, and that is saying much. He is not afraid to dare. There are many scenes in this book that are not that believable, but they are so strong and powerful that the effect is great. The characters continue to be developed. Lehane did not give everything away in the first book. In \\"Darkness, take my hand\\" he reveals further information about not only Kenzie and Angie, but also about his recurrent secondary characters, like Bubba and Boston PD detectives Oscar Lee and Devlin Amronklin, among others.The Kenzie / Gennaro's two books I've read in the series are really great. Lehane's stories unravel the worst about human nature. They are as explicit as can be, and that makes them real, whether we like ir or not.Grade 9.2/10"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Darkness, Take My Hand is no lightweight crime novel. It is tense, emotionally draining and frightening. Detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are put through so much mental and physical punishment that at times the book is hard to read because it is so unrelenting. The villains are extremely bad and some of the murders that are committed are horrific.The characters and their relationships really make this book. Patrick and Angela are so likeable, despite all the rubbish in their lives and their messed up pasts. To a certain extent they have the most dysfunctional lives I have ever read about. Both of them are divorced (Angie from a wife beater and Patrick from Angie?s sister), both of them are in love with each other but aren?t prepared to show it, both of them use commonplace sex as a replacement for other things in their lives, and so on. Their relationship is further complicated by a new love in Patrick?s life ? Grace and her young daughter Mae. As in the first novel in this series, the parts where Patrick looks back to his childhood and thinks about his father and his and Angie?s relationship back then were especially poignant and had me in tears.The plot for this book was rather too gruesome and scary for me. There were too many horrible murders and threatening characters. A lot of the events that happened were tragic and made me feel quite depressed. Put it this way, I don?t think I?ll feel up to reading the next novel in the series for at least a month or two. I need time to recuperate first!Overall this is a good thriller which is fast paced and emotional. I recommend it to those who can stand violence and gruesome murders because these take up a large part of the book. The highlight for me was the relationship between Patrick and Angie ? I wanted to force them to get together. Still, maybe it will happen for them in the third book in the series?JoAnne"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This was my first Lehane book (I have since read the rest) and I fell in love with him, the story and the characters. I am a fan of realistic, gritty neighborhood stories be they in Boston or New York or New Orleans or wherever. The relationship between Gennaro and Kinzie is utterly believable (and I have had a problem in the past with male authors writing in a woman's voice)and realistic. Be forewarned: this book is darker than the others in his series, especially the subsequent ones. It is scary, morally complex, and graphic. It is also filled with a wonderful cast of characters from Gennaro and Kinzie's neighborhood, especially &quot;Bubba&quot;. Those who have never read Lehane but enjoy a gritty neighborhood thriller, wait no longer."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Dennis Lehane has done something here no mystery writer has done in a long, long time. He scared the hell out of me! I enjoyed his first book (&quot;A Drink Before the War&quot;) very much, and was looking forward to reading this, his second. I got more than I bargained for in almost every sense of the word. An intricate, complex plot, which amazingly ties up logically at the very end. Twists and turns to surprise even the most jaded mystery buff, who is sure s/he can always see them coming. Not this time, you can't! You might figure out one or two, but don't get smug. Lehane will take your perceptions, turn them upside down, and just when you think you've got your feet on the ground, he'll do it again. I should have read this one in broad daylight. It is most aptly titled: darkness takes the hand of the reader and leads us all into a labyrinth of corruption, terror and revenge.I read a lot of books, and Lehane's Kenzie/Gennaro series have earned my ultimate accolade: I'm not waiting for his titles to come out in paperback! The hard cover first editions of his first two novels are already selling for $50; two weeks ago, they were selling for $35. He has joined the ranks of the very best, and the collectors are valuing him accordingly."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Darkness, take My hand by Dennis Lehane William Morrow and Company. 1996When the PI team of Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro are called to investigate a threat to Jason, the son of a noted psychiatrist, Diandra Warren, they find some strange coincidences. &quot;Moira Kenzie&quot; told Diandra that Kevin Hurlihy, a crazy local hood and her former boyfriend, had threatened to kill her present boyfriend Jason. However when Patrick and Angie check out the local hoods Kevin seems not to be involved but they find that ties run back to their old neighborhood and some of the people they grew up with.Digging deeper they find that the trail leads to a convicted serial killer and back again to their old neighborhood. They story begins to make sense and wind down when it leads to someone who was a partner of the serial killer and likely one of two present day neighborhood men and an incident that happened when Patrick was a child.The book is well written, exciting and a real page-turner. Patrick and Angie are well developed and sympathetic characters. Patrick's relationship with Grace and her young daughter is filled with angst when his problems and life infect theirs and make a continuing relationship appear improbable.I picked up the book when I heard an interview with Dennis Lehane on television and he said that Stephen King loved his books and helped him (Stephen) get through his recent recovery period after his accident. I was not disappointed and would highly recommend this book to all mystery fans."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I struggled with how to rate this book. While I kept turning the pages, the excessive gore really left me with a very bad feeling about this book and the author. Which doesn't mean that it's a bad book. It simply is not the kind of book I prefer to read. I was already skeptical after reading the first book in the series (A Drink Before the War) but decided to give Lehane a second chance. After all, this book was included in the Independent Mystery Bookseller's list of the top 100 books of the 20th Century. This will probably be the end of the line for Lehane in my reading list.In addition to the gore, I simply don't find myself liking Patrick and Angie very much. Patrick seems to have a pretty shallow notion of love. Lehane still hasn't given me enough insight into Angie to get a sense of what's there to like. There are so many mystery series protagonists that I would love to spend time with, it seems silly to invest anymore time in these two.Bottom-line: Probably a pretty good read for those with a high tolerance for(or interest in) dismembered bodies and the like. As for me, I'm going to track down some nice cozies where the drama is more mental."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"When a second book tops the first, you know you've found a good writer.The phrase, &quot;I couldn't put it down&quot; is applicable here. Patrick and Angie find themselves face to face with a serial killer loose in Boston. I was so tense reading this that at one point the phone ringing almost had me jump out of my skin. Lehane captures the simple rhythms and nuances of dialogue better than almost any writer I've read. You can't help fall in love with these characters. If you haven't read anything by him,I'd suggest starting with &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot; because it sets up the world the tough Irish Boston P.I.'s inhabit. This is not your fathers mystery novel. It's really violent, gory, and you never are sure who will make it to the end. But it's really well written, has some great plot twists, and will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Boy, can Dennis Lehane craft a story! DARKNESS, TAKE MY HAND is the second in the Kenzie/Gennaro series, and it certainly does not disappoint! It is a fast-paced thriller that leaves you sorry that you have to put it down for something as trivial as eating or sleeping. As Patrick and Angie unravel clues, Patrick's past with his violent father and with Angie and Renee, his ex-wife, becomes clearer to the reader. Lehane is the most exciting and hip writer to come along in some time, and I wish him a long career. More Kenzie and Gennaro, Please!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I've never really had a favorite author until now. Dennis Lehane grabbed my attention with his first few words in Darkness take my Hand and I was hooked! I figured this book was a one time masterpiece. Absolutely not! All of his books are incredible! But this one, this one is my favorite. It was so creepy and evil, yet even when I was scared to death, Patrick &quot;Don't call me Pat&quot; Kenzie said or thought something that had me laughing. It amazes me how Dennis Lehane does this and makes it all work so beautifully. And, you'll love the main characters,Patrick and Angela, as well as the side characters Bubba, Oscar and Devin. You won't be able to stop reading. Bubba. He's the man. You've gotta love him. I've never had the desire to meet a psychopath, but I would love to meet Bubba. If you like his character, there's lots more of him in Prayers for Rain. Read it! Read them all! I guarantee you won't go away disappointed and you'll wait impatiently for the next book to come out. Mr. Lehane, you've got amazing talent. You're the best and I'm a fan for life."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"After reading A Drink Before the War a few weeks ago, I quickly ordered all of Dennis Lehane's other books so that I could read them chronologically without having to wait in between books. Darkness, Take My Hand is, without doubt, one of the finest suspense novels I have ever read-and I've read a lot! Patrick and Angie feel like friends to me now, and the horror they are faced with during the course of this novel was almost unbearable. Most novels have &quot;stick-man&quot; villains that I feel never really pose any real threat to the heroes. Not so here. The bad guys here are REALLY bad guys. Kudos to Lehane! What a craftsman. I'm almost done with Sacred now, Dennis, so write faster!!!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"As others have stated, this book is the work of a true WRITER, not just a pop-novelist. Lehane succeeds on every level in this book: violence, love, comedy, friendship, you name it. I read a lot of books and Lehane's right now are the best to me. Try it and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"After reading the first novel, A Drink Before War I thought I just found My new favorite author. After finishing Darkness.. I was sure! It was amazing!!!!!I finished it in two days and now I'm going to buy all the rest of the books. The story line,the characters. It's all awesome!I could not put this book down. If you want to read a great author this is the one. Kudos to you DL!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"If you have never read Lehane this book is where you need to start. This is the best serial killer book I have ever read. By using the addition of more killers than one Lehane keeps you guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I have read all of Dennis Lehane's books. I started with &quot;Sacred&quot; and read backwards. This is one of the best books of this kind that I have ever read. You felt drawn in with the characters. It was a very scary feeling. Patrick and Angie are great together and their supporting charaters are just as good. I recommend all of Mr. Lehane's books and I cannot wait for his new release in June!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Great characters. Terrific plot. Marvelous prose. Don't miss this one"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"What a book. There are so many superlatives I could use, but I suppose that excellent and haunting are the best. I read this book over a year ago and whenever I notice it on my bookshelf it still gives me the chills. I've also enjoyed Lehane's other three books, but this one is the best. Read it!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I read this one first, and the rest is history. Dialogue that rivals Elmore Leonard and characters that are the type you follow throughout--you will wait for the next one to be written. A little like Bill Granger, i.e. plots with twists and lots of action when you least expect it. An excellent read, as are the other two (paperbacks) in this series."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is the first novel by Lehane that I've read, and it's one of the best novels I've read this year. A solid thriller (though, be warned, not for the squeamish) about murder, a serial killer, two Boston private eyes, and the past histories that tie it all together, is wonderfully written. You feel what these characters feel; their pain, their memories, their longings...Lehane is a writer to watch, and I'll be seeking out the rest of the novels in this series! Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane writes well. Characters are developed well enough you can picture yourself meeting them. He does this without long intrusive narrative so I cannot fault his skill. The mystery is also a good plot.I don't care so much for the graphic brutality of his writing. Perhaps I'm squeamish. I think he could write just as good a story with a bit less of the gore."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Numerous dirtbags and sadists materialize in this thriller set in Boston and featuring P.I. heroes Pat Kenzie and Angie Gennaro. To say this is a slasher is an understatement; more like a dismantler. As the tension mounts and the villains launch brutality from all directions, it becomes doubtful that the P.I.'s will remain unscathed. Things are not as they seem, and as the bodies pile up, you can't be sure if Kenzie and Gennaro will join them or not.Read it and see; quite the rollercoaster!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Okay, I love Dennis Lehane novels. I just started this Kenzie Series of novels recently and this second book in the series was just as gripping and edge-of-your-seat as the first (A Drink Before the War). Both Patrick and Angela are back in this continuation and on another dangerous case in seedy Boston. They find themselves and their loved ones put directly into the path of danger because of their work and this adds a new dimension to the story, one that I really enjoyed.If I had any complaints, it would be that Lehane does go overboard in the grotesqueness of the crime department. It didn't need to be so graphically, even grossly, violent for the reader to understand just how bad the bad guys are here. I'm not squeamish by any means, but it felt gratuitous here nonetheless. Lehane's a good enough writer to convey badness without all the over the top crime scenes.It certainly won't stop me from continuing on in the series....in fact, I can't recall the last time a series of books engrossed me as much as these!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"If there's one overused plot device in crime fiction these days, it's that of the serial killer. And yet, every so often you read a book that takes that staple and does something remarkable with it, and Darkness, Take My Hand is one such book. As he typically does, Lehane starts the second Kenzie/Gennaro book simply enough, with the pair investigating a young man who is apparently being threatened by some local mobsters. But as usual, the case is far more complex than it first appears, gradually growing into a brutal dig into the very nature of evil itself. Lehane may use the serial killer trope, but few writers have ever taken the time to truly recreate the terror that would come from such a situation, to say nothing of the emotional devastation that such a figure could wreak. And that old chestnut about the killer being someone you know? Even that is given fresh life here, as Lehane shows his characters still grappling with the impact of such a revelation. Darkness, Take My Hand is not an easy book. The violence is horrific, even monstrous, but as Kenzie himself remarks, it would be too easy to dismiss it as inhuman; it's all very recognizably human, which makes it all the more unsettling. And in true noir fashion, even our heroes aren't immune to the effects of all this darkness; by the book's end, Lehane has plunged deeply into the horrors at every person's heart, and his conclusion is all the more effective for its refusal to give easy answers. Perhaps Lehane's best book, Darkness, Take My Hand is not for the faint of heart. But those willing to look into its brutality may find an uncomfortable recognition of the violence it shows."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is Dennis Lehane's second outstanding novel and once again we're taken on a tour of the dark side of human behavior. Sometimes I even found myself rooting for the bad guy. But there is no question about it, if you're a reader of mystery, suspense or thriller books, you simply can't ignore Lehane.In this story Patrick and Angie come back from Lahane's hugely successful debut novelA Drink Before the War, and they're hired to shadow a college kid because his mother fears for his safety and the surveillance job quickly turns into a life and death situation for the duo.Bodies keep piling up. There's a link to a killer from the past, but it can't be him as he's still in jail. Patrick and Angie (who thankfully is shed of her abusive husband by now) have to make it through this case alive and it isn't going to be easy.One thing of note about this book, Lehane lets us get a hundred pages into the book before he introduces the serial killer, quite a refreshing difference than the usual opening of a brutal murder on page one seen though the killer's eyes. Lehane skillfully brings us along with his characters and we find out what's going on as they do. Great writing. Five stars, even though there was a little to much of the icky stuff for me, I still couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"need a looooooooong time to arrive in france but the book is perfect, the size of the book is very funny for me cause their aren't like that in france. now i just have to enjoy it"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"To start, I am not the avid reader type who just burns through books.

When I got my Kindle, back in March, I decided to see if there was a book version of the movie. Lo and behold, I discovered that Dennis Lehane was a fairly prolific author, and opted to read a book of his with which I was not familiar. It was a real page turner. I can't praise his skills highly enough. Great read!! Looking forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"So, I read the first installment of the Kenzie and Gennaro series, A Drink Before the War, a few months ago and gave it a glowing review (okay, not glowing, but it did get four stars each one deserved). However, I did give one complaint... I didn't think that the book was \\"dark\\" enough; I was just a bit underwhelmed by the actual case. Yeah well, be careful what you wish for because... Darkness, Take My Hand was way darker than I was expecting.This book was GRAPHIC (yes the caps and the exclamation point are needed to exemplify that)! I read more than a few reviews that were stating this, but when I was well under way into Darkness, Take My Hand, I thought \\"Well it's not too bad.\\" Of course, then something dark and graphic was described that not only disturbed me, but scared the crap out of me as well (something that makes me recall \\"The Exorcist\\", which still terrifies me). It just went downhill from there. I, however, do not have a problem with dark, graphic, gritty, and/or gore (the last one I can only deal with in book form, not in films), so that didn't dampen my enjoyment of the book at all. However, I'd be lying if I didn't say that it took me completely by surprise.I'm still absolutely in love with the characters. In Darkness, Take My Hand, Lehane delves more into Patrick's past including more about his father and more about his ex-wife (who's identity just made my jaw drop at how screwy everything is). We also get to know Angie a little more and we're shown exactly how many flaws both these characters have. It makes them more real and frankly, made me fall in love with them even more. Their banter (which I admit I absolutely adore and is the main reason for my enjoyment of this series) was still here in all of it's hilarious and aww-ing glory. We also have Bubba (who's loyalty is sweet albeit way disturbing) and almost all of the rest of the characters back in this installment and they're just basically wonderful. Patrick and Angie are surrounded by great friends who are amazing and colorful characters which make this book even better.Darkness, Take My Hand was definitely a great book. I loved it even more than A Drink Before the War. And all of Dennis Lehane's novels seem as if they're page-turners. I know I was clicking the Kindle at a frantic pace. So, highly recommended, but definitely not for the faint of heart or those who fear The Exorcist much more than I do (that one scene really traumatized me)."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I had the classic conflict that comes with reading a good book: Couldn't put it down and hated for it to end.

Which makes it so exciting to have come across Dennis Lehane's new Kenzie &amp; Gennaro series. The first novel was riveting. This one manages to be even more compelling. Lehane's characters stick to your guts. An excellent suspense thriller--but definitely NOT for the squeemish"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane has done a tough thing--improved on his great first mystery &quot;A Drink Before The War&quot;. This is a fast-moving, scary book. It peels of layers of people's personalities in ways that are both realistic and terrifying.There is a sociopathic killer loose in Dorchester, a Boston neighborhood--vicious, brilliant, and elusive. The killer is focused on wreaking vengeance on detectives Patrick Kenzie, Angie Genarro and several elementary schoold classmates. But why? There is no connection in the present."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lahane's skill with Boston atmosphere and some initially intriguing plot lines might keep you going for awhile.About halfway through he transcends the Noir, leaping into Slapstick Tragedy and Melodrama. Just as the depths of human degeneracy are excavated, Lahane discovers a new sub-floor, and it all becomes silly and repetitive very quickly. Predator Clowns cruising for kids in a van! Crucifixions! Who knew Boston was such a hot town? (Must be all that New England repression).The succession of psychopaths, Mafia mass murderers, cynical cops, and drunken wife beaters (and these are just the protagonists) owes as much to Quentin Tarentino and slasher films as Chandler, Cain and Hammett. But those writers were able to conjure up an existentialist context from their narratives, not slather it on like Lahane does in order to justify the bloodbath. He doesn't explore evil- he exploits it.To me, that's the most unsettling aspect of this book (and a lot of his other work) - the writer depicting the most incredible atrocities, rubbing it in the reader's face with an almost juvenile glee (\\"See how HORRIBLE this is?\\") and then expecting them to take the story's moral implications any more seriously than the ridiculous and derivative gross-out material it is. That IS pretty scary."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Let me just say this was a good story with very likeable characters, and writing that really puts you at the scene of the action.Patrick, Angie, Paul, Oscar, Devin, Patrick, Angie, Paul, Bubba and the villains are all very fun and well written. I actually liked the villians, but was very happy to see them go. And Lehane uses some thought provoking social commentary to create some depth for his leads. Nice.I like what Dennis Lehane is trying to do with his character's personal lives and professional flaws to make the story realistic and believable. It works pretty well, but I often had to forcefully put myself in Patrick Kensie's shoes to understand a situation or give reason for an error in judgment. The conversation with myself: 'Ok, now if I was Kensie and it was the middle of a night of pleasure that was just interrupted by a phone call, maybe I, forgetting that a genius killer has threatened or killed everybody in my circle of friends, would have unhesitatingly answered the front door at 2:00 in the morning.' Of course there is more to it than that, but I felt like I was a step or two ahead of the detective through out the book, \\"Dude, you better send somebody over to protect that kid\\". It felt like Lehane was creating suspense for the reader that the main character was oblivious to. It required effort from me to justify the detective's stupidit... um... perspective.Regardless, \`Darkness, Take My Hand' is a good, fun book."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],x={key:0},C={key:1};function H(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",P,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",C,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,E)):b("",!0)])}const D=u(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-3edd6e80"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/32.md","filePath":"glossary/32.md"}'),L={name:"glossary/32.md"},j=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{O as __pageData,j as default};
