The neatest thing is how amazingly applicable James' observations are in today's society. The book is fun and interesting to read. I learned a great deal."},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"Beginning in 1891, William James gave frequent lectures to teachers in which he explained the psychology he had developed in his \\"Principles of Psychology\\" and offered suggestions on applying the science of psychology to the art of education. Similarly, beginning in 1895, James delivered a series of lectures to college students -- generally at schools for women -- on education and its purposes. In 1899, James gathered both sets of lectures together and published them as \\"Talks to Teachers on Psychology and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals.\\" The book was read widely and became financially successful for James.In his illuminating recent biography of James, \\"William James in the Maelstrom of American Modernism\\", Robert Richardson describes the \\"Talks\\" as a whole as \\"written in what we may call William James's third style.\\" He explains: \\"The third style is his plainest, clearest, most public style. It is at once vivid, personal, comprehensible, and without a shred of condescension. It is best exemplified in 'Talks to Teachers'. The longer James worked over a subject, the simpler and shorter and more direct he made it\\". (p. 360)The two sets of lectures are complementary with the first set explaining to teachers how psychology could be of use in the educational process while the second set explains to the students the value of the educational opportunities presented to them. The \\"Talks to Teachers\\" begins with what many people at the time saw as a mechanistic psychology rooted in physiology and developed in light of Darwin's theory of evolution. In many places, James encourages teachers to see a pupil in part as \\"a subtle little piece of of machinery.\\" An effective means of education endeavors to work with rather than against the nervous system. In successive short chapters, James discusses his fundamental theory of the \\"stream of consciousness\\" and applies it to learned behavior through exploration of reactions, habits, association, attention and memory. The lectures are lucid and clear and show both flexibility and wisdom in considering the process of education.James's focus throughout is on education as an activity fitting the student for the conduct of life in a wide variety of situations rather than as means of learning intellectual abstractions. James stresses the importance of the body and of physical activity in the learning process. His psychology begins with science and mechanism but it does not end there. I would like to point out two of what I found to be among the insightful observations of the \\"Talks to Teachers.\\" First, in the chapter on \\"Memory\\", James points out that the psychological abilities of the mind must be taken together in an individual and that a person need not be \\"cast down\\" by deficiencies in any single element. James stresses passion and desire as critical in overcoming any mechanical difficulties. He writes: \\"You can be an artist without visual images, a reader without eyes, a mass of erudition with a bad elementary memory. In almost any subject your passion for the subject will save you. If you only care enough for a result you will almost certainly attain it.\\"The other passage in the \\"Talks to Teachers\\" I wish to single out is in the concluding chapter on \\"The Will\\". Here James allows Spinoza to have the last word. James points out that there are two ways in which people can make choices: by saying \\"no\\" to something or by saying \\"yes\\" to its contrary. James opts for the latter approach. James writes: \\"Spinoza long ago wrote in his Ethics that anything that a man can avoid under the notion that it is bad he may also avoid under the notion that something else is good. He who habitually acts sub specie mali, under the negative notion, the notion of the bad, is called a slave by Spinoza. To him who acts habitually under the notion of good he gives the name of freeman. See to it now, I beg you, that you make freement of your pupils by habituating them to act, whenever possible, under the notion of a good\\". This is wise advice, from both Spinoza and William James.The second part of the book consists of three wonderful addresses to students: \\"The Gospel of Relaxation\\", the seminal essay \\"On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings\\" and its companion essay \\"What Makes a Life Significant.\\" The first essay is a still timely corrective to the tendency of many Americans to stress and to wrongly-directed effort. But second and third of these essays are critical to James's work in its entirety. The \\"blindness\\" to which James refers is the difficulty every person has in knowing the mind of another and in properly and sympathetically valuing what the other person finds important and significant in life. As James states in his Preface to \\"Talks to Teachers\\": \\"The facts and worths of life need many cognizers to take them in. There is no point of view absolutely public and universal.\\" James develops this theme through the use of literary examples drawn from Robert Louis Stevenson, Whitman, Tolstoy, and many other writers.In the Preface to the \\"Talks to Teachers and Students\\" James also underscores the importance of the essay \\"On a Certain Blindness\\". This essay is James's most direct statement of the value of pluralism, individualism, and democracy. He writes: \\"The practical consequence of such a philosophy is the well-known democratic respect for the sacredness of individuality -- is, at any rate, the outward tolerance of whatever is not itself intolerant. ... Religiously and philosophically, our ancient national doctrine of live and let live may prove to have a far deeper meaning than our people now seem to imagine it it to possess.\\"This short and beautifully written collection of essays is an excellent non-technical introduction to the thought of William James.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"My father always had this book at arm's reach.It was a pocket version.I can still see the tip of its well worn appearance comfortably peeking out of his tweed coat side pocket.Even as a kid it really peaked my curiosity,as at that point I had never read a book,'a real book',just the hardy brothers,and all that kid stuff we all recall as children.It appeared to be one of his best friends,and that in itself fascinated me.I considered my father even when I was very young to be a friend,in my mind,'father'was just a moniker.I never mentioned it to him for years.I finally mustered up the courage to ask what this book was.He said \\"guides to living\\".Yes \\"this little book\\" is my best advisor and tutor.\\"It has comforted me on many an occasion\\"Years later when I adopted an avid love for books,I read these wonderful essays.I go back time and time again,seeking advise from it's pages for a variety of reasons.These essays by William James originally published in 1917 remain as fresh and applicable to modern life as if they were written last year.James,the father of Psychology pours his heart out to you in these essays.My favourites are THE GOSPEL OF RELAXATION- THE ENERGIES OF MAN-ON A CERTAIN BLINDNES IN HUMAN BEINGS-HABIT an THE WILL.This book always travels with me.I hope you have a chance to read it sometime.Here is a little taste.This is an excerpt from THE WILL\\"Our strength and our intellegence,our wealth,and even our good luck,are things which warm our heart,and make us feel ourselves a match for life.But deeper than all such things,and able to suffice onto without them is the sense of the amount of effort we can put forth...\\""},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"Amazing how insightful James was, and his ideas are.

Enter nosy neighbour, add a bad boy, throw them all into the same place at the same time and watch the fireworks. While the formula is a known one, it is F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing that makes the novel worth while. Please, please, please read this BEFORE you see the movie. It will no doubt be spectacular but all the more so with Fitzgerald's words swimming in your head."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"With the movie pending, this seemed like a good time to re-read a novel I haven't picked up in years. So long, in fact, that I can't remember my first impressions of it. So we're stuck here with my impressions from the re-read:Gatsby, you fool. You're smart enough to pull yourself out of poverty and desperation (albeit perhaps not in the most legal way, but one takes what one can get) and then waste it all on a silly girl? How are we supposed to feel any sympathy for that? My guess is that we're not.Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation, so we have to expect a lot of pointless stuff here. That's not to say it's not interesting - on the contrary, it's a regular soap opera: love affairs, cheating, lying, crime, rich people, etc and so on. He clearly disdained the idle rich and this novel showcases that. Yet as much as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy irritate (especially Daisy, as we never really get to know her at all), they also fascinate, something I believe Fitzgerald was disdainful of.The most fascinating character, in my opinion, is found in Myrtle Wilson, the poor wife of a garage-owner who longs to escape her existence. Although Fitzgerald devotes far more time to Daisy, it is Myrtle who is complex and compelling in every way. If nothing else, you should read the book just to get a glimpse of her.The book, of course, is a tragedy. Or is it? Tragic events certainly happen, but it is difficult to feel any sense of sorrow or compassion for them.With the movie coming out, I would suggest you read this one if you missed it during your primary education years. At only 160 pages or so, it's a short read and worth your time if only so you can poke fun at the inaccuracies/exaggerations in the upcoming movie and talk about what Fitzgerald himself would have thought of the production. ;)"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Great book, and the physical book itself was very high quality?

In fact, if Fitzgerald had written this book properly (no extra junk I could care less about) it would have been EXACTLY two sentences long- &quot;I'm rich.&quot; and &quot;Oh, boo hoo.&quot; The plot line resembles an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 (namely &quot;Let's sit around and whine about being rich.

This book is obviously more than just a boy meets girl who is married to another boy book, but it is not much more.

Fitzgerlad is too busy telling the story which happenes to be dull and unexciting at the most.The plot, the storyline, the story, and the execution of it is just poor. It's boring. It's futile. It's dumb. I fail to understand why Fitzgerald chose to use Nick, this incredibly dull and uninteresting character, as his narrator when he could have written it third person, or used a more interesting character for the narrator. Even the conversation and dialogue is quite useless. Take this for a sampler, \\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year...or wait a minute- it's ust the opposite- the sun's getting colder every year.\\" And this quote comes from nowhere and has to do with nothing.Gatsby was obviously drunk, or smoking marijuana when he was writing this book, and must have thougth that this book was pretty clever.

The Great Gatsby is certainly nothing I would have finished had it not been so short.My basic response to this book: It lacks depth of any significance. The descriptions are minimally imaginative, and never spark excitement. And the characters? The characterizations, the portrayal of the characters and their actions and emotions, are all simple and don't transmit any of the passion they are supposedly feeling. Supposedly, for example, the several main characters in the book, most notably Gatsby, have the Chalice of Life just at their fingertips, but are afraid to grasp it. But I got no feel for the inner anguish and turmoil and tortuous yearning that must arise from such fear and self-denial.In short, this book, while having a decent plot and overall structure, was boring, because the writing is boring.

So honestly, I unable to take any of their opinions of what they thought of the book into consideration, thusly I had to read it myself.When I first heard that my literature class and I had the opportunity to read The Great Gatsby, I had an open mind and frankly, I grew with such anticipation. The first few pages immediately begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, a rather timid man from the mid-west, who becomes quite interested into all the glamour and glitz of the New York, along with the wonder of his uncanny neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick is definitely not your average narrator. He generally judges all his surroundings by its cover, and basically has something to say about everything. And with Fitzgerald as the author, all that is being judged is extremely detailed as it can get. Some may say detail is good, but I say, too much detail can get others thrown off and indifferent toward the novel.As the novel progressed in content, I began to grow uninterested. I felt that I wasn't as into the novel like others had appeared to be, and my mindset toward the book wasn't quite as good as I hoped. To be honest, the novel's storyline wasn't half-bad; it was typical, a so-called \\"classic,\\" but nonetheless it was rather acceptable. Fitzgerald focuses on a plethora of different characters dealing with their lives of betrayal, love, and sometimes even death; doesn't that sound quite alluring?Charm is brought into this tragic tale as Fitzgerald adds his romantic side into play. He shows how one character loses his love and strives to regain his love back. It is certainly reasonably endearing, but it appears to show originality on Fitzgerald's part. To me, I feel as if it has already been done. Uniqueness is the basis to any story, in order for the reader to stay fascinated, the author must create something that is out of the ordinary, therefore keeping the reader more than satisfied.All in all, Fitzgerald's \\"Best American Novel of All Time\\" unfortunately isn't at its best. Honestly, the way he expresses his writing with such perplex detail isn't the smartest approach an author, who supposedly is seen as one of the greatest American novelist in American Literature, should make. As a reader you should consider these factors as to how to judge this so called \\"classical\\" novel written by the infamous and supposed great writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald for yourself. But truthfully, if you, as a reader, define Fitzgerald's archetypal storyline as great as its title; that is beyond me."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A bunch of rich snobs complain about how boring life is while putting down or bullying poorer people.

Throughout my public school education, we had read a variety of classics from Steinbeck, Dickens, Hemingway, Miller, etc. So I really thought I had read this one along the way. After a couple of paragraphs, I realized that I hadn't, because I think I would have remembered the different feel this one seems to have from most classic American literature.The length of the novel alone is enough to show you that it's not quite the same as some of those other novels. Fitzgerald seemed to have more of a sense of what to cut out and what to include than some of his contemporaries, because at no point during this reading did I sit and think \\"Will you just get ON with it?!?\\" I'm sad to say that I have done that with plenty of other authors, so I was a bit worried I'd have that reaction when going through The Great Gatsby. I very happily enjoyed this novel and hope to read more of Fitzgerald's work in the future.The book itself is the tragic tale of our title character, Jay Gatsby. Having never been satisfied with the life he came from, Gatsby invents a new self and goes about trying to find the person he wants to be. Along the way, he meets Daisy, who becomes the big driving force in his life. I think in today's day and age, we might call Gatsby a stalker - he's obsessive and goes so far as to buy his house in Long Island because of his ability to see Daisy's across the way. While this would seem creepy if we were telling it from a modern perspective, it strikes me as being rather sad. Gatsby goes from only knowing he wants to make money, to knowing he wants to make money for Daisy. At one point during the story, he even says that he decided doing things was less important than telling Daisy about all the things he wanted to do. It's really a sad case of lost boy syndrome, in my book.Something that really stuck out to me throughout the book was that people seemed to want to be around Gatsby, but no one necessarily seems to like him, going so far as to spread random rumors about how he acquired his fortune and what his past was like. This theme carries through to the end when we learn that our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who is truly there for Gatsby in his time of need. While Gatsby isn't a model citizen, he doesn't seem all that scandalous to me, and certainly doesn't deserve the rumor mongering that follows him throughout the course of the novel. Maybe it's just the fact that I'm looking at it from a modern perspective, so his actions don't seem any worse than things we see on TV on a daily basis.I picked this book up for Banned Books Week, and found it rather amusing when I was investigating the reasoning behind the banning of this book. It was basically for language and some mild sexual content, which is just ridiculous. I certainly didn't see any bad language when reading it, and the only references to sex were along the lines of \\"so and so left the room for awhile\\". Again, maybe it's a more modern perspective, but those things are just silly. I'm totally against the banning of books anyway, so I guess I've got a skewed perspective twice over.The only questionable thing for me is really the behavior of Daisy's husband, Tom Buchanan. I found Tom to be annoying, as arrogant as he is described, and a bigot to top it off. It's made worse by the knowledge that men like Tom did exist, and to an extent they still do. Still, that's no reason to ban a book, it's just a reason to dislike Tom and root for Gatsby.I really would be curious to see what kind of things Fitzgerald would have come up with if he lived in our time. It's a shame we lost him all too soon, because I think he has a unique voice and I would have liked to see more from him."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"When I was reading this I kept wondering how it could be a classic.

There are references to many things that happened in the 20's and issues of the time. The ending was pretty anticlimactic as well."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a timeless classic that can be appreciated decades after its publication. The mysterious Gatsby looms over the lethargic beginning, but as he comes into focus the novel becomes enthralling. The mysterious Gatsby is at first depicted as a wealthy, powerful man, but shocking irony reveals the truth. Gatsby's love for Daisy has driven him to an extravagant lifestyle. Gatsby, once portrayed as the wealthiest and most powerful man in New York, was nothing more than a hopeless romantic. Gatsby is further berated - Daisy's wife, Tom, accuses Gatsby of criminal activities and involvement. Nonetheless, Gatsby and Daisy still meet privately on several occasions, and Gatsby's ornate portrayal of Daisy is not fulfilled. Over the years, Gatsby has exalted Daisy with his immense wealth and imagination.The overarching theme throughout the novel is exactly that mentioned above. Gatsby's exalting of Daisy has turned her into nothing more than a possession in his mind. This can be paralleled to the American Dream, the desire for success, prosperity, wealth, and a family. Gatsby can never have Daisy because of his immense wealth, an ironic cynical idea that was likely portrayed since this novel was written in the midst of the Great Depression. Another theme parodies the constant quest for money in America. The upper class, repented by Gatsby, is motivated by greed and desire. On the surface, the upper class appear superior an powerful, but in reality they are so desperate that they seek wealth to fill the hole in their personal American Dream.Overall, the Great Gatsby is a timeless classic, brilliantly written on multiple levels. The entire storyline brilliantly parallels and satires the quest for wealth, needs, and desires. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is elegant yet precise. As previously mentioned, the beginning, though lethargic and descriptive, is still intriguing. At first, the verbose details may seem extraneous, but it proves to be a great beginning to an amazing novel."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I think, or I glean, that American high school students are required to read this book, held up as a shining example of national literature. Perhaps because I'm not American, this novel wasn't on any lists when I studied English in high school and university. Just as well; I mightn't have appreciated it then.It's understandable that The Great Gatsby would be taught; it's damned good. It's tight, compact, linear, and practically every sentence is a work of art. I bought the audio book and listened to it twice. Then I picked up the novel and read it in a couple of days. It's excellent; there's no way around it. It's also rather different from Tender is the Night, also good, perhaps more evolved, but not nearly as flash or impactful.If someone employed Fitzgerald's style today, their prose would likely be labeled too ornate. A shame, because it's poetic and powerfully descriptive.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Brilliant, a simple conversation scene in the book make me sit up, enthralled, and laugh out loud. Perceptive, erudite. A genius."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The thing that this book brings out more than anything is the idea that the rich gained their power and notoriety through some type of moral superiority. That is completely trashed in this book.First of all, Tom Buchannan is the most unctuous character in this book, if not all literature. He is the picture of the eastern establishment rich kid who had everything given to him. And he is a leach to his wife and skulks around with Myrtle.Daisy and Gatsby are also pathetic characters. The thrust of the novel is also important in that it brings to light the fact that money and vast riches cannot bring happiness. We still see that today. The 1920s and the Jazz Age were the beginning of the era of conspicuous consumption and while Gatsby throws weekend long parties, he almost never partakes in them, and he is rather quite miserable.The ending of the book, not to give spoilers, demonstrates the conceit of the era. A seminal work of American Fiction."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite classics. I read this when I was high school, but didn't get my own copy of the book until later years. I thought it was an interesting read. To read about the main character and how it was possible to redefine or recreate yourself and try to persuade the world around you to accept this new definition was amazing to read. Then to mix in a love story with Jay Gatsby and his love for Ms. Daisy Buchanan was a good read as well. Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to read a good book and a classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald's insight in this book cuts through the blinding American optimism of the time. Though at the time he wrote The Great Gatsby he could not have foreseen the economic and cultural crisis approaching in 1929, he is clearly suspicious and wary of the culture surrounding him, and the tone of this book expresses that he expects evil will come of it. His characters put their faith and their trust in unstable things- wealth, social superiority, commercialism, the power of culture- and their typical american idealism and ambition makes them reach too far for things they don't have, and they end up losing what they did have. Fitzgerald's narrator, Nick Carraway, is ambitious, but is not blinded by the glamour and excess of the society surrounding him. Nick is the only character who is actually grieved by the tragedies which befall the other characters, because he alone values human compassion above society and ambition. From a Christian perspective, this book shows what happens to culture and the individuals who make up that culture when Christian ambition and even basic humanity are sacrificed for social greed."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is less about the American Dream and more about the death of a dream; a dream one holds in one's heart, for such an inexplicably long time, that it becomes something more than a dream, something ineffable and austere. Like the previous sentence, this book is permeated with ambiguous phrasings and sentimental, other-worldly prose - that is to say, Fitzgerald has a certain writing style, and chooses to imbue his novel with a certain unabashed romanticism.Most peoples critiques of the characters are incomplete. Sure, they have money, and that might make them frivolous or careless to a certain extent, but they all have depth and breadth. The characters only seem overtly despondent because we view them through the eyes of the narrator, a person who seems somewhat detached from things, as he should be, as the novel is essentially his recollection of events. The net effect is that the novel achieves sort of a dream-like quality. The most likable of the characters is the novels name-sake, Gatsby. I read somewhere that the original editor/publisher of the book had Fitzgerald omit much of Gatsby's biography - I would have liked to know more about Gatsby. That's the great trick of the novel, the reader wants to know more about Gatsby, and when his identity and his character is revealed, it can seem anti-climatic; but when we discover why Gatsby has amassed his wealth, created his persona, and built his estate in a certain place, we realize his true intentions, and recognize them as being the best of humanity, even if they are naive and romantic notions flush with sentimentality.The plot to the novel is interesting and includes one or two twists that make it feel like an urban legend.The main sticking point of the novel (for me) is that wealth does not create happiness, nor is it a means to an end. The wealthy face all the same problems, regrets, and insecurities as everyone else, with the added burden of having money.The novel is a relatively short, enjoyable read, poetic and sublime. An excellent addition to anyone's general library.

Quotes like this - \\"Can't repeat the past?\\" he cried incredulously. \\"Why of course you can!\\" - are just classic.The Great Gatsby is a story abut Jay Gatsby's quest to track down the girl he loved in his youth, and his inability to come to grips with the path her life has taken in the interim. It also follows narrator Nick Carroway, Gatsby's neighbor for a summer. But most of all it is a story about the American dream - about love, money and ambition - and a slice of life in the 1920s, full of wild parties and glamour and tradgedy."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the books that I read in high school that I have been meaning to re-read, in an attempt to see whether it would mean more to me when I was older, than it did when I was young and easily bored.In my mind the book is still OK. I agree that it shows countless flaws in the the character's pursuit of the American dream. I'm not sure which errors in judgement were more pronounced in this story - trying to solve problems and win love through money, or the acts of infidelity themselves.I was left wondering what I would have thought if I had been in the position of the narrator Nick Carraway. It seemed as if he moved to West Egg only to find himself in the middle of the affairs of Daisy and Tom Buchanan and then unexpectedly he became the confidant of J. Gatsby.

In brief, the Doppler effect addresses the perceived frequency of waves, such as a fire truck's siren, by taking into account the actual frequency, and the relative speeds of the source of the sound, and the observer. So too with books; your opinion is so often determined by your particular circumstances, perhaps rushing towards the source, or enjoying the lengthening perspective that life in its fullness can provide. Unlike so many of the now familiar 1-star reviews, written by students forced to read the book as an assignment, I first read this book, of my own free will, more or less, when I was in Vietnam, some 40 plus years ago. When you are living in a bunker, the whining of the rich, and their self-induced troubles, does not go down well, and if Amazon had existed then, the best I could have mustered would have been a 2-star rating.But a friend chided me into undertaking a second read. And I found a finely crafted novel, yes, concerning the rich, primarily; set in the early years of the \\"Roaring 20's.\\" The story is told through the voice of Ned Carraway, standing in that proverbial inertial reference frame, a migrant from the Mid-West, attempting to scratch a living by selling bonds on Wall Street, and living in modest circumstances on Long Island. The book's essential theme is lost love, or more precisely, lost opportunities in courtship, and involves the title character, Jay Gatsby (n&eacute; Jimmy Gatz), and his desire for Tom Buchanan's wife, Daisy, whom he had briefly known before her marriage. She requites, for sure. The \\"minor characters\\" do their share of suffering. There is plenty of philandering all around, and a somewhat predictable Greek tragedy denouement.Fitzgerald tells his story well, and it is relatively fast-paced and dense. There are sufficient insights to maintain the interest. Tom exudes much of the stupidity and bigotry that so often goes with wealth. Consider the following statement: \\"...Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard, and have intermarriage between black and white.\\" At another point, Fitzgerald says of Tom: \\"As for Tom, the fact that he \`had some woman in New York' was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his preemptory heart.\\"But the primary focus is on Gatsby. And therein were some problems. Somerset Maugham did the \\"obsession with a woman\\" thing to perfection. Fitzgerald's explanation of Gatsby's obsession was substantially weaker. And then there is the matter of his rapid acquisition of wealth. Could it have occurred so quickly, under any circumstances, since the novel was set in the early 20's, instead of the late 20's?The Rich really are different than you and me, as the old saw goes. The concentration of wealth in the United States, even in the midst of the Great Recession, exceeds even that of the \`20's, so the foibles, prejudges, and contrived problems of the lucky, or is it unlucky few, from that prior era, merit another look, as the wavelength of that receding period lengthens, along with perspective of the reader.A 5-star read, but not one of the 10 best American novels of all time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I just ordered this book as a gift for a friend and when it came I was so delighted with the quality that I purchased another one for myself, even though I already own several copies of Gatsby.

The protagonist, introduced to polite society by an acquaintance (Gatsby), shows you the landmarks and windfalls along the road to dinner parties, and points out the many trappings of culture and conscience that befit a beautiful young fool surfing the upper crust of industrial-age America.Much of this book draws from the writer's own life, as he watched his own wife suffer from many of the same symptoms of society as his book's characters; obsession with the trappings and trimmings of the social elite; greed and spite; treachery and manipulation;alcoholism and insanity. This genuine point of view is distilled by careful selection in a tour de force o the ballroom lifestyle.The author's style relies heavily upon narrative, and his descriptions are potent. He mingles Western cultural artifacts (billboards, warehouse districts) and signs of life in America's dustbowl (parked cars) to spot the low and high income parts of metropolitan culture like the warm and cold spots in the river. All in all, this is a book which draws its power from subjective interpretation of the narrative; very little is decided for the reader, who feels much like a back-seat passenger in Gatsby's car, listening in and seeing the sights."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I decided to read The Great Gatsby because it is a classic, and when I was supposed to read it in high school, I got the Cliff Notes instead.

Gatsby is in search of his true love, which is something all of us look for in life - that relationship of heroic proportions that seems almost surreal and timeless. Perhaps the last page is the best clincher of the book: \\"Gatsby believed in the green light (true love), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.

It holds your interest because of the subject matter - love, betrayal. Most of the characters aren't likeable, they are dislikeable. It is one of the most overrated books of all time because it is often called one of the greatest books, which it definitely isn't. Can anyone seriously put this little story up against War and Peace, or Brothers Karamazov? Come on. You don't have any great characters here. But it is an interesting story that earns its three stars out of five."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I did not like the novel entitled \\"The Great Gatsby\\" very much. I really found it disappointing, for before reading this book I thought it would be interesting enough to capture my attention. This did not happen because those parts that would be considered the climax were not interesting (I found theses scenes dull and predictable).Furthermore, I would like to say that most characters were not good at all. I consider that some scenes, such as the one in which Daisy starts crying on Gatsby's shirts, are meaningless (perhaps because what these parts want to symbolise, is not clear enough). Moreover, I think that the story should not have been told in the first person by Nick, because by doing this Fitzgerald gave no possibility of including an account of the emotional relationship between Gatsby and Daisy from the time of the reunion to the catastrophe.Finally, I would like to make clear that my opinion should not be taken as an insult towards Fitzgerald, who is a worldwide well-known writer, but as a personal comment in which I highlight what for me was wrong in the setting and development of \\"The Great Gatsby\\"."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I guess that this novel come into the hands of today's readers mostly due to the fact that it has been designated as one of the U.S. literary icons of the XX Century. Undoubtedly, the precision to detail and the smoothness used by the writer to convey its ideas is fantastic. My problem with it, is that the drama in which the love story is build seems rather silly. We have a character like Gatsby who is a young fellow who decided to become rich the fast way (smuggling and other unidentified dirty business) to gain social recognition for the sole purpose of being worthy of a rich girl of whom he had fallen in love. Nevertheless, the author never takes the effort to outline why in ruthless 20's, when wild capitalism was on the rise and pragmatism was the only name of the game, a person like Gatsby, who is the living symbol of those forces, who have laid more women that he can remember and who have \\"known the world\\" from every possible angle, decides to waist his life in pursuit of a romantic love and challenge the husband of her beloved with the tact and style of a 14th year old. Such situation just takes away all credibility to the drama. I guess the novel became important for the reasons so many of the other reviewers have expressed. He provided a frame of reference for the people of the 20's to perceive their own time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I first read The Great Gatsby as a summer reading assignment for 10th grade English class. I was on vacation at the Jersey shore, and, as I lay in bed in the evenings, sunburnt and calm after swimming in the ocean all day, I discovered a thrilling new world. The world of seductive glamour and heartbreaking tragedy. The story has stayed with me, more than 30 years later. I've re-read Gatsby many times, and have thought about it throughout my life. The words of Nick Carroway, the narrator, who tells us the wisdom his father imparted to him as a child...basically to never forget the advantages you were born with, and that there are others who were not born so lucky. This is the story of America. It is also the story of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He was the not-so-rich, not so aristocratic, lover of rich girls and aristocrats. He lived in the world of the very rich, and heard the money tinkling in the voices of the rich girls he met in prep school, and then at the Princeton dances. These are the girls that melded into his greatest heroine (or, perhaps, anti-heroine) Daisy Buchanan. Daisy lives on the the top of the heap of all of the Fitzgerald girls. Well, perhaps just a notch underneath Zelda, the real-life Mrs. Fitzgerald. Gatsby was the beginning of an obsession for me. I went on to read everything by and about Fitzgerald. One of the most exciting parts of my first visit to Paris at age 18 was discovering a collection of his short stories that had never been collected in book form. In college, I spent many evenings browsing the stacks of the BU library reading the biographies of FSF. Although all of his stories provided enjoyment, and I would recommend them all to any budding romantics out there, it is Gatsby which is closest to perfection. So many wondrous details. I believe they called it \\"A Novel WIthout a Hero.\\" But Gatsby is the hero, because he dared to believe that he could re-capture the first rush of young love. It's like capturing a falling star in a milk bottle. And it's something we all long for. To keep the magic of first experience. The act of reading this novel for the first time is an act of magic. Do not pass it up."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Jay Gatsby lives in a large mansion on the water in Long Island, New York, circa 1925. He hosts enormous parties each weekend attended by hundreds of people whom are uninvited and do not even know him. But that does not bother him. He is the perfect host, always making sure that his guests have everything their heart's desire. Nick Carraway lives next door and works in the City selling bonds. He is originally from the midwest but has relocated East to seek his fortune. He is befriended by Gatsby and others in elite social circles including a college friend Tom Buchannan and his wife Daisy, who is also Nick's cousin. But the world appears smaller and smaller as Nick discovers that Gatsby is in love with Daisy and that they dated once, years before, prior to her wedding to Tom. Gatsby has never gotten over Daisy and spends his every minute in an effort to win her back and prove his love.Fitzgerald's best known novel is filled with love, hate, intrigue, and friendship. He describes the frivolity of the time as contrasted with the sadness of human lonliness and insecurity. What seems to say so little given that it is a very short book, really says quite a bit in what it does not say. Romantic relationships that are described as happy clearly illustrate the dispair and sadness that is truly being suffered by those that are not truly in love with each other. Platonic relationships that seem losely connected actually describe tight friendships that are closer than others that portend to be strong.With each reading of this novel more of what Fitzgerald meant to convey comes through. It is the type of novel that grows with the reader. Reading it at different times in ones life will change what the reader gets out of it and enjoys. It is a timeless classic that continues to get better over time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book is extremely good reding material for High School students. It will help them in improving his comprehension as well as their grammar application. The story is a great treat for adults."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"When I was seventeen and believed I knew things about literature, I wrote a review that both dismissed this book, and talked childishly of how a teacher reading too much into it, and demanding explanations from everything about the book, had made the text boring, and poor. I deleted that review, and now, six years later, returning to the book, and reading it in one sitting, I have come to an entirely new conclusion. After literally hundreds of books, from Hemingway to Faulkner, to Joyce and Woolf, to Kerouac and Heller, the poetics of this book, of Fitzgerald's writing, is to be marvelled and enjoyed.The story of Jay Gatsby, told through the eyes of Nick Carraway is a wonderful experience that every American, nay I say, every human being should experience. This is a text of utter beauty, filled with the poetry of life in it's lines. It moves us forward into the realization of the failure of the American Dream. It is a tragedy, it is a romance, it is a story of class, it is the story of an American soul seeking both victory and redemption. The writing erupts from the page like sparks from sparklers, each page burning with radiant descriptions, powerful imagery, and insight that you wish was constant in the literature of today.The Great Gatsby is a timeless novel, capable of being enjoyed by anyone, black or white, rich or poor, American or European or Asian. It is a novel that goes beyond that of a moment in history, and becomes a part of the soul. It captures more than the heart of man, but the heart of life itself. To recommend this book would be to say that this book needs a recommendation, but, if time and history are not clear indicators of its greatness, than it's opening pages should be."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"In whatever context this book is read, it holds its place as a literary masterpiece, for a menu of reasons - each reader has their own. A powerful fable wrapped in a gripping story, eloquent poetic prose that ebbs and flows with the rhythm of a story filled with subtle intelligence and suspenseful tension. Long after the last page is turned, its poetic message lingers like a bittersweet fragrance. A book to cherish."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A wonderfully intricate story, told in Fitzgerald's most polished prose style, which confronts issues of materialism, identity, dreams, self-worth, and mortality. This story is as relevant today as it was when it was written almost 80 years ago for its denunciation of, and simultaneous admiration for, the moneyed class and the stupidity which so often accompanies wealth."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I am hooked on audio books. I have a long commute to and from work everyday and I can't wait to get in the car so I can get back to my audio book of the week. I was so excited at the prospect of listening to Tim Robbins narrating The Great Gatsby, a book I have wanted to read for a long time. I am a third of the way through and am terribly disappointed. This is the first audio book that I am struggling with. I am a huge fan of Tim's on-screen work but he is \\"performing\\" here and it's distracting. The variations in his voice are irritating as well...I am constantly adjusting the volume. There are other narrations of this classic out there - buy one of those."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby, a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, takes place in the fantastic city of New York. Nick Carraway, a southern boy, leaves the farms and hills of the South to live where the noisy traffic and tall skyscrapers of the North surround him. Of course to Nick, everything is so different. For one thing, New York is a more \\"open minded\\" kind of place and Fitzgerald allows us to explore the feelings that Nick encounters on such a drastic change. We move along with Nick throughout the novel, bouncing around from character to character. We also find the dramatic difference between \\"West Eggers\\" and \\"East Eggers\\".Daisy, a second cousin to Nick, is in fact an \\"East Egger\\" and she and her husband, Tom Buchanan, unload a boat load of secrets, lusts, and well kept mischievous acts. Nick of course tries to keep out of things but there is no avoiding what Tom and Daisy are dealing with. Jordan Baker, a pro-golfer, becomes a good friend of Nick's and they both are on the outside looking in on the Buchanan's rocky marriage. Nick finds that he's very fond of Jordan but tries to stay alert so that he will not be sucked into any of the chaos.What will this novel be without Fitzgerald's most mysterious character, Jay Gatsby? Jay Gatsby, from the very start of the story is a very fine, handsome, and yet awe-inspiring man. Nick's curiosity of this creature only lure's the reader to find out what this Gatsby character is all about. Now of course you'll learn that \\"East Eggers\\" are not too fond of the \\"West Eggers\\" and Gatsby just happens to be a \\"West Egger\\". So, of course there's some dispute between Tom and Gatsby when they are first introduce in the novel. However, this dispute goes far beyond where each men are living. The reader finds out about Daisy's past and how she and Gatsby are more then just acquaintances.It seems that many of characters in Fitzgerald's novel are looking to attain something. What that something is, well it all depends on that character. Throughout the book we still find that even though Nick begins to talk with Gatsby he still doesn't know anything about him. Gatsby throws these extravagant parties and yet is rarely present at the occasions. However, Nick and Gatsby become very good friends and all the secrets begin to spill out to reveal who Gatsby truly is.Toward the end of the novel you may think that the story may slowly fade out and the book will come to an end, however Fitzgerald throws a huge shocker that will keep you suspended in your chair. Lives are changed forever and all Nick can do is watch helplessly from the sidelines. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is truly a remarkable story. The characters all have their place. You're able to create bonds and dislikes which make up a great book."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"THE GREAT GATSBY BOOK REVIEWThe novel, The Great Gatsby, is a work of fiction written by F. Scott Fitzgerald around 1924-1925. It is told to us from the perspective of Nick Carraway, one of the main characters. Through Carraway we learn about the rest of the characters and their way of living. The book introduces time, love, and reality as its major subjects. From beginning to end, Carraway mentions time for an event that takes place, along with the season which gives a certain type of mood. The character of Jay Gatsby runs after luxury and wealth in order to gain the love of Daisy Buchanan. Through this action Fitzgerald demonstrates the hardship he had to go through in order to be with his love, Zelda. Similarly, other events in the book are related to the author's life.Fitzgerald raises the issue of morals and decency in this novel, however, each of his character face a problem with morals. Nick Carraway believes he is the only one who is honest and decent but I believe he is not as good as he thinks he is. Carraway secretly forms opinions about the others but when he needs information or company he has no problem being around them. I don't believe this action of his to be decent behavior, consequently he is not decent as he says to be. At first, Carraway is very curious to meet the famous Jay Gatsby, a mysterious and interesting guy everyone talks about, but towards the middle he changes his opinion about him, making Gatsby the mean guy and in the end Carraway is once again on Gatsby's side because he feels sorry for the guy. Carraway's cousin Daisy is dishonest with her marriage and to her Gatsby, her love. She appears to be innocent and unaware of her husbands affair and yet she herself goes of with another man, not caring about the consequences her marriage would have to face. Jay Gatsby has lied his way into the lifestyle that he is living, all for his true love, which he hopes will someday return back to him. As you can see, Fitzgerald has his characters based on a web of lies and problems, which hardly leaves them any room for happiness.I believe the novel to be very informative and descriptive. All the characters are introduced with a full detail of their appearance, actions and achievements so far in life. For this very reason, the book did not hold my interest. I thought it to have no real meaning behind it and didn't quite enjoy it even after we were done with the book and surely didn't think of it as a classic. I definitely would not recommend this novel to read but if you enjoy drama that is pointless than go right ahead and read the book."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Written about 1920s culture this book still has a powerful effect today. After having lived through the 1990s, which was another prosperous time for the economy, I can relate to the characters quite well.If you are an F. Scott fan you already know how well he writes. Many of the more recent authors aren't as good at developing a story as he is.If you like the book there's a most excellent movie to supplement it. It stars Robert Redford and follows the book quite well."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Yes, I'm but another unfortunate soul who had to go through this book because of the wretched school. Let me try to be fair, the book started decent. I thought the writing style of the author was good, but nothing egregrious. I was interested in finding out about the narrator, of course, the story turns and introduced a mob of characters from parties and dreaded plots. It was plainly, and simply and tediously S-L-O-W. Reading this book is a torture. Okay, that was my first impression of the book. After finally reading it through, however, I guess I should say it was better than I thought. The story speeds up a little, still retaining the air of elusiveness. It is hard to grasp the theme of The Great Gatsby. But perhaps when you do it is worthwhile to you. Though I still feel unable to relate this story very well. But different people have different opinions."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Are you people stupid? This is one of the best books ever written"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"When I first heard that my English teacher gave us the opportunity to read \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" I had an open mind and frankly, I grew with such anticipation. The first few pages immediately begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, a rather timid man from the mid-west, who becomes quite interested into all the glamour and glitz of the New York, along with the wonder of his uncanny neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick is definitely not your average narrator. He generally judges all his surroundings by its cover, and basically has something to say about everything. And with Fitzgerald as the author, all that is being judged is extremely detailed as it can get. Some may say detail is good, but I say, too much detail can get others thrown off and indifferent toward the novel.As the novel progressed in content, I began to grow uninterested. I felt that I wasn't as into the novel like others had appeared to be, and my mindset toward the book wasn't quite as good as I hoped. To be honest, the novel's storyline wasn't half-bad; it was typical, a so-called \\"classic,\\" but nonetheless it was rather acceptable. Fitzgerald focuses on a plethora of different characters dealing with their lives of betrayal, love, and sometimes even death; doesn't that sound quite alluring?Charm is brought into this tragic tale as Fitzgerald adds his romantic side into play. He shows how one character loses his love and strives to regain his love back. It is certainly reasonably endearing, but it appears to show originality on Fitzgerald's part. To me, I feel as if it has already been done. Uniqueness is the basis to any story, in order for the reader to stay fascinated, the author must create something that is out of the ordinary, therefore keeping the reader more than satisfied. I don't agree with Fitzgerald's title for the story. To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby. He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy. To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him. Was it because he was rich and famous? He became rich through illegal activities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were. There is nothing great about that struggling man. A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\". He is dead inside.However this novel does not end in fairy tale. It is more of a Shakespeareans play, a tragedy. Although I'm more partial to happy endings, the twist in the story does very well suit it. The story is pieced together well, in stormy plot, but lacks excitement towards the ending. Maybe Fitzgerald was headed in the direction of simplicity but that wasn't the case here.All in all, Fitzgerald's \\"Best American Novel of All Time\\" unfortunately isn't at its best. As a reader you should consider these factors as to how to judge this so called \\"classical\\" novel written by the infamous and supposed great writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald for yourself. But truthfully, if you, as a reader, define Fitzgerald's archetypal storyline as great as its title; that is beyond me."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Prepare yourself, because the following is a less than glowing review of a revered classic. Yes, it's true, I am making myself vulnerable to all sorts of negative votes to express an honest, yet negative, opinion on a &quot;classic&quot; book.But first, a little plot overview. This is a tragic lovestory told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a Midwestern transplant to New York who happens to live in a modest house in a very rich neighborhood. He is the narrator, but most of the action is happening with other principal figures, most prominently J Gatsby. Gatsby is a mysterious figure who has gained wealth quickly from questionable means and goes to great lengths to win the heart of the woman he loves...who happens to be Nick's cousin.The story twists and turns and describes Gatsby's high-rollin' lifestyle -- which would make a great episode in today's world of MTV Cribs -- and melds together several love stories with a great description of the &quot;bored rich&quot; living in the 1920's. The story is very entertaining and moves you along quickly.So, if this were a novel I picked up without knowing anything about it, I would probably be glowing and gushing all over the floor about it. But it's not. It is &quot;classic&quot; literature whose merits to fit into that category seem to be in debate. Well, here are my two cents.Some of the arguments that I have seen for this book's greatness are its beautiful language, Fitzgerald's economy of words, and the portrayal of the Jazz Age. And to that I say, first, that yes, the language is very good and I liked alot of the writer's descriptions, but they simply did not blow my doors off like other classics seem to. My personal grade would be a B+.Secondly, hey, economy of words is great, and I appreciate that an author is able to express him/herself succinctly (as opposed to many non-classic current authors,) but that in and of itself is kind of like an add-on benefit for me, like if the car dealer throws in some customized floor mats or something. That's great, but it's not a deal maker-or-breaker.Thirdly, I appreciate the portrayal of this period in history. But I really don't care that much about the bored rich in that period of history. By reading some reviewers' comments, you would think that this would be akin to learning about the hardships of Western pioneers or the tribulations of flood victims or something. It's just not that captivating of a topic to me to carry a story, but I guess that is personal preference.So, to summarize. I liked the book. I give it four stars. But it has a wagon-load of expectations that it is carrying, and I just felt like I was missing something when I was reading it. And perhaps that just means I don't have enough edgukashuns to &quot;get it,&quot; but this feeling seems to be a common one among other readers, even those who have finished high school.Go ahead. Commence with the negatives."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"If you're thinking of buying the Great Gatsby (a classic example of the literature elite trying to cram a book down the people's mouths as a &quot;classic&quot;), read the yellow pages instead.

Every word is so carefully chosen, each element so intricately interwound, you can't help but feel your also glimpsing into Fitzgerald's very essence as you thumb the pages. While I'm not going to review the plot, it's actually a simple story of love's power and the human desire to be more than we are. The real strength is the way Fitzgerald draws you into a world of the bored rich and let's you see every detail through the eyes of the narrator. Gatsby himself is the essence of a tragic fugure. So rich, so powerful, yet even he can't have it all. Maybe my love for this book comes from my identification with Gatsby. How he was determined to become successful and acheived his goal. Read this book, read it slowly, savor the language like it is a fine port. So many things happen at once, you need to move through it carefully, so you don't miss any nusances. Finally, I noticed that many other &quot;reviewers&quot;, mostly pimple faces high school kids, absolutely hated the book. Don't be fooled. There is nothing boring about here. I read it in High School, I'm now an attorney, and absolutely loved it even then. The book is just too rich to be appreciated by many kids who refuse to take the time to look below the surface. They want a fast plot, simple language and an exciting story. That's all they are capable of handling since they are exposed to crap like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Titanic.&quot; Anyone who didn't care for the book is just showing their own shortcomings and lack of intelligence.

Much to my disappointment I found nothing more than an a superficial plot based mostly on descriptions of the 1920's. Fitzgerald succesfully caught the spirit of the 20's so if you're looking to get a feel for that era this would be a good book to read, on the other hand if you're looking for a grand literary work, there is a lot more out there. Fitzgerald's characters are shallow and unidentifiable, his plot weak and slow-moving to an extent which becomes tiresome even though the book is relatively short. Fitzgerald is not an author but rather a social historian, something apparent in other of his works, such as &quot;Bernice bobs her hair&quot;. So if it's insight on the 20's you want, this should be great, but it falls short of anything else it's reputation demands."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in high school, and now 20+ years later. I still don't get what makes this book so highly acclaimed. As a Christian, I do not condone the adulterous affairs portrayed in the novel, one character beating his girlfriend, nor the rumored illegal means by which Gatsby earned his wealth. Perhaps if I didn't care about those things, I would have felt more favorably about Gatsby and the other characters.I did find the narrator, Nick Carraway, somewhat likable. Nick observes all the immorality around him, and he seems to keep himself from being sucked into the abyss; however, his being seeing as an outsider was likely due to his modest means compared to most others in the story. I was happy to see Nick had a sense of honor about him and his chosen profession of selling bonds. It seems his independence separated him from the filthy rich, but he was friendly enough that people entrusted him with their secrets."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I enjoyed The Great Gatsby as I enjoyed all of Fitzgerald's work, however, I think This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and the Dammed are his best work.

If you are not sure whether you should buy it, YOU SHOULD. F Scott Fitzgerald is my #1 favorite author. He knows how to display a scene so vividly that's unlike most authors. His books can render much emotion in a small way. This book is the presentation of pitiable people and displays people in a realistic light-people with flaws and worries, not characters that do one bad thing and that's it, or characters that are all angel or all villain. The whole book is rather sad in my opinion. Nothing seems to be particularly happy or motivating and then ends on a tragic note. Yet Fitzgerald weaves a web around the reader that makes him want to continue with the rainy-day feeling and leaves you with a sad/wonderful/bittersweet/memorable book.And that is how it is."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Gatsby has achieved legendary status in the American canon because it plumbs perpetually attractive themes: unbridled ambition, wealth, power and their inevitable diminution in the face of the most powerful human reality of all-that these are like springtime blooms, satisfying, evanescent and ultimatley to no purpose. For that alone the book is worth reading time and again, ironically rather like the Bible."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"One way to describe The Great Gatsby is to compare this piece of literature to a treasure hunt. The reason for this comparison is because of the abundance of symbolism and tiny snippets of important information throughout the book. In my opinion you would have to read this book a few times to get a really good sense of the complexity of the story because each time through the book you will find many things you missed the last time. However, I find this style of writing a little annoying because I am not one that usually goes back to read a book again, so for this book I was left confused. The Great Gatsby possesses many lessons on life and how to achieve goals and therefore, an American classic on the American Dream."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I was both touched and frustrated by the style of writing. Pay attention to every line or you may miss something. The over arching message is universal, that wealthy people can make big mistakes in life too...The author seems to want to blame wealth for irresponsibility...a theme that is difficult for me to buy. Everyone can be there no matter what station in life. The real tragedy was Gatsby's investment in worthlessness. For that point I commend the author."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I first read this one years ago, in high school I believe, and I liked it well enough then. But it was soon eclipsed in my mind by Joyce's works. And Hemingway's. Against the works of these latter authors, Fitzgerald's GATSBY seemed to me to be rather ordinary, old fashioned if you will . . . albeit a nicely honed piece of prose.There is, indeed, a certain artifice to the Gatsby story which smacks of the writer's intentions, an intrusive \\"plottiness\\" reflecting coincidences which are not at all the way things really work in life. And yet for all that, the story is strongly told, moving and lyrical, and the characterizations, as I found on re-reading the novel at my wife's urging, far more subtle than I recalled from my high school days. GATSBY is the story of a mystery man who dreams of a wealthy debutante he met years before, when he was an impoverished young soldier, and whose entire life since has been dedicated to winning her. To do this he has earned millions of dollars in the heyday of racketeering and prohibition (how is never quite made clear) and, at the time the novel is set, is engaged in creating an upper class persona for himself, in order to be worthy of the woman he loves.Of course, as Fitzgerald, through his narrator, the Midwestern transplant and aspiring bond salesman, Nick Carraway, shows, it is not Gatsby who needs to be made worthy at all. There is a certain melodrama to the tale which kind of blunted the edge for me but, on balance, the overwrought tragic overtones in the careless hit and run accident that brings all to a head are more than balanced out by the insight vouchsafed to us by Nick when he tells Gatsby, near the end, that the whole lot of them are not worth Gatsby alone. Gatsby wanders off distractedly to meet his undeserved destiny, thereafter, and Nick remains to pick up the pieces, packing up and returning home to the Midwest in disgust, and something akin to despair, at the human condition when, at last, the full import of what has occurred comes home to him.Fitzgerald had set out to craft a gem with this novel and he succeeded. Though it has flaws, the powerful insight and the polished, lyrical prose more than make up for them, setting this book firmly in the constellation of great American novels.SWM"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book is a literary classic. This is not difficult for many to recognize, but often this book is used as a required reading assignment in high school and teens don't get the &quot;Big Picture.&quot;TGG was assigned to me while in highschool. I made a mad dash for the bookstore to get the Cliff's Notes. I BS'd my way through a book report and put the class behind me.I just read the book for a college english class. I'll reiterate what a wonderful book it is.I am left feeling like I should in fact have read it in highschool instead of opting for the Cliff's Notes. Reading the book in highschool and then again in college would have allowed me to draw a wonderful parallel. I wish I was able to look back on my views in high school and compare them to my opinions of the book today.Reading TGG in highscool and then in college gives you an oppurtunity to see your maturation first hand!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I really enjoyed and would highly recommend reading The Great Gatsby. Overall, it was an easy read, and for the most part, a light-hearted, entertaining story. It had an interesting plot with remarkable characters to support it. Even though it was written almost a century ago, it is still easy to appreciate Fitzgerald's ideas and style of writing.The book was very well written for many reasons. I liked the fact that it was a first person narrative. I personally enjoy first person novel because I think that the insight of the narrator makes the reader relate to the story more, as opposed to the neutral position of a third person story. The narrative offered details vivid enough to easily imagine the setting. I was not familiar with the setting in New York, but the descriptiveness was clear enough for me to picture the scenes. Also, the writing style was excellent at using setting as a device to convey emotion, and in a few instances, foreshadowing. The plot is fast moving and I really enjoyed the unexpected plot twist towards the end. The small side plots that arose between the supporting characters sustained my interest also. The story was very much to the point, and did not at any time drag on.The strongest part of the writing was the development, connections, and introduction of the characters. Nick Cattaway fits the role of the narrator perfectly and provides a central connection among all the other characters. It allowed me to feel more sympathetic towards the characters because of Nick's sympathy for his friends. The order in which he introduces the characters and then slowly revealed how their lives were intertwined made for a very interesting story. My favorite of the introductions was the surprisingly low key intro to Gatsby. However, this character was the only one that I wasn't satisfied with, and proved to be the only flaw I found with the book.The lack of development of the character of Gatsby was very disappointing for me. After such a unique entrance, in addition to the title, I expected much more than the book offered. Although more is revealed about Gatsby as the story progresses, I still didn't feel a connection to the character. Since Gatsby was intended to be a mysterious character, that may be the reason the lack of information about him. However, there seemed to be a true depth missing that was hinted at, but was never fully communicated. This was especially true in the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy. The intensity of Gatsby's feelings seemed to be glanced over.Besides that minor negative point, the book was very good, and as a said before I recommend it to anyone looking for a short but enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This was a book that stayed with me long after hearing it read. I found Gatsby to be a very intriguing character because of his singleminded passion. I enjoyed understanding the thoughts and ideas of Carraway. The writing provided vivid imagery of a time gone by and yet it was a timeless story. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Why is this novel a classic? The answer is more than just Fitzgerald's wonderful prose or his use of imagery to convey messages. The answer lies in the way the characters in this novel teach us to look more closely at ourselves and our lives and notice things we might otherwise have missed.The novel's narrator, Nick, opens by telling us that he \\"tends to reserve all judgements\\" of people until he has gotten to know them. From this introduction, we come to see the flaw in Nick's reasoning. For he does judge people, though he chooses to remain silent about it, and we see his judgements as he introduces us to the people in his life. It seems that everyone around Nick is obsessed with money, particularly his second cousin Daisy and her husband Tom. Nick introduces Tom and Daisy by telling us that they \\"drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.\\" This excellent sentence tells us pretty much everything we need to know about Tom and Daisy, and the events that follow do little to change this perception. And then there's Gatsby. Wealthy, popular, mysterious Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties at his mansion and seems to be totally in control of his life. And yet he longs for something more: to be with Daisy, the woman he loves. But is he really in love with Daisy, or is he only in love with the person he thinks she is? This question plagues us as we read, watching Gatsby's facade crumble as he pursues Daisy throughout the novel. We know that something terrible is going to happen, we just don't know what it is. Yet we know that the relationship is doomed; Daisy doesn't love Gatsby, she is in love with his image. And through Nick's eyes, her true character is revealed. We see that although Daisy is beautiful, she is also cold, caring only for herself and her own happiness. Her true love is money, and she's married to a man who can provide her with what she truly loves. She cares little for the consequences of her actions. Nick's final assesment reads, \\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...\\"The lesson is powerful and important: things aren't always what they seem. The bible says that the love of money is the root of all evil, and we see this played out in the lives of these characters. In the end, Nick realizes that some things are more important, and so he has resolved to go on with his life and learn from Gatsby's mistakes. We, the readers, are touched and changed. That is why this book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I had to read this book in high school as a Junior and I didn't really get into it. In fact I really coasted through the book without really following it too closely. I decided to reread it and I was much surprised by how much I liked this novel.Fitzgerald has created a great portrait of a tainted American Dream. Through his character Jay Gatsby we see how the ideals of society have been corrupted. Gatsby made his fortune by dubious means, and pursues irrationally Daisy Buchannan, a very vapid individual who comes to tears over shirts. This is also symbolic of his the futile pursuit of happiness.Though this novel was written in the 20's, the message is still timeless. Anyone who thinks this is dated has not looked at the society we live in. We are practically in another me generation. People today don't have a care in the world. Having recently finished high school and being currently in college I have witnessed the sort of carefree vapid sense that most young people have. They don't have a collective thought in their heads other than drinking and partying. They also don't seem to care who they hurt in the process, sort of like Daisy and Gatsby in the car.The only drawback I can possibly see with this wonderful novel is the technical skills. They aren't great but they don't detract from the story. Fitzgerald does use a limited perspective and he does follow a cohesive plot, so the technical writing isn't too terrible.Overall this is one of the top 10 books I have ever read, and I have read quite extensively. So don't listen to the negative reviews, read this novel and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald is mainly known as a jazz age writer, as an observer of the flappers and his work is considered to be stuck in the past. Nothing could be further from the truth. This novel captures the American spirit in all its confused idealism, its expansive dreaming and scheming, the corruption in its childlike innocence and its penchant for pressing into the future without examining the past. The old money and its callous cop-out policies are still practised by the ones who can buy second chances as symbolized by the established Buchanans while neurotic upstart Gatsby is the forerunner of every motivated small town boy who makes it against the odds and finds out that although everything is for sale, including a brand new identity , all the power and all the glitz can't buy back the wasted youth or the heart of the ones who had their finger on the pulse of opportunity and rationale. The closer Gatsby gets to his dream the more remote its core becomes;not unlike an emotional fata morgana. Nick Carraway is the chronicler of this tragedy of illusion and leaves the wiser for having the veil lifted and seeing nothing more than a poor boy's broken heart in the swimmingpool of vodka and blood. The Wilsons from the wrong side of the track are a brilliant signifier of how the priviledged amuse themselves with the hardscabble folks for diversion but can effort to cut them at a moment's notice. Having means won't buy you love or real friends but it will buy you a clean slate again and again until you run out of real estate. Gatsby's real estate is his heart's yearning so he dies desolate because he bought the motivational speech and was never told that the new continent and all its attentant promises might make room for a new brand of hero but it can't change the human heart.A classic in the best sense of the word. A Greek myth remade to fit the size of the new world."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Most reviews of this book talk of nothing but the love affair of Daisy and Jay Gatsby. They never speak of the off balance, really modern relationship of Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker. Carraway is by far the character to watch, and the one that makes this book interesting. His constantly changing relationship to Gatsby is strictly human. Reading this book from the twenties is like reading a book from the nineties. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was far ahead of its time, and so was Nick Carraway and the relationships flooded throughout the book.The gossip aspect is very modern as well. Everyone at Gatsby's parties follow him around because of mystery. And that's what Jay Gatsby is about. Mystery. Even when the book is over, you never fully understand him.Overall, a great book, but not the best ever."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald's third and best-known novel, \\"Gatsby\\" is remarkable both for the degree of skill already evidenced by the 28-year-old writer and for the unmistakable turn of phrases, a hallmark of Fitzgerald's writing. My favorite aspect of Fitzgerald's prose is the way he was able to convey such precise shades of meaning, fearlessly crafting sentences that though wordy perfectly capture a character's emotions or a memory's effect.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is, essentially, a tragic story of love gone wrong. Is a lie told out of love less censurable than those told for lower reasons? Gatsby spins a cocoon of lies around himself, a cocoon from which he hopes to emerge as a new man worthy of Daisy's love. He emerges instead into a world of liars, and though on the face of things he is the biggest grifter of them all, Gatsby alone elicits sympathy: there is a degree of absolution due the creator of such a colossal deception. It is almost as if one is begging to be found out. Neither Tom nor Daisy nor Jordan nor even the unhappily married Wilsons have any such claim on our understanding. In the course of this story everyone lies to everyone else: only Gatsby pays the price. The truly creative liar is punished, the everyday tellers of banal lies go unchecked.I personally preferred \\"Tender is the Night\\", perhaps only because its longer and more complex nature allowed Fitzgerald more room to perform, to draw on all the powers at his command. But \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is definitely a worthwhile read, a relatively short tale told with the ease of a colorful memory."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I am a 17 year old high school student and I just read the Great Gatsby this year for my English class. I expected it to be just like every other &quot;classic&quot; novel, full of stogy prose and dated language. Instead what I found was a thorougly &quot;modern&quot; book, in every way. The descriptions, the characters, the situations, all seemed to be latent in society today. It made me want to be alive in the 1920's, a time of unmeasurable prosperity and creative talent."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Contemporarily, when one undertakes a classic literary paragon such as \\"Gatsby\\", it isn't usually just for the sheer pleasure of reading a \\"good book\\"...one typically reads it to feel the need to be connected to writing so sublime that one could almost draw spiritual innervations from it. Some, on the other hand, may feel the need to be grounded in literature so rich and provocative that upon returning to contemporary fiction, they then have a yardstick with which to compare. Others, still, may derive and extract lost emotions that only the classics can emote.Whatever vehicle drives one back to consider \\"Gatsby\\", the outcome can only lead to some interesting and, perhaps, novel conclusions. This reader's motivation, for example, was a recent reading of Dan Okrent's marvelous account of the bootlegging \`20's in \\"Last Call\\" a history of prohibition wherein Okrent describes disparate characters very much similar to Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby and the socio-culture of the \\"jazz-age\\" that is depicted so eloquently in \\"Gatsby\\". Whatever the engine, returning to this prodigious work by Fitzgerald, the reader is again struck by the grandiloquence of the wording, the grandeur of the scene setting, the power of the plot and the gut-wrenching and heartfelt sensibilities of the narrator as he and thus the reader are dragged along in a story so strong and powerful, we immediately recognize the brilliance of Fitzgerald as an archetype fiction writer and also, then, the work of \\"Gatsby\\" as his literary masterpiece.True, there are criticisms that have abounded for decades...the character development especially for Daisy and Tom Buchanan are almost deplorably one dimensional. Some of the criticisms of Gatsby follow this same line...he appears to be horribly shallow and unfeeling; immature in an unsettling way as to drive the reader to wonder what Daisy (no mature stalwart herself by any standard) ever saw in him. Also, the tragic Wilson's are almost laughable in their lack of earnestness and believability...Fitzgerald provides an antagonist that is almost too downcast, too disconsolate to be believable.And yet it all works. The overall drive for this work and, undoubtedly, the reason it has reached mythic proportions as a literary classic, is the nuanced and almost transcendent interventions of the narrator Nick Carraway. His profound and reasoned observations seemingly tie everything together. He is what makes this book work. Fitzgerald, after further consideration, probably had this in mind all along...if that was his intent, he truly was a genius.So whatever your compulsion, go back to West Egg, Long Island; enjoy an evening at the Gatsby mansion and immerse yourself in the early \`20's jazz age once again while experiencing expert literary storytelling. You'll undoubtedly find yourself marveling at the genius of F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work along with all the rest of us."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I often feel you can judge a book by the first and last lines.

It is relatively short for a novel yet it is an epic in ideas and idealism centering around the American Dream.

Scott Fitzgerald: The Great Gatsby, a critical guide from Columbia University Press. Though it's unsourced, it sounds legitimate - which is why I doubt I can say much about Fitzgerald's work that hasn't already been said. However, except for briefly commenting on the novel's classic status, the reason I've written this review is to assist those who, like me, may have avoided 'Gatsby' for years, and to help them decide whether to keep on doing so.I sidestepped 'The Great Gatsby' because I believed that this book, universally acknowledged as a classic, had to make its appeal for that standing to the broadest possible base of readers - an American Literature primer, so to speak. High-handed, maybe, but I've basically the same opinion since finishing the book as before. That doesn't mean 'Gatsby' isn't an excellent construction, full of interesting themes and motifs, and above all an insightful opinion on the American Dream - which I expected - but as an introduction to literature, I wonder what resonance 'Gatsby' carries for young readers confronted with the book today.Jay Gatsby, the self-made man, built out of nothing but now able to buy anything except the one thing he wants - Daisy Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the voice of reason, narrates the events - how Gatsby and Daisy, lovers before the war, are reunited; but despite all of Gatsby's attempts, he fails to lure her away from her philandering husband. Nick, disgusted with the excesses and unseemliness of both Gatsby's party crowd and Daisy's old money blue bloods, eventually decamps westward, returning symbolically to the common sense of America's heartland.It's not surprising that 'The Great Gatsby' wasn't successful in Fitzgerald's lifetime. After all, he chastised the people most likely to read his book for being part of the anything goes culture. Nor is it remarkable that there was a rediscovery of 'Gatsby' after World War II. In the Twenties, Nick Carraway was a perceptive man, and Gatsby a nave and complicit victim of the American Dream. In the years since, Nick looks like an altruistic fool, and, in the ultimate irony, Gatsby, who was facetiously called 'Great' by Fitzgerald, has grown into his title. Viewing his life now, it's difficult not to say that he conquered the Dream as he acquired a vast wealth, and his willingness to sacrifice everything for Daisy becomes a tragic flaw - instead of one last symbol in a poorly directed life.Fitzgerald warned that the pursuit of wealth wasn't enough, that it couldn't buy dreams - now the dream *is* the pursuit of wealth. Those tasked with presenting 'Gatsby' to succeeding generations must face a wall of misunderstanding - how to convince people that the wealthy Gatsby's inability to buy back his past amounts to failure? Or more importantly, why he even wanted to with all he already had. I'm glad that's not my job.In the end, though, I find a distinct lack of emotion in Fitzgerald's examination of the American Dream - it is instead an almost clinical post-mortem. No matter what the tragic circumstances surrounding the end of Gatsby are, I just can't muster up enough interest to care one way or the other. As a literature primer, it works because of Fitzgerald's skill as a wordsmith - as an effective or affecting work, instead of great, it is sufficient.This edition, with a preface and endnotes by Fitzgerald biographer Matthew Bruccoli, promises to be the \\"Authorized Text\\", a reprint of the Cambridge University Press 1991 edition. In a brief note, Mr. Bruccoli gives a few examples of some of the corrected textual errors, but I couldn't see much difference. Bruccoli's preface and the publisher's afterward were both interesting without becoming tiresome, though the endnotes seemed geared toward an inexperienced and ill-read student. Thankfully, the text wasn't dotted with superscript notation indicating entries in the endnotes, which I find very distracting. Overall, I doubt there's enough to distinguish this edition from a mass-market publication, except that it's in the trade paperback format, which I prefer if I plan to keep a book, and which is easier on the eyes the older I get."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I used this with my class of special education students (high school).

Unlike many other modernist American novels, it actually explores America in America from an American perspective. Like, it doesn't take place in Europe and it isn't about America compared to Europe. It is actually able to comment on American aristocracy as it is because of this, not as it is in comparison to other societies. So, seriously on the 'America' part of 'Great American Novel' is what I mean.I actually feel hesitant to write a review on it. Everything that needs to be said about The Great Gatsby is is the book. Everything I could write has been explained better by Fitzgerald. This is by no means a bad thing (check out my rating, come on), and in fact it's a great achievement.

END"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"During my college years, I was forced to read The Great Gatsby, and I must say that I'm glad my professor chose to force this masterpiece on me. It is my all time favorite book. Fitzgerald's last three final paragraphs could stand alone by themselves and they would still be considered a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I am now reading F.Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby for the fifth time. Each time that I read the work, it yields more gold. In many ways this novel is a metaphor for a failed American Dream; however, it is only one possible dream. I am not so cynical(yet) to believe that there is only one dream. Martin Luther King's dream of service to humanity is certainly a viable one that remains. Gatsby's only flaw was that he loved his mental projection of Daisy--his ideal woman. But the Daisy he loved and the real life Daisy were as different as night and day. The real Daisy was shallow,self-centered, and materialistic. Daisy could not love because Daisy was not really a person. Instead, she was a one-dimensional imitiation of a human being; her husband Tom is her male counter-part; neither one is a whole person. Yet, as Nick tells us &quot;They could always retreat into their money.&quot;In many ways, Gatsby has as much relevance today as it did for the twenties. In our super-materialistic, name brand society peolpe are brain-washed into pursuing Daisy-dreams of designer clothes, prestige cars and bigger, better houses.Maybe, Gatsby even has moral and ethical implications: To pursue the empty god of materialism(Daisy) is to choose death. &quot;Gatsby turned out alright in the end.&quot; At least, he found a reason to live and a reason to die(even if it was misguided).The Great Gatsby captures the emptiness of an American Dream."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A short book, a simple story, but Fitzgerald does things with the English language that few human beings have ever been able to do. This novel floats ethereally through the mind and settles in a place where it refuses to be dislodged. It is a pity that it is on almost every high school reading list because it is worth much more than the simple distaste that comes from most required reading. And what might be simple can also be classic. This is one of those books that resonates stronger and stronger with each succesive re-read. The movie (despite Robert Redford's presence) does the book absolutely no justice."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is certainly a period piece that pays tribute to the excess of the 1920s. But more importantly, Fitzgerald's writing style is an excellent model for fiction writers looking for examples on charcter development. The author's descriptions are vivid, enticing, brutally honest, and, as far as I'm concerned, flawless. A beautifully tragic book and a must-read for any serious scholar of American literature."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The setting of The Great Gatsby by F.Scott Fitzgerald plays an important role in the development of the novel. The unique way that Fitzgerald never refers to a specific year or era leaves it up for you to decide when you would like the novel to occur. Most people assume that the 1920's would be the most likely time period for the book to take place, but it is just as easy to say it took place in 1990. The way Fitzgerald did this leaves the book for the reader to enjoy as he or she so likes. Fitzgerald did, however, describe some of the setting. The West Egg and East Egg are perfect examples of this. He does not go into great depth to describe the shapes, colors, and proportions of these locations, but rather the characters surrounding them. During most of the book the characters you follow show you the atmosphere they are in, again leaving it up to the reader to chose how these places look. Fitzgerald's writing technique leaves it open for the reader to use their imagination more than any other book I have ever read. Usually when comparing a movie from a book I can think in my mind what I thought was similar and different. However, this book made it hard for me to disagree or agree with any of the scenes in the movie because Fitzgerald left it so wide open. Overall I think it was the best way to do it!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald looks into the hearts of his characters with such accuracy that you actually taste their pain when their glass shells are smashed. By the same token, you may never look at yourself in the same way again. An easy read, but a worthy one."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book not only tells the story of _The Great Gatsby_, but shows &quot;Generation X&quot; what it was like to live in the famous &quot;Roaring Twenties.&quot; Fitzgerald is a genius and has the best descriptions! Symbolism is prevelant throughout the book, so read carefully! The characters show the shallowness of people, and the idea that money buys everything...even love is hinted at throughout the novel. A definite must read. For those who read it at a young age, read it over again, you won't regret it. I read it sophomore year and I also thought it was a &quot;soap opera,&quot; but now _The Great Gatsby_ is my favorite book."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is probably one of the best novels of its time in the sense that it depicts the disillusionment of the Jazz Age to a tee! Gatsby's love for Daisy is not &quot;love&quot; in the sense that you or I know, but a kind of sick perversion or more aptly put - the inability for him to come to terms with his past. The need to have money and the need to be known in the Jazz Age is forever present in the book, and, from what we know of Gatsby's past, is something that Gatsby strove for his entire life. The reason his love affair with Daisy failed was because he had nothing! Love was not enough for Daisy in the relationship, and *her&quot; disillusionment was with her need for material possessions: money, cars, fancy dresses, fabulous parties, etc. I find the role of Nick in the entire novel to be somewhat strange since I think that it would have been a good story without his presence, and my favorite part of the book is when he realizes it is his birthday - as if that is something one can forget. Gatsby's death at the end is envitable since I think the book comes full circle. Gatsby is violently awakened, and, perhaps, never realizes his disillusionment. I think though the end of the book reinforces this sense of disillusionment with the American dream when Nick sums up his encounter with Daisy and her husband. They apparently carry on as if nothing had happened, Dasiy doesn't leave Tom, and Gatsby's &quot;role&quot; as a martyr is ignored. Not even the death of Daisy's former love could bring her out of her disillusioned state. Of course there are many other themes - the relationship between Daisy and Gatsby, the mysterious glasses which recurs throughout the novel and many more... All in all...a very good book historically, sociologically, and psychologically. I've read it at least four times and will probably read it many more times!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a must read book. I give it 4 stars because of the dramatic scenes and situations that Fitzgerald depicts. The book is an epic love story between Jay Gatsby and the lovely Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby who lives in a large mansion would throw tremendous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the insational love of the married Daisy Buchanan. During this story Gatsby follows his dream of getting Daisy back at any cost......even death of other people or himself as well. Fitzgerald's strong values and beliefs were clearly presented which is a very entertaining style to read. One thing I would criticise about this book is that the action of the story does not start until the fourth chapter, which discouraged my interest greatly."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Considered by many to be one of the greatest novels of our century, this book presents a vivid chronicle of the Jazz Age and is a tightly constructed work of literary genius. In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the married Daisy Buchanan.This book is a story of the American dream and Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means. Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new group aspires to the established rich values and so on.A strong statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is not a book soon forgotten. I read this book for a class of mine and totally fell in love with Fitzgerald's writing style. It is one that you can identify with so easily, as if you know exactly what he is talking about. The love story is somewhat common, that of a tragic nature, yet one truly feels completely saddened for young Gatsby at the end. Fitzgerald not only makes the reader eager to read, but you will find yourself eagerly grabbing for his other novels, all of which are equally superb."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald once wrote that a truly great writer should write &quot;for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolteachers ever afterward.&quot; How prophetic! Although I wasn't born until 40 years after Fitzgerald's death, the messages he speaks are as clear to me as if he were speaking in my ear. this american literary masterpiece, with its rich themes of time, devotion and the american dream is well worth its praise. Fitz knew it was his best work, and it's a damn shame he couldn't live to see it gain the respect of the world. i reccomend that anyone who enjoyed this book read more on Fitzgerald's life and you'll want to check out the short story &quot;winter dreams&quot; which resembles gatsby in several ways. If you ever make it to USC in columbia, s.c., go and see Professor Bruccoli's collection of F. Scott at the Thomas Cooper Library."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone! The book came recommended by the WSJ as a good summer read, so I figured &quot;Why not?&quot;. I was supposed to read Gatsby in high school, however, I chose to read Cliffs Notes instead - big mistake! It is a great read and moves very quickly.I read the book over 2 days during my recent vacation and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book brings alive characters that are often so present in our society and intertwines them in a great story. Fitzgerald has a great way with words. He describes things in such a way that you truly feel like you can see the person or object he describes.I could say more, however, I will leave you with this - - Just read the book. It is less than 200 pages and is definitely in my Top 10 of books."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"We listened to this while driving through Long Island reviewing wineries for About.Com, and it was the perfect accompanyment in so many ways. Fitzgerald's writing style is incredibly evocative - stirring vivid images in your mind of the mansions of East Egg, of the complex individuals that lived there and how they interacted. Each person presents one face to the world, while hiding a wealth of fears and desires. The scene where a car looses a wheel is one of my favorites - the witty way Fitzgerald turns words and plays with the individuals is just fantastic.This is definitely not a book to read 'on assignment', forced to hunt for meaning. It's a book to read in your 20s or beyond, when you see the way old loves can still call to you, when temptation strikes sometime to try to turn back the clock. But of course, you can't, as Fitzgerald demonstrates with such a wonderful style. There were so many scenes in this book that stood out as stellar, that sparkled in our minds.I think it's hard for a younger person to identify with some of the themes in here, just as it's probably hard for an older person to truly remember what it's like to be a teenager. It's the kind of book that, if you've lived through love and loss, battled years to achieve something you realize later wasn't worth it, you finish a passage and say ... &quot;Yes. That is it exactly.&quot;"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"With 381 reviews before me, it is clear that this one is superfluous, but since your eyes are reading these lines. Let me tell you what I think.I guess that this novel come into the hands of today's readers mostly due to the fact that it has been designated as one of the U.S. literary icons of the XX Century. Undoubtedly, the precision to detail and the smoothness used by the writer to convey its ideas is fantastic. My problem with it, is that the drama in which the love story is build seems rather silly. We have a character like Gatsby who is a young fellow who decided to become rich the fast way (smuggling and other unidentified dirty business) to gain social recognition for the sole purpose of being worthy of a rich girl of whom he had fallen in love. Nevertheless, the author never takes the effort to outline why in ruthless 20's, when wild capitalism was on the rise and pragmatism was the only name of the game, a person like Gatsby, who is the living symbol of those forces, who have laid more women that he can remember and who have \\"known the world\\" from every possible angle, decides to waist his life in pursuit of a romantic love and challenge the husband of her beloved with the tact and style of a 14th year old. Such situation just takes away all credibility to the drama. I guess the novel became important for the reasons so many of the other reviewers have expressed. He provided a frame of reference for the people of the 20's to perceive their own time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book.

Scott Fitzgerald, is a well written novel that explores the everyday life of a town through the eyes of an outsider. This onlooker sees not only the town, but every detail that paints a picture, for the reader, of the town and its people. The authors use of imagery is very good, because he uses great detail to from the smallest item to the largest disaster. He describes, in one part, a simple billboard for T.J. Eckelburg's, who is an eye doctor. Fitzgerald describes the billboard which has a great big pair of glasses with two eyes starring through, yet this is not only a good ad, but it also describes the town by a simple picture. These eyes describe, that everybody is watching everybody, and all is seen sooner or later. Through his use of imagery, a metaphor is produced, and the glasses and eyes are those of mainly Nick who sees all, but also of the townspeople, who sooner or later see all that has happened. This imagery also is used at the end of the book when the town is described as the fire is burning it down. This helps paint a mental picture of the destruction the fire did to all the buildings and the few people still alive in the town. All in all this book was a very good book because of its use of imagery which placed the reader with in the story making that much more exciting."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald proves why he is one of the biggest names of the Roaring '20's. He perfectly captures the elegance and hedonism of the period between World War I and the Great Depression.

This would make an excellent resource for anyone wishing to get a better grip on the 1920's."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Certainly one of the, if not the greatest piece of literature written by an American.

Most people have read it and most love it, but there seems to be a stubborn group of Fitzgerald-haters, so it's obviously not for everyone.The imagery stood out among all other good parts of the book. It is very lyrical, almost poetic. If nothing else, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a beautiful novel.Gatsby is the best part of the whole thing, too. Dark, mysterious, and rich, we never really get a good look at him (don't watch the movie for this reason), but he's an intriguing character, worth at least a glance.I don't know if this book is a classic, but I don't know what makes a classic. The story is well written and the scenery is gorgeous even if the plot is a little convoluted.

Greed and the lust of power are very dangerous. A reflection of a darkening America, the book is more relevant today than it was in 1925."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"At only 182 pages in the paperback edition, The Great Gatsby looms far larger in the life of American fiction than its slim dimensions. Unlike many novels with a great deal of hype latched to them, Gatsby lives up to its reputation in every blessed way. Perhaps part of the staying power and widespread appeal of this work is that it and its author were nearly forgotten. This powerful work was hardly read for more than 25 years, and now it is widely assumed to be one of the greatest works of American fiction in the 20th century. It earned its kingdom through dark years. From amnesia to aggrandizement shows that behind the swirl of its reputation is a powerfully complete artistic vision. Like all great work, Gatsby can be read on many levels: as a critique of the shifting American psyche, as a critique of the pitfalls of capitalism, as a time capsule of the roaring 20's... each reading brings new surprises. Perhaps the most refreshing reading is the uniqueness of the language. Fitzgerald here created prose masterpiece. Every sentence is finely wrought and cleverly designed, like jewels in an exquisite setting. He created, as he stated, a consciously artistic achievement."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is not your typical fictional novel. In this book you will find mystery, excitement, rule-breaking, parties, and shady characters that surprise you with every turn- all of which I was not expecting when I began this book. F. Scott Fitzgerald added these elements in a 1920's setting- an era in which there were many social changes. The main theme presented in this book- you can't relive the past- is relevent even today. We all live in the here-and-now- what's in the past is in the past for a reason, and trying to alter that will cause problems for many people- as you will find in The Great Gatsby. We can all get something out of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, no matter your age!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This is not a perfect novel. The characters are underdeveloped. It is difficult to care about some of them either way. The story line is melodramatic, and it does not break any new ground.However, the real joy of the book it the language it is written in. Try reading it aloud. You will appreciate the rhythm and the cadenza of how each paragraph is constructed. You will not find a book that evokes its settings more vividly than this one. This is a short book, but it is to be read slowly. Savor every moment. You will be rewarded."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read this book after having known the plot and ending, through another novel, The Double Bind by Chris Bohjalian. I figured it sounded interesting and thought I would read it for myself. Having known the ending didn't make for the most exciting read, but it was good. More than that, it was more about what the novel represented and did not say.I won't go through the plot. The 1920's were a fascenating time and this novel helped capture that. While it was also written during this period, it had very much a sound and tone of an older novel which did take a little getting used to. Overall, I'd describe it as a little more bland or plain spoken that what you might read today. The character development was done with finess and the story was brought along to the conclusion masterfully. Towards the end you just wanted to skip through to see how it would end.Overall it's a tragic tale. There's a lot of tragedy in the book, however it's interesting how the author choses to present this to us, in a matter of fact way. What really resonates with me is the topic of the past and how some of us are prisoners of it. And how often a first love, may be your only true love. The notion that maybe you can recapture this one day, is something I think many can relate to. Great novel, I'm glad I decided to finally get around to reading this classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald captured one of the great truths of American life: that a person can \\"reinvent\\" themselves. We are not bound by our accidents of birth. He also captured one of the sad truths: too many people spend their lives chasing an illusion. In Gatsby's case, it was the illuions of the happiness that comes from being in the \\"moneyed\\" class. If Fitzgerald were writing today, I would bet that Gatsby would be chasing celebrity culture, equally pointless and equally seductive to so many. The developing friendship between Nick and Gatsby is interesting to watch, as Gatsby at first tries to ingratiate himself with his money, and then realizes he doesn't have to and finally opens up to have a real friend. When Nick informs Gatsby that he is worth the lot of the rich put together, it is a culmination of something real, not the illusion. The book captuers the roaring 20's well, but can also translate easily into our time. It is justifiably considered a classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Did you ever want to go back? Back to those great times? That's what Gatsby wanted to do but he additionally wanted to CHANGE THE RULES too!This work is told from the perspective of a third party about a determined man, Gatsby, who fails to secure an early love, a vain immature gal, Daisy, and now that he's hit the big time and has become a high-roller, he wants his Daisy back (even though he never had her to begin with) -- and he's willing to go to any extreme to OWN her.The setting is the 20s, a period of excess and near social insanity in New York City in particular. Gatsby puts his plan into place and things go fine for awhile in that Daisy responds quickly to his overtures. But what Gatsby never figured on is that Daisy is a mile wide and an inch thick. She RE-responds to her husband's overtures to come back, albeit this act is spurred on by a personal tragedy and the death of a near-innocent.Gatsby, in the meantime, has inadvertently set into motion a chain of events over which he no longer exerts control and, ultimately, it leads to his demise.This book is arguably Fitzgerald's best work and it's bulging with symbolism and metaphor. It's a book that is set apart from most others of the period and now is thus referred to as \\"literature\\" -- quite the professionally written novel.It's not for everybody but if you're up for reading some great prose, you love scandal, and don't mind all the subtle ethical lessons that accompany the work, then this one is probably for you.Tom Wolf wrote a very similar work which was all about having rotten friends and the parallel excesses of a much more contemporary period, if you're interested:The Bonfire of the Vanities"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This novel may have a bit of a negative association for many past and present American high schoolers, myself included (two decades ago), who were forced to read it. And it is a touch boring. But other than that it's a great book, especially considering that the author was only 29 years old when it was published. It flawlessly captures the excesses of the roaring 1920s in the Hamptons of Long Island, through a group of characters who are each distinct and not easy to forget. The description of the wasteland surrounding the shop of the mechanic, George Wilson, is a very interesting way to contrast the lavishness of the Hamptons. And there actually is a fair amount of action in the plot that intensifies the psychological aspects of the story.

I am a junior in highschool who has recently finished reading this book. I happen to believe that you are older than me and yet, I understood the book better than you. Why don't you read it a little more carefully next time? There aren't any unanswered questions. Gatsby's work is subtely mentioned in the book after Gatsby's death when Nick picks up a phone call that was meant for Gatsby. On page 174, Nick is confused by what the man on the other line wants from Gatsby. &quot;'Young Parke's in trouble,' he said rapidly. 'They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter.'&quot; It goes on to tell how it actually happened. If one read closely enough, it is obvious that Gatsby was not a bootlegger, as believed by Tom, but a white collar criminal who created counterfeit bonds.I also do not enjoy seeing comments like &quot;teenagers don't appreciate books, read it when you grow up,&quot; because I really liked the book and am sure that many other teenagers appreciate it too."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book is a glimpse into the jazz age and the glamourous parties of that time.

It was a very intriguining novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though at times I found it somewhat difficult to follow, and found myself re-reading paragraphs to better understand it. At first I believed the theme to be that of a love story, but further reading brought me to find the main theme, which was the American dream in the 1920's. The dream was to become wealthy and socially excepted by a higher class, even if it meant going against your morals. I think I like this novel because I can relate the dream of the 1920's to be very similar to that of today. This connection helped me to stay interested and better understand what the theme was about.My favorite character was Nick Carraway even though he had no desire to achieve this dream. He possessed a very strong character and did not give in to the immoral things his neighbors did, which separated him from the rest. Nick was the middle man and it was interesting to see how he learned of everyone's affairs, even his cousin's, which he had a hand in setting up. He was also the narrator, so his ideas and views influenced the reader's feelings about the story, as we saw the account from his point of view. This is the first novel that I have ever read where the main character was not in the beginning or end of the story. Nick was the person who was important in the beginning and end of the book, though he was not the main character. This approach was very appealing and pretty amazing. Jay Gatsby was another character that I found interesting. He was the main character of the story and was who the novel revolved around. He was a young man who made his millions illegally and only did it to win his long-life love back. And that is why at first I believed the theme to be about love.The ending of the novel was very attention grabbing. I would have never guessed it to end that way.

But I did enjoy it and was impressed that such a charismatic story could be told in just over a hundred pages.

I was given a close look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Thought it was written 80 years ago, I realized I could relate to the characters--their lifestyles and personalities are still applicable to life in America today. This book speaks to the reader, allowing them to feel the same emotions the narrarator is feeling, experience the same events the narrarator is.

The description is through the eyes of a cynical, mysterious and a wierd man which is why it gives the whole story a different outlook, but that what i enjoyed best, this book it written so differently from what we're used to read, the man gatsby, his stories - all taken so cynically by the narrator nick, i love the way he puts it and then how he ultimately becomes so credible that he takes everything as it is given by gatsby. Gatsby's lust for money and love for daisy is icing over the cake, the end's just a little sad but that makes the book a classic. I think it's a must for the lovers of classics and to those who want to write in future, it's a piece of the finest writings i've read.

The eloquence with which Fitzgerald writes with is somewhat rare, however the story would not have worked had he not.

It's a plot that you don't get engrossed in, but one that you eventually want to know the outcome. Recommend it to anyone? Yes. It's worth the read. Rave about it? No. It's not worth arguing if you meet some opposition."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I usually hate the books I have to read for school, but this one was the best book I have ever read.

That first time I read it, I thought it was extremely boring, and couldn't even get past the first 8 pages. However, when it was assigned to me in my English class the following year, I learned how rich it was in it's symbolism and style. It really made me question where our society is headed in terms of ethics and materialism. I can see how people who may not totally understand this book will find it boring and slow, as I had experianced it when I first read it. However, I recommend it as a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone in high school or above."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel that is probably one that I will be able to remember for the rest of my life. I say this because it has so much to do with the realities of today, not just of the early twenties. These include issues of love, social status, and money. Following the life of Gatsby makes you realize how much all of us has experienced at one point in our lives what he is experiencing. The novel was well written with numerous methaphors to give readers their own interpretations of different scenes. Take for example the locations of East Egg and West Egg separated by the harbor, symbolizing the separation of the rich and the poor and that Jay Gatsby may never be with the woman he loves. This and many other things make this a great book. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys to read."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The ending seems quite abrupt, but that's not necessarily bad.

There's no disputing why people still read this great American novel, and I was moved this time around more than ever. I originally read this work in college, and only mildly \\"got it\\". Actually, I wondered what the fuss was all about, but maturity brings wisdom and reading this now, in middle age, makes all the difference. Actually, in today's terms, Gatsby is the 1 per cent. (Need I say, this read couldn't be more apt due to one of the presidential candidates?) The prototype could not be better. Both Gatsby and his wife, Daisy are so shallow, not minding the eventual fate that meets them. Of course, Nick Carraway is a great witness to that demise. Written in the 1920's, it proves classics remain this way for a reason: good story matters. Good characters matter. Only so many books today meet the test."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A little bloated; overrated classic.

What amazed me is how so many of Fitzgerald's phrasings remained with me during that time. It was like the story and the characters were timeless. My perspective on some of the individuals, however, did change. As a younger person, I saw Daisy as a more innocent actor in the final tragedy. As an older person, I recognize her silent complicity in evil. Years ago, I also saw Nick as naive. This time, I recognized that, in many ways, he grows throughout the story and becomes a good man.This is the first book in my lifetime that I've re-read. Based on the experience, I imagine I'll be doing it again and again with books I read as a younger person."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I'm assuming this book is considered a classic. I don't read the classics that often, so I wouldn't know. But anyway, I've heard of this one all my life, and watched part of the movie a couple times, I think. The other day, it so happened I was in the mood for literary fiction, and already having an armchair historian's interest in the 1920s, I waded in.Story-wise, I didn't quite know what to expect. Turns out, the plot is an age-old standard about a poor boy's devotion to a privileged girl. Thrown into the mix is a rags-to-riches theme, a couple intersecting love triangles, the futility of material ambitions, the disease of wealth and much analytical fodder for social anthropologists.Gatsby is great, as I see it, only in his heroic determination in conquering the world (well, financially conquering a significant piece of it, anyway) to win the heart of the narrator's cousin, Daisy. Daisy is one of those girls who is fun and bubbly at casual social events, held at arm's distance. Under her attractive surface, however, is a shallow, vapid conformist hardly worth the efforts Gatsby has labored at to ascend to her snobby caste. Daisy's hypocritical two-timing blowhard husband is even less likable. Though Gatsby has amassed his wealth by extra-legal means, he was by far the most sympathetic character for me, even without the poignant destiny.I don't know if this was considered light reading in 1925, but today Fitzgerald's prose would befuddle all but the most literate. Not to say he meanders into introspective tedium as James Jones did 30 years later. Fitzgerald reminds me of Victorian-era authors who spent considerable time spelling out their observations of subtle human nuances/intuiting/speculating about the cognitive patterns they translated to. It's actually enjoyable, and didn't tax my 21st Century attention span too often. It was obvious, however, that F. Scott's favorite word was \\"vitality.\\"There is a murder, of sorts, in this novel, but the mystery that makes it worthwhile is the title character."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I thought the book would be a in a little better shape, but it is still in its binding so I guess that's okay, thank you for the speedy shipping."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I purchased all six of these books from the Canadian Amazon website (amazon.ca) several weeks ago because I couldn't bear to wait any longer for them to show up on the American site.The covers are just gorgeous.

The inside flap of the cover is perforated and is designed to be removed and used as a matching bookmark.The cover art for this set of F.

I read it for the first time after college, and hated it. Now, 10 years later I have read it half a dozen times, and find it to be a richer and richer experience every time.Fitzgerald was a talented writer, and there are times that the prose in this text is breathtakingly good. But that is not what makes this novel stand out as one of the greatest pieces of truly American literature. Rather it is the eternal optimism, sometimes misplaced, of Gatsby (and some of the other characters) that keeps calling to the reader long after the last page. Fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the American ideals and persona, and he did it in the guise of a love story. There is no better description of the indefatigable American spirit than the last page of this novel. It is literary perfection, and even if the book that preceded it was not incredible it would be worth the price.I won't rehash plot points here, but I will say that in Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan Baker, and the amazingly well drawn Tom Buchanan, Fitzgerald created a cast of characters that will long reign as one of the most recognizable in the canon of American Lit. I recently reread this novel for a book club, and it is no coincidence that despite the many varied reactions to the book, everyone agreed that Tom stood out. We all knew a Tom in our lives. It speaks to Fitzgerald's honesty as a writer that one of the least likable characters in the text is one of the novel's standouts.Don't read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" because you have to. Read it because you want to. And then put it aside and live a few more years of life. Then come back to it. You will be amazed what you will find in its pages that you did not find before."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I've read this book several times, and each reading shows me something else that I didn't know before.

No matter how many times I go back and re-read this book (that I was first introduced to as a sophomore in high school), it never fails to take me to a different time and place.I love the descriptions of the lazy and decadent ways of these characters and the struggle Nick Carroway has to be a part of them. I love the scandals that are around every curve. But, most of all, I love the easy-going manner of Gatsby himself. He's quite possibly the greatest character in all of American literature and I feel that, often times, he's the least appreciated too.I've heard many say that this novel is \\"too slow\\" or \\"too descriptive\\". But, I really feel that Fitzgerald was trying to completely overwhelm the reader with excess. It's an underlying theme in this novel and his writing style makes the reader feel the fact that money can not buy happiness. Sure this novel is wordier than some - But there's beauty in each and every carefully chosen one."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I have always loved FSF's writing. His prose is beautifully poetic. This is his best work by far. The book comes alive in this reading by Alexander Scourby. I have listened to this recording probably 10 times over the last few years and I never tire of the story or the way it is read. I have also listened to the version read by Tim Robbins and he doesn't do the book justice. He portrays Gatsby as kind of a dour fellow. I have always viewed Gatsby as the ultimate romantic and that is how he is portrayed by Scourby in this reading. I cannot recommend this audio enough."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a difficult novel that successfully polarizes readers, especially ones who take it seriously. That marks great literature. When serious readers react oppositely to the same work, you know you are looking at good, if not great, art. Please note, too, that the range of reviews today mirrors the range of reviews that greeted this book when it arrived new in bookstores over 80 years ago. You can easily search those then-current reviews on the Internet for your own amusement and instruction and once again be surprised over how little people change. For some of us, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a wonder, while it leaves others wondering at us.To describe briefly the novel: Set in the American 1920s at the height of a stock market boom in the Roaring Twenties, this novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, a wealthy, young Ivy League graduate who's learning the bond business on Wall Street. Nick tells us about his life at the time as it connects with a second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, from Louisville, who is married to the fabulously and formidably wealthy Tom Buchanan. Tom and Nick schooled together at Yale where Nick had an uneasy relationship with the larger, wealthier, and crueler Tom Buchanan. The story unfolds with Nick, Daisy, Tom, and an attractive female golf pro, Jordan Baker, out on the glistening lawns of the wealthy sections of Long Island. Fold in Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson and her clueless, but devoted husband, George, and we have a strong story, but nothing about this Gatsby guy. Only when we are well into the story do we hear about the title character, Jay Gatsby, and he is slowly brought into plot and character development. Gatsby has been driving this novel from the beginning, but we don't know that. We learn in subtle, indirect fashion that Daisy and Gatsby have a mutual past that neither our narrator, Nick, nor her husband, Tom, discern or know. And in that past connection we grasp the proximate, animating force of the novel: Gatsby loved Daisy then and loves her now. The novel unfolds as Daisy learns that Gatsby owns a mansion across the bay from her estate. The old lovers cross paths again - one forcing the reunion, the other gliding into it - and we have all the action that will drive the remainder of the novel. I reveal nothing more and observe: The novel is simple and obvious, a story of wealthy, sophisticated people in boom times, with a narrator watching a married couple that has romantic rivals.The basic plot and character in part explain why serious readers can be so seriously divided over \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Virtually everyone who dislikes the novel finds it to be simplistic, boring, and obvious. Gee whiz, let's try to get interested in people who have everything in life yet have trouble doing anything in life well. Tom and Daisy have it all, yet are stupid, shallow, and thoughtless people. Gatsby at least strives for something better and while he achieves great wealth, notoriety, and popularity, he, too, suffers from problems that should be easy to solve given his talents and resources. Jordan Baker, the female golf pro, is successful, famous, and attractive, but alas she can't make her life work. And, Nick, our narrator, seems to observe everything well, except for himself. All in all, we have a cast of characters who warrant scorn, dismissal, and contempt.And yet, other serious readers see Gatsby as a great novel, a work of art. How?Start first with a quality that almost all serious readers notice and admire: The writing. Fitzgerald writes romantic sentences with a Hemingway edge. His words are at once beautiful and descriptive. Even readers who overall disparage the book, heed the writing, and marvel at it. The voice is unique, esthetic, and sharp. Gatsby is Fitzgerald's finest writing and certainly some of the best writing in English anytime. But writing skill alone will not save this book for some serious readers.What earns this disdain, I think, is found in the deceptive simplicity of the book. At a genuine level of analysis the story is rather easy to grasp, understand, and evaluate. Especially if you are reading this book under requirement as it appears many students experience, the psychological demands of the classroom (it's required, a specific timeline, deadlines for completing various chapters, assignments in class or for homework on the book, etc.) I think lead many readers into the worst outcome for a reading class - you read to survive the course rather than for your own simple entertainment and education. Under these conditions, the obvious, simple, and designed elements of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" attract immediate attention in the short term demands of required reading and lead some readers to obvious, simple, and designed conclusions about the book. If you've \\"had\\" to read Gatsby, give it a year, and try once again. It's not a maturity issue. It's a motivation issue: Read it for yourself on your own terms.If you read for yourself, you can reflect on complexities in the book. Realize first that Fitzgerald writes differently about Tom and Daisy than he does for Nick or Jordan Baker, or the minor, but important characters like Myrtle and George Wilson, but most especially for Gatsby. With Tom and Daisy, Fitzgerald tends to offer direct and immediate observations of their behavior and thoughts as if he is looking them right now with a God's eye view and telling us about them. He really gets under the skin with Tom and Daisy. With Gatsby, by contrast, most of the writing is a narrative recounting of the past that is cloudy, perhaps misremembered, and operates as description with little interpretation or with contradiction from an unreliable narrator (Nick). This makes the characters of Tom and Daisy seem like high quality photos while Gatsby comes off more like a portrait done by an Impressionist painter: Clearly a portrait, but with shadows and no sharp edges. Tom and Daisy are objects. Gatsby is all subject and he becomes a Rorschach test allowing us to project ourselves onto him.Next, you need to be alert to absolutely crucial plot actions that are briefly presented and can be easily missed. The climatic action of the story in particular requires the reader to do a lot of work and keep certain actions in mind through a long series of character reactions and developments. Recall the scene late in the book that takes place in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Who's in the scene? What do they say to each other? How are relationship conflicts resolved? Then, the characters move rapidly out of the Plaza Hotel and drive back to West and East Egg in separate cars. How do those car rides manifest behaviorally the relationship conflicts resolved earlier in the Hotel? Stated another way, in the Hotel we hear conflict and resolution. From the car rides we see how that conflict and resolution play out in action. This sequence is the ultimate plot point for the novel that drives interpretation. You need to read it carefully.Finally, you need to relate what we hear and see regarding relationship conflict and resolution with the interpretation and understanding of Jay Gatsby. You'll recall that Tom and Daisy are bright, detailed, and sharp characters while Gatsby is vague, shadowed, and blurry. You can try to understand Gatsby through the events that occur following the car rides back to the Eggs. For you see, the whole point of the book is in what happens to Gatsby and what happens to Gatsby is caused by his character. (So, Fitzgerald exemplifies that maxim that all writers steal and that good writers steal from the best which in this case is Fitzgerald stealing from Heraclitus!)For many people the basic theme of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is this: Be careful what you wish for. I think at a simple level of analysis this is true. At a deeper level (one that follows my suggestions above) I would refine that theme into this: Be careful what you aspire to. For me, this novel is a great cautionary meditation on the American Dream and its less pleasant possibilities. In positive form, the American Dream is that you can be more than you started with. That explains in part why this book is often required for younger readers in high school or college who are taking their first real steps toward realizing their own American Dream. Fitzgerald offers Gatsby as a caution to those of us who think that aspiration past our beginnings is a good thing, a desirable thing, and the point of ambition. Everyone in this novel aspires to be more than they seem to be or who they are. Everyone in this novel suffers loss, failure, or disaster. No one in this novel leaves with any awareness of why they failed. Yet most of the characters can be described as either great challengers to the American Dream or else already living the American Dream. How is it possible for such failure to occur?In my eyes, the answer is found in the last sentence of the novel: \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" Aspiration moves \\"against the current.\\" Ambition motivates us not to a positive manifestation of the Dream, with the Dream as the Vision or Goal of one's life, but rather ambition motivates us to a negative manifestation of the Dream, with Dream as Fantasy or Psychosis or UnReality. And for those of us who aspire, we will find ourselves \\"borne back ceaselessly into the past\\" a modern Sisyphus doomed to push the stone uphill to the crest only to see it roll down to the valley every time.That is a soul-chilling thought. Isn't this kind of ambition a good thing? Don't all good parents aspire for their children to aspire? Doesn't it all fall down if we don't aspire? It is not that anyone in the novel aspires badly or stupidly or illegally, but rather that they aspire at all is the root and branch of their failure. Here, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" argues that it is ambition itself that will cause people to fail and worse still to fail without insight and repair, for as long as you continue to aspire you will continue to fail.This is an interesting and heuristic interpretation. First, it breaks free of the simple and obvious surface appearances and misdirections that divert some readers: It's the 1920s and irrelevant; it's about a bunch of spoiled white folks; it's about the vita loca. Clearly, there's a lot more going on here and it requires careful, thoughtful reading and reflection. Second, it explains why Gatsby is still appealing to so many people even after 80 years. It turns out that we are still living in a Modern age and the current Postmodern foolishness is explained by the past: Gatsby and Tom and Daisy and Nick would call themselves Postmodern today. The American Dream here is the defining element of Modernism and the fact that we're still aspiring the same old way like Jay Gatsby connects with us at a deep level. Third, it reinforces the perceived greatness of the novel that many readers see and continue to see. This is not only a well written, well structured, pretty novel, it also addresses eternal human nature and the repetitive futility we experience in life. Gatsby is dramatic philosophy, a better written Platonic dialog.Or so I think."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The beauty of this book is that Fitzgerald's elegant prose flows so nicely into the story being told. It is wonderfully written, but not distractingly so.I can't give the book 5 stars -- I save that for only the books I truly think are perfect -- but The Great Gatsby is definitely worth reading. For anyone who has ever felt that deep sense of purpose or meaning in a world that feels bloated with socialite zombies, Fitzgerald's novel is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald broke literary ground with this novel. His style--clean-chiseled characterizations and sentences that cut to the chase--was unlike the work of his contemporaries.Most novels that influence literature in this way die a short death. They are stylistically innovative, but soon other writers perfect what they pioneered. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of simultaneously innovating and perfecting. In that, the novel is pure genious.The Great Gatsby is the saddest novel I have ever read, because it goes to a deeper level than just tear-jerking. It ends in a place of complete emptiness, despair, and loss. It's a book that will satisfy you emotionally and intellectually, and also a book that will show you how powerful true emotion can be."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It is true the story is not particuarly Original, but to qoute the wisdom of solomon The only reason something is believed to be new is because we have forgoten the past. It is extremly well written with lavish description that is not laborious, but enjoyable. The choice of Narrator as Nick carroway is brilliant, as it gives proper perspective. I don't believe the Previous reviewers understand what Fiztgerald was trying to convey. The perspective reminds me Seneca's Thyestes in the it is about are desire to fill the emptiness in our souls.

Inevitably, the story ends in tragedy. Really, the story centers around the main character's dream to find a relationship. This dream ended in adultery and murder. The character, Nick, from which the story is told from in the first person, gives this conclusion,\\"His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him....Gatsby believed in the (dream), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"In a sense, the story is a dark account of humanity's failure to achieve happiness in pleasure, relationships and money. In trying to achieve these things, mankind ruins lives. In the end, we find that the wealthy, popular Gatsby only has three people at his funeral. While the number of people at a funeral is not a marker of success or happiness in life, it does show that attempts at popularity, wealth and power does not add up to much in the end."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read the Great Gatsby for school in my junior year of high school and loved it.

Jay Gatsby moves into a mansion across the bay from his former lover and throws a continual party in hopes of winning her from her husband. The carnal excesses of the Jazz Age ensure that this won't end happily for anyone, including the seemingly detached narrator, Nick Carraway.Kids, skip the Cliff's Notes and just read this one.

I also think many people don't see the depth that there really is in this book. It's not just about love, or romance. It is the persuit of a dream, a dream that is not all that it seems. A dream that is represented through one character, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is an illusion. Read it."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It was a fast paced, thrilling ride through all the love and mistakes that we make. A brilliant novel by Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a classic of American literature. Many people have read it in school, but I came upon it later in life. I admire the beauty of the language and the story. No need for me to comment on the symbolism, etc.- many others can comment more intelligently.After reading it twice now, and appearing in a bit part in a stage production of the novel, I have had time and opportunity to reflect on the book. What sticks with me are the characters. Tom Buchanan is a blustery bully, but very vital and interesting. His wife Daisy is beautiful, period. Gatsby is a fool who refuses to grow up. The &quot;love of his life&quot; is taken by another man and he should just get on with it. He is attractive and magnetic- he could find any number of beautiful, intelligent women to be with, but he fixates on the unworthy Daisy. His tragedy seems to be his inability to live in the present. So that gives us Tom and Daisy in the category of People I'm Glad I Don't Know and Gatsby in the category of People Who Need a Vigorous Kick in the Seat. However, the character who ended up making me angry was Nick Carraway. He is so often mentioned as some kind of Greek chorus. This is not how I see him. I see Nick as the one person who could have done something or even just said something that might have averted the tragedy of this story. He does nothing. He sees people make bad decisions and do stupid things and doesn't say a word. In fact, he helps things along. Obviously, Fitzgerald would never have written it any differently. Gatsby with a happy ending would have been forgotten immediately if ever published at all.It's a wonderful read, and part of the American Lit canon. I do recommend The Great Gatsby, but I can't get the bad taste of Nick Carraway out of my mouth."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Gatsby is simply the greatest American novel. Enough Said. I believe the Publisher's Afterward, by Charles Scribner, is excellent as well."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest American novels ever written. Much has been said of it supposedly chronicling the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;, but I think the themes are much deeper, penetrating the heart of what it means to be an American. The prose is near flawless, and the character of Gatsby is equally enigmatic and familiar. The idea that America is a place where one can continually reinvent oneself and spin a life out of dreams is as prevalent today (maybe more prevalent) as it was in the 1920's. Gatsby's seduction by this myth and its tragic consequences shows Fitzgerald's complete understanding of the limits and and even dangers of such a romanticism. The themes aside, his command of words, paragraphs and structure is something that all writers aspire to."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can, says Gatsby. Essentially, this is the prototypical Great American Novel - that old cliche of pop literary culture so often used by writers and laymen alike. The book conflates America's promise of the past, corruption of the present, and hope for the future. It is the beautiful and ugly side of American ambition, optimism, and sense of invincibility that makes so many Americans feel immortal.The story, which Mencken inevitably declared to be a trivial anecdote, is nevertheless an exciting look into twentysomething romanticism. Glamorous parties, nouveuax riche and old money values colliding, the luxury of youthful idleness, whirlwind romance. This is the perfect book for a high school student with dreams.More than anything, this book struck me as a metaphor for timeless American ethos. Gatsby makes the paradoxical attempt to move against the tide of the future to bring back the past. He wants, like so many people, to bring back that magical moment in his life when he thought life was eternal, the world was beautiful, and he was the biggest man in it. He wants to recapture the love that opened a plethora of infinite possibilities, turning his back on the reality of changing times and changing people.Gatsby's greatness is in making himself and others believe the sublime fantasy that thinks itself real. He wants his Daisy as so many other people have wanted theirs - pure, perfect, and existing solely for him. The ambition to defeat life may become tragic, but it never gives up hope - the hope of a better, stronger tomorrow. And in the end, it is action that moves the world, but it is hope that keeps the world alive."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"If I was a high school student forced to read this and have to answer test questions on it, I would not think so highly of this book. However, now thirty and coming to this on my own I found a book that has righfully earned it's place among our few American classics. At first, Fitzgerald's poetic and economic prose takes some time getting used to. I found myself rereading certain passages. It did win me over though, after the first page where the narrator defines personality as &quot;an unbroken series of successfull gestures.&quot; He has other witty observations throughout and I was surprised to see how funny the book could be at times.Symbolism aside the story is a decent, readable one. The premise is a young man starting out in 1920's New York after the end of Worls War I whose next door nieghbor is the self-assured but mysterious Jay Gatsby. This may seem boring to some, but I hesitate to say more at the risk of giving anything away. Trust me, there more to it. At first it meanders, seeming to string a series of almost random but interesting vignettes depicting the jazz age. For those who may want to give up on the book at that point, I say don't. Fitzgerald has been setting the reader up. The other shoe drops halfway through the novel. Also a note on the characters. Even though you may not agree what the characters are doing, at least it invokes a reaction. Which is more than I can say of the &quot;classics&quot; that I was forced to read in high school.The themes in Gatsby are very poignant. Showing us how fragile dreams and perceptions, both self and outside, can be. And that sincere intentions do not always come from honest sources. Is this the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;? I don't know, I have a few more books to go before I make that assumption. What I can tell you is that I has a pleasant time reading this one and see why many people think so."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a novel set in 1920s New York City that precisely captures the mood and tenor of what came to be known as the Jazz Age. The story focuses on the flashily affluent Jay Gatsby, who made his fortune through dubious means, his more modest neighbor Nick, Nick's captivating cousin Daisy Buchanan and her wealthy husband Tom. Gatsby hopes to use his material success to win the adoration of Daisy, who happens to be a love from his past, before he went off to war. However, Gatsby\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d ends up paying a heftier price - his life - for the girl he has passionately but secretly pursued through the years.On the surface, The Great Gatsby seems like a book designed solely for leisure reading purposes. But dig beneath that surface, and the reader excavates some philosophical themes. For example, since Daisy did not marry Gatsby at the time of their affair because he lacked wealth, when Gatsby returns from the war, he is intent upon making a fortune in order to lure her back to him. His efforts ultimately doom him, reflecting the dour consequences of material obsession. Additionally, Gatsby's fervent focus on Daisy after so many years have lapsed exposes the peril inherent in clinging too closely to far-fetched fancies.But while Fitzgerald deftly works these themes, sometimes his commentary on the moral substance of his characters is ambiguous. He appears to revel in Jazz Age excesses, as portrayed in Gatsby's elaborate parties and in the characters' periodic jaunts to the city. Yet, through the sober-minded narration of Nick, Fitzgerald also seems to indict Gatsby for his ostentacious display of wealth. Furthermore, Fitzgerald draws Gatsby in a dualistic way - he simultatenously shows him as a man of principle and as a starry-eyed fool for persistently pursuing Daisy. But perhaps Fitzgerald simply wants us to make up our own minds about Gatsby rather than preach to us, or maybe he wants to show how human weaknesses can serve as strengths and vice versa, depending on the scenario.The character of Nick is credibly drawn; he represents temperance, but also passivity, as he appears to float on the fringes of his friends' lives rather than actively indulge in them. Indeed, as narrator, Nick allows us to see the story through his eyes, and while we never lack insight into his feelings, we also never feel pressured to see things his way; Nick's tone is calmly questioning rather than priggishly pedantic.Tom Buchanan as a vapidly wealthy and viciously philandering spouse is artfully conceived; whether he's flaunting his latest love at a party or speaking haughtily about the menaces of black economic progress, reader disdain for Tom is never far from the surface.But it's Daisy Buchanan who steals the show in The Great Gatsby; a mishmash of contradictions, Daisy exudes a sultry charm that masks a profound restiveness with her current lifestyle. She wants desperately to break free from her stifling circumstances, and Gatsby provides the catalyst for her to do so. Yet, she is constrained by convention, and Fitzgerald permits us to feel the tragic dimensions of her fate throughout the story. This tragedy is never more apparent than when at a tense gathering that includes Gatsby, she reluctantly (and not altogether believably) concedes that she has loved Tom, despite her earlier assertions to the contrary.The Shakespearean conclusion of The Great Gatsby will seem heavy-handed to some, while other readers will embrace it as a logical c\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001dulmination of a story infused with melodrama. But one thing is certain: The Great Gatsby will leave an indelible impression on readers with its instructive themes, intriguing plot, and realistically drawn characters."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Jay Gatsby. The most sophisticated, popular, extravagant man on West Egg Island. The host of lavish, extraordinary parties, sprawled across the gardens of his enormous house, filled with aristocrats, vibrant colors, jazz music, laughter, and the tinklin of glasses. A personable young man if there ever was one. A friend to all, and fond of calling them &quot;old boy.&quot; And above all, an Oxford man. Or is he? For it seems one can never fully trust Gatsby and the stories of his past. The occasional uncertainty d hesitancy in his voice, as well as frequent inquiries, investigations, and juicy rumors, contradict the his words. Jay Gatsby is the hero of F. Scott Fiztgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby, an captivating novel full of intertwining stories and characters, and the revelation of the first connection is intriguing enough to leave the reader begging for the next. A won rful story, The Great Gatsby is laced with mystery, and spiced with a dash of romance. The tale unfolds itself in 1922, on the Long Island provinces of West and East Egg Island, the latter being the more fashionable of the two, and the island where Daisy and Tom Bucanan reside. Daisy is a sparkling young woman and adored by all that meet er. She is sociable, polite, energetic, enthusiastic, and positively delightful, complete with a voice resembling lilting music notes. But this bright girl isn't all she seems; even lovely Daisy has a passionate secret. Her husband, Tom, is an athletic an, the epitome of arrogance. His eyes are always described as &quot;flashing about restlessly.&quot; The former football hero demands dominance over all, especially over the women in his life; his wife, and his over-the-top, full-figured mistress, Myrtle Wilson. t is only when he feels denied of this control that he shows emotion. Across the bay, on the West Egg, lives Daisy's cousin, and Tom's college friend, Nick Callaway, who also happens to be Gatsby's neighbor (just some of the slew of intertwining connec ons between the characters). Nick is the narrator of the story, and does well in presenting an objective view of the string of events that take place. Perhaps this is because he lives by the rule to not criticize others. However, he is incredibly percep ve, and whatever criticisms and opinions he does take on become completely justified to the reader, biased or not. Nick is forever changed by his encounters with Gatsby, but still remains able to continue his normal life, leaving any stinging memories b ind. Perhaps this can be attributed to Jordan Baker, who can be considered the anchor of sanity, or the accomplice for the plot basis. Jordan, Daisy's good friend, moves through the story to become Nick's love interest, but also serves as the source of e missing pieces of the story, the glue between other characters, without being incredibly integral to the connections themselves. As said before, The Great Gatsby is a wonderful whirl of mixing and mingling pasts and presents. It focuses around Jay Gatsby and his quest to recapture the love he had and lost five years ago; Daisy, who loves him in return. However, between elaborate chemes and secret meetings, the two must conquer husbands, mistresses, death, tragedy, and pass the test of true love and loyalty. And despite how much readers come to wish them well, at times their happy fate is wholly uncertain. Through the tangled story of Gatsby and Daisy's romance, and the web of characters and events that surround them, Fitzgerald makes it painfully clear to his readers that people are interminably connected, and the actions of one can start a chain that e ects the lives of many. And, contrary to main-stream fictitious happiness, love does not always prove to be pure and true, or prevail over all. Although The Great Gatsby eventually proves itself to be a simply engrossing novel, the primary story line can be difficult to deeply fall into. The first seventy-five pages can seem dry and lagging, as they primarily consist of explaining how Nick cam to live in West Egg, and retelling seemingly unimportant encounters with several of the characters, probably simply a method of presenting them to readers. However, with the introduction of Mr. Wolfshiem, a shady character, as well as the conversation b ween Gatsby and Nick that precedes that meeting, the plot thickens tremendously. It is with these two events that the mysterious story and the intertwining pasts begin to unfold themselves, and readers will find themselves immediately entranced by the s uence of events to come. The Great Gatsby, though not entirely difficult, should also not be tackled by those who find expressive language and metaphors troubling. However, once readers have become aquatinted with Fitzgerald's writing, his exquisite use of language and metapho will become apparent. They will find the lavish words find even necessary to match the sophisticated nature of the characters. He makes exceptional use of metaphor, best exemplified by his description of Daisy's voice. It is praised time and time again, nd is said to retain the quality of music, notes that will never be played again, the sound of tinkling money, and glowing and singing noise, the sort that the ear follows up and down. Jordan is also frequently said to &quot;balance objects on her chin,&quot; def ing the way she holds herself. And just outside of New York is an area where everything is apparently made from ashes, and the piercing blue streams of sky are solely referred to as &quot;the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg.&quot; These metaphors help to paint a wo erfully vivid picture, making sounds and sights come alive, full with depth and meaning."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I suspect that there are three types of readers.1) People who read just to read a good story2) People who read for the beauty of the prose and the beauty of the way the story is told3) People who are a combination of bothI myself am #1.

That is why I gave the book three stars. It was easy to follow, but still only mildly interesting. I guess as I study literature more, I will come back and reread this book."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A good plot plus an engaging writing style make a bestseller. Sometimes, those elements are combined with a third: the story makes us think about ourselves, and life in general. It's only then that we have a classic...In my opinion, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is just that, a classic. It was first published in 1925, an the author set the background of the story in the 1920's, the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;. Disregarding the fact that particular period of history is already distant, this book has managed to mantain its edge.But why does that happen?. The plot is interesting, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is the story of Jay Gatsby, a poor man who fell in love with a rich young girl named Daisy, who ended up getting married to someone who had as much money as her parents. All that happened before the beginning of the story, that starts quite a few years after that marriage. Daisy is quite unhappy (in a rather superficial way), and ready for a change when Gatsby enters again into her life, as good-looking as ever but with much more money.The story is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, who is Daisy's cousin and who happens to meet Gatsby in one of the party the later organizes. Nick is a catalyst in the story, due to the fact that he puts Daisy and Jay in contact again after many years of separation. However, and more important, Carraway makes the book remarkably more interesting for the reader, making commentaries from time to time regarding what is happening. In the book, Nick says &quot;Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known&quot;.At the very least, Nick's role is an effective way that Fitzgerald found of involving the reader a little bit more in what's happening in the story. Most people can identify with Nick Carraway because he doesn't go to the extremes where the other characters permanently are. Gatsby, and his relentless persecution of a love that never was, that can end in nothing else that pure tragedy... And Daisy, so frivolous and vain, so thoroughly engrossed in herself that is incapable of true love...All in all, I liked the story, but I especially enjoyed the way in which F. Scott Fitzgerald writes. His style is very simple, with only some metaphores that don't obscure the meaning but help to make it clear. He is also quite concise, as evident from the fact that this book has little more that 200 pages.I think it is probably wortwhile to point out that what really makes this book a classic, instead of merely an enjoyable book (not that there is anything wrong with those!!), is the fact that it deals with many themes all of us deem important, for example love, dreams, lies, justice, social differences, hate, money and what it can (and cannot) buy...From my point of view, this book is more than worth your time and money. I only wish the ending had been different... The book would have lost some of its dramatic air, but I would have been happier. Even though I know it is rather silly, I prefer happy endings. I hope you notice that despite that, I still recommend &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to you. I really don't have other choice, because it is really a great book :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"After living abroad in the Middle East for a year and traveling through more than twenty-five countries, I recently re-read The Great Gatsby, seeking the familiarity of America. The Great Gatsby captures what is different about Americans and the American experience. At its most basic, America represents endless striving for greatness. Whether in business, science, athletics or world affairs, Americans imagine and seek the best. Though we often stumble and fall short; though we often cut corners to achieve our dreams - striving for greatness is the essence of America. In Gatsby, we feel what it is like to want something so badly, to succeed in reaching it and to ultimately fail. How many of us have not shared these experiences in some way or another? American writings today, such as David Ebershoff's Pasadena (2002) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002), continue to explore Gatsby's central theme of obsession with greatness. In this time of global uncertainty, we can get back in touch with what it means to be an American by reading such books."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"...of course, that's just my opinion, and I obviously haven't read everything that's been written (or even a minute fraction of it!). However, I've never come across anything that so captured the profound wonder and sadness of the human condition. There are passages in The Great Gatsby which took my breath away, passages so perfect I couldn't believe that someone was capable of writing them. Hunter S. Thompson once said something to the effect that he couldn't imagine one word being added or taken away from this novel. Surely that's one of the highest compliments one writer could give another (it also gave me a newfound respect for Hunter S. Thompson, but that's beside the point...). Like most of Fitzgerald's work, The Great Gatsby holds up well as a period piece on young America in the Jazz Age. More importantly, it is a timeless metaphor of mythical proportion. The green light on Daisy's dock is the longing that drives us all; our dreams dissolve in the moment of fulfillment, leaving us with the bittersweet realization that it was only the dreams themselves that gave our lives beauty and meaning."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Amazon.com, I don't know what was wrong with the last 2 reviews I left. Hopefully, you'll print this one!This book may have been written 80 years ago to this writing, but the message is no less relevant. Greed and the lust of power are dangerous. Our hero Jay Gatsby becomes a victim to the American Dream. All because he has a crush on the conceited airhead Daisy Buchanan. The problem is that Daisy is already married to arrogant rich bully Tom Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story, remains Gatsby's only true friend. It is not for nothing Nick tries to warn Gatsby of the so-called upper class: &quot;They're a worthless lot! You're worth the whole d___ group put together!&quot;"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald would have been better served as an evangalist. Perhaps he would not have died from a coronary doubtless related to his depression and alcoholism.The book is told through the impressions of Nick, a middle class fellow, and revolves around Mr. Gatsby. A man who has replaced the fortitude of spirituality with the frailty of materialism in the hopes of acquiring a woman, Daisy, hardly worth his disdain let alone his life.The story reflects the deeper truth that rationality and science alone cannot solve our problems and certainly cannot supplant the need for a higher purpose in life or belief in a higher power. To do so leaves a void too often filled with materialism which is a cheap substitute.This is exemplified in the characters of Tom Daisy and Jordan, souless wraiths who drift aimlessly from place to place draining the life of everything they touch. Even Tom, who has every conceivable material possession, betrays a longing for days gone by when he was revered as a football hero presumably since this was the only title he ever earned.Gatsby is a compromised and tragic figure partially redeemed only by his solitary quest to fulfull an adolescent meaningless fantasy. Unlike \\"old money\\" he has a goal however trivial.The fulfillment of his goal is anti-climactic as with all objects pursued solely for possession and display. The empheral joy of possession is replaced with the enduring meaninglessness of his life and the eventual ignomy of losing Daisy.The end of the story shows the illusion of Gatsby, a young wealthy eccentric enigmatic gentleman, dissipated by the reality of Gatsby, a hollow common criminal consumed by the desire for a used mindless woman.With the contemporary obssession with materialism, in the form of youth, beauty and wealth, to the exclusion of all else the book is more relevant today than it was then."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Truly outstanding.

If you have any hesitations, read it."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I'd like to emphasize that The Great Gatsby is not the best or greatest American Novel, but that it is a perfect one. Contradiction? Not really, because The Great Gatsby completely encapsulates what it is like to be American, particularly in the 1920s. It perfectly illustrates all the qualities that people fear and admire in the American people: ambition, power, privilege. Its flaws don't qualify it as the &quot;greatest,&quot; but it is still pretty amazing! A lot of reviewers dissed this novel because of the &quot;ordinary&quot; plot, supposedly reminiscent of a soap opera. Well, where do you think all those soap operas (and movies, etc.) got their plots from? For better or worse, Fitzgerald and his contemporaries recreated the modern novel, just as Shakespeare (another high school nemesis, I'm sure) recreated theatre. Without Fitzgerald, we wouldn't have Douglas Coupland, or Jack Kerouac, or a host of other writers who, directly or indirectly, were influenced by Fitzgerald's clear writing, time-line crossing, sense of emotion. Granted, many inferior writers (like the soap opera ones, and by the way, how do you know soap opera plots, anyway?) have taken Fitzgerald's innovations and created awful versions. But what can you do? Originals always spawn copies."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald did with Great Gatsby in literature what Orson Welles did with Citizen Kane in film: he made something sweet and sublime and simple and complex and brilliant.

The love, the murder, the partying? You can find the same things at your average weekend kegger.

Fitzgerald's fantastic style and flair completely engulf the reader, and lets you fall in love with the characters.I'd like to point out one thing. i read this in an English 11 class, and while some high schoolers may fail to understand much of it, I took so much from this book. perhaps it is the way in which the teacher presented it and developed it in class (assigning each character to a student along with many perspectives on symbols in the book - colors, parties, etc) Everything in this book fascinated me - the characters, the parties, the colors, and so many other things - I was nearly overwhelmed. I recommend it to anyone who can look past the outer shell and see the symbolic meaning and theme of this novel.ALso, I'd like to question the review by Aaron Goldberg. He criticized Tom for being a racist. He's intended to appear that way, it's the way many people in the 1920's thought, and it remains today. I don't understand how calling Wolfshiem a &quot;small, flat-nosed Jew&quot; is racist, if it is merely the description of a character. he's got a flat nose - that's racist? And the fact that TGG and DB never get together? It';s tragic, it's supoposed to show that all the money and wealth in the world cannot ensure you happiness, and to not let missed opportunities of the past bog you down in the future. And as for a &quot;dated&quot; book? That's the purpose, it is set in the 1920s, Fitzgerald wrote it in near-pefrect sync with the era.Some people just confuse me when they cannot look deeper into a book and hrasp literary concepts such as setting, irony, and symbolism.Anyway, read this book! It's a great!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I just enetered the 9th grade and, as a requirement, i had to read 4 books over the summer. After a visit to the book store and a chat with a salesperson i decided on The Bean Trees, Of Mice and Men, Cold Sassy Tree, and, The Great Gatsby. As a teenager i am insulted at the thought that we(teenagers) can't fully appreciate this book and would simply pass it of as trash and refuse to read it. I LOVED IT!!! and I have at least 3 friends who agree with me. We were all able to understand and discuss the book and found no cause for complaint. I would read it again in an instant. Just because i'm a teenager doesn't make me any less literate than the next 20 something year old."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"When I first read some of the reviews that stated that high school students could not appreciate the boor, or that they were not sophisticated readers I laughed. I remeber reading the book in high school and loving it, disecting it, reading critical studies and articles on Gatsby. But, after reading one of the reviews that discussed Tom's racism, anti-semitism, etc. and failure in chronology I am now inclined to agree that the book may go beyond some high school students, and in a their zeal to deconstruct a text before having any of the proper background, maturity or tools can not appreciate what is one of the finest American works ever written. The mistakes in chronology are minor and insignificant to the point and power of Fitzgerald's work. The racism is a crucial aspect in Tom's character. And rather than going on to explain why I suggest that any high schooler who misses this takes another reviewers suggestion and try again a few yeras later. No one has to like this book, but there is a reason that this may be the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; and if you don't understand that you may need to wait a few years."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Beautifully written and still relevant today.

There are some who call it \\"boring\\", \\"pretentious\\", \\"pointless\\" and most of all, \\"confusing\\". However, the beauty in this masterpiece is Fitzgerald's weaving of what (we can conclude) he may have witnessed in his own life of wealth, carelessness and debauchery. He had a way of seeing through people's facades and getting to the truth of a person's heart, and then revealing these truths in deceptively simple ways. There was his genius.Jay Gatsby is one of the great tragic heroes of any time. He has amassed a great deal of wealth, but doesn't know what to do with it. He uses it to throw parties for people who don't know him, and who don't care that they don't. His myth is bigger than he is, and so he doesn't set them straight. He is a pathetic, lonely creature who comes alive again after he reunites with Daisy, his lifelong love. But this happiness, too, is elusive and fleeting. And it is his undoing.My favorite parts of the work are the descriptions of the times, the people, the places. When reading this book we are afforded the opportunity to cut through the glitzy, glamorous depictions of \\"the roaring twenties\\", and instead see the darkness, emptiness and loneliness all that glitz was supposed to be covering up."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"With a singular obsession, Jay Gatsby manoeuvers every dollar of his vast fortune to cradle a woman he thinks he loves. Throwing elaborate parties with a guest list that includes anyone who wants to show up, Gatsby builds a mansion just across the way from Daisy, the object of his obsession.Circumstance thwarts all of his goals, the futility of his quest never completely realized. Gatsby is as tragic a character as the inevitability of his failure. Gatsby, \\"pa[ys] a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\"The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a somewhat solemn and restrained fellow who never really expresses what he wants to say. His virtue, however, is his silence and profound honesty. He says so himself: \\"Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\\"The Great Gatsby is a stunning tale of remarkable poise and literary quality. Fitzgerald is the epitome of the highschool English teachers dream--he appreciates the English language, and takes the standard approach to literature very seriously. The book is a tour de force of depth and contrast, and an exploration of the King's English. The author has taken pains to diversify his word choice, and the texture and depth of his language.Here's a passage that demonstrates Fitzgerald's quality as a writer: \\"There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward teh drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated teh surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.\\"Yikes. Enough to give you goosebumps, isn't it?Highly recommended, and worth the praise."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"In college, when I asked my literature professor to name the greatest novel of all time, without hesitation, he mentioned Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. I then asked what he thought was the tantamount novel by an American. He offered three, Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, and The Great Gatsby. I had already read Moby Dick and Huckleberry Finn while I attended high school. However, my high school failed to include The Great Gatsby in its curriculum. I vowed that summer (1993) to read Gatsby. Since then I have read it two more times and savored each subsequent reading. I now understand why The Great Gatsby has received such an exalted position in the literary stratosphere.After his first two novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and the Damned, F. Scott Fitzgerald said he wanted to try something \\"exciting and new.\\" His creation became The Great Gatsby, published in 1925 to modest success. It wasn't until later that Gastby became regarded as Fitzgerald's masterpiece.The Great Gatsby is a short novel and can be completed in a day or two. The ease of reading The Great Gatsby belies its intricate plot and evocative prose. Gatsby perfectly captures the prosperous, carefree era of the 1920's. The novel appealed to me because of its Long Island setting. East and West Egg are Manhassat and Great Neck. Jay Gatsby, the novel's protagonist, had a love affair with Daisy Buchanan that ended when Gatsby went to fight in World War I. Gatsby lost his fortune thereafter. Daisy married Tom Buchanan while Gatsby was away. To regain Daisy's affections, Gatsby uses unscrupulous means to garner money. Tom Buchanan refers to Gatsby's bootlegging. Gatsby throws lavish parties at his home thinking Daisy might attend. Daisy won't leave her husband, even though she knows he is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, thus creating tension between Gatsby and Tom.The American dream does not become a reality for everybody. Although Gatsby's wealth can afford him a luxurious house overlooking the Long Island Sound, it's the wrong currency for recapturing Daisy's love. Daisy and Myrtle are both materialistic characters and money clouds their perceptions. Daisy ignores her husband's affair with Myrtle due to Tom's wealth. Although Tom treats her terribly, Myrtle is shallow and only sees Tom's affluence.The Great Gatsby also vividly displays Fitzgerald's adept utilization of foreshadowing and symbolism. The car accident in Gatsby's driveway at the beginning of the novel provides a case in point. When one reaches the end of the novel, this scene will become more poignant.The late comedian Andy Kaufman, to the consternation of his audience, incorporated a reading of The Great Gatsby into his stand up routine. This is a testament to the stature the novel has attained in the last sixty years. Gatsby is the epitome of the perfect novel. The Great Gatsby has become my favorite novel of all time, with Anna Karenina being a close second. I would recommend everyone read the book before seeing the mediocre Robert Reford film. I like Redford, but I thought he was dreadfully miscast as Jay Gatsby. I hope my high school English teachers now provide The Great Gatsby to their students. They will be treated to a genuine literary masterwork."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"When I learned that the Modern Library Board had selected the Great Gatsby as the second most important novel to be written in the English language in the twentieth century, my first reaction was &quot;Uh-oh. What did I miss.&quot; So, after twenty-five years, I picked up the novel again. After reading the novel for a second time, even with the Board's lofty ranking always in my mind, my original opinion remained unchanged.Although I have always been astounded by the beauty of some of Fitzgerald's prose, I considered his story of ambition, the &quot;American Dream,&quot; and lost love as somewhat trite and predictable. That opinion did not change with this reading. I still saw the plot as being too contrived, the characters too thinly drawn, and his theme of the corruption of the &quot;American Dream&quot; better handled by Dos Passos, Dreiser or even Nabokov. So why did the Modern Library give this novel such a high ranking? I am still unsure. And I might be so presumptuous as to suggest that even Fitzgerald would be surprised; after all, during his lifetime the book nearly went out of print. I guess that many critics, following the lead of Lionel Trilling, see the character of Jay Gatsby as standing for America itself, and the novel as the most American of American novels.Even though my opinion of the novel remained the same after two readings, my overall impression of the author grew. I have always associated Fitzgerald with wealth, as an author with whom I could have no connection. This prejudice affected my reading of Tender is the Night, and has remained for twenty-five years. Now I see Fitzgerald in a more human light, a man haunted by the same desires that drove Gatsby, and like his chief character, a man who could not give up his dreams, or his &quot;old warm world.&quot; Both Gatsby and the author lived lives of silent desperation, moving slowly toward thier dreams, passing through the ash heaps of American society under the sightless eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is narrated by the simple Nick Carraway and tells of the intricate lives of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. Fitzgerald creates a perfect mix of love, happiness, wealth, betrayal, and suspense. Through the use of the characters and their love, the reader can picture the times of the roaring twenties. From astonishingly gorgeous parties of the wealthy Jay Gatsby, to the simple beauty and innocence of Daisy, Fitzgerald convinces the reader to truly believe his writing. He writes with a style that creates beautiful and sometimes frustrating images for the reader. His descriptions utilize precise detail. As one reads Fitzgerald's words slipping across the page, one can witness exactly what is being described. Fitzgerald's techniques of using descriptions and detail prove helpful. Moving beyond style, the book pushes past the basic storyline and becomes very symbolic. The characters, setting, and events that take place are all telling of the American dream in the twenties. It depicts people who let wealth determine their lives. It emphasizes how money and people's desire for money can stand in the way of true happiness. The Great Gatsby is a well-written novel that creates a telling depiction of life in America in the 1920's."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is an important book, make no mistake. It is also the finest novel of a very fine novelist. At a time when America was just beginning to realise that it was as susceptible to corruption, greed and self-delusion as every other country on the planet, Fitzgerald wrote a book that really does capture the moment a nation founded on ideals realises that ideals are hard to live by.Gatsby, the central anti-character, is a mere shadow, a man who reinvents himself to win the heart of the girl he think he loves. The foundations of this infatuation and subsequent reinvention are rotten and the result must be rotten too. Fitzgerald writes beautifully, his words tinged with the sadness and quiet desperation that flavours the whole novel, and his characters all seem to sense that their lives are built on precarious ideas about success, happiness and love.The Great Gatsby is a very honest and acute portrayal of a nation built on the misbegotten assumption that you can be whoever you want to be, and the consequences that that belief holds. More importantly it is a brilliant and moving novel."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book was initally forced onto me as a high school junior, and, like all the other students, I first groaned and braced myself for the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a good read (with a few psychological aspects)... it's a classic that just doesn't seem like a classic"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I found it practically impossible to enjoy this book because it is about shallow, careless and carefree people. Because the characters are extremely dull and flippant about life, I found the book itself to be a dull read. It was like trying to swallow terrible tasting medicine. This book certainly does not attempt to tackle any of life's problems. I give this book two stars rather than one, however, because Fitzgerald deserves credit for the mystical, beautifully flowing,light, prose which he uses. I particularly enjoyed the beginning of the chapter of the garden party at Gatsby's mansion, as well as the end of the novel."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This is an excellent novel, filled with fascinating characters and recognition of superficiality. Gatsby (born Gatz) is a man of mystery, almost like Kurtz of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Much like the Conrad book, a certain aura surrounds Gatsby--he is a man of mysterious abilities and unknown origins. I would recommend to anyone this story about a bootlegger whose prepetual party comes to a fatal end."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A very good story to say the least but it was a little hard to understand. I had to re-read paragraphs to get a grip on the story a little better but I assume the book reads like that because it was written so long ago using the &quot;language&quot; of that era. I read this along with my daughter as suggested by her English teacher. The book did spark conversation about the early 1900s and some of the &quot;symbolism&quot; in the story, which was enjoyable. It's a classic and worth reading but it's not what I call a page turner."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I would grant four stars to the book \\"The Great Gatsby\\", since in my opinion, the book was good and very amusing in some parts, but at the same time very boring in others. I would recommend this book to a specific group of people, because I believe that this book is not one that any person can read, because other individual's help is required to understand some parts. The book in my opinion was not entertaining in its first parts, when the characters are introduced and you begin to know each one of the lives of the different main characters. When I could overtake half of it, my opinion towards the book started changing, because as the different events started to be introduced in the story, I began to involve myself more and more with the book. Finally, when I reached the end, which from my point of view, is the most interesting part, I realised that it was a good book to read, but if I had the opportunity of reading it again, I would not do so."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald hit the nail on the head in this book when he makes a scathing comment on popularity. He portrays popularity as a fleeting status in this book. Gatsby is the center of attention in his life with huge parties and a grandios lifestyle, but when he passes on, only a few good freinds show up at his funeral. A great book from an author who was never fully appreciated in his time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It is very difficult for me to understand why the average rating given The Great Gatsby by reviewers isn't five stars. In my view this is one of the greatest novels ever written -- perhaps even THE great American novel. This book is so well written that it would be a pleasure to read even if it didn't have a plot. But it does have a plot -- one that is both well constructed and quintessentially American -- as well as characters so well-developed one feels that one knows them.

It captured the readers attention from the start and kept you clinging to the fascinating storyline. It displayed true human character, without trying to sound impressive. A simple, yet understated work of fiction. One of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The American Dream--as it arose in the Colonial period and developed in the nineteenth century--was based on the assumption that each person, no matter what his origins, could succeed in life on the sole basis of his or her own skill and effort. The dream was embodied in the ideal of the self-made man, just as it was embodied in Fitzgerald's own family by his grandfather, P. F. McQuillan.The Great Gatsby is a novel about what happened to the American dream in the 1920s, a period when the old values that gave substance to the dream had been corrupted by the vulgar pursuit of wealth. The characters are Midwesterners who have come East in pursuit of this new dream of money, fame, success, glamour, and excitement. Tom and Daisy must have a huge house, a stable of polo ponies, and friends in Europe. Gatsby must have his enormous mansion before he can feel confident enough to try to win Daisy.What Fitzgerald seems to be criticizing in The Great Gatsby is not the American Dream itself but the corruption of the American Dream. What was once--for Ben Franklin, for example, or Thomas Jefferson--a belief in self-reliance and hard work has become what Nick Carraway calls \\"...the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.\\" The energy that might have gone into the pursuit of noble goals has been channeled into the pursuit of power and pleasure, and a very showy, but fundamentally empty form of success."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The vitality, innocence and ambition of our heroes, the shallow pleasures of material success, the ennui of the rich, the tragedy of failed love, racism, the failure of the rule of law, the lack of respect for real virtue and sacrifice; this all sounds like America to me.Add drug dealing, the NFL, Vietnam and better electronics and the plot could easily make decades disappear. And we believe that we have a culture with &quot;constant change&quot;.This is as close to 'our story' as anything I have ever read."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is, by my standards, the best novel written in tha States during the last century. It is a sad love story, but at the same time is a reflection of the inexistence of the second chance. The characters are rich and beatiful, but dark and condemed. Since I read The Great Gastby, I have never been able to see the past naively."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I really liked this. It's short and simple, beautifully descriptive and carries within it the weight of great devotion and tragedy. It's a book one would call a work of art. I would read this for a taste of the fabulous lifestyle of the rich, decadent and charming in New York at the height of the Roaring 20s. Also, for Gatsby's utter devotion to a lost dream, the depth and the consequence of such a devotion.If anything, I felt the characters of Nick Carraway (narrator) and Jordan Baker weren't built up enough. Fitzgerald's method of description wasn't too much to my taste either. It was rather amusing when at one point, within the same conversation, he uses &quot;inquired Jordan humorously ... said Jordan helpfully ... snorted Tom contemptuously ... demanded Jordan crossly&quot;."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I reread this book recently, not having read it for at least ten years, and it held up beautifully.

Terrible ignorance of youth. Have since read it a half dozen times. Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, book. Sad as well. Mis-guided love. Great Friendship. Glimpse of the social elite.

I'm more jaded now and understand more of the nuance in the book than I did my first go around.However, what hasn't changed is my love of the rhythm of the words, of Fitzgerald's painting of characters and of Jay Gatsby himself. I still dream of that era and of the gorgeousness of the soirees at his home, thrown only to attract his lost beloved, Daisy.Still a wonderful fresh read after all these years."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"If F. Scott Fitzgerald's estate could get paid a penny for every writing student who has read excepts of The Great Gadsby in books about writing, his estate would be worth a trillion dollars with accrued interest. There are several pennies that I added, but I didn't know where to send them."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a humble character from the Midwest who finds himself surrounded by a wealthy crowd of people. Nick lives across Jay Gatsby, a mysterious figure who surrounds himself with extravagancies and people he considers extravagant. Gatsby's idea is to rekindle his romantic relationship with Daisy Buchanan, who's since married Tom Buchanan. Nick reintroduces Daisy to Gatsby. Gatsby's relationship with Daisy is based off of a lie and they never get back together. Daisy stays with Tom. Gatsby's killed in the end by a delusional widower.What \\"The Great Gatsby\\" does best is captures the fickleness of upper-class society. Gatsby who was not born into money adores Daisy for her popularity and money. Gatsby lies to Daisy and tells her he's rich. Not content with himself, Gatsby's idea is to become rich so that Daisy will continue to love him when they're reunited. Fitzgerald succeeds in telling the story from Nick's point of view. Nick is intrigued by the glamor that surrounds him in New York, but never submits to the notion that money will provide him with happiness. Nicks quiet demeanor allows for Gatsby to go about his wasteful spending uninterrupted. When Nick finds Gatsby hiding in a bush outside of Daisy mansion, the hollowness of the upper-class is put subtly into perspective. Together, Tom, Daisy, and Gatsby create a very comedic dynamic. The three are all so rich that they're bored and their meaningless pursuits lead them ironically into some of the most primitive confrontations.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is simple to read and this style compliments the characters the book is written about intelligently. There is nothing solid behind the glitter that cloaks Gatsby's life. By the time Gatsby dies, it feels about right, because by the end of the book, it's clear he's nothing \\"great\\". Fitzgerald does an excellent job of keeping the novel moderately paced, as the story feels that it does all characters involved justice."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald's masterpiece stands the test of time. The decadence and callousness of the characters make them hard to like, but riveting as well. The lyricism of the language is not to be found in many authors today. Gatsby, for all his failings, still may be the most likable of the cast of characters because he does realize there is a world outside himself. A tragic tale beautifully told. It will be a challenging read for most contemporary readers, but it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The first time I read The Great Gatsby was for school and at first I was apprehensive about it. After completing a few chapters my worries were swayed and I realized that this book would become one of my favorites. The story follows Nick Carraway around New York and his interactions with the citizens of this pretentious society mainly Tom, Daisy, and Jay Gatsby. One aspect of what makes The Great Gatsby such an excellent and timeless novel is the character development. Gatsby's character is mainly developed through interactions with Nick and Nick's descriptions and opinions of him. Also, Fitzgerald's prose and syntax come off naturally and help the flow of the novel and the accessibility of it as a whole. The tale of unrequited love and the yearning to live in the past was very identifiable to me which in return made the novel overall more appealing. Upon rereading The Great Gatsby, this time purely for pleasure, the story and the characters overall felt more real and deeper. It seems that this is one of those novels that every time you read it again it gets better and better. I have now read The Great Gatsby about four or five times and it never loses its appeal or meaning through re-readings. Isn't that what a timeless novel should do? If that's the case, then The Great Gatsby is definitely a classic novel not only because it fits the formula, but also because it's full of superb writing and characters. It's the perfect novel for someone who is unhappy with their present state or someone who loves a person but they do not feel the same way, or if you just want a well developed story that will change the way you look at things. Overall it's an excellent story that everyone should read at some point because we all of the tendency to want to relive the past and can learn the pitfall of this from none other than Jay Gatsby himself."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I chose The Great Gatsby as an outside reading for my advanced placement English class. I'm not a fan of fiction, but the synopsis of the novel caught my attention. Who doesn't have an American dream? As I read the novel, I found myself pitying Gatsby and loathing Daisy. But Gatsby kept tearing at my heart. Morally, he had some issues, but I do admire his honesty to himself. I do recommend the novel to anyone who enjoys the era of the twenties and a character who fails to see the flaws in the one he thinks he loves."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a brilliant piece of literary fiction by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story takes place in the 1920's and centers itself around the American Dream. With the Jazz Age as the backdrop to the story, the characters act vividly within a world of glitz and jealousy and rage. It might be the best written literary work I have read. It would be an understatement to say that this is a must read. Five Stars."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book took me by surprise. The first two chapters didn't really get me into the book, and I found myself feeling awkward as I followed a seemingly pointless beginning. But, trust me, it's worth it. The book took off and left me gasping for air. The Great Gatsby is truly a modern day tragedy, and a very well written one at that. As the story progresses, you get drawn into the conflicts and the characters. You feel bad for some characters, feel angry at others, and become all the more attached to the words that Fitzgerald has written. This is a book that, once it takes off, you cannot put down. Not that it's intense, but that it's involving. It's depressing, but amazing at the same time. Truly a masterpiece of literature that everyone should read at least once!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I just finished reading this book in my 11th Grade English class, and I recomend it highly, especially if you're a hopeless romantic (like me!). It's a story of impossible love set against the backdrop of the 1920's. Gatsby has everything money can buy, but what he really wants can't be bought--Daisy. I'll admit the first couple chapters are boring, but it's worth it if you stick it out!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald, the GREAT GATSBY is a traditional classic. I give the book two thumbs up. The book is about a wealthy, lonely bachelor, who will not rest until he gets the love of his life. The book has a sad ending, but I will leave that for you to read about. The author brilliantly shows how being wealthy doesn't necessarily make you happy. Wealth can bring about isolation, and lonliness. The morality of the story refects very heavily on society today. People are always criticizing the wealthy instead of congratulating them for their accomplishments. This book gives great insight on the &quot;snobby&quot; rich, and the &quot;down to earth&quot; rich individuals. Once again I highly recommend this novel and I really hope you like it. And if you don't like it, then I don't know whats wrong with you."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the greatest novels ever written. The way that F. Scott Fitzgerald uses diffrent emotions really expresses how life in the 1920's were. It also shows what love is really like, and how it can make you do crazy thinks. It can even lead to death. Gatsby learned that the hard way. If your into drama, action, and romance please read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a fantastic love story told in such a manner that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Gatsby is every woman's dream man. He's loyal to his love, honest, intelligent, gallant, handsome, and has money. The only draw back is that his money is dirty. Truly a fiction character that women can only dream about, never the less a very entertaining piece of literature."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I admit, I was surprised. I went into reading this book as a big task, something to be avoided at all costs. But when I really got down to reading it, I realized how interesting the book actually was. The first chapter or so was a bit slow, but after that the storyline just kept gaining momentum. I strongly believe that F. Scott Fitzgerald was the premier writer of the &quot;Jazz Age.&quot; &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is often referred to as the quintessential novel of the &quot;Jazz Age&quot; and I believe that this is very true! Some of Fitzgerald's characters seem as real as the characters in &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; Realism is especially clear in the main character, Nick Cathaway. He is a hard working man from the Midwest who was in the &quot;Great War.&quot; Some people say that he lives a rather boring life, but honestly, if your life were so much more exciting would you be sitting at home reading this book? I didn't think so! Although Fitzgerald was a great writer, I think he was a little politically incorrect. He also used a lot of plays on words, which made reading the novel a little more confusing. The notes in the back of the book did help a little but it was more confusing then it needed to be. I did like how Fitzgerald used the first person. It lets us get really close inside the narrator's head and that's nice to be able to do. Overall I really enjoyed reading this book and I can't wait to read other books by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Thank you for listening and V.A. rules."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I was forced to read this book in my high school English class. I ended up actually enjoying this book. I thought it was a good story, engaging and a wonderful depiction of the 1920s. I found myself not so into the plot but into the style of writing, and the wonderful backdrop of the roaring 20s, a time of partying and prosperous times for the upper class. I found this book to be very dark, touching on the pain that money can bring."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is told from Nick Carraways point of view. Nick lived on Long Island Sound, but he lived in West Egg on the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound. Nick knew only what he would see or was told about Gatsby. The book is about the changing of hearts for people that have so much money all they need is someone to love. Money isn't everything because love can over take money. Gatsby would give up everything for a true love such as Daisy. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a good novel full of surprises that will make you think twice about money and love.F. Scott Fitzgerald writes from Nick Carraway's point of view. Nick is the narrator and through Nick we find out about all the other characters and how they become the way they were. Nick would figure out the other characters and learn about them when spending the day with them. That way you were able to find out where each character came from. All the other characters had different views than Nick which made him nice to have around for a day because he would look at issues from a different viewpoint helping them out."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"while reading the great gatsby over this past summer i did not realize the signifigance of the underlying meaning. after i read it a second time i began to understand the actual beauty of fitzgerald's masterpiece. if you ever want a book to sit and contemplate for a while then i suggest this one."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby crosses time as it depicts the careless indulgence that is embedded in our culture. There is a Tom, Daisy and a Gatsby in all our lives. Fitzgerald immortalizes America through his novel.

We learn that we, those born and raised in this country must aslo struggle for these. Most importantly, though Fitzgerald brings us Gatsby.

This is actually the second time that I have read the book and I was still caught up in the story just like if it had been my first time reading it! I certainly recommend it the book to everyone."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"F. Scott Ftizgerald hits the mark with The Great Gatsby. The book is flawless. His excellence comes in his subtle use of characters, the &quot;twists&quot; in the story, and the slow, teasing unravelling of the &quot;real&quot; story.We don't meet Gatsby right away. We are given hints, gossip and a vision or two. Yet Gatsby, while not the narrator of the story (as is Nick Carraway), is the main character. This is Gatsby's story, as told through his neighbor, Nick Carraway. Even when we do meet Gatsby, we, along with Carraway and the inhabitants of West Egg, are made aware of the fact that we still do not fully know who he is, where he comes from or very much about the man. This subtle characterization illustrates Fitzgerald's genius.There are a handful of moments in The Great Gatsby when the reader drops the book down and says, &quot;Ohmygosh!&quot;. Fitzgerald doesn't make this book flat and predictable, but instead takes some interesting turns. One such turn occurs when Tom Buchanan gets confrontational with Gatsby, and Gatsby, the polished gentleman, opens right up and speaks the truth as he sees it -- giving a shocking revelation.We wade into The Great Gatsby not knowing what lurks in the murky waters. Is this a story about a mysterious man with a dark past? Oh-- okay, this is a love story!...No, wait...this is a story about life... It is not until the last word is read, the book is closed and set down, that the reader truly &quot;gets&quot; The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is narrated through Nick Carroway, a man who is new to the town of West Egg. Through Nick's eyes the reader learns of Gatsby, Daisy and Daisy's husband Tom. Gatsby is a veteran who has horded much wealth through corrupt means. In the beginning of the story, the reader knows very little of Gatsby or his past. The conflict is apparent in Gatsby's utter love for Daisy. The plot centers around this conflict and much happens because of it.The theme of this story is that money can't buy happiness; therefore the search for happiness should be of one's own accord. This theme is brought out by the characterization the author uses in the story. For example, through the first quarter of the book the reader learns about Gatsby from rumors and gossip. The characterization brings out the tone of suspicion and nerviousness, leaving the reader to guess the next step of the plot for themselves. Through and through &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a classic book with very effective literary techniques and a universal theme."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I had to read this book for school. I enjoyed it very much, and I see how it defined the \\"Jazz Age\\" so well, but I tend to think this book is overrated. It is listed as the 2nd best novel of the century according to the Modern Library's List of the Top 100 Books of the Century. The book has many good points, but I do believe there are many better books out there. I like the characters and how the story is told from the eyes of a bystander to the happenings, Nick Carraway. I also admire Fitzgerald's way with words and his ability to tell a story. The descriptions of Gatsby's mansion and parties give a vivid picture of what the 1920's were really like, and because of this, the book is known as the definitive novel of the 1920's. The theme of the \\"death of the American Dream\\" cannot be underrated, either; this undoubtedly is a major reason why the book is rated so high in booklists. On the bad side, I believe the story takes way to long to get going. It only contains 197 pages and nine chapters; the first four chapters all contain exposition. Once the action gets going, the book is good, but overall, I believe this book, while definitely a classic, is overrated."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I'm really not sure what the definition of an &quot;American Classic&quot; is, but I know good literature when I read it, and Gatsby is just that. It's not the most action-packed, event-filled book ever written, but it's an incredible study of human behavior and chocked to the brim with excellent mood, symbolism, and atmosphere. It's the type of book a person can really sink their teeth into. The plot and meaning isn't just laid out for you, but nor does it take a rocket scientist to find. Fitzgerald writes in an excellent style that is both intelligent and enjoyable, an oft rare combination that few authors have truly mastered."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It is superficial to dismiss the Great Gatsby as a 'period piece', a perfect description of the roaring twenties - but holding little value to the modern reader. Yet, the Great Gatsby is harbor to themes and concepts that transcend its setting, and still can be meaningful to a reader today. The Great Gatsby analyzes the destructive impacts of society and wealth on people - certainly, society today has not changed so much that is no longer damages the psyches of people would get dragged beneath its current. And today, we must still be believe in the potential for life and dreams - like Gatsby, a poor boy turned rich because he believed in the orgastic future."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This novel is an extremly remarkable book that has so much to do with devotion and trying to attain a goal that any cheesy romance reader should love it. Gatsby believed in the green light, and he knew that one day he would have Daisy, and the symbolism precribing to this is wonderful! However, it is not mush that you can read without thinking, otherwise it would be a cheesy romance novel. If you are involved with the novel you are reading, it will come to you with a bang, the true meaning leaving a smile on your face. Great job by one of the greatest American novelists of all time!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This was a pretty good book about the sad and corrupt people of the 1920s. Don't be bullied by William T. Vogt's review, though, read it for yourself and form your own opinion. It is easy not to have any sympathy for the characters because of faults such as greed, brutality, and arrogance. But it is important that you look beyond those characteristics when reading. You must remember this is the 1920s, you must take into consideration the background of each character and their motivations (every scene is important), then you will understand them more and perhaps gain a bit of sympathy if not like for the character. Even the Great Gatsby has his faults (don't be fooled by the title). When reading the story, a question that you should try to answer is if this is truly a love story or the story of two people who think their in love (consider motivation and character). Another question to ask is why this is titled the Great Gatsby. Overall, this is an excellent commentary on 1920s life through the eyes of Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"There's something about the American literary critic that seems to equate short and lowbrow with good. At least that's the feeling you get in school when forced to read novels like this one and by authors like Steinbeck and Hemingway. The interesting prose and slathered-thick symbolism livened up this tale of a man who is DETERMINED to have everything. The reason I didn't care about his struggle is because this nouveau riche tycoon just wants the standard stuff: acceptance, $$$ and girls. I guess the moral of the story is that being shallow and possessive can lead to tragic consequences, but duh!, you're already supposed to know that."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read this book in high school. That was only three yearsago. I am not rich, not a social climber, but my sympathy for Gatsbyis utter and unbreakable. He is perhaps the most American hero in all of American literature--both a triumph of diligence and ingenuity and a tragedy of naivete and unrequitable striving. Make no mistake, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a classic. I don't mind if other readers don't like it, but I wish they would read the book with a little more empathy."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"How this is an American classic, I will never know. The book is short and barely has any character development. You don't route for anyone nor really care about finding about anybody's back story - including Gatsby himself. The book does do an ok job of portraying that \\"rich, post-World War I, 1920s era apathy generation\\" but the problem with portraying apathy is that your readers are going to be apathetic. There is one part of the book that has some \\"action\\" in it but it's so shoe horned in for the sole purpose of rapping up the story that it's almost unbelievable. For those that poo-poo Twilight for \\"stalker\\" type mentality of Edward, you have the same behavior in Gatsby as well. I was very underwhelmed and feel sorry for the countless public school students who had to suffer through this book. The one positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as boring as \\"Wuthering Heights\\".

I do not know why. I wasted much time reading critical appraisals, but they are all junk. So is this book. I don't care what anybody says there are *SEVERAL* parts that *DO* seem to be &quot;scribbled drunk&quot; and are nearly unintelligible. The book is filled with all kinds of errors, particuliarly chronological. There is also plenty of *PREJUDICE* and *RACISM* in this book. Wolfsheim is singled out as &quot;a small, flat nosed Jew&quot; despite the fact that he never mentions this. Nick also constantly refers to his &quot;tragic nose&quot;. What garbage. Also when Tom talks about the &quot;Superior Nordic Race nobody seems to care *IN THE LEAST* about the horrible things he is saying. Nick's maid is refered to as &quot;my Finn&quot;, which is so racist as to be almost unintelligible. Daisy and Gatsby are proposterous characters. The idea that they can never get together *MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER*. I don't care about society standards that is completely ridiculous. That Daisy would even think of staying with Tom dates this book *HORRIBLY* at the very least and more realitically turns into *A VIRTUAL CARTOON*. How and why Gatsby would do what he did is not believably in the least. Gatsby would never have gone to Oxford if he had truly cared about Daisy. The Confrontation makes absolutely no sense.

I think it has endured in academia because liberal professors like how it &quot;damns&quot; the American Dream. Gatsby tries to realize the American Dream by going from a poor boy to a rich man, and moving into high society. But he fails. (He never started down the American Dream trail anyway. Gatsby makes his money illegally, which is NOT the American Dream). Academics love when the American Dream is &quot;shown&quot; to be a house of cards. Then we can all embrace socialism. Fitzgerald actually wrote better short stories (especially &quot;Absolution,&quot; which, ironically, was originally a childhood scene for THE GREAT GATSBY, but cut out). And Fitzgerald's contemporary, John O'Hara, said about Fitzgerald's later novel TENDER IS THE NIGHT: &quot;Compared with TENDER IS THE NIGHT, THE GREAT GATSBY is greasy kid stuff.&quot; And O'Hara was absolutely right. TENDER IS THE NIGHT is a much better novel. Ernest Hemingway even thought TENDER IS THE NIGHT was Fitzgerald's best novel. GATSBY ain't bad, but if you want to read the best of Fitzgerald, check his other work out first."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This novel has a certain magnetism, a certain style that the author used to beautify and immortalise the mundane aspects of life and glorify them forever in our memory; aesthetic language is the manuscript of this amazing opus..In this case, it is a sweet lullaby that came from the 1920's, a most singular era potrayed to us through the eyes of a virtuous writter, F.Scott.Fitzgerald; He gave life to an era and wings to its cast, creating a world full of surreal parties, dusty limbos and glamourus automobiles.Yet it is surely through the special appeal of its language that the novel makes its first claim on our interest; for it it is a highly poetic novel, with strong, powerful, touching evocations that make our senses submerge and transmigrate into a perpetual limbo.The novel is strung together by motifs that appear and return, lingering in our mind for future innuendosIn a society, accidents happen and are taken for granted, but as they multiply in the book, they reveal a whole new meaning in which cars are merely futile excuses for careless driving with no moral or ethical directions at all.Irresponsability is the essence, the fuel on which this nemesis drives on, running over anything without any regret but expecting that someone ( the white trash ) will always clean after them.It is as if the 1920's were just pleasent cocktail waves impregnated with the mezmerising sounds of jazz, catalysed in the anarchy of charleston's moodThis were the parties Gatsby hosted, were all the USA intoxicated themserlves with champagne and sinecures, merely to sober up and presence the reality of the hangoverGatsby merely intended to extend the curfew, in order not to face the reality of his anguish, the slow trepidation of time's forgotten realm, showing itself as an incubus that would end the dream....his dreamGatsby wanted to trascend time, and to him time appeared submissive to his wealth and power, as he tried to recreate the past, the american dream, holding the clock's wrath aimlessly and in vain against his hopes, desires and aspirations, leading to his destruction while the others,&quot;the foul dust that floated on the wake of his dreams&quot; lingers on forever, covering meaningless actions in a meaningless worldBut soon the 20's would sail etheraly into the past with all its cast viciously darkened by the definite crash"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby was a great novel and one that everyone who has read this, will remember. I truly believed that it defined and era of our country. The extravagant parties and tea times. Gatsby's tragic flaw although was the fact that he loved Daisy and fell in love with her once again, too easily. Daisy, I feel had no respect for Gatsby, especially after his death. Not going to your lovers funeral is the worst flaw anyone can possess. I feel sorry for Gatsby and hope that this never happens to anyone close to me. Everyone who said and acted like they were his friends truly weren't. I also feel very sorry for Nick Carrawy because he has to witness a great man st and alone and still be happy in the process. Gatsby's book also describes the era of the 20's very well. He has been known to define the Jazz age and th era. Affer doing some basic work on the 20's, it shows that it really does describe alot of the time period. Gatsby's place in life was not showed through his work. His life suffered more hard work than Gatsby ever could. I think that through his works he tried to portray his life in a way that he wish it would have went."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"At this point a wide variety of teachers have been teaching me English, in one form or another, for the last 12 years or so. I have often heard some of those teachers describe &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as an American literary classic, but I haven't had the opportunity to read the story until now. One reason is that a novel like &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; written in 1925 didn't exactly appeal to the average teenager at these earlier stages of education. Another, more valid, reason is that we probably wouldn't have understood it anyway.At first sight &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; seems to be a long story about nothing in particular except for an obscene amount of parties. It turns out though that the story contains multiple levels of observation on the American society during the &quot;roaring twenties&quot;, as well as more general reflections over human nature and even philosophical and theological points.A thing I find interesting about &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, is the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, because this says a great deal about Gatsby. During the story three different images of Gatsby are transmitted to the readers. At first Gatsby is portrayed as a decent and noble Oxford man who has made himself a fortune in ways unknown to us and with a lot of things going on. He gives great parties and even though several of his guests perceive him as a somewhat mystical figure who isn't quite what he seems to be - some even suggest that he killed a man or acted as a German spy during the war - he stands out as the perfect host. Later it turns out that he actually does have a lot of things going on, though not exactly of the reputable kind.The truth is that he participated in the war and came out as a highly decorated officer. After the war however his decorations could not buy food or clothes and by coincidence he met Meyer Wolfsheim, who had just the right thing for him...So Gatsby is actually in the business of bootlegging. Having established that, it would be easy to write him off as a liar and a common - although wealthy - criminal. This image of him is softened though by the observation, that he did it for love. In fact it seems that everything in his life revolves around one person, namely Daisy.It turns out that Gatsby and Daisy know each other from five years earlier, when they were a couple and were actually going to marry each other. Gatsby was madly in love with Daisy and she loved him too, but when he was in Europe during the war, she eventually got a little bit desperate and wanted her life to take on a steady and reassuring direction - I would imagine that her parents had something to do with it as well. Consequently she married Tom Buchanan, who was extremely wealthy and an impressive physical presence as well. This explains Gatsby's actions to a certain extent, since it is obvious that the only purpose of his extravagant house is to impress Daisy.This is seen in the situation where Gatsby has Nick Carraway arrange a meeting with Daisy at Nick's - a rather embarrassing session at first that ends up with Gatsby giving Daisy the super-extended deluxe grand tour of his house. During the tour Gatsby perceives his own home through Daisy's eyes and generally does everything to seem interesting, for instance when asked how he can stand living in the house alone: &quot;I always keep it full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.&quot; It is not a coincidence either that he bought his house with a view across the water to where Daisy lives. At the end of the dock she has a green light that shines all night, which takes on a great deal of significance since it symbolises the distance between Daisy and himself.The span of water between Gatsby and the light (also great symbolism in itself, isn't it?) could be compared to the actual distance in emotion and time. Now he has met with her, talked to her and touched her. She has seen his home and given her approval, so the gap has closed and the light is just a light again. Or is it? The light could be any colour, but it is green which has always meant &quot;full speed ahead&quot;. So since the distance between Gatsby and the light has closed due to his recent entering the same high social class as Daisy, he is now worthy of her love, in his own eyes and apparently hers as well.So the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy has come full circle. Jay Gatsby's appearance towards his surroundings is built up on lies upon deceit and e.g. the large and wild parties are only meant to capture the attention of Daisy.Another thing that I find interesting in this story is the mentioning of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. After the death of his wife George Wilson states that &quot;God sees everything&quot; while looking specifically at the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg indicating that Eckleburg should or could be interpreted as God. He is, however, just an old billboard advertising for an optometrist - faded after not having been painted for a long time and brooding over a dumping ground . The symbolism is pretty clear. The presence of God is faded in the society described and the society as seen by God i.e. those who believe, is deranged - a dumping ground.As for George Wilson he says: &quot;...you can't fool God&quot; and &quot;God sees everything&quot; but the question he must be asking himself is, if God sees everything, why did he not stop Myrtle Wilson from running out in front of the car? Maybe that is why God is symbolised only by a pair of huge eyes - because He let go of the steering wheel years ago and has now retreated to the role of the observer. Omnipotence replaced by omniscience. Anyway Wilson decides to lend God's eyes a pair of hands, but manages - with a little help from Tom Buchanan - to kill the wrong man.Importance is in the mind of the beholder - a historian would find other aspects of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; interesting than I have. Interpreting this story, I found it exciting to work with the whole relationship between Gatsby and Daisy. The story of how his love for her gave birth to his ambitions and consequently his wealth hold faint reminiscence of Greek tragedy. It stands parallel to Fitzgerald's own life, where he could not marry Zelda Sayre until he had achieved some success and wealth , and even Fitzgerald's description of the wild life is somewhat autobiographical. In the story Daisy moves away with her husband, while in real life Fitzgerald was separated from Zelda because she was suffering from a severe mental illness.The passages about T.J. Eckleburg are a fine way of giving a hint that this wild life and social shallowness is actually leading nowhere - also illustrated by the fact that only three persons attend Gatsby's funeral - his father, Nick Carraway and the man with the owl-eyed glasses. He is the only other person who has taken the time to scratch the surface of Gatsby as a human being, symbolised by his opening the books in Gatsby's library instead of just assuming that they would be empty shells . This suggests that a man's legacy could be measured by the number of people by his grave rather than in parties or hard currency."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"How is it possible to label as &quot;underappreciated&quot; a book that is routinely included in the American literary canon? Understand this: _Gatsby_ forced its way into the canon--with the pellucid beauty of its prose and the undeniable resonance of its theme--against the wishes of many, if not most, in the critical intelligensia. In his time, Fitzgerald was regarded as a talented but irresponsible lightweight, a writer who dissolved his unique gift in expensive gin. Today, his lifetime reputation as a dissolute drunkard continues to tarnish his litarary legacy, particularly in comparison to the other two members of the Trinity of 20th Century American Literature, Hemingway and Faulkner. With some exceptions (most notably the fanatically devoted Matthew Bruccoli), critics and academics continue to regard Fitzgerald's work of love, wealth, and dreams as a shade beneath Hemingway and Faulkner, with their more gaudily &quot;literary&quot; themes of mortality, family, and death. But _Gatsby_ makes liars and fools of those who remain intent on observing only a chronicler of the gin-soaked privileged classes. Yes, there is wealth, and parties and cars and stars, but _Gatsby_ is a book that rewards not only the dazzling first read, but repeated readings. Of course, the book features some of the best of Fitzgerald's spectacular, inimitable prose style, which even detractors acknowledge as unmatched in its poetic grace. But there is much more underneath the fine finish, where so many have failed to look, distracted by the glossy exterior. Dreams, ambition, financial and moral corruption, love real and imagined, morality, success, failure and death: these are _Gatsby_'s themes, the themes of the American story--and are there bigger themes in Hemingway's bullfights and war, or Faulkner's incest and insanity? Modern critics continue to insist that Fitzgerald understood only a certain class and time, but this assessment suffers from a failure of the vision and imagination that Fitzgerald possessed in abundance. The very slightness of the plot of _Gatsby_ facilitates its analogy to contemporary America. Just imagine how easy it would be for Hollywood to remake _Gatsby_ as a modern tale of a boy from the ghetto rising through raw ambition and illicit means, chasing a dream he left behind that was never within his reach. In fact, Hollywood has made that movie, a hundred times over, because it is the prototypical American story, applicable to any time or place in the nation's history. _Gatsby_ is really a perfect, particular retelling of the most enduring story in American mythology"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Few books can be as consistently incredible as Gatsby. The idea of astockbroker/promoter who has a heart must send chills of fear downthe managers of the great Wall Street firms. Yet, it is so, and isdecisively the realm of fiction.Gatsby is the prototypical social mountaineer, climbing and climbingin the 1920s towards an impossible dream: having the love of a flipand indecisive Southern gal, and being accepted for who he dreams hemay be within his questing heart. Like the best American novels itis replete with greed, over consumption of limited goods, graced bya cynical narrator, and clever in its jaded appraisal of life.Ultimately the book comes down to one central issue that is notexplained: &quot;Why would a great man have so much love for a selfishlyundeserving woman?&quot; Gatsby has grandeur but his love has nothing.It's a spoiled book in that sense, and without the quality of virtuein Daisy, the book becomes a cruel mistake that can only end in death.Fitzgerald's style is elegant, brief, he never makes mistakes injudgment, and his narrative is impeccable. The book rushes forwardlike a Greek tragedy and ends just as Sunset Boulevard begins: withGatsby dead in a pool killed by that which he loved. Somehow thereis some great truth in the idea that in great American fiction theuse of coincidence is always deadly, and satisfaction never easy.Plato would have used the book as an exemplar in his proof of theideal, Aristotle would have merely laughed, yet inwardly agreed -the book is a cautionary tale; but more importantly hagiography.....C.K.

Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY is the tale of an aloof narrator caught up in adultery and murder in a 1920s America flush with new money. The novel has been touted as a mirror of its age, a meditation on the loss of a basic humanity in the midst of economic prosperity, and even the summit of American prose writing in the 20th century.In fact, I must confess that I find THE GREAT GATSBY a sometimes tiresome soap opera that never manages to make that leap to great novel. The novel can be read to the end, and even often enjoyed. There's a decent bit of humour, and clearly some elements have been original enough to sink into the public consciousness. However, those elements that are so often referenced -- Gatsby's unrequited love, Nick's disgust with what he sees -- always sound more profound when detached from the actual text with its contrived turns, unrealistic dialogue and the occasional (and generally unsuccessful) try at poetic metaphor.All in all, THE GREAT GATSBY belongs in that list of books one must read to be an informed person, but for which one should steel oneself for the disappointment that may come."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read this book because I'm trying to read a lot of the classics on the various \\"Top 100\\" book lists floating around out there.

Scott Fitzgerald, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. in New York in 1925. The book is about the American Dream and the failure of the attempt to reach its illusionary goals, especially the Gatsby's. The attempt to capture the American Dream is central theme to many stories of all times. For Gatsby, the dream is that one can acquire love and happiness through wealth and power. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 - 1940) was born in St Paul, Minnesota. He was an American short-story writer and novelist. The Great Gatsby is considered as Fitzgerald's finest novel.The story was set in New York and Long Island in 1920's. Nick Carraway is a young man working as a bond broker in New York. He is used as the narrator throughout the story. Nick acts as an insider as well as an outsider. He eyes everything that is happening in between, but has no intention to interfere. I think he chooses not to lose anybody close to him in the story. This arrangement makes it easy for Fitzgerald to give the audience detailed inside information and to back out as an outsider as needed. The core character, Jay Gatsby, is a character that longs for the past. He devotes most of his adult life trying to recapture it and he finally pays his life as the price in his pursuit. When he was young in the military, Gatsby fell in love with the beautiful Daisy, but he could not marry her because of the difference in their social status. So he left her to acquire wealth. When he got the wealth legally or illegally, he moved near to Daisy, who has already married to another wealthy man, and threw extravagant parties every week hoping Daisy might show up one day at the party. Finally, he set up a meeting with Daisy through her cousin Nick. Fitzgerald uses Gatsby's personal dream to symbolize the larger American Dream where all have the opportunity to get what they want.Nick is a multi-functional character to the author. He uses Nick as the approach for Gatsby to Daisy. The author naturally arranges all these. Gatsby cannot accept that the past is gone and done with. Nick once attempts to show him the folly of his dream, but Gatsby innocently replies to Nick's assertion that the past cannot be relived. For Gatsby, his American Dream is not material possessions, although it may seem that way. He only comes into wealth to fulfill his Dream, Daisy.Gatsby believes that he is acting for good beyond his personal interest and that should guarantee success. However, he is terribly wrong. He is so determined and so blind that he would do anything to get Daisy, even covering her up for the fatal accident. His dream never comes about and he ends up paying the ultimate price for it. The idea of the American Dream still holds true in today's time, which is wealth, love, or fame. But one thing never changes about the American Dream. That is everyone desires something in life and strives to get it. Gatsby is a good example of pursuing the American Dream.A society naturally breaks up into various social groups over time. Members of the lower statuses constantly suppose that their problems can be solved if they gain enough wealth to reach the upper class. Fitzgerald believes in his story that many people interpret the American Dream as being this passage to high social status. They believe once reaching that point, they do not have to worry about money any more. Though, the American Dream involves more than the social and economic standings of an individual.It seems that the more Gatsby tries to obtain, the less he ends up with. The saddest part of Gatsby is the funeral, which symbolizes the ultimate failure of Gatsby to ever achieve what he has wanted. The women he loved and died for was not present. None of the people who frequented the parties over the summer showed up. Wolfsheim, whom Nick believed to be a close friend to Gatsby, refused to attend. The idealism conflicts with the materialism and is torn apart. However, it is his father who lives at the bottom of the society, who is the most natural and native person in the story, whom Gatsby has never mentioned about, finds his way to his son's mansion for the funeral. What greatness of a father's love is in contrast to the love that Gatsby died for? That is the love of eternity. The father loves his son no matter his son is rich or poor. At this moment, both the idealism and materialism are eclipsed by the truthfulness and naturalness. And that is why Nick was tired of the life there, the carelessness of the people, and the corruption of the society in the American East. He decided to head back to his origin, to the more natural and traditional American Mid-West.Gatsby possesses an extreme imbalance between the material and spiritual sides of himself. Fitzgerald uses him as a portrait of the ultimate failure of the American Dream in that individuals tend to believe wealth is everything. Maybe what Fitzgerald wants to say is that a nation cannot operate solely on materialism. The spirits of individuals are the true composition of a nation."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Very disappointed in this book, which is supposed to be a classic.

A good writer ought to tell a story that is interesting enough to spark a natural curiosity in the reader over its deeper implications. The Great Gatsby is a good example of this. Fitzgerald subtly interweves social commentary into a solid story, providing entertainment for the casual reader and enough material for the critical reader to keep himself occupied.I only had two problems with this book: First, Fitzgerald's drawn-out, boring writing style, and secondly, the novel's climax, which seemed a little hokey to me.

Scot FitzgeraldTitle: The Great GatsbyPublished: 1925Type of Book: fictionTheme: differences between social classes and conflict with loveBackground Information: The author of this novel can greatly relate to one of the main characters. Like Jay Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald was ambitious when it came to women they wanted. They both had a sense of a rich lifestyle and they just had to be successful people.Content: Nick Carraway, who is also the narrator, moves to New York during the summertime to learn about a bond business so he rents a house in West Egg. Jay Gatsby is his rich neighbor who always throws parties every Saturday night, but he does not really engage in them. All the main characters that are in a marriage either have a mistress or another significant other.Reactions: The book becomes very appealing because all the suspense builds up as you read. You would have to keep on reading to find out what really happens next. For example, there is a part in the novel where someone gets killed but the one who killed that person seems very unlikely of them. The book affected me in a few good way too. It is better to be honest in any relationship and try your best to express yourself in a decent manner.

I found it to be poorly structured and somewhat choppy. The characters are pretty well crafted for a short novel such as this, but you don't really become enthralled with any of them. When the murder occurs, you really don't care. Even when the individual is struck by the car, you kind of go &quot;Oh, wow, that's too bad,&quot; but nothing more is felt. And there are a few minor loose ends that are never resolved. I finished the book with a feeling of &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;Perhaps the big rush to get this into print was part of the reason for its shortcomings. I'm not sure.

Gatz is from a lower class Midwestern farming family who falls in love with the wealthy well bread Daisy. The two are unable to marry and live happily ever after as they are from vastly different backgrounds and social status. Gatz enlists in the military and upon the end of his service is befriended by a wealthy benefactor who employs him \\"in a vague personal capacity\\". Gatz's employment provides him the opportunity to see the world, and experience life on the other side of the social strata. His adventures allow him to reinvent himself and upon the death of his benefactor, Gatsby purchases a mansion on Long Island, near the now married Daisy, and begins the process of recapturing her favors.On Long Island, Gatsby is known for the lavish parties and ongoing entertaining at his mansion. The east coast rich and famous are regulars at his parties but no one knows the origins of his wealth or his family background. Unable to connect Gatsby to his riches, the socialites create their own version of who he is and where his money comes from. Meanwhile, Gatsby pursues a meeting with Daisy in an attempt to woo her from her marriage; now that he has attained the wealth that will certainly please her. Will the good guy get his girl . . . you'll have to read the book to find out.The story is narrated by Nick Cassaway, Daisy's cousin and Gatsby's neighbor. It's a brief story that's easily read but I'm not quite certain what makes it such a classic. The novel does depict the role that class and social status played in American culture during the early 1900 - and still - but I can't say this was a captivating or enlightening read.

This is nothing more than an adequately written soap opera of a love triangle that ends in tragedy. I expected great writing; I found the author's writing to be merely adequate and the characters to be wooden. The story is of the lowest common denominator type: a sleazy romance that would have been equally at home in the Harlequin Romance series. The supposedly brilliant portrayal of the Jazz Age was anything but. I am a big twenties fan and know a good deal about the period and Fitzgerald certainly did not capture the feeling of the period for me. The twenties were about Jazz in New Orleans and Chicago, movies in Hollywood, hustle and bustle in Manhattan, not about some spoiled and bored people in Long Island who don't know what to do with themselves (how could anyone have been bored in the 1920's ???!!! There was a good reason why they called it the Jazz Age; it was exciting - to everyone but the clueless numbskulls in this novel). Daisy is supposedly irresistable; she comes across as the twenties version of a valley girl. Any grown man moronic enough to fall for her deserves what he gets. Gatsby is as wooden as any toy soldier.Why, oh why, do academics go crazy over these novels? I think it is because they spend so much time in academia that they have no sense of life outside of universities.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, \\"The Great Gatsby\\", is narrated by the passive Nick Carrraway, who has recently settled into the West Egg section of Long Island, a decidedly less prestigious area than its East Egg counterpart. He has come to find his way in New York and to make his name known in the bond business. Nick's story, however, is not so much about himself as it is about his new neighbor, the mysterious Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gaudy mansion next door and hosts wild weekly parties to all of New York's upper crust. When Nick is brought into this fast-paced world, he must reexamine himself and the world he lives in.The novel is a classic examination of what it means to be a success the American Dream. As secrets unfold about the mythologized Gatsby, we discover that he has reinvented himself into the persona that he is, and that he is a man who is tormented by an idealistic vision of the woman he loves, and his desire to capture that woman for himself.Written in 1922, the novel is both a tragedy and a scathing indictment of the time of decadence that preceded the immediate economic upheaval and crash of 1929. Although it is situated very much in the context of the 20s and New York, it serves as a timeless story of a man's dream and the sometimes impossibility of those dreams."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A couple of thoughts:1. Don't read this book, or any book, because you believe it to be \\"a classic.\\" That term is essentially meaningless, and the people who use it -- either as praise or blame -- generally don't have any souls. Really. And that is not a subjective opinion.2. Do read this book because, in doing so, you may learn things about the reality of America, the dream of America, dreaming itself and the beautiful emptiness of it, and perhaps even yourself. You may not learn all these things. You may, in fact, not learn any of them. And, frankly, you may not like the way the book is challenging your conception of yourself once you realize just how deeply it is doing so. But at the very least, even if you hate the book after you have read it, you will have exposed yourself to some thoughts that are, in and of themselves, quite beautifully expressed. Worse things can happen to you. And if the worst thing that ever happens to you is that you don't like a book, you'll be luckier than most.3. A lot of people have found in this book something worthwhile, although it hasn't always been (as evidenced by these reviews) \\"pleasure.\\" Some of those people may indeed be fools, and others of them may have been hornswaggled by the Evil American Culture Industry into thinking this book was more meaningful to them than, say, the Iliad. But, probably, the rest of them are just being honest. You might give them the benefit of the doubt.4. Likewise, a lot of people (albeit fewer of them, again as evidenced by these reviews) have found absolutely nothing worthwhile in this book. I encourage you to read their reviews, and then to press the \\"read the rest of my reviews button\\" to find out just how many of them prefer, say, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which is, without a doubt, funnier) to this book. But, as in thought number 3 above, it is probably a mistake to generalize: certainly not all of the people who find this book valueless are unsophisticated, imaginationless, anti-intellectual, snobbish, or even just plain douchebags.It is remarkable, however, how often they sound that way.5. You may disregard thought 4 with respect to Luder of Saddam City. I'm pretty sure he/she IS a douchebag. And I reiterate: he/she really doesn't get the book. Or, I suspect, books generally.

Scott Fitzgerald, is a fictional novel portraying the lives of wealthy young citizens of West and East-Egg, Long Island. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was his chance for something new. It was his chance for what he believed was greatness. Today the Great Gastby's name is synonymous with that of Fitzgerald's. Fitzgerald's novel includes love,mystery, and a myriad of events that would lead to downfall and tragedy.The story takes place around the jazz era. Nick, the narrator of the story is a young gentlman who comes out to the west into Long Island into a bonds business. He spends his summer with his cousin Daisy Bunchanan, her husband Tom Buchanan, and their friend/tennis star, Jordan Baker. Nick is fascinated by the mystery and lifestyle of his neighbor Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, the topic of the story, is a man who had built an empire for himself which eventually like many empires, fall. As much as Gatsby is great, he is plagued with many rumors.Gatsby befriends Nick to get to his cousin Daisy whom he was once in love with five years ago before he had gone to war. He goes through many obstacles such as Daisy's husband Tom and his fear of rejection once again. It turns out that Daisy had rejected him in the past because he was too poor. Gatsby makes his way up top through some illegal activities accompanied by his friend Meyer Wolfshiem. For years Gastby had been hosting parties and moved to West Egg to lure Daisy and to meet her once again. After wising to the fact that Nick was her cousin he had found his trump card.However this novel does not end in fairy tale. It is more of a Shakespeareian play, a tragedy. Althoygh I'm more partial to happy endings, the twist in the story does very well suit it. The story is wonderfully pieced together, in storym plot, and ending but it lacks excitement. Maybe Fitzgerald was headed in the direction of simplicity but this is definitely too simplistic.I don't agree with Fitzgerald's title for the story. To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby. He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy. To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him. Was it because he was rich and famous? He became rich through illegal acitvities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were. There is nothing great about that struggling man. A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\". He is dead inside.I found some parts of the story quite blurry and hard to understand. Was the role of Tom Buchanan a bad man or a good yet misunderstood man? Some say he's a brute but was his actions justifiable? I believe they were; he was only standing up for his wife. He does admit to loving his wife Daisy and tries to keep Gatsby away from her. Is he wrong for doing so? In one man's opinion he may be protecting his family from a home wrecker and in another man's opnion he may be blocking the starving lover from his candy of his eye.In the end I believe this isn't much of a reading material. I was easily bored. Maybe the story could have been more interesting had Fitzgerald created a much better narrator. Everything in this story wa pure descriptive. Although it was pieced together well, it lacked substance. Maybe this story would be more appealing to the older age groups but to keep interest in teenage readers, I would have to disagree. It is not really a bad story in terms of construction, just in the ability to maintain a reader's interest."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"There's so much critique-wise that could be said of this book. It's an entertaining, interesting story. The characters are so well-developed and their actions and words so consistent and unique throughout the novel that they seem so real. This is something most novels lack. Fitzgerald brings even the minor characters to life. The imagery and symbols are intricate, both serving to further the theme. The symbols are an integral part of the story, like Gatsby's car, which characterizes him as ostentatious and symbolically leads to his death. The characters themselves are symbolic. The story serves as a historical document of the 20's. The thematic material applies as much to our present society as it did back then. It is condensed, fitting so much meaning into each page, each sentence, each phrase. Much of the wording of the book is so memorable, so quotable, even magical. The Preface, Publisher's Afterward, and the Explanatory notes of this edition, as well as Cliff's Notes are very helpful to understand and appreciate this novel.The basic theme is that of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby is defined by his dream to win Daisy Buchanan, a popular, beautiful, but superficial girl. To win her, he needs exorbitant sums of money which he gains through corruption. Gatsby has all the \\"toys\\"-- a mansion, a Rolls-Royce, a hydroplane, and connections to people like Meyer Wolfsheif who fixed the 1919 World Series. Dan Cody circling the continent aimlessly in his yacht as he falls victim to alcohol shows that money is not an end in itself. Gatsby is different because money is only a means to an end for him; still, he fails. This book shows the harmful effects of a wide gap between the rich and the poor. The wealthy Buchanan's are not productive at all and the poor Wilson struggles to survive and is pushed around by Tom Buchanan. This book shows that such extreme wealth as Gatsby's and the Buchanan's leads to waste. Gatsby has a pool he only uses once all summer. He drives a Rolls-Royce which can cost over 300 grand in today's money. Daisy drives the car and accidentally kills Wilson's wife who was having an affair with Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband. Tom manipulates Wilson into thinking Gatsby killed her and Wilson shoots him then turns the gun on himself. The major theme of the novel is that \\"money isn't real\\" as the movie \\"Blow\\" put it. The material world is illusion, in other words. I've heard it said that \\"You can't buy happiness but you can rent it.\\" If that's true, then it helps explain Gatsby's failure-- he tried to, and thought he did, buy it.Gatsby's boyhood program for self-improvement as revealed by his dad at the ending is just like Ben Franklin's autobiography. Two self-help books I've read and reviewed negatively are \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie and \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins. After reading Gatsby it seemed as though these two books were studied and practiced thoroughly by Jay Gatsby.First off, Gatsby's mannerisms resemble what is recommended in \\"Win Friends.\\" Gatsby is very indirect. He can't just go directly to Daisy or even directly to Nick to arrange the meeting between he and Daisy. He has Jordan tell Nick about the background between them then has Nick invite Daisy over to his house (he's Gatsby's neighbor) and tells him to tell her not to bring her husband. Gatsby then disappears outside when she comes and knocks on the back door. He must have looked like an idiot to Daisy being so ridiculously indirect and obvious like this. Gatsby even bought his house in the neighborhood of Daisy for this reason. Another aspect of Win Friends is to smile-- whether you are truthfully happy or not to charm other people into liking you. Consider Nick's description of Gatsby's smile, \\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it. It faced--or seemed to face-- the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you, with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck...whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.\\" As is advised to do in \\"Win Friends\\", Gatsby makes other people feel special like the way he calls everyone \\"old sport.\\" But keep in mind Gatsby has no real friends and everyone but Nick merely uses him. They flocked to his mansion by the hundred for his parties but only a few people were at his funeral.The other Jay Gatsby handbook is \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins. I once saw Tony on TV and Jay Gatsby came to my mind before I realized it was him. I saw Tony's signature before and it was signed in a \\"majestic hand\\" just like Gatsby's writing on the note of invitation to his party to Nick. Throughout his book, Robbins writes of his accomplishments of making money and buying all the ostentatious \\"toys\\" like Gatsby has. Both men's obsession with materialism is so intense as to almost take on a spiritual level. Comparing \\"The Great Gatsby\\" to these two books and the movies \\"Blow\\" and \\"Casino\\" are just some ways you can understand how Gatsby relates to our world now even though it was written about the 1920's.I don't feel a review of a 1000 word limit can possibly do justice to this novel. To appreciate it yourself, all the more I can say is read it, read Cliff's notes, think about it, read it again, and observe how the theme relates to the world around you very much today."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This is the horrifically real tale of people and lost dreams. The story takes place in New York in the 1930's -40's. The main charcter, Nick is a bondsman from Wisconsin who happens to move into a house nextdoor to the mysterious Jay Gatsby who throws extraveagnt parties nightly. Nick's summer in New York was a colorful menagerie of elaborate society where he meets his sweetheart and gets into some mixups with his cousin Daisy and Gatsby. Nick discovers after not too much time there is a reason why Gatsby's past is so elusive and that there is a very real and very powerful agenda on Gatsby's mind. The Great Gatsby was an awesome book. Fitzgerald has a bold voice in his writing and expresses abstrsct ideas in a very tangible form. It gave a tragic look into life and society of the East Coast and the forlorn hopes that people hold to in their minds. Gatsby was a pleasant read and the sentences seemed to contain so much substance that I found myself rereading a lot so I wouldn't miss anything. I read the authorized text, so it was identical to the original publication, so it was wholly preserved. I would reccommend this book as intriguing and enchanting to most."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I purchased this book for my high school lit class and found it to be a huge rip-off. Besides lacking page numbers, the opening epigraph, and consistent formatting, the copy is also printed in an extremely small font, making it quite difficult to read. Save your money and buy one of the other versions of this book!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I am utterly baffled by the reputation this book enjoys. Fitzgerald seems to assume (rightly it would seem) that the mere evocation of fantastic wealth (shiny automobiles, lavish parties etc) will be fantastically interesting to his readers. A triumph of content over style if you ask me! Admittedly there are a few very brilliant passages, but overall I find the book's much-vaunted prose to be like iridescent steam, vapid and affected. There is precious little complexity of thought, and more of what I would call \`sentiment' than genuine emotion. The symbolism is laughably trite (to take just 3 examples : the green light on Daisy's side of the bay, characters in white, and - last but not least - the celebrated Valley of Ashes (Oh come on now ! Give us break!)). The characterization struck me as hollow, and the dialogue stilted and unnatural. Very rarely was I able to hear real men and women. I could go on, but after reading what other readers have said I feel like a voice in the wilderness..."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The book arrived on time and was as eexpected. The book was required reading by my daughters American Lit class. It has been read and annotated and analyzed...she found the book to be interesting and easy to read."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I pretty much had my mind made up about this book going into it. Having read numerous spoilers over the years (Gatsby is, after all, everywhere) and having just finished two depressingly weary previous novels of Fitzgerald, I was braced for another unredemptive drag through the dust with yet another hoard of hard-drinking, adulterous characters. And, in essence, that's exactly what it is. But there's more to this one than just that. I wasn't more than a chapter in before I could tell this was something different from anything else Fitzgerald had done. It's lighter, less self-indulgent, and as a result a much more piquant and incisive study of character and culture. A large part of its difference is the narrative voice, which is thankfully far away from the Avery and Anthony of his earlier novels. For once, we have a basically decent character objectively observing the crumbling of the immoral rich. It's not a book I would enjoy reading over and over again, but there is a magic here that makes me understand why it is so beloved."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Read it.

Amazing story and easy to lose yourself in. I highly recommend it as well."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Its easy to see why this is considered a classic of American literature. Historians see it as a mirror of those who lived during the Jazz Age. To me at a deeper level, it deals with the issue of what you want in life or out of life, and what you do when you find you can't get it, and you realize you can't. And, no amount of money or power or friends can get you there. To those peers living during the self-indulgent Jazz Age, the Great Gatsby speaks prophetically about the realiy of not finding satisfaction through indulging. The way to realization of goals is to be ethical and principled. The only one in the book who is that and is thus the hero turns out not to be Gatsby, not matter how great, but the narrator who is the &#34;least among these&#34;, telling the story and is a distant observer of those caught in the chase. Anyone contemplating setting out on life's journey to find fame and fortune ought to consult the Great Gatsby before going too far down the road."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Regardless of whether you like F.Scott Fitzgerald you'll find this period piece strangely contemporary. A must read American classic! The perfect gift for students!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"To me, one of the most depressing things about grad school was reading through great works of literature, finding one that I really loved, digging up criticism and scholarship about it so I could write my double-spaced ode to The Sound and the Fury or War and Peace or whatever... and discovering that the book was all used up.There was nothing I could possibly say about it that would be new. Every possible thought and conclusion had long since been had by dozens of other, more qualified people. Every minor character and allusion was already the subject of half a dozen moldering dissertations. Sure, I went ahead and wrote my little paper, but it didn't add anything to Timeless Academia's conversation on the subject.The Great Gatsby is one of those books. I can't say anything about it that hasn't been said hundreds of times before, and neither can you.But lately, I've been having the most fun with these old books when I can arrange to read them with relatively new people. It's kind of wonderful to read alongside someone who's not had \\"Great American novel\\" tattooed under their eyelids, who isn't swallowing bile at the thought of churning out a five-paragraph essay at the end of it all - who still has room for virginal surprise and wonder and disgust as they turn the pages.I'm finding this mix of old book, new reader especially satisfying with Gatsby. You get that sense from the city itself: in the summer of 1922, everything is so new and extravagant and full of spectacle that a person could forget just how old and worn-down the world really is.So there it is, my one halfway original thought: if it's been awhile since 11th-grade English and you'd like to try this book again, see if you can get a fresh companion to take you to one of Gatsby's parties. They are really quite something."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The first time i read this book iwas bored because i didnt fully understand how Fitzgerald conveyed the plot of the story. But now i have read it again with a more mature state of mind I really find it like a soap oprah... there was evidence of gossip that placed a &#34;umph&#34; to the supension I had when reading. The love story between Daisy and Gatsby, with Nick and Jordon, Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy too, interuptions not to mention their individual ives, and how FItzgerald cleverly used elements of prose and literary devices, to convey confusion and suspense highlights the fact that this story was well written and will remain one of the best years to come."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"A masterpiece about the American Dream. One of the best novels ever written, but don't take my words for it. The uses of symbolism are brilliant, such as the green light on the dock, the Valley of Ashes, and the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg. I especially cherish the ending, it was so beautiful. I recommend reading this book, and then read it again, and again"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby's deceptively ephemeral story is not so much the deserved masterpiece of one of our most gifted writers as it is the stunning illusion of a great magician. In that, it is a velvet covered table upon which a small band of bored and privileged jazz-agers appear under the entertainer's deft hands. It is a metaphor of its age and an uncanny prognostication of our current malaise. What makes this book magical? When one steps back from the book, there's no plot, the characters are rather bland, they don't do anything particularly interesting, and what they do accomplish in the very short timespan we spend with them is so trivial or mean that we are left wondering why we enjoyed the book so much. But the craft of magic is never about the rabbit; rather, it is about the empty hat. Fitzgerald The Great's magic wand is the English language, and from the void he lifts a masterstroke of storytelling."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Anyone that has not read this book is horrible deprived in every way that I can think of. This book has just about everything that one could possibly want in a book. It has romance, wealth, parties, anger, jealousy, revenge, searching. It has it all!! It is the story of a very wealthy group of people in the twenties. One in particular (who is quite mysterious to those around him) is in love with a married woman. She falls in love with him too, when she discovers that he lives very near her. THere is a showdown between Gatsby and Daisy's husband that ends in a very interesting way. There is so much more to this book than just this bit that I have alluded to. There is so much more that to try and write a true review of it would create a whole new book in and of itself. I just hope that some of you out there read this and decide to read it. It is truly one of the best novels ever written!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"In a world where a football star can commit murder and get away with it,and a family of rich and famous politicians can trash those who stand inthe way of reelection, Fitzgerald could never have been more correct. Whenhe wrote in &quot;Gatsby&quot; that the rich are different, he seems to have had somesort of prophetic genuis. They certainly are different. The way in which Tomand Daisy were able to leave their problems behind is not so dissimilar tothe kind of privilege which is flaunted by those who abuse such privilegetoday. I can't help but feel that even Fitzgerald could never haveimagined the depth of arrogance which our rich and infamous have reachedtoday."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book.

I read a review that 'Textorcist \\"me\\" (saschatuan)' wrote and i wanted to point out that the book actually takes place in Long Island and Tom and Daisy's last name is Buchanan (not Buckhannon.) The fact that Gatby throws parties is a very important detail of the book, showing his devotion to reunite with Daisy. I also noticed spelling and grammar errors.

Fitzgerald puts across some good points, but the book left me without the feeling of having been there and only with images of what happened. He did not do a very good job of emphasizing the important points, and I'm afraid I missed some of them. I would only recommend this book if your intent is a long-term study of writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Anyone remember a skit that Andy Kaufmann did on Saturday Night Live? He came out on stage holding a copy of THE GREAT GATSBY, sat down on a stool, and told the audience that he had never really understood the book when reading it in school, and proposed that he and the audience read it aloud and discuss it, so that he could understand what it was all about. Maybe that is needed here.I am not anti-kids or anti-teens. But high school students need constantly to remind themselves that they are not experienced readers, and that their opinions on books should be proffered with a necessary dose of humility--humility that they might not yet have learned to be a first rate reader.To pass a judgment on THE GREAT GATSBY like \\"it isn't so great\\" or \\"this is a bad book\\" or \\"this is boring\\" says absolutely nothing about the novel but a great deal about the presumptuous oaf uttering the statement.THE GREAT GATSBY--like ULYSSES, THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, LOLITA, MOBY DICK, MIDDLEMARCH, or Proust--provides the measure of what a great novel can achieve. But one isn't born able to read and appreciate great books; it is a skill achieved over the course of time.My advice to all the high schoolers who want to trash this book out of revenge for having been forced to read it: wait a few years, learn to read novels, gain a little more understanding of history, grow up a little, and then go back to it. The book will have remained the same, but you will have grown up sufficiently to get the point.

The Great Gatsby captures what is different about Americans and the American experience. At its most basic, America represents endless striving for greatness. Whether in business, science, athletics or world affairs, Americans imagine and seek the best. Though we often stumble and fall short; though we often cut corners to achieve our dreams - striving for greatness is the essence of America. In Gatsby, we feel what it is like to want something so badly, to succeed in reaching it and to ultimately fail. How many of us have not shared these experiences in some way or another? American writings today, such as David Ebershoff's Pasadena (2002) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002), continue to explore Gatsby's central theme of obsession with greatness.

I had not realized at the time that this is considered an important piece of American literature. However it is a charming and well crafted work of art that deserves recognition.

First is the general story; plot, characterization, setting, storyline. Second is the way it is written which keeps you reading it over and over.The setting is a fictitious New York suburb of East and West Egg in the early 1920's, a location dotted with large estates build with immense wealth. The main characters are the narrator, Nick Caraway; his new found girl and golf pro, Jordan Baker; Tom Buchanan, the husband of Daisy Buchanan; and of course James Gatz also known as Jay Gatsby, self prescribed culturist of old wealth.Concerning the first aspect, this book is an art of obsession, treachery, deception, hubris, crime and murder. It is the original soap opera (though not annoyingly melodramatic). It will keep you turning pages and ends with a bang.The second aspect, the one that makes it a classic is the brilliant prose and mastery of the English language. Like a movie that presents something new every time you watch it, this book has many subtle subplots and philosophical outlooks.I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading and rereading the classics. A book from \\"the lost generation,\\" written by an author from World War I, it definitely has the era's deserving undertones."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Next to the Sun Also Rises, the Great Gatsby is simply the greatest American Novel written in the 20th Century.

The first seventy pages of the book were filled with so many details and so much information that I kept getting confused. Luckily, one of my friends, the one who recommended the book to me, was always able to answer my questions and explain things to me in a manner that I could comprehend. I feel that the book does not really begin to pick up and make any sense till page eighty or so. After that point though, I feel that the plot really picked up and became more interesting. I am one who watches soap operas, so it was a little bit of a resemblence.

The characters way of speaking gives the book its early 1900's feel, and the clothes they wear also help. The book is in a way a love story, and is the focus, but there is a lot more than just the focus on Gatsby wanting to be with Daisy. There are the relationships between Daisy and Tom, Tom and Myrtle, and the relationship between Myrtle and George. These relationships create examples of the characters are, conflict, and plot in the story are shown through dioulouge and situations. Example for showing that Tom was a violent person was when Myrtle shouted the name of his wife,\\"Daisy, Daisy, Daisy!\\" Tom hits Myrtle in the face and breaks her nose.Why I recommend this book be because it is an interesting story. It's interesting in the way that truth slowly surfaces throughout the book. The story about Gatsby and who he really is makes you want to keep reading, and also to see if he achieves his goal. The book successfully covers how Gatsby uses the American Dream, power and money, to try and achieve his goal of winning back Daisy. The way Gatsby gets his power and money, bootlegging alcohol, fits in perfect due to the time period that the story takes place because there is a prohibition going on.One thing I didn't like about the book is that the book is very detailed, especially about the characheters. I found it difficult to come back to the book after not reading it for a week. I went back several times to remember the story and recent developments. Other than that one minor difficulty the book is very good and is recommended."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald's most notable work, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; defined a generation; that of the Jazz Age (1920's upper-crust America). Told in first-person through the young, middle-class metaphor Nick Carraway, the story has one of the most overarching themes I have ever encountered. On one level a tragic love triangle between Daisy Buchanan, Tom Miller, and Jay Gatsby. On another, it tells the story of New York's middle- and upper-classes, and the aftereffects of a lavish lifestyle on both societies.The narrative unfolds in a straightforward manner, and the language is beautiful, the prose intricately crafted with the care of a master gardener.The novel also touches briefly on the theme of war as well; Gatsby returns to find his idea of feminine perfection, Daisy, has married the bellicose Tom Buchanan. Gatsby becomes infatuated with the acquisition of wealth, material possessions and appearances the centerpoint of his existence. Which makes his ending all the more powerful; in the end, Gatsby is undone by his greed and egocentrism.There is much, much more to the book--including the character of Jordan Baker, the significance of Gatsby's surname, and Meyer Wolfsheim--but there is not nearly enough space to discuss this masterpiece of American Literature.Yes, it has been the hallmark of high school English classes, but that should not be it's grave; indeed, it is the foundation of modern literature and the defining moment for an entire generation."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The novel critizes many of the themes and trends of the 1920s.The main character is a self-made man but, he giained his money through bootlegging, he is also extremely materialsitc.

Widely regarded as a classic of modern literature, Fitzgerald manages to capture something very American, very modern, very sublime and truly timeless in this novel; from the relatively simple narrative of romantic yearnings, to the greedy ambitions, the lost loves, the complex enchantments, and the underlying despair; this is a journey of life.This book for me is just too much. Take the exchange between Nick and Gatsby about the 'past', and following 'lost dreams';- \\"You can't repeat the past\\" (Nick). \\"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can\\" (Gastby). Can you? I still don't know. How about the early quote of \\"the foul dust that floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the shortwinded elations and abortive sorrows of men\\". A dark promise of things to come. And what about the exhileration and excitement of the \\"returning trains of my youth\\", near the end, where Nick decides to leave the 'big smoke' in New York, permanently tainted in his mind, for the wide plains, the homely townships, and to escape from the shallow, superficial and 'messy' lives of the Big Apple pretenders.I won't spoil you with intricate details of the story, if you haven't read it and you want to understand modern literature and the modern western world, you have to read it. It is as simple as that.This book is a unique expose of the human spirit, the western dream, the love and despair of life; quintessentially 20th century and quintessentially beautiful.I wish I was seventeen and could read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald is a pure genius. The Great Gatsby was beatifully written and completely captured the 1920s and its American Jazz Age. On the surface, Fitzgerald's novel seemed simple, but after a months study on it the book revealed so much more. Only a literary mastermind could have come up with such a subtle novel that came to be more complex and insightful than expected. Fitzgerald's characters is what brought life to the book. Nick, being the narrator, showed sensibility in the novel. Although Nick represented the middle class people striving to upgrade their status, he maintained his ground. Through the experiences that he had gone through being with the high society, there was a major turning point for him. Nick realized that that corrupt and shallow class had absolutely no morals. From there he moved back West, too afraid that he may experience what Gastby had experienced. Jay Gatsby on the other hand, was somewhat of an honorable mystery. He was a mystery because he was never seen directly, but mainly through other peoples perceptions. Nobody really knew him as a person and nobody knew his identity. Although, Gatsby was on a quest in search of something that meant his whole life to him. He wanted to re-live the past that he had with Daisy and didn't stop for a second to come back to reality no matter what other people had told him. Now Daisy was simply a basketcase and represented her society quite well. She was materialistic and extremely shallow, thus the name Daisy. She had played with people's minds and seemed to play with her own mind at the same time. The novel just came together very well with the connection of the seasons to Gatsby's dream to even the slightest detailing of the colour of clothing and even the vehicle's interior. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel was very insightful and well-crafted, but before making any first judgements after reading it thorough research will make you believe how great The Great Gatsby truly is."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The story of Jay Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway. Carraway had graduated from New Haven in 1915, had participated in the Great War and, returning restless, decided to move East and learn the bond business. In the spring of 1922, he rents a house in West Egg, Long Island next to the mansion of Gatsby - a mysterious host of large and extravagant parties.It seems that few people know anything about Gatsby, so speculation is rife. Gatsby is wealthy and powerful, and knows how to get things done. And yet, while many flock to his parties, he seems to have no friends, only business associates. A man of mystery.Nick Carraway's second cousin, once removed, is Daisy Buchanan. Daisy and Tom (and their daughter Pammy) live on the more fashionable East Egg side of Long Island. Nick had met her husband Tom at New Haven and Nick calls on them soon after moving to West Egg. During his visit, Nick also meets Jordan Baker who tells him that Tom has a mistress, and finds that here as well that Gatsby, his parties and his wealth are a topic of discussion. There is a lot of restless energy here, as well as a sense of dissatisfaction, of boredom and of wanting more from life.Myrtle Wilson, Tom's mistress, lives with her husband Tom near an expanse of land known as the Valley of Ashes. A wasteland of sorts, between New York and Long Island, constantly under the view of an advertisement for an oculist.\`But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.'Through Nick and Jordan, Daisy is reintroduced to Gatsby. She had been engaged to him before her marriage to Tom, back when he had no money. Gatsby still loves Daisy, and hopes to recapture this past romance.\`\`Can't repeat the past?' he cried incredulously. \`Why of course you can.''Unfortunately, for Jay Gatsby, he cannot repeat the past. And a series of unfortunate coincidences and tragedies obliterate his future as well as that of the Wilsons. It's of no consequence to Tom and Daisy, the destruction that they cause and retreat from. They live in and for the moment, without loyalty and without care.\`They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made ...'\`Her voice is full of money', he said suddenly.' And money talks in this novel, but it has to be the \`right' sort of \`old' money. There is no place for a parvenu like Gatsby, and there are few mourners at his funeral.It's been forty years since I last read this novel, and while I remembered the story fairly well, it had a different impact this time around. The first time around I wondered how people could be so fickle and shallow, this time I was more focussed on how Fitzgerald manages to complete such an unsettling story within fewer than 150 pages. All versions of the early 20th century American Dream portrayed in this book are flawed: those who can see the flaws can do nothing and those who strive to live it are doomed to fail. Equality is not realisable.And if I read it again? Who knows what I'll think of it.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It's a powerfully written classic with uncommon, often devastating insight on the human condition, worthy of all the praise its earned for generations. The kind of book every idealist (myself included) should read, regardless of what we're idealistic about (love, God, country, ourselves, etc.), and a story so fundamental that it makes you rethink who you believe you are. It may be set in the Jazz Age, but the lessons will always be relevant, no matter the era. Fitzgerald's economical prose is second-to-none and makes the book highly re-readable; and most authors could write for a lifetime and never come up with as haunting, and true, a climactic line as \\"I'm thirty - I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.\\""},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I fell in love with F. Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant novel, The Great Gatsby, when I was in high school. I was captivated by the lush, lyrical prose that was such a distinctive characteristic of the novel. I think that Fitzgerald has given us a searing, powerful take on the rich dilettantes of the 1920's. He slowly and skillfully reveals the shallowness and callousness of these people, as they manipulate and deceive everyone. It seems that Fitzgerald's heroines were always reincarnations of his real wife, Zelda. It is clear that Gatsby has hopelessly romanticized the superficial and hollow Daisy Buchanan. He has elevated her to a pedestal that she does not in any way deserve. Yet he is determined to pursue her and his dreams, at all costs.Fitzgerald is unmatched when it comes to character studies. He has used his own real life experience among the elite, to peel away the beautiful artifice and show us the truly ugly, heartless soul inside these people. Daisy and Tom are unhappy and unfulfilled people. Tom uses Myrtle to escape from the boredom and inanity of Daisy. He could care less if it all turns out badly. Consequences, morality and decency are not qualities that one finds in the likes of Tom and Daisy. They take what they want and try to steal moments of happiness at the expense of the humanity of those who are manipulated and played like chess pieces. Life is a game to them, a game to be played out in grand style and if someone gets crushed in the process, so be it.Fitzgerald finds his own voice in his narrator, the conscientious and astute Nick Carraway. He is the observer, watching the carnage and emotional wreckage unfold before his eyes. Through him, we see the horror of what Tom and Daisy do to those who have the misfortune to those who cross their path. Initially, Nick is enchanted to be in their company, but by the end as he surveys the tragedy and destruction that has been wrought, he is repelled and wants only to put as much distance as he can between himself and these monsters. Fitzgerald's own ideas and thoughts are expressed through Nick. It's a masterful way of illuminating the reader. Nick is the moral compass in this novel. He sees the truth, the ugly reality of what makes up the rich and famous, their lack of character, their emptiness, their need to lose themselves. In the end we feel the way he does. The beauty and lavishness of the lives of these people are just a brittle exterior, covering up the hideousness that lies underneath.As I read this novel again, years later and much older, it has taken on a whole other dimension. I have enough life experience now to truly appreciate the dark and sinister reality that can lie behind beauty and wealth. It is now a richer experience, because Fitzgerald's novel is timeless. He provided a stinging, harsh critique of the kind of people he knew all too well, of an era, a time in which people satisfied their greediness at the expense of others. The book can never become outdated, because what it says about people who have too much money and time on their hands with too little humanity, applies to generations through the years.This is a seminal work, a beautifully crafted tale about a time that was captured forever in these richly drawn characters. Fitzgerald had the most distinctive style of writing I have ever experienced. No one else has ever even come close to his genius. He can dissect and carve out the essence of his characters using the most lovely prose. His descriptive phrases still leave me breathless. I am only sorry that he died prematurely in 1940 at the too young age of 44, thereby depriving us of the privilege of reading more of his magnificent writing. We must make do with what he was able to give us in the brief time he was on this earth."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is nearest the perfect novel our country has produced. The first twenty pages represent the smoothest prose to be found in a modern novel, and introduces the ideal narrator, Nick Carroway, truthful, dryly humorous, accepting, nonjudgmentall, kind, modest, and likable. The story moves along briskly, though not big on magniloquent ideas. Rather, the story is a chronicle. It etches in stone the Jazz Age, with all its superfluities, excesses, and bubbly froth. It has every American theme--the nostalgic look backwards to aristocracy, the striving for success, the have's and have nots, the intersection of the old and new, the loss of hope for those who can't keep up with their dreams, and the bumptious, hyperactive quality that supposedly characterizes our country. There is rarely a paragraph that does not have wit, poignancy, and the eye of the narrator registers all with a detached discernment. Indeed, the overarching consciousness and morality of Nick Carroway may be the best part of this great novel. Through Carroway, the action of the novel moves along, giving a moral ascendancy to all the sordid and comic activities he views. The novel is uniquely evocative, rousing in the reader feelings of humor, sadness and regret that only the best art can, so that the reader himself experiences a sense of yearning for all that has passed, for the romanced past, just like the protagonist, who seek vainly to regain it. And the last lines of the novel are amongst the most poignant ever written. Damon LaBarbera, PhD"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Personally this is the second time I have read The Great Gatsby, the first time in college and now 20 plus years later. I had remembered the main storyline but had forgotten what a good read the book can be. Fitzgerald provides a nicely written, not overly long or multifaceted story that is full of complexity and insight into America in the 1920s (and in some ways today).Everyone's life in the story seems to be based on or involves a lie (Tom and Daisy in their marriage, Daisy in her role in the death of Myrtle, Jordon's success in her profession, Myrtle and Wilson in their marriage, Meyer Wolfsheim's notoriety, and of course Gatsby in his whole being). Even Myrtle's sister Catherine, a minor character, lies when arriving at the site of her sister's death. All of these lies exist under the ever vigilant eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, though no one seems to have any reservation about being watched. Nick, our narrator, claims he is one of the few honest people he has ever known. Yet he is complacent and allows the lies to occur and, in some cases, is an actual accomplice in the carrying forth of many of the lies. Does this make him a liar, or worse.Though ultimately a story, or statement, about 1920's America the story contains a timeless theme, true wealth can correct a lot of wrongs. Tom and Daisy left a horrible trail behind them. Their wealth will allow them to move forward with little to no impact. While many of the others are not poor they lack the means, financially and mentally, to move forward the way Toms and Daisy's wealth allows them to do.Was Jay Gatsby great as supposed in the title, I don't know. Nick seemed to have been converted to believing so at the end after despising him earlier. Better than the whole lot he states. But can some who is completely a fabrication be great? The obvious answer is yes as we have seen it through the ages but I don't know about Gatsby.Enjoy the book. It's a great read that has multiple layers."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This story of the 'lost generation', those who came of age in time to fight in WWI and, if they were lucky, returned home to find that everything had changed, especially themselves. This generation was no longer content to stay in the small towns and cities that their families had lived in for generations. The young men did not want to enter into the family business and settle down with a suitable young woman from nearby. The young women were not content to stay in their parents' house and wait, they wanted out in the world to 'do something'.The story is told, not through the eyes of Gatsby but through those of Nick, a young man from the midwest who has settled in New York to learn the bond game. By chance he has rented a house on Long Island for the summer, a small cottage stuck among much grander mansions and, again by chance, across an inlet from a cousin, Daisy and her husband Tom, who, also by chance Nick had known slightly in college. Also by chance, Nick's neighbor, the mysterious Gatsby had been one of Daisy's many suitors before she had settled down with Tom. Nick soon finds himself swept into the glittering, glamorous world of Gatsby and Daisy and Tom. He is made an unwilling witness to Tom's infidelity, the one sided romance of Gatsby and Daisy and finally to the tragic results of it all.THE GREAT GATSBY is a very American story, one that depicts the American restlessness, the desire to be more, better, different from all that has come before. As with many books that are assigned reading this one is often forced on an audience that is too young to appreciate it. Like many others I hated this novel when I first read it (I was an 18 year old college freshman) but found that it stuck with me, unlike many other assigned books, long after the final exam. Over the years I have read it several times and each time discovered something new, a different aspect of the novel becoming the 'point' of the story.This is one everyone really should read at least once, perferably a couple times, in their lives."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I have just finished this book and it is a very pleasant read. The 1920's have always intruiged me and this book has made me even more hungry for stuff from this decade. I love Mr. Fitzgerald's method of writing, almost poetic in nature but borderline overly-sentimental (although the Age of Excess as the 20's were deemed may have aided in this extra drama).The way Fitzgerald characterized the rich is also very interesting. From Tom Buchanan to Jordan Baker, these rich social elites are wonderfully crafted with complex personalities. I love it! I also enjoy the the descriptive detail given to each scene...its amazing.Overall..a stunning piece of work that I would readily reccommend."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book is so simple, and so brief, and it's not really about much more than a wealthy, mysterious, lovesick man who throws parties to attract a girl he loved and lost.But, it's amazing.F. Scott Fitzgerald was a true wordsmith. He knew how to use the english language, and in \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" he used it more skillfully than he ever had before. He was a painstaking writer who went over every sentence over and over again, and his exactness shows.That's not to say that the book is flawless--there are whole books that exist just to list the book's faults, especially in its chronology--but let's see YOU write a book this good. The book is streamlined and focused, in part due to Fitzgerald's time spent writing an unsuccessful script right beforehand. The structure of a script--in which every scene leads to the next, and every scene moves the story forward, and the whole thing is resolved in about ninety minutes or so--taught Fitzgerald immeasurable amounts about what this book didn't need to make it great, and about how to propel a story forward.The characters are memorable, the place and time (the jazz era) are vividly depicted, and the writing will surround and enfold you.Ignore that kids have to read this in high school--that it's almost a textbook to them. Just be glad it exists, and give it a read. It gets better every time, and you may find yourself wanting to re-read it almost immediately after finishing it.I know it's happened to me more than once."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Having reread this book for the first time in 20 years, I can confirm that there's a reason that it's considered one of the very best American novels. However, my reaction to the story was different than when I first read it in high school. I recall that back then I was hoping that Daisy and Gatsby's love story would ultimately yield a happy ending. Now, I found them both to be such shallow creatures that they inspired no pity. While I considered the characters to be emotionally stunted, that dooesn't mean I was not impressed with Fitzergerald's skillful rendering. As in most forms of art, in literature it is more difficult to accurately and interestingly portray nothingness than to describe a richly endowed subject. At this more cynical age, I found Daisy to be a remarkable emotional void, and Gatsby's quest to pour all of his hopes and dreams into such a shallow cauldron only confirmed his own vapidity. One thing that hasn't changed in all these years is my amazement at Fitzgerald's ability to set a scene. His descriptive passages are truly poetic, and his command of word choice in unparalleled. All this made for a stimulating and delightful read."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Scott Fitzgerald, a monumental talent who only occasionally got things working right, made Gatsby great by the extraordinary invention of Nick Carraway. Carraway as narrator provided the exact perfect pitch: more awestruck than he would admit, more moral than it was fashionable to reveal -- always objective and distanced and subtle and charming, genuinely decent and impeccably well mannered, a little dangerously smitten himself by the lovely but corrupt Jordan Baker.Alexander Scourby, one of the greatest reading voices of his era (overlapping Fitzgerald's enough to know and feel it all) here does Carraway in a way that cannot, therefore, again be quite equalled. Imagine having a recording of a great contemporary actor reading Ahab's speeches in Moby Dick, and one begins to appreciate the gift that we only now have in recorded sound, something we are already quite casual about. But there is much more here than historical accuracy. Scourby's voice wraps around every phrase of Fitzgeral's text with both an actor's professionalism and a good reader's care, making it not only uncannily his own monument but also a monument in audio book history. It sets the bar, and anyone interested in the recorded voice as an art form should own this for repeated learning."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It's difficult to give any even-handed critique F. Scott Fitzgerald's standard-setting Jazz Age novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you'll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Jay Gatsby has for Daisy Fay Buchanan, a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920's is what give the novel its true gravitas.Much of this is eloquently articulated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro.These characters are inevitably led on a collision course that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth. The strength of Fitzgerald's treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author's economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era. It is well worth re-reading, especially at such a bargain price."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I listened to this book over a few nights with my wife, after having read it first some sixteen years ago. It is a masterpiece, and known widely as such, but what surprised me on hearing it was how the book I'd remembered as terribly romantic was actually rather clear-eyed and dark. My wife, who had never read it, listened spell-bound, and at the end burst into tears at the sadness of it. A word about Scourby as reader - he is restrained but emotional, captures the personality of each character with a slightly different tone, and - most importantly for me - brings out the fact that the closing pages, which are often quoted out of context as deeply romantic, are in fact painfully cynical, a voice of disenchantment about the cost of America, not its promise. A masterpiece on the page and on tape. Can't recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I'm troubled that many young people in these reviews don't seem to appreciate this novel. Even when &quot;forced&quot; to read it in high school, I loved it. I've read it for probably the tenth time recently and I can say that every single time it's better than I remembered it. I was prompted by the character is Haruki Murakami's book Norwegian Wood who carries it with him and reads it to cheer him up. This narrator calls it the most perfect book ever written and says that you cannot find a page that's not perfect. I have to agree -- it's not just the plot, it's the beautiful writing and incredible characters and scenes that stay with you years later. Even after years, who can forget the scene when Gatsby shows Nick all his custom made shirts, or Nick describes his first vision of Daisy by comparing her posture to someone balancing something on his/her chin, or any of Gatsby's parties, or the broken nose -- you get the idea. For some reason, rereading this book reminds me of picking up a relationshp with an old friend. It's so very comforting to read the best prose you can find in English and find that certain passages are almost committed to memory. Don't miss out on this one. If you didn't like it in high school, try it again when your reading tastes mature."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The first time I encountered \\"The Great Gatsby\\" it was as an assignment in a high school English class. My recent re-read occurred after my son had read it in his high school English class. The reread brought back memories of a form of academic study from which I have been separated for many years.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an excellent book in which to study the writer's art. In this short book the reader can detect a collection of symbolic details which make the story much more than the tale which appears on the surface: the ash heap, as a symbol of the waste of American society; the green light on Daisy's dock, which means so much to Gatsby as a symbol, until he again meets Daisy, when it again becomes, for Gatsby, as for everyone else, just a light.The characters all play their roles in the development of the story. Shallow figures fill Gatsby's parties, but show their true level of concern for him when they all absent themselves from his funeral. The class distinctions between Daisy, a true upper class maiden, who can never lower herself to accept Gatsby, the aspirant to a class rank which wealth and parties cannot buy. Gatsby's source of wealth is hinted at by his association with Meyer Wolfsheim, the gambler who fixed the World Series. Like others, he will associate with Gatsby in life, but has no time for him in death.The unnatural core of Gatsby's world is illustrated by his act of moving east, rather than the traditional westward migration, in order to achieve freedom and advancement.Tom and Daisy Buchanan represent old money, which will not accept Gatsby and, in the end, destroys him.Nick Carraway is the one character in the book who develops his own moral sense. His role as narrator permits us to see Gatsby's world through his eyes. It is he who sees, and is repelled by, the rotten cores of Gatsby and the worlds in which lives and into which he aspires. He sees the corruption deep inside Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Most of all, we see the innate goodness in Tom. Observing, but not entering Gatsby's world, he is able to understand and judge it. His final evaluation of Gatsby's world is seen when he abandons it all to return to his native Midwest.As I re-read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" I remembered what I had not liked about it the first time I read it. The causal acceptance of infidelity seems at odds with what I have always viewed as the ideal as well as the reality. As one studies the commentaries of this book, with all of its symbolisms, I often wonder if the symbols were really in F. Scott Fitzgerald's mind as he wrote the book, or whether they are constructs of later commentators. Either way, they give the book a depth which so many others lack. When my son speaks of other books he reads in English class, he always says \\"It's no Great Gatsby.\\" The more I think of it, few of novels are."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I have always looked forward to reading the classic book The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. When I finally had time to read it, I wasn't disappointed. The Great Gatsby, written in 1925, is a fictional tale that takes place during the American Jazz Age. The story is set in the eastern U.S. and follows the journey of a young man named Nick. The book trails Nick from his home in the West to his new life in West Egg, New York. Nick becomes involved in the social scene is West Egg, which is mainly centered on the weekly extravagant parties thrown by the incredibly wealthy and strangely mysterious Jay Gatsby. As the book progresses, Gatsby's past is slowly unraveled. Nick witnesses Gatsby's gradual admittance of his significant secret. He discovers that Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy Buchanan, a beautiful socialite, trapped in a miserable marriage to an unfaithful husband. Though Nick does not want to be involved in any way with the illicit love affair between Daisy and Gatsby, he is gradually takes a larger part in Gatsby and Daisy's dangerous romance. When Jay and Daisy decide to declare their love to one another, it leaves Gatsby in an unforgettable and risky situation that changes the lives of all involved. The Great Gatsby was one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. It included a beautiful love story, danger, suspense, tales of true devotion and friendship, and a wonderful, thought-provoking commentary on the society in post-World War I America, a time of excess and confusion. I have learned several lessons from the novel, whether they are about loyalty or remaining true to oneself. I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of thirteen because of some parts of the novel that might be difficult to grasp. The Great Gatsby is a truly wonderful book, and sure to be enjoyed by many for many years to come."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I question whether I should even write a review of a book I dislike which most people, even most of my friends, seem to adore. What it comes down to, for me, is that all the characters, even the best of them (namely Gatsby) are amoral, and the worst of them are vile. I ended up reading this book for school twice. The first time, in high school, I finished it and thought, &quot;I must be missing something,&quot; so I bought and read through the Cliffs Notes, and then said, &quot;Well yes, I knew all that, but so what?&quot; In college I was assigned to read it a second time, and that time I got more substance out of it. The book will never be one of my favorites, though. I just haven't got enough cynicism in my soul (at least not yet, anyway) to look into a moral vaccuum and find much enlightenment there.Perhaps I should read it a third time; it's a short book, after all. I'm older now, and I do get the point in a way I couldn't have then--Gatsby falls in love not with a real woman, but with his own dream vision of her, and confrontation with the real thing shatters him. (Then again, Don Quixote did the exact same thing without making me dislike him.) The equating in Gatsby's mind of love with money is also worth understanding as a very American hang-up, but it does just make him seem pathetic. And yes, I know that's the point.I also concede that one reason I disliked it was the sheer glut of tragedies I was forced to read in school. I find that I have more patience for unhappy endings in fiction now that they're not being forced on me. (Heck, I read Dostoevsky for fun, now). But unhappy endings need not be the same thing as nihilism. Gatsby's universe is a highly nihilistic one, a world so far gone that even the saddest ideals seem priceless simply for being ideals.Perhaps it's the kind of cynicism the book represents--it's not &quot;grumpy old man&quot; cynicism like Vonnegut or Twain, which at least feels earned and honest. No, this is youthful &quot;look how worldly I am&quot; cynicism, the sort that drives us as kids to write bad poetry and wear lots of black. Perhaps that's inevitable--the characters ARE all young, and the book is about decadence.It may also be the humorlessness of the book that sets it aside from Vonnegut and Twain. I enjoyed de Laclos's &quot;Dangerous Liasons,&quot; where the protagonists are both insidiously evil, but at least the cynicism there is laced with black humor. Gatsby carries an unrelenting air of &quot;I'm writing something important, dammit!&quot;It's not my cup of tea. You're free to like it. Most folks do."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"As you can tell by many reviews which surround this one, our world is filled with minds who probably feel that the height of pathos is reality tv, or having to wait in line more than 5 minutes at an ATM.But about Fitzgerald--I'm reminded of Eliot's phrase \\"infinitely gentle, infinitely suffering...\\" (paraphrasing). His descriptions and evocations here are gorgeous, tender--and most of all subtle, which is why Gatsby is lost on so many modern readers. All of this novel is excellent and parts of it absolutely shimmer--Nick's description of the way Gatsby smiled at him. Look at this...\\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced---or seemed to face---the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far a you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\\"Who wouldn't want to believe in that smile?Or take, for example, the scene in which Gatsby shows his closetful of rare, extravagant and wonderful shirts to Daisy and Daisy weeps....not because of his sartorial excellence but because she knows even at that point, in her heart, that she will forever be stuck with that clod Tom.This is about the American Dream, and how the pursuit of it can kick the living s**t out of you....how friends come and go...and how society often rewards generosity with disdain.I beg you to read this book, because it is good for your soul.Just my opinion."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"There are two Kindle editions of The Great Gatsby, both at the same price.Unfortunately the edition I bought, from Old Landmark Publishing, has a number of minor transcription errors. The most notable is the occasionalinsertion of multiple paragraphbreaks within a sentence. There are also occasional misplaced paragraph breaks in dialog paragraphs, which sometimes leads to confusion about which character is speaking.I downloaded the free sample of the Scribner Edition and although that is only a short sample, it appears to be a much better quality transcription.So since there are two Kindle editions available, you might want to avoid the Old Landmark Publishing Edition (the one with the car on the cover) and try theScribner Edition(the one with the stark black and white cover)."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Wow. Age has nothing to do with appreciation of this novel. I had to read Gatsby last year, in the tenth grade, and I absolutely adored it. Fitzgerald did a wonderful job with this story. It is a light and simple read, while at the same time an intricately crafted and beautiful story of Gatsby, one of the most tragic and wonderful characters I have encountered in my seventeen years of reading. This book is worth reading a few times through. Thought-evoking, tragic, and beautifully written, it delivers a tale with a message that you are bound to remember. Classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"What I meant by that statement was that I really must have missed a lot when I read this book. The reason I say that is because I'm an avid reader of classic fiction (great literature from the past and the present), but I just didn't understand why this is considered one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. I chose to read this book in part because of its &quot;greatness&quot; in the eyes of most reviewers. But I found myself 150 pages into it and still waiting for something exciting to happen. It started out slow and just got slower. But I just didn't get it. The ending was definitely surprising (I won't spoil it for whoever's reading this), but somewhat of an anticlimax.What was the most depressing to me is that I have read many other great books that my friends have hated or found utterly boring, and I have just loved them. Examples include &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Ethan Frome.&quot; But I must have just missed something major in this book. I understand all the fuss about the &quot;American Dream&quot; and how this is about the hollowness of rich living, but it seems that in writing about that hollowness, the book becomes hollow too. Well, I'm only 16 and in the 10th grade, so that definitely must be affecting something. I guess I'll just leave it on my bookshelf for a decade and go back and then we'll see where I am. For now, though, I might reread &quot;Beloved&quot; or move on to &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book that has a double meaning throughout the entire story and if one does not realize it, one would think it is just another book. The Great Gatsby is all about what Americans would go through in order to reach the &quot;American Dream.&quot; Some of the reviews that did not like the book were written because they did not understand the real message Fitzgerald was trying to get across. When Gatsby becomes rich all of a sudden, the book implies he was selling liquor in the 1920's when it was prohibited. Daisy is just intereseted in the money, just like everyone, not caring where it came from. There are many implications in the book but Fitzgerald always tries to say things moderately. If someone reads the book just on the &quot;surface,&quot; it is likely the person will not understand the true meaning of the plot and just think it was a story. In order to appreciate the book, one would have to go inside the book to find why each word that is being written is an important component of the story. The Great Gatsby clarifies what the true &quot;American Dream&quot; is and Fitzgerald puts it in a way no one can believe but is true."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This review is not about the book itself, but about the Kindle Edition method of purchasing it. I love this book dearly, I really do, but seriously. Can anyone even BEGIN to explain to me why the Kindle edition is three dollars MORE EXPENSIVE than the paperback? With Kindle books, you don't even have to pay for the paper! To whoever it was who set these prices: I think it's disgusting that you would pull a dirty trick like that on your customers, knowing that a lot of people buy the Kindle edition first, without looking at the paperback. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.This book would have been an easy sale to me, Amazon, because I would really prefer to have it on my Kindle.

The Great Gatsby is widely regarded as a great novel and has been widely acclaimed as such, but having read through it twice I cannot agree. I am merely a well read person and lay no claims as to literary erudition but this book did not live up to my expectations. I found the writing very adjectival with constant use of metaphors, some of which seemed trite and effeminate. In addition the story moves at a slow pace, particularly in the first half of the book where there is much description and virtually no action. Obviously Fitzgerald depicts the period of the early twenties with prohibition allowing quick acquisition of wealth, but the fact that Gatsby returned from military service penniless and alone makes his construction of such a huge fortune in a few years seem unbelievable, even in that era. Gatsby is the least believable character in this whole novel. For much of the time he is a shadowy figure moping around in his infatuation with a woman he was parted from for five years. His behaviour verges on that of a love-sick teenager rather than a war hero. Of course the book depicts the decadence of the wealthy during that period superbly and at times the prose is beautifully descriptive, but the \\"Great American Novel\\" ???"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald's Gatsby is one of the triumphs of American social commentary-as brilliant as it is deep, this poignant insight into the glittering superficialities of the jazz age holds a timeless message about the elusive nature of the American dream. Look beyond obvious plot details and into the intricate web of colors and name symbology to fully appreciate this book. To all the disappointed high schoolers out there, grow up before you read this novel and learn to appreciate this writing for what it is: a nostalgic tribute to a changing society, not an adventure novel for your shallow entertainment."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"What can I say? This is one of those novels that is so beautifully melancholy and tragically romantic as to inspire countless additional readings. F. Scott Fitzgerald has the most unique and surprising way with words. This book not only moved me with its lyricism but left me often with a sort of physical feeling that I simply cannot find words to explain.This novel says so much about the emptiness and excess of the jazz age as experienced by the wealthy leisure class.Fitzgerald so wonderfully portrays the idea that it is the STRIVING for greatness that counts in life, because once it is reached, it can never possibly live up to the grandeur that one envisages in dreams. In many ways, this book suggests the end of the American dream, and while Gatsby himself is not far from reproach, he represents the desire in all of us to be something better. He is both flawed and beautiful; lonely yet eerily surrounded.If you want to be moved, read this book...and really pay attention to the language and the mood; it may very well change the way you see the world."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby holds a special place in my heart. Like Nick Carraway, the narrator, I am a Midwesterner that ventured out East to Yale and returned somewhat disenchanted with the rhythm of life on the East coast. So there are personal reasons for me to identify with the novel, in addition to Fitzgerald's unusual brilliance and mastery of the English language.This was not always the case. Many people-- some of them very intelligent- often faulted The Great Gatsby for being 'soft' or 'too easy to read.' This is not intentional academic snobbery-- how often have readers taken up a facile book without coming away satisfied? Indeed, the critics of Fitzgerald's time did not take him seriously for similar reasons-- I myself fell within this skeptic group until I reread the novel four years later after heavy exposure to the other literary lights of that time.Having now read The Great Gatsby approximately twenty times, I have come to recognize the unique power of the novel. It is, as described in the introductory essay, a complete miracle. It is a miracle of social criticism as witnessed by the unsurmountable gap between old and new money; it is a miracle (one might almost say an inevitable result) of the modern schism between the age of hard-nosed science and pure romantism; it is a miracle of story-telling, combining Hemingway's lucid economy with Faulkner's innovation and power. The result is Fitzgerald's characteristic 'magic voice,' which has yet to be duplicated by any author since.And above all, it is a good story. At the heart of the tale is the use of a partially-involved first person narrator (in the form of Nick Carraway), combining the power of the first-person POV with the sweep and scope of the third person narrative. This stroke of genius becomes even more evident as parallel story lines develop, resulting in the convergence of the two paths and the famous closing scene with the now-transformed Nick brooding on the deserted beach.There is so much to this book that it is impossible to list all that I admire. Yet paradoxically, unlike other masterworks like Absalom! Absalom!, it is possible for everyone who reads The Great Gatsby to view the work in its totality. It is so natural that it is almost as if Fitzgerald did not write it, and rather, the work appeared completed and perfect of its own volition-- a masterpiece for everyone."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I am sorry to have waited so long to read this masterpiece. F. Scott Fitzgerald's crowning achievement is a relatively concise, easily readable gem of a story, which goes much deeper than the average genre fiction (obviously), but not in a dull way.It is very easy to picture oneself as Nick, the protagonist, attempting to piece together this strange character, Jay Gatsby, and the elaborate world he inhabits. Character development is beautifully accomplished as the book progresses, and there is no wasted scenes or characters. In fact, there is a great deal of substance to the entire story, despite its focus on the lack of substance for the characters presented.The Great Gatsby will help you understand the lives of the fabulously wealthy in the 20s, but more importantly it will help you begin to understand the real world, and what is really important. Gatsby's &quot;Green light&quot; is each of ours as well, if we would only see it.If you have a soul, you will love this book, and either way, it will certainly make you think."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This novel has been characterized as the quintessential American novel, and even as &quot;THE&quot; American novel. Whether or not I agree with that characterization, F. Scott Fitzgerald's short but dense tale is a masterpiece. That said, there is not much I can add to the years and years of analysis and praise. This book is simply stunning.I will not rehash plot details here, but I will make a few comments. I studied this book as an English major at college, and just reread it for fun 10 years later. I remember reading it as a student, and learning about all the symbolism present. If you look for it, you can find symbolism contained in every paragraph. A few symbolic themes I remember studying were those of colors, the weather, religion and the Bible, and numbers. I remember learning that different colors represented different traits. White, for example, supposedly represents purity, while yellow represents artificiality. Therefore, the name Daisy is itself a symbol: a daisy is white on the outside and yellow in the center. Accordingly, Daisy appears to be pure but inside is tarnished and artificial.While it is fascinating to study all the symbolism in this novel, this time I read it purely for the story. And the story is more than enough. Strip away all of the symbolism, and this would still be a masterpiece. This is the tale of a twisted perversion of the American dream--one of Gatsby's ambition to amass a fortune in order to win over Daisy. Yet he will never win over Daisy, for she will never love one who has to earn his wealth. It is the story of Gatsby's failure to win even one true friend, despite the fact that his house is always filled with people, and everyone &quot;knows&quot; him. Even the narrator only arranges Gatsby's funeral out of a sense of obligation and pity.This slim masterpiece is beautifully and concisely written, and heartbreaking without ever being sentimental. This book has survived 75 years worth of critical analysis, and it still going strong. In another 75 years, people will still be studying this grotesque manifestation of the American dream."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read this book in high school for a class and thought it was one of the most boring pieces of crap I would ever read.

I decicded to read it again, carefully trying to asorb some meaning.And I found it.This book is really profound, a great work. The characters all fit together so well, and the story just takes you back to another time.If you are 14-18 years old, and just read this book to read it you wil not enjoy it. I think I just wans't mature enough to appreciate this work before. Don't judge this book by the first time you read it. Take the time to read it again and think about it; you will love it.A good analogy is how a diamond in the rough just looks like glass on the beach, sanded and hidden in a fog.

Re-reading this book nearly 100 years after it was written, I realize that no one else has better captured the essence of 20th Century America, nor described it as eloquently. Not a single word is wasted in this work. The last lines are an amazing summation of not just this novel, but of human existence (they are engraved on Fitzgerald's tombstone). &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; are the only books about America that are even in the same league as &quot;Gatsby,&quot; but they are not as brilliantly conceived and executed."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I am one of those \\"freaks\\" who makes sure to read this novel at least once a year.

She is noy human it seems, and Gatsby cannot keep up, no matter how hard he tries.This novel was required reading in high school, and thank God for that.

Jay Gatsby pursues the American dream with a single minded zeal and the closer he gets to his dream the emptier he is. The greatness of the book is both in this theme and in the way Fitzgerald makes Gatsby stand for all of us Americans. In his later works Fitzgerald falters but here every last detail is in its proper place. The narrator Nick is the perfect voice for this story. Through his eyes we may see that Gatsby is not all that Gatsby wants to be but like Nick we let ourselves be seduced anyway. The most superficial creature in this book, Daisy, is the object of Gatsby's lifelong obsession. She is about as weak as that flower and no more complex. Only Gatsby with his undying ability to dream which is unmatched by any character in fiction and the reason we all love him can imagine she is anything more than the common flower of her namesake. Everything functions and happens exactly as it should. No plot, I suggest, can be repeated by more readers. I put this in a tie with Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises for greatest book by an American. Hemingway's book is equally great though for quite different reasons. I think in his next book Tender is the Night Fitzgerald is trying to cover Hemingway's terrain but unlike Hemingway Fitzgerald does not really belong in Europe. Hemingway uncovers what it is to be American by showing Americans outside America and in contrast to Europeans. Fitzgerald never brings his Americans abroad in contact with anything but each other. But in this book he is brilliant. I just wish he would have stayed put."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"You were probably assigned this book as a teenager, for school, like every other teenager in America. I know I was. But if you were like me you were totally unable to appreciate it. More recently (read: 10 years later) I re-read the book. I don't need to say it's the greatest American novel ever written, since so many before me said it much more eloquently.All I can add to the chorus of praise is that this book is much more meaningful when you're a little older and able to appreciate it, and it's actually a very quick read. The experience of reading this in your 20s (or later) is extremely pleasant and rewarding.Enjoy! :)"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Can we all agree that this is the Great American Novel?It captures, perfectly, the spirit and sounds of the Twenties. Fitzgerald's characters are so well imagined that they take on a life of their own - so much so that turning the book into a film is well nigh impossible. Even though it has been done a number of times, the casting is usually wrong, at least in part.We have such a vividly personal idea of whom Tom and Daisy, Nick and Jordan and yes, Gatsby are, that no one actor or actress can quite satisfy on the screen. So too with the symbols, from the light at the end of the dock to the billowy room and those ever- watchful eyes...This book is worth keeping near by, and re-reading often. Say, once a year. It really is a modern marvel - and o so much more than a snapshot of its time.Fitzgerald got it so right in this novel that it remains his tragic fate that he never quite equaled his genius elsewhere. Perhaps because the people are real people, aren't they? We can, for instance, say that Nick and Gatsby are the two personas of F Scott and that Daisy is pretty much Zelda Sayre, and when we do, we will appreciate them more, not less.Read it for the romance, read it for the razzmatazz, read it for the historicity, read it for the tragedy, read it for fun and read it for consolation.

There was a lot of description about the period, and society behavior of the period, that didn't seem particularly relevant, and the end seemed morally ambiguous. However, much of this short novel has stuck in my mind, especially the characters, longer than other novels I read (mostly sci-fi and mysteries).It also seemed a mistake to make the protagonist a bystander with only passing reference to Gatsby during the first third of the novel. On reflection, this probably built up the mystery about the character and kept me reading. Since then I've watched the movie with Alan Ladd, and they dropped that device, bringing Gatsby in early. The movie seemed like it would be thoroughly dull to anyone who hasn't read the book, though relatively faithful for a Hollywood adaptation."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Gatsby was a beautifully written novel, set in the Jazz Age.

Maybe that wasn't the point, but from the perspective of a pleasure reader it made the book rather dull. As a study of the culture of the twenties or of the theme of time in a period coming directly after WWI, it is amazing and captivating, but the characters were so shallow that I felt a strong detachment as i was reading further and further into the novel. Gatsby is a complete flop, spending all of his energy tryig to redo the past, Daisy is so flippant that you can't truly care for her, Tom cheats on his wife and hits his girlfriend, and Nick allows himself to get sucked into their games. Although written well, and worth all the acclaim it has recieved i personally did not enjoy this novel or find it particularly engrossing."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"To only have lived in this well depicted time period. The least I can say is that it took me as close to it as I will ever come. It was almost like time travel. I re-read it constantly just to pretend I'm there."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby was possibly the single greatest book I've ever read. The attention to detail is amazing. He puts in short descriptions of all of the characters. This book is a model for a love story. This is like a building block for modern love stories."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read this whole book in one sitting. I LOVED IT!! It is by far my new favorite book. It was truly the first \\"school book\\" that I could not put down. I highly suggest it!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I first read The Great Gatsby while in high school. I thought it was wonderful at the time, but I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now that I've read it for the second time. The story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan enthralled me from beginning to end. Written during the Jazz Age, which is also the story's backdrop, F. Scott Fitzgerald tells the tragic and decadent love story of an impoverished officer who seeks wealth in an attempt to woo Daisy. He also happens to want to obtain a respectable place in society. However, Gatsby's attempts to obtain both Daisy and richness beyond his wildest dreams backfire and he soon falls from grace in a poignant conclusion that brought tears to my eyes.Someone once asked me if I wanted to be like Jay Gatsby -- if I wanted to aspire to things beyond my means and want someone who will never be within my reach. And that is the reason why this novel touched me so much. It spoke to me. Gatsby is one of the most compelling characters ever written. And the love story is quite a sad one, but I think that that's what makes it memorable and special to me. And the fact that the story is narrated by a third character -- Nick Callaway -- makes the reader appreciate both sides of the coin, though Callaway is quite vocal about his own observations and prejudices. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a true American classic. I have read it twice and will no doubt reread it at some stage in the future. I cannot recommend this American classic enough."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This story starts out relatively slow, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It tells the story of Jay Gatsby who tries to win back the love of Daisy Buchanan with his money. The story is narrated by Nick Carroway who views all aspects of the rich. Whether it's the front that Gatsby puts on or the deception between the Buchanan's, he views it all. The American Dream is the theme throughout this novel which seems to be what every character longs for. Overall I would definitely recommend this novel because many people could learn a valuable lesson that the \\"American Dream\\" is not all that its cracked up to be."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Scott Fitzgerald has been showered with praise and celebrated as one of the great authors of the century, and deservedly so. His language is remarkable because he uses quite an extensive vocabulary with the utmost precision, and is able to create vivid characters with a few succint phrases, a few strokes of the artist's brush. However, there are two things that strike me as odd in this novel: the &quot;prologue&quot;, that is, the first few paragraphs, which must have been written after the rest of the novel had been completed. This is a strange and ambiguous opening, and I am not sure that it is very good. And secondly the ending itself, because closure is brought about by introducing an accident (Daisy running over Tom's mistress). Somehow this is not satisfactory, at least not to me, because it avoids a final confrontation between the characters. Here Fitzgerald may as well have sent down a bolt of lightning to kill someone! People's fates in literature should be decided by themselves or by some other character, not by something beyond anyone's control. Why? Because that negates that character is fate and action; in fact, EVERYTHING in a novel should stem from character."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"That quote sums up the book for me.I don't think I would have appreciated this book as a young person. Now, however, I understand the folly of chasing castles in the sky. In Gatsby you see a man who could have done so much but wasted his precious life chasing an illusion. Daisy embodied everything he thought he wanted: beauty, wealth, and a name. Yet we see (and I don't think Gatsby ever understood) that it was all a mirage. For all of their wealth and breeding, Daisy and Tom were vapid, shallow, cruel people who deserved each other.Anyone unfortunate enough to enter their sphere would be crushed and cast aside."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This was a memorable way to \\"read\\" the F.

Thank God for Amazon and it's incredible books at reasonable prices. Amazon makes reading the classics easy, accessible and affordable. What more could I ask for?"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Ah, THE GREAT GATSBY. The defining novel of the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's masterpiece. The Great American Novel. I first read this in High School and then again in a College course called \\"Literature of the Jazz Age\\" which also featured Hemingway'sA Moveable Feast. Hem and Scott were friends who despised one another. Hem once crushed a glass in his bare hand and in a fit of machismo said, \\"Scott can you do that?\\" Fitzgerald answered, \\"Hem, you're such an @$$40/#.\\" Hem, on his side, thought Scott was a \\"powder puff.\\"Having re-read it several times since, I'll say that THE GREAT GATSBY is great. It is a beautifully crafted prose poem in which every word serves a purpose; there's no excess here.If you haven't read it, it is the story of Jay Gatsby, a Long Island millionaire who is hopelessly in love with Daisy, married to Tom Buchanan, as told to us through the eyes of Nick Carraway, who watches as their insular world unravels.Almost everybody who dislikes this book seems to focus on the negativity of the characters. They miss the point. The characters ARE negative and shallow by design: Tom is cruel, Daisy is a b**ch, Jordan is vapid, and Jay is a phony. They aren't supposed to be likeable. THE GREAT GATSBY's only sympathetic character is Nick. If you read this book carefully, you'll see that this is Carraway's autobiography. Notice that Carraway walks away from all the false glitter of Gatsby's time, leaving behind all the wreckage the others have caused.Another huge complaint I see in the reviews is how BORING the book is, and how impenetrable it seems. The atmosphere of the story is one of stultifying heaviness. With all their money, the characters have no idea how to exist, much less live and thrive. At one point Daisy asks a general question about having plans with friends, \\"What do people plan?\\" Jay, Daisy, Tom and the others are suffocating, and it is a mark of this book's excellence that that airlessness impacts the reader. Some readers may, however, find it a slog.Is Carraway Fitzgerald? Very possibly. As a younger man, he fell in love with his future wife, the less-than-stable Zelda, and suffered through her various crazinesses. He strove to impress her and satisfy her endless wants (much like Gatsby with Daisy). THE GREAT GATSBY (originally titled AMONG THE ASH-HEAPS AND THE MILLIONAIRES) is in part a recounting of his own maturation.AMENDED REVIEW 10/7/10"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"First and foremost, this is a great book. Anyone who enjoys literature will fall in love with Fitzgerald's examined manipulation of the English language that can be called nothing else but art. Every word speaks volumes in this tale of minimal pages but endless emotions. It is a book to be savored and one that continues to get better with age."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I have heard it said that English is not a beautiful sounding language and that American prose in particular seems tone-deaf. I submit that people that say these things have never read Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"But if the beautiful sentences were simply that, the book would not work on the deeper level that gripped me within a couple pages. There has been criticism of, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" that its overly romantic but I think the book is tapping into something more than that. It embodies and presents the American yearning for identity which is part wealth, part status, part beauty and part awe. This yearning goes beyond anything attainable and into the dangerous realm of self-delusion to which even someone as strong and decent as Gatsby succumbs.Gatsby isn't a tragic hero because want he seeks isn't monumental - the adulterous love of Daisy but the way he pursues her is heroic because it consumes his whole life. Everything he is and does is aimed at gaining access to the social strata in which she lives. And the novel shows that elite society to be superficial, empty and thoughtless but Gatsby can't see that because he is so consumed with obtaining Daisy.And someone could write an entire dissertation (and probably several people have) on the role of the automobile in Great Gatsby. When the book was written in 1923-24, the automobile was just on its way to becoming mainstream. They weren't a luxury but neither had they yet become commonplace. Fitzgerald was able to see the car not just as a symbol of his character's reckless disregard but as embodying both the rush to freedom and the ugly ruin of American life. The ash heaps and haunting eyes staring out from of the Dr. T.J. Eeckleburg billboard is where autos refill and where a pedestrian is run over by Gatsby's car. The automobile allowed the characters impulsively decide to drive to New Yok City for drinks they don't even consume but to do so they must travel through industrial and commercial blight. Isn't this the devil's bargain we have all surrendered to?"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"4 stars means: It was a great book and I would recommend it to almost anyone.This novel best epitomizes the 1920s in New York and the U.S. as a whole. Although it starts moderately slow, as a lot of 'classics' sometimes do, at least to the modern reader, it is a engaging read with genuinely interesting and extremely complex characters.On the characters: Few novels manage to create this depth of personality in such a large number of characters over so few pages. You come to, if not like, at least be interested in the fate of everyone in the novel. Although there are very few people you could honestly root for this becomes part of the fun of the book.The party scene is a seminal moment in fiction. It is one of the best captured moments through so few words.The prose is not fluffy but well crafted and meaningful. Fitzgerald manages to illuminate deeper issues in the plot through brilliant diction and subtle analogies.This and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button are the only works of Fitzgerald which I have read, but both have made me want to enjoy more of them.

In truth, while well done, Gatsby is not as exceptional as many would have you believe. I think perhaps people have gotten to the point of lauding this book simply because it is the popular thing to do.

You must take your time to really figure out the characters and their intentions."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The story was beautifully written but yet is so terribly tragic. Gatsby's desperate attempt to win Daisy's heart is so terribly vapid. Gatsby is a man with so little content, but yet so many complexities. Fitzgerald's writing style is so brilliant with the description of life on New York's Long Island. The shallowness and pure moral emptiness of the characters resonates throughout the novel. Gatsby dies for his own criminal sins, but also for the sins of the party goers. Fitzgerald voyeuristically brings the reader along on a joyride with Gatsby as his life spirals out of control. His murder stops the joyride not only for the party goers but for the readers as well. The lack of attendance at his funeral shows that he had no true friends, but that everybody, excluding the narrator, used Gatsby only for his money. The people of Long Island, including Daisy, are slaves to Mammon and this sickens Fitzgerald to the core. Fitzgerald through Gatsby questions American values, but American society in general. God in Long Island is replaced by advertising bill boards for eye doctors. The writing style is splendid and the story is captivating yet saddening. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is the greatest novel of the 1920's, and top five all-time in American literature."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Can't identify good literature when they see it. Fitzgerald masterfully pulls off second-person narration. He crafted each sentence to create one legendary masterpiece.

As a junior in high school, my class read this book which I thought was going to be the typical boring English book but it is truly a well-written work.I believed the book starts out pretty slow but as reader gets deeper and deeper into the book, they can find mystery, intrigue, romance, and other subplots. Readers can find the mystery which surrounds Gatsby. He only reveals bits and pieces about his past which leaves the reader to speculate some things about him. The intrigue and romance mingle into the odd love relationships of Tom, Daisy, Gatsby, and Myrtle. Did Daisy truly love Gatsby? Does Tom even care about his mistress Myrtle? All the confusion will make a head-on-collision toward the end of the book.So even if you do not get any of that symbolism or delve deeper into the novel, it's still worthwhile to read this American classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It is Mr. Fitzgerlad's great misfortune to find that his acknowledgement as one of this young country's few authentic literary masters should be to have his work forced upon millions of the nation's TV reared, comic book-glutted High School students. Wholly unprepared to see the author's work in a cultural or artistic context (for to do that they would have had to read legitimate novels in the past), they doubtless rush for the Cliffs notes or else plagiarize reviews in abetting encyclopaedias for their sham book reports. This sacrilege is as nothing, though, when compared to the frustrating denunciations of &quot;right-thinking&quot; young people who, ignorant of changing historical and cultural trends, can't understand why Fitzgerald had his characters express themselves as people really spoke and NOT according to the politically correct scripts that are so common nowadays in the hangover after the nightmare illusion of Free Speech."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read these &quot;reviews&quot; of an American masterpiece where people are comparing the Great Gatsby to a soap opera when the story is so much more epic than the brainwashed masses who sit in front of TVs can recognize.

Jay Gatsby longs to become rich and captivate his only love. It depicts the longing to relive the past intricately yet adds a feeling of grand admiration for Gatsby. Gatsby was just a man, surrounded by attitudes and consequences. This book only lets the reader admire a fictional character while leaving him or her without a learned lesson or a thought to ponder over. I truly believe the essence of this book is powerful yet only for the main character not the public.

I never understood this because, for me, the emotional core of the novel is understanding the extent to which men are willing to fabricate and chase illusions. This slim beast of a novel allows us to walk in the shoes of a man determined to recreate the past and shape reality to his wishes. Everything Jay Gatsby does is designed to win back his love, but time, social status, and reality stand between him and his dreams. By empathizing with Jay Gatsby, we understand our own desires to recapture the past and our own tendencies to objectify the people we cared about. It is for this reason that this is a great piece of literature worthy of reading and rereading.For those out there who find the characters unsympathetic, please note that the same negative traits found in the characters are the same traits we all have. Gatsby, Daisy, etc... are not supposed to be role models, they're supposed to highlight our own desires and flaws. While we might not find them euphoric to be around, we certainly learn more about ourselves by being with them.

He doesn't disappoint from beginning to end, I recommend to any book lover out there or anyone looking for something to keep them occupied. One of the greatest era to write about in the greatest city in America!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"By some quirk in my personal history, I'd never read GATSBY. It has many beautifully written, poetic passages, and Gatsby's demise retains an ineffable sadness that moved me in the final pages. The absence of mourners at his funeral was particularly poignant. Fitzgerald's theme of pursuing an incompletely realized dream is universal, with the corollary that if one's timing is off, the dream may forever remain out of reach. Add to this a crushing irony: in order to win Daisy, Gatsby strove to make himself a member of her wealthy Long Island society, but she is shallow and frivolous and her husband is brutish and racist. The others in their group show no loyalty to Gatsby, the man who'd thrown them lavish parties, by deserting him in death.I'll comment briefly on the poetic nature of Fitzgerald's prose. He uses two metaphors involving water that are linked inextricably to the action of the novel. At the beginning of the story, the narrator, Nick, notes that \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes...\\" comparing conduct to an edifice that can be built on a solid base (\\"hard rock\\") or a tenuous one (\\"wet marshes\\"). Foreshadowing is at work here as Gatsby's springboard into affluent society turns out to be a yacht in a dangerously shallow mooring. Unfortunately, Gatsby is floating in his pool at the end when he is shot to death. The novel concludes with another \\"wet\\" metaphor in the justly famous line \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" Humans are boats struggling to row into the future, while all the while carried backward by Time's river. Figures of speech are only effective if they complement the surrounding language and action.Another vivid display of language occurs at the beginning of Chapter III with a 2 1/2 page description of the preparations for and beginning of a typical Gatsby party. \\"On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\\" Later, the narrator notes, \\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\\" A milieu built on the \\"wet marshes\\" indeed."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Reading The Great Gatsby in high school almost seems like an American rite of passage. When I read it years ago in high school, I didn't care for it. Actually, I hated it. But after seeing that title pop up over and over again among lists of the greatest novels, I wanted to try it again. Did I like it any more the second time around? Nope.First, there is the language. Most people will tell you that that is what they love about the book, that The Great Gatsby is the prime example of exquisite and beautiful language. Maybe it works for you, but reading Fitzgerald's words leaves me scratching my head wondering, \\"What is he trying to say?\\"Let's take a relatively unimportant line from Chapter 1 as an example. Fitzgerald writes, \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\\" Okay, what does that mean? I get the second half of the sentence - that the narrator doesn't care how one's conduct, i.e., one's behavior, is founded - that it doesn't matter whether you were brought up with great advantages or if you were brought up without them. But why hard rock? Why wet marshes? What does that mean? Hard rock? Wet marshes? Maybe you have a great answer for me, and I'm just not getting it. That's entirely plausible. But without a straight answer, I'm just left struggling. And this happens all over the place in this novel - words that conjure up images that float in the sky without any meaning to ground them.Second, there are the wholly unlikeable characters. What more needs to be said? The characters are wholly unlikeable. All of them.Third, through the narrator Nick Carraway, we are treated to a love/hate relationship with the wealthy class of the time period. We are to be in love, in awe, and in constant fascination with this one percent (to use today's language) for no reason other than the fact that they have lots of money. We are to be envious of and hopelessly attracted to high society. And although Fitzgerald paints these one percent characters as wholly unlikeable, he falls short of actually condemning their behavior. It's not a scathing satire. In the end, you still see the glimmers of attraction. And this, I cannot stand. I cannot stand the pathetic fawning over of the one percent. Cue eye roll. Get a backbone and find some self-worth. Please.Why two stars instead of one? My hatred of this novel bordered on obsession. I kept wondering why I disliked it so much. Those thoughts kept churning and churning in my head. And so, two stars instead of one, because evoking this level of obsession is worth something."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I've just reread THE GREAT GATSBY for the first time since high school. It's amazing we had to read it in high school. How could a teenager understand all this stuff about adultery and materialism? I remember my eleventh grade teacher said that F. Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;wasn't a first rate writer, but he was a very good second rate writer.&quot; Even in eleventh grade, I found that horrific. Why labor at all to write a book in the first place, pouring all your life blood into writing what would become a 20th century classic, just to have some high school English teacher dub you &quot;a very good second rate writer&quot;?In my English teacher's defense, we were a very trying class. She was trying to get us to elucidate the symbolic meaning in the scene where Jay Gatsby stands on his dock and stares at the green light across the water. She said, &quot;The dock scene . . . what comes to your mind?&quot; The jocks who sat in the back of the class yelled, &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock.&quot; The poor woman literally banged her head into the brick wall of our classroom.Rereading THE GREAT GATSBY all these years later, I am struck with how fresh and utterly relevant it is. In essence, it isn't dated at all. What happened in West Egg in the Long Island Sound in 1923 could just as well have happened in Silicon Valley in the Dot Com Nineties. There are many Jay Gatsbys. Fitzgerald created an essential American archetype with Jay Gatz, the boy from North Dakota who wanted to reinvent himself and turn himself into something grand, based on the dreams he had for his life when he was 17. We catch a poignant glimpse of him as a thirty-year-old man who woos and impresses his long lost love with his swank mansion and his English tailored shirts. All glitter and glamour, the most important thing is that gaudy surface and facade that dazzles the eye. It says a lot about our culture, about the quintessential American dream."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I've probably read this book 3 times, listened to it on audio tape once, and read it aloud while on a car trip. What can you say about such a powerful and classic book, a book that has come to be symbolic of the Jazz Age with all of its excess and smarmy decadence? The enigmatic and subtly evil Jay Gatsby, self-made man and millionaire, and his passion for Daisy, the wife of the man who lives across the bay from him, are at the center of this novel, which is told from the point of view of Nick, an occasional guest and neighbor on East Egg, who is able to tell the story, eventually, with some degree of detachment and cynicism. There is the inevitability of a Greek drama to the cadences and pacing of The Great Gatsby, a tragedy lying in wait for all involved.Exquisite and spare prose, tight plot, and wonderful characters. It's as good as a novel gets."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I had heard much about this book but had never (unbelieveably) read anything by Fitzgerald. Decided to start and because of the movie (I plan on seeing) I decided to start with this one. The story was great, the writing spectacular and the outcome unexpected."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Hard to follow at times. Maybe I missed something along the way but the ending was a complete surprise to me"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book reads with deceptive simplicity, light and frothy, but in reality it's beautifully crafted. As another reviewer mentioned, it is even better to read later in life, even if you read it back in school, it will 'land' differently now.The story is timeless and very American. The self created master of the universe, still looking out and coveting from his gilded perch.We live in a world full of greedy strivers and wannabes, grasping for success at all costs and often achieving it; who create their identities out of whole cloth, and who we then look up to admiringly, unaware of any seedy backstory.This book is as contemporary now as it was almost 90 years ago when it was written, and probably will continue to be, so long as humans continue to be the greedy schemers they have been to date!And it is written so beautifully. Fitzgerald would be enjoying his renaissance and he deserves it, as his own life was as full of tragedy as it was glitter and praise."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is still one of my favorite books. I decided to buy the very well priced Kindle edition so I could read it on some flights. I'm preparing myself for the movie is coming out. It was actually even better than I'd remembered."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I reread this in preparation for the movie coming out this year. I am so glad that i did as i had forgotten just what a classic this book is. A great story with robust characters that will transport you to another time."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read this book in the 7th grade and while i couldn't remember that much of the plot, I knew that I enjoyed it a the time. I wanted to get reacquainted with it before the movie comes out and I'm so glad that I did. When I was younger, I was so enamored by the lavish, 20's lifestyle that these characters lived- almost as if I was an outsider invited to tag along with them, just like our narrator, Nick. Reading it now, I have a much more skeptical but mature reaction. I felt sad for how lonely and stuck all of these characters were in their life choices. The only person who was able to realize this early on, and know when to say when, was Nick.While ultimately a sad story, I really did enjoy it and happy that I reintroduced myself to Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This book is a classic and when I read it I instantly knew why.The writing is poetic and so are the characters.I had been meaning to read this for a long time and jumped on it when it went on sale. I'm glad I did. This book takes you on a journey through what is right and wrong, good and evil and the blurred lines that exist in that mindset."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I read this in high school, which was a very long time ago. It was worth a re-read as an adult. F. Scott Fitzgerald had a wonderful writing style that is not always seen by our popular author of the 21st centry."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"From what I understand, this book is considered by those in the know to be among the very greatest of American novels, and the most important American novel of the 20th Century. I don't really think it deserves such high praise. Although it is a penetrating look at 20's life- in all its excess- the book falls short on plot and substance. Sure there are greater meanings (don't forget that green light) but reading it is not the pleasure it could be for me. Perhaps I feel this way because I find that much of the writing, especially the dialogue, is still very much ingrained in 1920's culture. Thus, I find it hard to see how it is so timeless in the minds of so many people. So, I personally would give 3 stars but its &quot;greatness&quot; has got to be 5. I will settle with 4."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Mariangeles, why are you so upset? Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and if you didn't like the book, there is no reason to berate others who do. I read this book in my summer school english class, and although it took me a while to get into it, I thought that The Great Gatsby was a well-written American classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald was an absolute genius! He created such a wonderfully rich, complex, and thought-provoking story that will NEVER fail to amaze me --even months after I read it. Sometimes I still find myself thinking about that story deeper every time!Jay Gatsby, a man who spent the better years of his life chasing only one dream --his long love, Daisy. He managed to raise a whole lot of money to buy a large house just to impress this woman who is now married. Will he win?It's no wonder that this masterpiece has earned its place as the second best book of the 20th century. It certainly scores high on my list!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I did not enjoy The Great Gatsby while reading it but after finishing it. I sat down and thought about what i had just read. I enjoyed it, it is about chasing dream that are not realistic. There are lover stories and love affairs throughout this book that makes the plot interesting.The characters are describe in unusal details.It also describes what life was like in the 1920's. After understanding this book I would recomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I was so absorbed in the beautiful tone that I almost forgot about the story. I read the beginning over and over again, and still could not grasp all the mystery and beauty of the world that Fitzgerald was revealing. A true masterpiece. Worth reading 1000 times. That's all I have to say about this book."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Perhaps the strongest point made by this book is Gastby's futile attempt to reach the idealistic goals that he has set based on the romanticism of the 20's. In his work Fitzgerald has created a picture that summarizes an entire decade. The character Daisy also represents the pressures put on women during that time period. This book is excellent for anyone fascinated with the 20's as it transports you to Gatsby's time and for all of you hopeless romantics out there."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"This remarkable book is one of the chief reasons I am such an avid reader of classic fiction. The reasons for this novel's greatness are unexplainable and somewhat mysterious to me. i.e., I have no idea why I love it so much, but I do! With this masterpiece, I believe that Fitzgerald has captured some unknown and unpracticed form of writing that is seldom equalled. With a style all his own, he took an ordinary, everyday setting and plot, with your average &quot;next door&quot; characters, and created something exceeding the extraordinary. Nick, the narrator, has a refreshing, honest way of letting the reader know exactly how Gatsby's story played out, and at the same time bringing us into his own life. I found myself sympathizing with Gatsby, and his love for Daisy, as I would with a member of my own family, and even having feelings, not present in the book, that a man in Gatsby's situation would likely have. It is easy to see, however, how one could misunderstand the book, or have a low opinion of it. There are a number of time-line and grammatical errors, but if it is read for what it is, it will be a cherished favorite forever."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; may at first glance seem to be merely a book on the idle rich in New York. They hold parties, get into arguments, become unhappy in love, and unhappy in life in general. However, in the end, one feels sorry for these tragic characters who represent not only the small group of people who they are, but everyone. They are all of us, searching for what makes us feel complete, whatever that may be. We too wonder at the green light that glimmers off in the distance that we just can't reach."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I have to agree with Mr Vogt (2/15). The negative reviews make me question the quality of the books that people read these days. The lyrical quality and economy of the writing are enough to make The Great Gatsby worth reading. And Fitzgerald's commentary on the &quot;American dream&quot; through the ironies of Gatsby's journey and ultimate fate really resonated with me. And the last two paragraphs....wow!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Perhaps one of the best works of the early 20th century, it is the epitome of all that was the Jazz Age. Fabulous wealth, extravagance, and romance. Still, the characters, especially Nick, seemed a bit 2-dimensional at times, and I personally wished that I could know more about them. Still, the book is a work of art and displays a powerful message, that there is no American Dream. None of the characters ever succeed to attain what they desire, due to personal failings or external forces. An essential read, but a hundred extra pages would have made it a near-perfect book."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I've just finished reading this book in my 10th grade Honors American Lit. class. I can easily say that it's one of the most beautifully written and intricate novels that I've ever read. To those of you who hated it - well, my advice is to quit watching so much MTV and take a couple of hours out to lose yourself in Fitzgerald's masterful style."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The way fitzgerald shows the carelessness of the weathy people of the &quot;great&quot; jazz age is wonderful. The way he used Nick Carraway as the narrater was marvelous. I like the way you start to like these characters and then Fitzgerald starts to show the horrible person that they are. I would recommend this book to anyone you will learn alot about the 20's and perhaps about yourself."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"I don't understand why so many people found the book so boring. The story carried a clear plot and a great view about the 1920s. I personally thought it was really well written. The language might be a little difficult to understand, but that's why there are dictionaries.The Great Gatsby was written 80 years ago, and it is still around today. If it was such an appalling novel, it would never have made it this far. But in any case, it has been passed on to generations, and that is what makes this book a classic."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a unique work written by the american novelist F.S.Fitzegrald.I found my self,while reading it,living the twenties arestocratic society;Away from feeling sympathy with GATSBY."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Well,I am just a lithuanian student(this year I began to study english),who had to read it at university.At first it seemed boring and with a simple plot,but now I am happy I have read it.It shows the society of the Jazz Age and for me,europien girl,it\`s a great possibility to learn about that past.I tried to read it lithuanian,but it was not so good.You really need to read this book in original. I will offer this book to my friends too."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"i read this book for english 10, and i gotta say, it immediately became one of my favorites. it's one of the only &quot;great american classics&quot; i've ever read and actually loved. the story was so relevant and the characters were so real, and the descriptions were amazing. i really understood the book (thanks in part to my teacher who loves it to death and was good enough to explain every little thing in detail) and it was very accurate. i could go on and on but i'mnot the best review writer, so i'll leave it at this: read this book, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"It was a good book I guess. Some parts were pretty boring but other parts were really good! So read the book if you want! I was forced to read it at school!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"Looking over the other responses, I have to include my own two cents and agree with the reviewer who said that anyone who gave this book less than 4 stars is completely oblivious. I first read this book about 15 years ago - when I was 14 and had to read it for my junior high English class. At that time, I too didn't &quot;get&quot; the book, thought it was boring, and couldn't see what all the hype was about. Then I re-read it a few years ago. I was simply amazed at how well-crafted, insightful, and yet SUBTLE the book is. The reviewer who remarked that GG's structure is flawed is especially misguided and probably didn't pay enough attention while reading. In fact, the structure of this book is pretty close to being perfect. The reviewer thought the narration of the events through the point of view of the neighbor is a &quot;crutch&quot; and a worn-out device. Not so! The WHOLE POINT of the novel is NOT, in fact, Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy, as everyone seems to think, but the question: who IS Jay Gatsby? Not only literally, i.e., what is his identity, but also figuratively, who IS he as a person. The story is remarkable in that we never see Gatsby directly; instead, his character is filtered through the views of the people around him. Therefore, the narration of the neighbor fits in perfectly with the overarching theme of the novel: he is left to sort out his impressions of Gatsby much in the same way that the reader is. If the story were told from Gatsby's point of view, we would get too close, know too much about him, and the entire effect would be ruined. As it stands, however, the novel becomes a comment on identity: who we really are, and how other people perceive or misperceive us. (I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read the book yet, but once you do read it, make this connection and you'll see how perfect the structure is.) That other reviewer also made the comment that a great work of art should cause us to think, question ourselves, etc., etc. GG does exactly this, but as I pointed out, Fitzgerald's technique is very subtle - with the result that some of the nuances may be lost on inattentive readers. To those who gave the novel less than four stars: read it again, and this time pay attention and look beyond the surface!"},{"Title":"The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library)","review":"More than anything, a meticulously crafted tale about TIME: its insufferable pace, its disruption, and the fallacy of controlling it. In the end, everyone is human--but Gatsby is worth more than all the &quot;rest of 'em put together&quot;.
