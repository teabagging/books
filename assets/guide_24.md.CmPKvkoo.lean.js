After reading the reviews for the book I have decided to wait until Christmas to read this particular installment. Thanks to the other readers for their reviews. God Bless Jan Karon for sharing the incredible town of Mitford with all its amazing characters with us. I don't think I have ever enjoyed a series more than this."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Mitford Series, having read them more than once. A book that is written in such a way as to have you laughing out loud is a well-written book that allows you to become part of the cast of characters. I was disappointed in Shepherds Abiding because it seemed to me to be excerpts from other books and lacked the humor so integral ot the others. I don't like to have authors ride on their success by rehashing rather than creating. If Jan Karon has nothing new to say about Mitford then she should be honest about it and let the series stand on its own merits."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I had never visited Mitford before, until giving this a listen whilst out and about gathering holly and mistletoe. One need not have started at the beginning of the series to feel like this is an encounter with old friends - Jan Karon creates instant comfort and joy. John McDonough's voicing is a grand rendition, creating excellent personification and differentiation of characters. And it's a merry surprise and a hoot when the Mitfordians do the walk-around town ecumenical Christmas caroling- because he sings, he really sings, not like a professional, but like real townspeople just sharing in the joy of caroling and camaraderie, and the listener can sing along with him.Those who enjoy Touched by an Angel and Little House on the Prairie (they grow on a person ;-) will enjoy Christmastime with the dear hearts and gentle people of Mitford. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"One of many in the lovely Jan Karon's Mitford series. Heartwarming, sweet, compelingly touched with the handprint of God. My favoite books of all time. You can't help but love Father Tim and his family."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"There's little doubt that Jaron's Mitford books are gently entertaining reading pleasures. Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, and all the rest are as unforgettable as a Carolina morning in May and the unique and vividly realistic sense of place she has created is always such a pleasure to visit. This Christmas story with its glimpses of Tim's boyhood is in no way less than any of the other volumes in the series, even in its brevity (which actually makes it perfect holiday reading for harried and frassled readers). But the most wonderful thing of all about this particular Father Tim tome is the absolutely spot-on, subtle but solid, utterly humane depiction of the anticipation, hopefulness, loving sheer unmitigated joy that comes, often over the weeks of preparation, be it right after Halloween or during Advent or even just on Christmas Eve, from Holy Christmastide. Karon is the Mistress of this sort of emotional development and it truly makes a good book even better. A most happy holiday."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"For fans of Jan Karon and Father Tim, Shepherds Abiding is another delightful visit to places and characters we so enjoy. It is an expedition to towns we wished we lived in or at least where we had grown up."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I bought the first six books as a birthday gift for my sister. We were mesmerized right from the start. Father Tim is a real inspiration. These books have been all through the family circle and they are on the second time around."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This whole series just makes you feel warm and cozy. I feel like I'm part of the community."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I listened to this book in April when skies were clear and the California temperatures were mild. Shepherds Abiding took me right into cold and frosty Mitford, smack into the lives of the flawed and fabulous people who live there. The image of the rugged Mitford males having lunch at the local tea shop was hilarious. My favorite part was Uncle Billy's relationship with his difficult wife Rose as she waited for her \\"Santy Claus\\" to visit. I laughed, I teared up and most of all, I felt lifted up by this lovely work. It doesn't have to be Christmas to appreciate Jan Karon's wonderful gift in Shepherds Abiding."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is a good book. Very smooth story. Would make a good Christmas gift. I like Jan Karon's books"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Jan Karon's book is a beautiful respite from the holiday chaos. As always, beautifully written with a feel of catching up with old and dear friends."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This was my first experience with the Mitford Series. The cover looked great, and it being two weeks before Christmas, I picked it up at a book sale for Literacy Volunteers. While I felt that I was missing something by not knowing the characters, it really didn't matter. Karon darts back and forth with the characters along the plot line. It is like a novel on amphetemines. (Maeve Binchy does this threading of plot from character to character- but so much better. She might even spend a full chapter on one subplot to truly engage the reader.) With Shepherds Abiding, my head was spinning. You could read the whole book in one sitting as it lacked depth. Cute story, nice story, simple story. Was there ever a doubt how all of the loose ends would tie together by the end?"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I loved all of her Mitford series books, but this one was a true delight. Save it for December - it will mean more to read it during Advent. Praises for a sweet story."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"The first review described my feelings exactly. There is no plot in this book and very little substance. And I was very very bored by the end. Painting shepherds is not a compelling enough plot."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is the first book in Jan karon's series that I have read.The story was very inspiring.The story was very easy to read an understand. I would recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I am editing this as of 12/26/08 & could not manage to change the stars to reflect it but my first impression has changed. In a couple of Ms. Karon's other efforts she has produced small short stories and sold them as such to those who will buy anything with the word MITFORD on it. And so when this came out I was quick to cry foul as it runs far shorter than I would have liked. As I love recorded books I got it from the library as an audio and as always John McDonough did an outstanding job. Now that time has passed I listened agian and the story was more satisfying. And the part with Fr. Tim & Co. in The Tea Shop ordering lunch was a howl."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"At the heart of this latest addition to the Mitford Series is a strong faith in the Christ Child of Christmas Nativities the worldwide. Ms. Karon writes from a depth of faith lived out in her writing that relates and touches the soul deep within its readers. And we thank God for her and it!Emmanuel (God with us) is prominent in this latest book. From His workings in Father Tim and Cynthia to the other characters, this Holy Child of Bethlehem takes His place at the center of all adoration and praise and thanks as His story is retold through the heartbreaks and gifts given and received in this small Carolina place and time. A small wish that she would have stuck with the Biblical way of salvation, not a saving prayer inviting Christ into hearts, but believe in the Christmas story and what it brought into the world, Our Savior, Redeemer Lord!In her identifying style the author makes this gracious Lord's outpourings burst forth in its radiance and magnificence in the characters' lives. What this reader found attractive and new in this work was the continuing flashbacks Tim has of his youth and father and abiding around the barn as a shepherd, to the ending of Tommy's receiving the same 2-wheels! Great, touching stuff!As the rest, will anxiously await the next and final installment. This will certainly become a classic to be shared, given and treasured.All praise and glory to the gracious Christ Child!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Shepherds Abiding is a short story masquerading as a full-lengthnovel. Jan Karon seems to have already said all she has to say in her previous Mitford books, and is now just trying to satisfy her publisher by filling a niche in the Christmas market."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"After reading the previous books(the first 3 more than once), it was w/ much anticipation that I ordered this. Too much time has passed between the release of new editions to the series, therefore it's easy to forget parts. Also, not much substance or plot to this one and the print was so big, I didn't even need my glasses! It felt like a drawn-out 'Esther's Gift'. Lots of foreshadowing of things to come, but nothing ever does.Since Karon is coming out w/a cookbook in 2004, it's easy to see where the recipes will come from (orange marmalade cake, risotto, tea-room menu. Gee, I'll bet there will even be a section for diabetics!) I feel scammed and definitely will wait to check out the last installment from the library."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Wholesome, sure. Entertaining... not on your life. This entire series is great bed reading for people who can't sleep. It's certainly cheaper and far less adicting than sleeping pills."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I read the first 5 books. Wanted to buy the remainder of the series. I haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"The service from the bookseller was fine. I have long been a devoted fan of Jan Karon's works and Shepherd's Abiding is a great way to start the Holiday Season. I always feel peaceful when reading the Mitford Series. Thanks, Jan!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Loved the first seven Mitford books, but this one did not have much substance. Almost seemed like Karon threw this one together in a hurry. She is usually a wonderful writer but this one was different."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I loved this series and wish Jan Karon would have continued it for a few more books"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I was completely satisfied with my product. It arrived within the specified time, it was new (as advertised), and the price was excellent."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Jan Karon is a wonderful author. I just wish she wrote more books than the Mitford Series. She can make you feel like you actually live in Mitford and are a neighbor or friend of all of her characters."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is a cozy quick story to get you into the mood for the holiday season.There is something lovely about the late-in-life love between Father Tim and Cynthia, who are aging well. Father Tim discovers that while growing old he remembering lost memories. He reminisces about past Christmases with his mother and father, and remembering the imaginative and lonely child that he had been.This is a book that only true die hard fans of Mitford series will enjoy.Don't buy this story on its own. You would have to start at the beginning of the series."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Charming, uplifting tale that centers life in a small town around the true Christmas story - the manifestations of God's gift of love and giving. No magic cats, no tacky love story, no shopping 'til you drop - just the simplicity of the real thing. If you want that, you'll love this book!! An old, seemingly hopeless nativity set is restored and in the process, Father Tim discovers the creativity he never thought he had. BTW reading the book is wonderful, but there is something 'extra' that happens when you listen to it! Have no fear, the audio version includes Esther's recipe as well as a few inspirational snippets of Christmas music."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I loved this book. I love the whole Mitford Series and have read all of the books several times. Jan Karon has such a gift for creating a place that we all go to and feel part of the community. I reread her books whenever I need a little light in my life. It just FEELS GOOD to read these books. They are never a disappointment. The people in them become family.I started the series at the recommendation of a librarian who came into my store and saw my beautiful Bouvier behind the counter with me. I've often said either Jan Karon owns a Bouvier or knows someone who does - she is so right on with bringing their sweet traits to light.I highly recommend this book or any of the Mitford books to anyone who wants a 'slice of life' read. They are inspiring, warm, comforting and just do good things to our hearts in general. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I ordered a bunch of books....All came together and were in good condition....I have not gotten to that book in the series yet, but am sure I will enjoy it as I have the first 6 of Jan Karon's books....."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I realize this book is shorter than the other Mitford books. I think it falls in the \\"Christmas Mitford books\\" class, which are shorter than the others in the Mitford series. This one, however, continues to develop the plot line of the Mitford saga.There is a lot of substance in this albeit shorter book.There is joy and grief (although small griefs) about small town life and small town people during the holiday and Christmas season.There is tension over Hope and her suddenly uncertain future.There is pain as we watch Dooley struggle with some hard things.There is finality as Percy and Velma head into their final days running the Main Street Grill, and sorrow as J.C. Hogan throws a monkey wrench into the works.There is joy and angst as Father Tim attempts an artistic endeavor for a Christmas present for his artistic wife, Cynthia.There is reflection on the Christmas season as a wondrous and holy season.There are gentle reminders of faith in daily life.I found the book very satisfying, both in continuing the Mitford saga, and as a pleasant Christmas (as well as any time of the year) read."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Once again I loved this book, the people in it. It is so refreshing to read in the midst of a life of turmoil."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I have read all the books and have listened to the tapes narrated by John McDonough and have been completely captivated. Although I thoroughly enjoyed reading the books, I enjoyed the audiocassettes read by Mr. Mc Donough even more than the books. He gives Father Tim and all the other characters in the book a life of their own. I have recommended this series to anyone who would like to have a good clean look at life in a small town. I even bought a set for my elderly mother-in-law and she got a real kick out of listening. I wait in utter anticipation for the next book. I have just completed Shepherds Abiding. It did not disappoint me in the least."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"The eighth novel in the bestselling Mitford Years is a meditation on the best of all presents-the gift of one's heart. Lovingly written and beautifully illustrated, it seeks to restore the true Christmas spirit and give everyone a seat at Mitford's holiday table.Since he was a boy growing up in Mississippi, Father Tim has lived what he calls &quot;the life of the mind.&quot; Except for cooking, gardening, and washing his dog, he never learned to savor the work of his hands.And then he finds a derelict nativity scene, including a flock of sheep, that has suffered the indignities of time and neglect.The question is, can he give this assembly new life? Restore the camel's ear, repaint every piece, replace an angel's missing wing? &quot;You can't teach an old dog new tricks,&quot; he reminds himself. Besides, it's his wife who's the artist in the family. Then he imagines the excitement in Cynthia's eyes, and steps up to the plate, beginning a small journey of faith that touches the hearts of everyone around him."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Again Jan Karon does a terrific job. I probably enjoyed this book even more than the others and that is hard to believe. They bring me peace and comfort. I have read all of them over and over and try hard to pattern my life and my thoughts after Father Tim &amp; Cynthia. I really hope that she will write more on Father Tim instead of what I hear is the last of the series coming out soon."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I am truly a fan of Jan Karon but this book was a disappointment to me. Too much of the same thing. Too much of Father Tim's diabetes (we all know he has it) and not enough about the young people. I want to know what Dooley is doing and also Lace and somehow the other child needs to be found. But I had a feeling this was written just to fill up pages. I reread all the Mitford Series every January and saved this one till last and found it shallow compared to the previous books.Hopefully the next one will tie up the loose ends of what is happening to all."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"To respond to the critics: Maybe the margins ARE too wide. Maybe the print IS larger than before, but, this Father Tim/Mitford story touched me as much as any in the past.Maybe it's because of the holidays, but I thought Hope's storyline was terrific. I was pulling for her and her wonderful dream. I loved that Uncle Billy was able to give his wife something very special from &quot;Santy&quot;. It was so true-to-character that Father Tim rescued a neglected nativity scene and put so much pride and work into its restoration.I was surprised to find tears in my eyes at the end ... and now ... as I'm writing this revew. Karon knows how to build up to a slam dunk &quot;defining moment&quot;!I understand there's only one more book in the series.Kudos to Karon for sharing her faith and her sweet, gentle fiction with a world that sorely needs good things.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I eagerly anticipated the release of this book, looking forward to a lengthy return to Mitford and it's lovable characters. Instead I received an unsatisfying hour and a half of Mitford &quot;lite&quot;, a book barely more meaty than an outline. The margins are obviously widened and the spiritual messages, always portrayed by Jan Karon with such &quot;right to the heart&quot; flair, are barely set to motion before spinning out into another quick direction.I would skip this one if I had it to do over. There's no engaging plot, and other than a moment here and there of familiar nostalgia for the town of my dreams, I was largely disappointed.I hope Ms. Karon's heart is back in the next book."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I passed up this book one day, because although I own every Mitford book, I was feeling broke, and the large margins and abundance of white space on each page just ticked me off. But then a friend asked to borrow it, and was so upset that I hadn't pre-ordered the darn thing that I went and bought it. I didn't read it right away. But on the week I chose to read it, I got to some advice from Father Tim that was a specific and perfect answer to my prayers and struggles of that week. In addition, it was just as familiar, fresh, and faith-filled as I expect from Jan Karon, and I'm very glad I broke down and paid full price. A wonderful addition to the series."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Another Father Tim book, I've thoroughly enjoyed all the Mitford series and look forward to more &#34;Father Tim&#34; book.Its a sweet, lovely read."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I picked up the newest installment in the Mitford series from my church library. Yes, the margins are pushed in and yes I wished for more...but I was blessed with what was there. The story of Father Tim's Christmas was exactly what I needed. It is a story of faith, faith in doing what you didn't imagine you could do, faith in hoping for something you never dreamed of having, and faith in the simplicity of the lives of our Mitford family. The book is setting the stage for the end of the series where we may see the conclusion of all the loose threads, will Kenny be found, will Father Tim and Cynthia travel to Ireland, will Dooley stay a Barlowe or become a Kavanagh...these are worth waiting for, in detail and in depth.To get to enjoy Christmas in Mitford makes this book worth my time to enjoy the story. But most of all it gave me faith when I needed to replenish my soul."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"The encouragement and peace I enjoy most when reading a Mitford story are all here in Shepherds Abiding. I have not been disappointed with the length of the book as some of the other reviewers. Instead I have been thrilled because I have been comparing the length of this holiday season release with the two previous holiday books by Jan Karon, Mitford Snowmen and Esther's Gift. Several months ago I understood that there would be one final novel in the Mitford Series--and I believe that is still the case with release projected for 2005, and so considered the release of Sheperds Abiding a wonderful surprise. It is a wonderful reflection on the holiday season."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Although I, too, was disappointed at the shorter book, I always find it enjoyable to sit down with Jan Karon's delightful cast of characters. I had been hoping for a more in-depth story that would take us further along in Father Tim's journey and explore more of the story lines that have been hinted at in past installments of the Mitford series. For example, will Father Tim find Kenny, the last missing Barlowe sibling? And when will Dooley discover that he is a millionaire? But we will have to wait until the final book to find out the answers to these questions.What I did find in Shepherds Abiding was a book very similar to A Common Life. While not as in-depth, the story gave us a better look into the thoughts and personalities of other residents of Mitford. We have only known Hope Winchester and Lew Boyd on a fairly superficial level up until now, and it was wonderful to get more insight into their lives and, particularly, their spiritual journeys. However, I did miss some of the characters that generally play a bigger role, such as Dooley and Cynthia.Nothing terribly exciting or dramatic happens in Shepherds Abiding. But that's never the case with life in Mitford - it's the characters and walking with them through the ups and downs of everyday life that give Jan Karon's books their charm."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Jan Karon's latest offering is a sparkling Christmas card and a celebration of the deeper meaning of the Advent season. The story revolves around Father Tim's efforts at restoring an old Nativity scene as a surprise for Cynthia's Christmas and also includes flashbacks into his own Christmases growing up in Mississippi. All the beloved Mitford characters are here -- each celebrating in their own way. I loved the way Ms. Karon further explored the story of Hope and Scott, and Uncle Billy's attempts to come up with Rose's Christmas gift were a joy. She has also laid the groundwork for some of the events that might happen in the next and final book of the &quot;Mitford&quot; series -- and oh, how I hate to see it end! My only complaint about this book, and it's a tiny one, is that I wish it had been longer. I hated to turn the last page and finish this book! However, I plan to reread it during the actual Advent season, and I think it will enrich my own celebration. Thanks, Jan Karon, for another wonderful book! You have blessed my life with this entire series."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Everyone will love this inspiring book. This author never fails to deliver a winner. I have all her books and bought this one the moment it appeared in the bookstores. This Christmas I will buy the entire series for family members to keep and enjoy and share. Thank you Jan Karon for this early Christmas gift to the world from you.The characters in this book are so real. I agree fully with all the other reviews - it was far too short - we want more and more of this series. No matter what church you attend or what your philosphy of life is, you will relate to the town of Mitford and its cast of characters. Father Tim is like a trusted comfortable friend. Words cannot express my admiration for this author and her insights.This is a book you want to go back to and memorize some parts, underline passages, and just apply the nuggets of wisdom to your own life.I strongly recommend this book - it is food for the soul - makes you feel happy inside."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I had feared that this latest addition to the Mitford series would be another lightweight story like &quot;A Common Life&quot; (which I enjoyed, but which was really little more than a lengthy short story about Father Tim's &amp; Cythia's wedding.)Although this book isn't the eagerly-awaited next full-length novel in the series, it is more than just a one-note Christmas story like &quot;Esther's Gift.&quot; Several of the secondary characters like Hope Winchester and Lew Boyd have their stories fleshed out and carried forward quite a bit. There are also some other subplots involving beloved characters like the Moseleys and Uncle Billy, so that the primary story of Father Tim and his nativity set isn't the only thing going on. All in all, although I'm still anxiously awaiting the next &quot;real&quot; novel in the series, this was a pleasant surprise and worth the price (especially at the discounted rate!)"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I loved Shepherds Abiding, just as I have loved all of the Mitford novels. They're so sweet and refreshing. If you're into sex and violence, you probably won't like the Mitford novels. But if you would like a relaxing little trip to a town kind of like Mayberry, you'll love Mitford. I recommend reading them all IN ORDER. I'll be sad when Jan Karon writes the last one."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This was a wonderful book. I have loved all of the Mitford books and this one, although it was short, was a great addition to the series. I liked how it dealt more with characters other than Father Tim and Cynthia. Her books always &quot;revisit&quot; the characters from past books and that helps to jog your memory.It's an inspirational holiday story.I can't wait for the next book to come out!If you have enjoyed the Mitford series, you will certainly enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"December is the perfect time to read this book and thanks to the generosity of a friend I was able to do so. As usual, Jan Karon's Mitford left me uplifted, mellow, smiling and wet eyed. She can do that and has been doing it now for some time.I have read and loved the books leading up to this one except for \\"In this Mountain\\" which I perceived to be a novella and took the author to task for it in my review. However, then was then and now is now and Ms. Karon is back in fine form even though the book has been puffed up to 288 pages by the use of white space and narrow margins. However, I am even over that.The author has a unique talent to take ordinary things and turn them into something endearing. If we lived in Mitford we might think it was boring and dull. But seen through Karon's eyes it is almost magical, a village where good things happen to good people and the story is always tied together by the scriptures.She does it better than anyone and after reading it, I just folded the book in my lap and said out loud to no one in particular - \\"Merry Christmas.\\" I'll bet you will too."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I read the reviews while waiting for this book to arrive. I was disappointed in what I read. When I got the book, I devoured it. I know it was short like A Common Life, but what a sweet thing for Timothy to do.. I am a Mitford addict, so I simply loved it!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I've read all of the Mittford books and loved them, but Shepherds Abiding has always been my absolute favorite. For the last couple years it has become my Christmas Tradition to reread this book.It is a great, light-reading, heart warming story...which also has great interest from the creative point of view as well. As someone interested in art, and obsessed with Christmas, this book is a great look at the creative process and how art can be a devotional process of sorts. And I must say, ever since reading Shepherds Abiding, I've always wanted to follow in Father Tim's steps and paint my own Nativity!If you love the Mittford Series, this is a great addition to treasure at Christmas time and any time of the year."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This was shorter than I would have liked but the familiar characters and warm Christmas feeling left by this book was worth it."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Who can resist a Jan Karon book.

It reminds the reader of the true meaning of Christmas in a very warm and human manner."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Through Father Timothy, Cynthia, Dooley, Barnabas and each resident of Mitford, Jan Karon brings the reader into the soul of an idealic, yet realistic small town of \\"yesteryear.\\" There is real-to-life heartbreaking situations, heart warming moments, lovely and loving humor, and most importantly, Jan Karon shows us, in Father Timothy, childlike innocence in a \\"60-something\\" truly gentle man; and through all the other characters, this innocence - lack of egoic self-indentification - shines from the depth of each. The Bible quotations are intertwined simply, not the least bit preachy, and provide a wonderful foundation to the theme. This is one of nine books in the Mitford Series. I highly recommend the entire series; it is my fervent hope that many of the characters will be further explored as \\"off-shoots\\" of this Mitford series and in his/her own right be the focus of a book."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"The Mitford series offer the reader an opportunity to learn what love can be like, especially important to those who came from dysfunctional families. Karon offers suggestions to women in the character of Cynthia; and a reality glimpse to men of possible relationship between man and woman.These are the books one can read over and over, and still learn something, while being entertained simultaneously! What a treat!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is not quite as good as the previous books, but still it is a great past-time reading. All of Jan Karon's books are wonderful.

I particularly enjoyed the lack of tension and strife in Father Tim's life in this book. Yes, he's busy and nearly overwhelmed, but the deep unhappiness he experiences in so many of the other books is wonderfully lacking in this one, making it my favorite."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I don't know how Jan Karon keeps topping her last book, but she does. Her characters are incredibly real. Many of her characters are like old, familiar friends...Buy the book!!! It's better than you imagine.If you're like me, you'll also enjoy Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices. I have also reviewed that book on Amazon."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is a cozy, quick read...and should get you in the mood for the holiday season. However, IF you have not read the earlier books in this series you will be at a loss as to some of the relationships and their importance to the community. Many of the continuing characters are mentioned only by first names and then just briefly. This is a book that only die hard fans of Mitford will enjoy."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is another book in the Father Tim series. These books are like chicken soup on a cold day. Reading them is like stepping into a Thomas Kincaid painting and taking a long stroll through the comfort and light radiating from the heartwarming scene. You don't have to be particularly religious to read these stories about Father Tim as you have more of the feeling of watching well known neighbors and friends come and go through town. They are well worth reading especially when the world seems a bit too fast paced and a reminder of the simplicity of life is much needed."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I enjoyed this story very much. I read it during the Christmas season, since it is set during that time."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This Christmas story doesn't really advance the story lines in the Mitford books much, but is instead a quiet side trip for the holidays. I love the characters in this series and their quirky adventures, and this book showcases the quiet way they love and serve each other and make Christmas a special time. Father Tim finds an antique Nativity set and decides to restore it as a surprise for Cynthia. The book recounts his journey as he learns to do the restoration work and then learns the joy of creativity and working with his hands. A nice time-out in the Christmas season to remember the reason for the holiday."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I've read this book many times but it's so nice to have it on my Kindle and ready for pre-Christmas reading. I really enjoy it. It's one of Karon's best."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"That's all I have to say but Amazon is making me add 20 more words. 5 more to go. BOO"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Started this series at my mother-n-law's house and she didn't have this one and neither did the library. Great, great series."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come. I like it."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This was a perfect book to read at the Christmas season. I enjoyed it very much and it brought many smiles and giggles. I can't wait to hear how the rest of my Book Club liked it."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I enjoyed every line in this book, and hated to see it end! Always a pleasure to read about this town & it's people."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"It is a book that you can pick up and it always makes you happy. It has a deep meaning, but does not require deep thinking. To me it says God is in His Heaven and all is right with the world. I did not say all was as I wanted it , but God is in control."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This comparatively short installment in the nine-volume Mitford saga deals with one Christmas season in the little North Carolina town. By itself it would not be worthwhile; one has to have read the preceding seven books in the series for this to mean anything at all.There is a certain O Henry \\"Gift of the Magi\\" sense to the plot. Father Tim labors in secret over an elaborate Christmas gift for his wife, while she works secretly over something for him. Creaky Billy makes a \\"Santy\\" for his mentally fading wife. Townspeople plan a party for the closing of their favorite eatery. In brief, not all that much of significance is taking place here. Somehow one senses that the writer is winding down the series toward the inevitable. After all, this can't go on forever.There are the usual prayers for this and that--prayers on virtually every page, as if they, per se, were action. And with the proper stacking of the cards, all prayers are answered. I knew they would be: I read the previous seven books, and that's how it works every time.The unfortunate thing about the Mitford books is that they tend to go downhill or be repetitive after the first three or four. For the reader who just can't get enough of the characters, this is fine. But I like to see a little more change."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Even if you have not read the other books in the series, this is a wonderful holiday read. I love all of the Mitford books, I am so sad to see the series come to an end."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"The Mitford books have served up slices of small town life now for more than a half a dozen years, and as the well-loved series winds down, Jan Karon focuses this full-sized novel, SHEPHERDS ABIDING, on &quot;the most wonderful time of the year&quot; --- Christmas.Miford lovers know that the plot of the books is not the point; rather, it's the enjoyable escape into the daily exploits of the Mitford characters that keeps the pages turning. This latest installment is no exception. The narrative revolves around Father Tim's restoration of an old, battered nativity set, which he hopes to complete for his wife Cynthia as a surprise for Christmas. As he painstakingly sands the plaster figures, uncovering their natural beauty, he also uncovers a surprising talent for working creatively with his hands. When a nativity piece must be discarded because it is damaged beyond repair, Father Tim also discards some of his fondest dreams for the future --- and creates some new ones. The restoration of the figures becomes symbolic of Father Tim's personal restoration as he enjoys his retirement. &quot;He felt a happy contentment flowing up in him, as a spring from a hidden source,&quot; Karen writes. Meanwhile, Cynthia is busy with her own Christmas surprise, which will offer Father Tim some consolation after a desolating accident.There's something especially endearing about the late-in-life love between Father Tim and Cynthia, who are aging well, yet aging nonetheless. With poignancy, Father Tim discovers that one of the gifts of growing old is recapturing lost memories. He finds himself reminiscing about past Christmases with his mother and father, and remembering the lonely and imaginative child that he had been. Some tender recollections of his indifferent father also resurface. A solid underpinning of hope anchors all of the Mitford novels, and the hope SHEPHERDS ABIDING offers seems to be that the last part of life is to be anticipated.But this is no serious Christmas tale. As with all of the Mitford novels, there's plenty of gentle humor. &quot;Just think! All that misery over taxes,&quot; Cynthia observes of the holy family's journey to Bethlehem. Father Tim answers, &quot;Some things never change.&quot;And indeed, in some ways, life hasn't changed much in Mitford, although the characters are older and their circumstances are a little different. Dooley Barlowe is away at university, and Louella Baxter Marshall is at Hope House retirement center, baking biscuits and ordering her Christmas presents online. Uncle Billy and Rose Watson exemplify committed love in the face of hardship. The search continues for Dooley's missing little brother Kenny, which will likely be wrapped up in the last book of the series.A few changes are afoot. The Grill is closing, and there's a light shining through the windows above the Happy Endings bookstore, now the home of its new owner. Puny is pregnant with twins --- again. However, there is a sense that the series is winding down, and the Mitford years are drawing toward a gentle close. After bringing more than 15 million copies of Karon's books to readers, Viking will publish THE MITFORD COOKBOOK AND KITCHEN READER next year; then the last novel in the Mitford series, LIGHT FROM HEAVEN, in 2005.The endearing nature of SHEPHERDS ABIDING, as with other Mitford titles, is that you find a point of connection to all its characters. Father Tim is the pastor you've always wanted; Uncle Billy and his aging wife Rose are the eccentric elderly relatives the family jokes about but loves; Hope is the single gal everyone is rooting for to find a guy who deserves her; and Dooley is that kid who came from bad circumstances, but you know has promise. Through Karon's eyes, Mitford is really our town --- like Andy Griffith's Mayberry, it is full of homespun wisdom plunked down with enough subtlety to make it palatable, but still obvious enough that we don't miss it. Readers should find SHEPHERDS ABIDING a peaceful entr&eacute;e into the Christmas season, and an enjoyable read all year round.--- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"What a wonderful surprise! I wasn't expecting an 8th book in the well-loved Mitford Series. &quot;Sheperds Abiding&quot; is a truly lovely story that makes you feel warm all over. I'm packing my bags and moving to Mitford!!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"On this first Sunday of Advent, 2011, I decided tolisten once again to SHEPHERDS ABIDING. Actually I have heard it every year during the Christmas season since its 2005 release.The publisher's blurb sets the scene: \\"Since he was a boy growing up in Mississippi, Father Tim has lived what he calls 'the life of the mind.' But then he finds a derelect nativity scence that has suffered the indignities of time and neglect. Can he give ths small assemly new life, restore the camel's ear, repaint every piece? Imagining the excitement in the eyes of his wife, Cynthia, he steps up to the plate, beginning a small journey of faith that reaches every one around him.\\"The good people of Mitford help, of course, many in unexpected ways. When you listen, you will know what I mean. Dooley is put on camel detail, however, and he does not help as he should have. Out of character for him.Please do listen. One of Karon's favorite choirs sings. And, one of my favorite narrators, John McDonough, reads.If you have not read the MITFORD series, start at the beginning with: AT HOME IN MITFORD. Follow it with book two: A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW. Then move to book six: A COMMON LIFE: THE WEDDING STORY. It is the story of the wedding of Father Tim and his Cynthia. And SHEPHERDS ABIDING is the continuation of that story of love.There are nine books in the Mitford sereis. I hope there will be more. Karon has written two books in the Father Tim series as well.Other authors have been praised as another Jan Karon. Patrick Taylor and his country doctor series, for example, and Gail Fraser and her Lumby series. Do not be fooled. Simply enjoy Karon and hope she continues to write for us. thank you."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"A friend gave me this book and I didn't grab it up right away... but when I did ~ WOW!! I really love her sweet characters and beautiful little town!!I have since bought the series and started from the beginning and I simply LOVE them!!!! If you haven't read any of them I would suggest starting at the beginning of the Mitford Series....\\"Welcome to Mitford\\". Although it isn't necessary to enjoy this one. The way Miss Karon writes about these people, this quaint town and their relationships, you are taken in by them regardless of if you've read the others or not! I felt as if I would like to go live among these people and when I finish one I go straight to the next!! ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Mitford is the kind of place that we would all love to live.... a slpeey little town in the mountains where you know your neighbors. I recommend buying this book... and curling up in your favorite chair with a warm blanket and cup of hot chocolate! Turn the phones off and slip away... I guarentee that you won't want to come back!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"As with all previous Father Tim books, I never want to leave Mitford. I will be sorry when it all comes to an end. I can't seem to get enough of the people of Mitford. An easy read that easily takes you on a journey to another world."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"In the writing business it's said that there are no new stories, which is obviously true. The talent to write about human nature that reflects divine love, however, is rare. I believe such talent is a gift that Jan Karon possesses.&quot;Shepherds Abiding&quot; is a true evergreen because it will, I pray, never be out-of-style. Jan Karon's refreshingly non-commercial approach to the \\"Christmas\\" story warms my soul! I recommend it, and all of her Mitford books, to anyone whose spirit yearns for genuine decency and a world where people care about each other."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Gifted performer John McDonough presents a warm, sympathetic reading of Jan Karon's eighth novel in the Mitford series. These popular books have brought Father Tim into the hearts of millions - &quot;Shepherds Abiding&quot; will garner even more devoted fans.According to Ms. Karon her latest endeavor &quot;doesn't tie up any serious threads or answer any of the Big Questions remaining in the series.&quot; It is, nonetheless, a touching reminder of what is important in life.Father Tim, by his own description, has been a thinker rather than a doer for all of his life. For him, even during a pleasant boyhood in Mississippi, he's not had an interest in working with this hands. That may change.To his surprise he finds a nativity scene that is much the worse for wear. The twenty figures, including animals, are all in sad condition. Would it be possible, he wonders, for him to restore the figures to their original wholeness and luster? What, he also wonders, would his wife Cynthia think of all this?Listeners will respond to this oasis of hope and tranquility during our too-busy holiday season.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I have enjoyed all the writings of Jan Karon. Very inspiring writer and beautifully illustrated works. I will probably purchase more of the series."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Mitford series is wonderful! I recommend reading the entire series of these books. The characters of the books become a part of your family!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I love all of Jan Karon's books. Her characters are realistic and believable. In this books Father Tim tackles the job of restoring a Nativity scene as a present for Cynthia. He learns all sorts of new skills, and a fair bit about himself as well."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I dearly loved reading this at Christmas again this year. I lost my own copy so I bought another just so I could read it again."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This story jumps around telling spurts of different people's lives. All of these people live in the same town, but there are so many people that it's difficult to keep track of all of them. Often when a scene changes, the author starts with \\"He\\" or \\"She\\" so the reader doesn't know which one of the many characters is being presented. The author also likes to start these scene changes other ways that are kind of secretive. Although this method is a tactic that can be used to add mystery, intrigue and to draw the reader in, when it is used so frequently throughout a story, it instead is apt to cause confusion and make the reader feel off balanced."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"All of Jan Karon's books are great! I love reading them in bed at night. They are great to give you a good feeling before falling asleep!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"One of my all time favorite authors---take me away---to a really &#34;nice&#34; place with &#34;nice&#34; people and a sense of calm and order---the way life should be---"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I read the entire Mitford series, so this book was up to the great level of all the stories in the series...just precious.The quality of this used book was as advertised. Happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I adore all the Mitford books and was so glad to see that this book was available in the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is my favorite Christmas book. It is the most gentle, beautiful story of a man's love for his wife. I have read it every Christmas and NEVER tire of it. Thank you."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Another great book in the Mitford series. Reading it was like coming home. Karon's writing delightfully expresses the warm feelings of a close-knit community that only exists inside her excellent books. I recommend you read the others in the series before reading this book.I took one star away because the technical aspects of her dialog can leave the reader puzzled at times as to who is talking. Plus, there are references to events in previous books that are not entirely explained in this book; these are fine for readers who have read and remember, but are frustrating to those who have not read the others or cannot recall. I read these books aloud to seniors and we're constantly struggling with these two issues."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"LOVED this book and am currently reading the Mitford series and would highly recommend it, living in the south this book reminds of the little towns that we drive through and the people in the book are very down to earth but not without there problems so they are easy to relate to and father Tim is very human and east to relate to, it makes you realize that the clergy are just as human as we are."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I'm not sure why the reactions to this book are so unbearable and insipid. SHEPARD'S ABIDING is a beautiufl story written with such warmth that I was sad when it ended. I finished the book in one afternoon and am anticipating Karon's swan song, LIGHT FROM HEAVEN, in November. I will deeply saddended to see a lovely series come to an end. This series is rare to find in bookstores; we need more of this kind. Enough violence."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I enjoyed reading the Sherpherds abiding, the eigth book, in the series of The Mitford Years. I have read all eight of them and I have enjoyed them very much. I love the setting of the book in a small town called Mitford. It brings joy and peace to my heart to read about the lives of the people in Mitford. The problems, and joys they experience, gives me a little escape from my own world. I have also purchased the Mitford Cookbook, so I can fix the foods mentioned in her books, and feel right at home with with all the characters. I am looking forward to reading more books my Jan Karon, and hope that the Mitford story isn't over yet. I want to know what happens to Dooley..."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Jan Karon always brings a smile to your face with books that make you feel warm and cozy inside. This CD set was certainly no exception! A truly wonderful additon to the Mitford Series and perhaps my favorite Father Tim tale."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"As a Jan Karon fan, I was delighted by this bonus of a book since I had heard there was to be just one more book in the series. It is longer than the previous Christmas books and shorter than some of the earlier books in the series. There illustrations on the insides of the covers are lovely.The book does assume that you know most of the characters from previous books, but it is a heart-warming story with a surprising addition to Father Tiom's usual activites. Certainly, we would be challenged &amp; improved by trying such a complicated project in later life.A great story to read with holiday music in the background after a chaleenging day of Christmas chores. It is a great way to center on the real message of Christmas."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I was disappointed in this book, and was glad I waited to check it out from the library rather than buy it. I was expecting a lot more than I got. It was nothing more than a long drawn out version of the smaller Christmas books, Esther's Gift, and The Mitford Snowmen. I believe the author could've done more to develope the characters-Dooley Barlowe was barely even mentioned-It was a charming little Christmas story-which does warm the heart, but leaves a lot wanting. I'm hoping the final book will be back up to the standard I've grown to love in the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"There is no way to compare this latest Karon trip to Mitford to her earlier series. Although of a rather nice size, this is strictly a visit with the beloved retired rector and his wife and the aging community that is so familiar to Mitford fans. I did not expect this volume to end up making a startling set of plot outcomes, and it didn't, but I found the whole read comforting. It was good to go back home to Mitford and follow the seasonal advance on Christmas with surprise presents being prepared for giving.I am glad that I bought this volume: a relaxing, restful, reassuring interval in other reading. I recommend it to those devoted to Karon's wonderful characters. You will certainly laugh and smile and rejoice in the down-to-earth experiences with all the good folk in Karon's fictional town.This book is Karon's Christmas card to her fans. So lovely and happily received!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I have loved all of Jan Karon's previous books. Have read some twice even. I looked forward to meeting my favorite characters again. I am not sure how to describe this very short book. I always have told my kids the teacher will notice huge fonts and generous double spacing. We have noticed Jan! Also, I never did get a feel for the story even though it started out in a familiar way, then boom! on to the next story. Please for the new readers, do not start with this book. It will not make any sense to you. Read the series from the start. Buy the series even, but borrow this from the library."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I had only read the first of Ms. Karon's Mitford books, and I liked it very much. I snatched this one up next because I love a Christmas story. Though it did not have the depth of activity and character as the first book, it was a pleasant read. It was while searching for something to read between Van Reid's Moosepath League novels that I decided to try Jan Karon, and I'm glad I did. I will go back, now, and read her others. But if you're looking for the best recent Christmas book, try Van Reid's &quot;Daniel Plainway.&quot; More than one reviewer made mention of Dickens' &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; when discussing &quot;Daniel Plainway&quot; and with good reason. It takes place in Maine in 1897 and has all the generosity and magic that we look for in a great Christmas novel. But don't overlook &quot;Shepherd's Abiding.&quot; If the subject matter interests you or you're a Karon fan, I think you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"What a wonderful story - this truly isn't a novel in the usual sense of the word but it's a wonderful story full of life and the happenings in Mitford. Ms. Karon continues her chronicle of Mitford. I truly feel like I know these people and I care about them. I just wish that there were many more books to come. This would make a wonderful Christmas gift and it is a stand alone story so you don't have to have read the previous books but it will certainly make you wish you had."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I am terribly disappointed by Shepherds Abiding. Maybe my expectations were too high. I was expecting a novel in the series and got another like The Common Life. But even more so, the writing was not at all up to Ms Karon's standards. There were throwaway references to the usual cast of characters. The description of a big event in the lives of two of the minor characters had no life to it, and Percy and Velma's retirement seemed flat. There was no verve to this book, and I'm surprised at Ms Karon. I wish I hadn't bougtht the book."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I love Mitford.I love Jan Karon's writing. I love every one of the characters in the town she has created. But I didn't love this book - and that's disappointing. I was looking forward to another few hours in the company of Mitford happenings, and found, instead, a brief coffee break. For true Mitford fans, that just isn't enough. I hope that the last book in the series will be full, and complete, and engrwossing, and satisfying. Anything less than that just doesn't do the town - or the characters - justice."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I love Mitford and have read all of the Karon books, but this is another of the short stories that have been sold as novels. This was a sweet story, but I hate being ripped off. One nice thing about Shepherds Abiding is that it's size matches the earlier Mitford books on my shelf."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I have been a Jan Karon fan since I read &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; and I have read each one of the books that she has written since. Her gentle humor and all-too-human characters have been a delight to me over the years. However, this book somehow misses the mark and it neither interests me nor tugs at my heart as the other Mitford books have done. In this installment, Father Tim is re-doing a manger scene for Cynthia for Christmas. Working with his hands is quite foreign to him so this is truly an effort of love. The characters from the other books reappear here, but they are not fleshed out enough for a reader to be involved with them and the rapid movement from character to character is quite distracting. Hopefully, any future Mitford books will return to the charming qualities which make these books so special."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"As with most of the other reviewers, I LOVE the Mitford series! This one, however, felt like a shoddy attempt at getting a product on the market in time for the holidays. The publishers should have removed the excessive white space (wide margins and large line spacing) and sold it as a short story.Were it sold as a short story, I would have given it four stars instead of one. As it is, I was left feeling cheated and disappointed.I can't wait for Jan Karon's next real novel. I trust that the next one will feel like the earlier books in the series, and will wrap up the story for us. Hopefully she will give her readers what they are so hungry for.... character development, a rich plot, and information on what Dooley and Lace make of their lives!"},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I love the sense of peace and hope that I always feel after reading these books. This one fell a little short for me, not the depth I would like to have seen. I do have to tell you about another book that I just read that left me feeling the hope and peace I was hoping to feel with Shepherds Abiding. Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin he is a new author and I hope he writes many more..."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I came across this and thought, \\"Finally! A new Mitford book.\\" And I wondered how I'd missed it. Once I got the book in hand, I realized I had not missed anything. This is not a new Mitford novel but a little story with some other previously published stuff thrown in. It's a big disappointment. I was so annoyed to realize that I'd paid a book price for a little story that I didn't even enjoy the story itself. It isn't the money, actually. It's that I was all set to relax and be drawn into Mitford again for a nice long visit. This short story sent me packing far too soon. Someone needs to let this author know that her readers are waiting for another REAL Mitford book. I won't buy anything like this again."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I would characterize this book as &quot;Mitford Lite&quot; - just does not stand up to the high standards we have come to expect in the Mitford books. Previous reviewers hit the nail on the head when they expressed dismay at the flimsy plot line....a story of Father Tim re-finishing a manger scene just couldn't quite hold my attention, and the sub plots weren't very compelling either. I'm chalking this up to the author and her publisher giving us a &quot;snack&quot; to keep us sated until the next, and last, Mitford book comes out in 2005 . I'll still read the final book, but hopefully Ms. Karon will complete this series by giving her readers the rich and descriptive writing for which she is deservedly famous."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"I've been a Jan Karon fan since the beginning and enjoyed most of her books, but find the early editions much more entertaining and inspiring. I love the characters, but wished there could be more insights, a broadening of their character. I find the new Dosetville series by Katherine Valentine much richer fare."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"It's really sad to see all these glowing reviews of this book,whose purpose is to teach people how to do arithmetic calculations.That is NOT what mathematics education should be about. If someonelearns how to multiply 47 times 83 in one's head, SO WHAT? Theimportant thing is what 47 times 83 is good for, such as the area of arectangle 47 cm by 83 cm, the cost of 47 items that cost $83 each, andso on. Calculation is by far the LEAST important part of mathematics.When this book was written we didn't have calculators, so maybe it wasmore important then for people to be able to do complicatedcomputations like this accurately in their head or with paper andpencil. Today, it's just plain silly. Readers would be much betteroff reading what the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics hasto say about the importance of reasoning, communication, connections,and, most important, problem-solving in mathematics, rather thanwasting their time with these gimics..."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"some readers have commented that the method does not work with multiplication by 5. I am using the 1960 version and have found that the method does hold even for examples that I produce not from the book. I suggest you examine the algorithm more carefully.In response to the 1 star review that claims this is not worthwhile for teaching mathematics and that reliance on calculators etc. is best while focusing on applied concepts is a good one, however, an overreliance on computational tools hinders mathematical thought since a student does not have a natural sense and intuition of the number system.Furthermore, when numbers are simple to manipulate, the mental energy for such thought is reduced and enables a student to focus more time on the problem at hand without the interruption of using a calculator for input and computation.I do agree with the businessman's comment that this is only a tool for teaching the operations involved with basic arithmetic and that it does not help with teaching word problems and cognitive skills. But, for anyone interested, this book willaid them with proficiency in mathematical computation and hopefully give them tools that can help them tackle more challenging problems in mathematics.Certainly, this system is far superior to conventional ones currently taught at the grade school level."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"I have read a lot of books on speed mathematics, and without exception, they are all useless except this one. The method described here is easy. But most importantly, it scales up to larger numbers without additional complexity. This scaling up is what differentiates this method from the others.The key to learning this method is skip the first chapter. Don't waste time in learning how to multiply by 8. Rather, start with the second chapter, the \\"direct method\\" for multiplication.You will surprise your friends and family when they see you multiplying numbers in your head."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"The below review goes for any edition of the book; be it paperback, hardback, new, old, in any language whatsoever.I, however, first studied the books' danish paperback edition, published 1950'ish ::Starting out; you really only need to know how to count one-tru-eleven.The book sets out by presenting to you an entirely new way to 'think' multiplication: You'll learn to 'read' each individual cipher - stop memorizing of multiplication tables - .

It's such a joy - both rewarding and addictive - ; provided only your undivided attention and wholeheartedly commitment !Your memory will work and expand quickly; you'll find yourself dividing, multiplying and adding just for the fun of it - without any support of tools like pen & paper etc., even for billions*billions or division into like a zillion decimals !In about one month I worked through this book cover-to-cover, read every single page of every chapter, did every single exercise over.*** This SYSTEM is guaranteed to WORK - anyone can learn it ***Even for someone who is not intimidated by numbers: this is the only book, you'll ever need to become the wizard of every-day-basic maths.Do not for any reason skip any chapter or pages or the entire philosophy WILL elude you !With pen [indeed: PEN] and paper work your way attentively and meticously through every single exercise - especially the obvious ones !PLEASE; Stay patient with each of the examples and repeat them over until you're completely mastering its unique technique.About half-way through this book you'll probably find calculators much too slow AND in-accurate [too few digits displayed]; You'll always vision the complete solution in your head long before you've finished punching the calculator's keypad.The division chapters seemed the most difficult ones to me [two entirely independent and very different systems]. One is fool-proof, one is tounge-in-cheek.; you'll need to work through both of them. The latter division system is by far the most difficult part of the entire book - PLEASE brace yourself to put the extra effort into mastering it - and then SELL your CALCULATORs !Your conception and memory skills as well as self-confidence will be instantly and permanently boosted.Excellent self-study guide for children, too !It's indeed the very best self-study basic-maths teacher for anyone who shyes away from basic accounting - or just wants a-trick-or-two to improve their calculating-speed."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"I have been using this book for five days and it has significantly improved my basic maths and the speed at which I can make calculations. Initially one has to remember when to apply the correct rule given the numbers you are trying to calculate, but after some practice this becomes second nature.The important thing about this book it that once you have learned the techniques, you can apply them to real world situations where you need to, for example, work out the area of a square (e.g. 48cm x 62cm) or where powers or logs have to be used.What I've found the most useful is not purely improving the speed of calculating random numbers together, but realising how I can use these speed methods and weave them in to other unrelated calculations and dramatically speed up mental calculation. I think that's the key to promoting this method to anyone. Don't just look at it as a number crunching method (it's great for this if that's all you're concerned with), it's brilliant for applying to other maths problems.This book is money well spent."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"I was introduced to the Trachtenberg method in the 3rd and 4th grade by my mother, through home study. I was an absolute mess in arithmetic and higher level math. The system gave me the encouragement, confidence and skills to go on - and go on I did, through 8 quarters of calculus for my degree in economics and beyond. This is absolutely the best foundation for any mom and dad that want to help their children with numbers, but are unsure of themselves or their skill. Techniques can be picked up so fast it's unbelievable. Highly recommend; I intend, as an older father with two year old girl twins, to use this book intensively, but not in the immediate future of course. I'd be interested in hearing from other readers on this, and I can be reached at bob_hanks@msn.com."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"A high school math teacher introduced me to this book 'way back in the sixties, and I have had a copy on my shelf ever since. One of the great advantages to being able to do arithmetic really fast in your head is that you can keep up with the scanner at the grocery store. Also good if you want to blow your kids away with speed and accuracy. The end of the book, &quot;Algebraic Description of the Method&quot; the icing on the cake for me; I just love the analysis of how arithmetic processes work. The story of Trachtenberg at the beginning was quite touching, too, and I greatly admire the man and his work. All in all, this book was quite influential for a flower child back then, and has continued so into middle age. Books like this one go beyond mere math and can actually shape the way you think."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"I've used the system for years, since my father got me a copy from the Popular Science book club back in the 60's. You may recall that was the era of the &quot;New Math&quot;.Unlike what some other reviewers have said, calculation is NOT the least important aspect of mathematics. Mental arithmetic gives you a feel for the numbers, a familiarity with them. As a former math teacher myself, I wish I had a nickel for every kid who said &quot;Well, that's what the calculator said&quot; but had no idea whether the &quot;answer&quot; is reasonable.Trachtenberg's system helps you to make the numbers your own and to make them serve you. While it's a shame about the current price, it's still a bargain if it helps you or your child."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"This method of mathematics was introduced to me as a freshman in high school. My teacher, who was proficient at it, used to race me multiplying multi-digit numbers together. He had the chalkboard and his brain and I had my calculator. He won regularly! We will be using it to home school our children, skipping the drudgery of memorizing the multiplication tables. If you or your children struggle with multiplication and division, this book is a must. It also has another method for addition and other aspects of math as well. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"I was given this book when I was a freshman in High School. I must say it really opened my eyes to the FUN you can have with math. NO, I was not a bookworm, or the teachers pet. This book made math so easy and fast, that I amazed many of my teachers with the skill it gave me. I was able to perfrom in seconds what it took my teachers many times longer to accomplish. Over the years, I have wished I still had the hardbound copy to refer to and to use in helping my daughter get the GRIP on math that all school aged children should have. I would like to see it used as a tool for learning in our schools. Of all the books I have come across, this one is a particular favorite of mine. I am going to have to order a copy for my daughter who is in college now, but has heard me talk about this book for years.I still find myself working problems with the methods this book taught me."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"Ok, I'll admit it. I did not read this book. My father did, when I was in third grade and failing miseribly. He taught me this method at home every night and when I was tested at the end of the year I had not only mastered multiplication and division, but finished the test before anyone else. The addition/subtraction was a God-send as well. If you have a child struggling with math, this is an excellent resource.

Most importantly, you get a very firm underlying knowledge of how numbers relate and work together. It's MUCH more useful than simply memorizing tables. And way more fun, of course. For children (and adults) who are either bored or too challenged by memorization, Trachtenberg's methods make the whole thing a delightful and exciting process. I demonstrated some multiplication to my niece and nephew, both high achievers in school... they were blown away with it... their parents ran off to buy the book."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"Like many, my first exposure to Trachtenberg came in the 60's when I found a copy in my High School's library. It always stayed with me and now, some 30+ years later, it became the solution to a couple of &quot;problems&quot;.A homeless man, developmentally disabled, had gotten a job at a large drugstore chain. It was a very big step for him and he is rightfully proud of himself for facing the challenges that getting the job entailed, but he wanted to advance and that meant learning math. He got himself book on math (for remedial education to enter college) and went to work studying. It was very difficult for him, especially operations with proper fractions, but he was learning. It took 3 months to learn about lowest common denominators. He asked me to work with him, and I decided to. Three months later he can do basic math, in his head. He now has the math competency to take, and pass, the company test for math proficiency. Trachtenberg's system is the one that made it possible. I want to point out that he is competent in the application of math, but not math literate and he still has trouble when presented with &quot;word problems&quot;, but in terms of his capacity to do the job at the next level, he is ready.The other &quot;problem&quot; also involves the education of adults, in this case homeless adults who lack a set of skills that are needed for employability, one of which is basic mathematical competence. The environment is one of adult education for the homeless aimed at achieving a GED (operating under the auspices of a large church). In a demonstration of Trachtenberg's system involving 4 subjects with the most minimal of skills, they achieved sufficient proficiency within 3 weeks to pass the math skills part of the GED exam where word problems weren't involved. The ability to deal with word problems relates to cognitive skills apart from math. Again, we are talking about competency in operations, not literacy. They are currently reviewing my proposal to replace their current math program with a Trachtenberg based approach.Cutler's book presents this very valuable tool in a clear and concise manner."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"If you are a math educator, you should not be without this book. Trachtenberg's methods demonstrate that there is more than one way to solve a problem - and what FUN they can be to solve!

This is one book that I won't loan out, because you really must have your own."},{"Title":"THE TRACHTENBERG SPEED SYSTEM OF BASIC MATHEMATICS","review":"I wish someone had guided me when this book came out, as I could see it's potential when I was eight years old. Later in Junior High in Grand Junction, Colorado, this sytem was taught by a former United States Air Force Strategic Air Command Navigator as a Math Teacher. His students were able to add, subtract, and multiply numbers that were 15 or more digits across, and 15 or more down, in the time it took to type this. When I transferred in, in May of 1969, I felt WAAAAY behind the times as I was given homework out of a text where all I did was add and subtract, and do long division, all the usual way. My Math teacher was surprised when I asked him if what he was teaching was indeed, the Tratchtenberg Method.

If you don't, I sure wouldn't buy this! lol But it is very, very instructive and a great purchase for the middle school, high school, or college student. Certainly even math-oriented adults would enjoy learning tricks to make math easier.

It has been very difficult for me to &quot;learn the mechanics&quot; and &quot;apply the concepts&quot; at the end of each chapter. The pace of the course allows the teacher to solve only 2 or 3 exercises in class, and the book certainly does not make selfstudy easy.

This collection of short stories, which came out in 1963, was his first published work. Price's work is a lyrical and evocative, albeit unsentimental celebration of his native rural North Carolina. Price is a prose master, sweeping the reader up in the beauty of his language so that the daily life of his characters can seem heroic. This collection is a small one, consisting of only seven stories, but each one is a gem, and the last story in the collection, the titular \\"The Names and Faces of Heroes,\\" may well take your breath away--literally."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"When trying to create a birth plan, I found myself confused about some of the interventions and intervention drugs offered during labor. This book answered a lot of my questions. By the time I finished this book, it was dog-eared and highlighted throughout. I made pages of notes to myself. This book, read in conjunction with several others, has helped me feel much more confident about entering my first labor. I feel better equipped with the knowledge I will need to determine which scenarios really warrant certain medical interventions and with the correct questions to ask prior to accepting or refusing those interventions. My hope is that the information offered in Thinking Woman's Guide will help me be the assertive, controlled and calm mother I want to be while delivering my baby."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth contains more evidence-based information about interventions during childbirth than I have found anywhere else. For those already considering natural birth, this book will provide the hard numbers to back you up, instead of the feely, hippie, hokum that you find in most natural birth books. As an intelligent woman, I don't want someone to tell me their way is better because it feels right, I want evidence.Goer not only provides backup for her statements, but she even examines the studies themselves in the last section of the book. If more babies died in one group versus another, she looks at why each particular baby died in a given group to show whether or not it was actually related to what was being tested. I don't think I've ever seen anyone take such a meticulous approach in a book about childbirth.For those who are not considering natural birth, you still need to read this!!! Yes, there's some scary information, but as Goer says in her Introduction, better to be uncomfortable than uninformed. You can certainly use the information she provides to balance what you want for your birth. While she is very biased toward natural birth, she does give a fair assessment of both the pros and cons for things like epidurals, cesareans, etc. Those who do not want to attempt natural birth can use her information to decide which interventions will be right for their births--it doesn't have to be all or nothing. Goer also provides many many lists of questions to ask your provider to determine whether or not he or she will be right for you.

I especially like the analysis of actual research, and I really feel that though the author is biased, the information contained in the book speaks for itself.This book has two flaws however. First of all, the material is very dry. I felt like I was reading a textbook. I would appreciate relevant anecdotes and birth stories. Secondly, I think this book should be updated with more recent statistics and studies. Normally, I make a point to read books that have either been written or updated within the past five years.I would also like to see a woman on the cover who doesn't look quite so upset.

It explains in layman's language all the pros and cons to epidurals, c-sections, and all the other offered but typically unnecessary procedures available to a laboring woman along with the sometimes highly unpleasant outcomes. Most items aren't things you aren't able to find out for yourself doing research but she saves you a lot of legwork and the book puts all the answers at your finger tips. It could also be good for some of the folks that believe they are experts on the subject of childbirth, encouraging epidurals and c-sections, and not having any idea about all the long and short term problems they can cause. It could be used as a discreet way of chiding them into silence and also save you from a hormone-induced rant in the hallway at work directed at such person.

I am trained in research and statistics and I found that some of her facts were problematic to me. For a non-specific example, the author compares different numerics (a % in one case to a raw number). It doesn't help me when comparing 100 women delivering with a midwife ... to 5% of women delivering with an obstetrician (this statement is not a quote from the book). 5% of what? I found she often used % without saying the total number (percent of what?). I also felt at times that the comparisons drawn in the tables were a bit contrived and heavily favored the midwife perspective.I was aware that this book was written from a non-medical intervention perspective, but I was surprised to just how biased the book is. The author fully admits that she is biased, so it is no secret. I just think you should be aware before you purchase, in case you are looking for something that may be more balanced. It left me wanting to read a book from a less-biased perspective; I'd like to read this book written by someone who has actually worked in a medical obstetrics practice."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I recommend this for finding a good base in understanding conventional vs natural birthing methods.

I found the book helpful in my search for information, especially the pro/con lists supplied at the end of certain segments. However, I felt that she went a bit overboard in some cases, almost resorting to scare tactics and guilt trips (on mother to be) in making her argument against conventional or mainstream methods."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Like many other reviewers said this book is biased. The author gives this disclaimer at the beginning and how her purpose for the book is in hoping to revert her readers to her opinions and beliefs.

Everything is footnoted and explained. One of the most interesting facts I found was that most emergency c/secs happen during the day, not at night or on weekends. Makes you think.This book is a great place to start if you are planning to have a child. You need to understand all your options good and bad. In the middle of labor is not the time to be asking questions if something happens. Research ahead of time and make your decisions beforehand. And make those decisions based on actual fact, not just because your doctor said so or because \\"that's what everone else does\\". Not that your dr is going to purposefully hurt you but in many cases they do put you through a lot of extra pain that you did not need.Doctors are not gods, hospitals are in it for the money. When my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, even though she was at one of the top hospitals with one of the beast doctors in the country, we quickly discovered we had to do our own research. Research that paid off in the end by finding other drugs that really helped her cope with the pain of chemo."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is the real deal on what's up with birth today. The author takes a hard look at many of the medical professions sacred cows, such as epidurals, episiotomy, iv, labor induction and management, just to name a few. Henci Goer has masterfully dug through the medical literature and gives readers the facts in laymen's terms. (More descriptions of these studies are included in the back of the book.) Every pregnant woman should read this book, especially those planning to give birth in a hospital.

I even had it beside me just before my wife went into labor, and used it for some last minute advice. Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book made me so scared that I briefly considered having an abortion.

What a crock. It also shows a clear bias against any medical professional and implies that their motives are simply to make your birth as convenient for them as possible. I am considering throwing this book away, which is something I have NEVER done. Waste of money and paper."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I think this book will primarily appeal to women who wish to validate their bias toward vaginal birth. However, if your mind is already made up, why buy the book? If this were truly \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth,\\" the author would present the pros and cons of vaginal delivery versus C-section, and leave the decision up to you. Instead, she rabidly tries to cram her opinions down your throat. If she had her facts straight, I could tolerate such an adamant stance. However, she is clearly and unconscionably misinformed. For example, she contends that vaginal birth does not damage the pelvic floor. Is she delusional? There is an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence to support that it does. Furthermore, I am a surgeon who has performed countless operations to repair this pelvic floor damage. It is obvious that this is associated with vaginal childbirth, NOT C-sections. Furthermore, as a man, I know that vaginal childbirth can induce permanent and undesirable changes in the vagina. That is something the author is oblivious to. If this were a perfect world, I suppose men wouldn't care about such a thing, but the fact is they do. Women can ignore this, but only at their own peril. Men, being men, generally don't feel comfortable enough to discuss this with their partners if it's a problem. Instead, they'll often look for a greener (can I say tighter?) pasture. You can blame men for being so shallow, but women are just as focused on pleasure. Women gossip so much about \\"a man's size\\" that this intimately personal subject is now an accepted part of our culture that can be cavalierly broached in magazines, books and on television with no one blinking an eye about it. My point? Women care just as much about pleasure as men do, and when it comes to determining sexual pleasure, a man's size is no less important than vaginal tightness, which can be permanently affected by vaginal delivery. Even if this does not concern you, you probably will be bothered by the other side effects of vaginal delivery, such as urinary stress incontinence and a dozen other problems. Hence, I feel that propagandists for vaginal delivery, such as Henci Goer, are doing a great disservice to women."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"But remember, it's one sided. Take everything with a grain of salt. She's very passionate about natural birth.Definitely a must read though"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Arrived way before I expected it. As far as the content, I wished it had been longer and covered more subjects, but found lots of stuff from the author online as well. Good for any women who is pregnant to read, consider, and research further."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"First, I must preference that you have to read this book with blinders on. The author does not hide the fact that she is very much in favor or a completely natural childbirthing experience and that she does not like hospitals and OBs...and that's that.The good points about this book are the ideas that you don't HAVE to have medical interventions for your labor, even if you labor in a hospital. Most of the time, the docs don't HAVE to break your water, you don't HAVE to have an IV drip, you don't HAVE to have Pitocin... If you've never been around hospitals much, it's nice to know that you do have a choice. This book bring that point home.However, in my opinion, this book was just a to anti-medical for me. I studied the sciences in school, and I know that there comes a time when 1000's of years of medicine are better than the \\"old ways.\\" As I read the book, I skipped a lot of the text where the author goes on about how each procedure is unnecessary and sometimes plain wrong. Granted, sometimes OBs get a bit too antsy about giving out meds and speeding up your labor, but a quick chat with your OB before delivery should make that a moot point. Most doctors want what the patient wants -- a delivery that satisfies the mother's idea of a good birth experience -- and are willing to listen to what the patient wants. It's all about communication.Bottom line...if you'd like to know more about the different procedures and interventions that can happen during L&D;, then this book is good. But read it like the title tell you, as a \\"thinking woman.\\" It's up to you to make your own judgment about each procedure and how you want your birth to be. Talk to your OB about what you read and then form your opinions."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As a Doula (professional labor assistant) and future childbirth educator, I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As a doula and aspiring midwife, I have found this book to be very eye-opening.

Henci is a thoughtful woman who had spent years researching her subject. She gives you nothing but the facts.This book has the information you won't get in most doctor's offices.Are you a thinking woman?"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I chose not to purchase this book based, ironically enough, on the positive recommendations. It sounds as if this book may be in need of an update, as episiotomies and other interventions are no longer 'routine' in many places, and many hospitals work cooperatively with midwives and doulas. Anesthesia has also changed a lot in the past 8 years since this book was published. While it may be good resource for prompting questions to your OB and hospital, it would be best to look for more up-to-date facts. I have found that this is true of many of these 'expecting' type books."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"So many women trust their OB/GYN implicitly; this book forces a woman to think for herself and make her own decisions in regards to her prenatal care. OBs are surgeons, and as such, tend to follow a medical model of care. Pregnancy and childbirth is not a disease, and should not be treated as such. This book offers thought-provoking statistics and information that allow a woman to carefully consider the type of prenatal care she wishes to receive."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I rarely give out five stars, but being a woman who chooses to become pregnant and give birth, I have to say that this is one of the most important books I've ever read. Henci Goer knows her stuff, backing up her claims about medicalized birth with reams of clinical studies. Anyone considering a birth with an attendant who has been trained in the traditional obstetrical model of childbirth would do well to educate themselves as much as possible about the nature of that training and the assumptions (many proven false) that such attendants operate under. It truly is, at base, an issue of safety -- there are risks associated with all types of intervention, most of which are done routinely and completely regardless of whether they are actually medically necessary.I cannot emphasize this enough -- if you want the safest and most rewarding birth possible, don't just listen blindly to your doctor or midwife, do your own research so that you can make truly informed decisions regarding your care. You will be well rewarded."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Whether your having a hospital or a homebirth, this book is relevant. Every pregnant woman will face decisions about the care of her body. This book will arm you with facts to evaluate options for yourself. That's the message of this book: you have choices, even if your doctor or midwife does not present them to you. And choosing to trust your caregiver to make decisions for you is valid for some women. But educating yourself can only make your birth better not worse."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I was a midwife for 15 years and wish this book had been available at that time. The attitudes of today's obstetricians have regressed to those of the 50s when women expected to be treated like sheep, and the doctors accommodated them. We had a surge of feminist autonomy during the 70s and 80s (when I caught babies in Berkeley, CA, and wrote a memoir, BABY CATCHER, Scribner 2002), but then the Epidural Epidemic struck full force. And now far, far too many women are acting like sheep again - and their doctors are just following standard procedures.Henci Goer's wonderful book gives credit to the fact that pregnant women still have brains: they can think, read, talk, and make decisions about their own care. In order to do this, they need unbiased information about the prodigious amount of obstetrical interference that goes on under the radar screen of the average woman's awareness, especially when she's in labor. Not afraid to call a spade a spade, and a charlatan a charlatan, Henci Goer lets readers inside her own head as she reasons and rationalizes her way through tons of 'scientific evidence' to arrive at logical and user-friendly recommendations.If you're thinking of becoming pregnant, know someone who is, or already are, DO NOT FAIL TO READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is excellent! It is very well researched with evidence-based information about routine medical interventions in labor and birth. The author gives you the facts, her opinion about the facts, and options for the pregnant woman to consider. While some of the info Henci shares with the reader is not pleasant, it is honest. If for you ignorance is bliss, then don't read this book. If you want to know how typical birth in the US adversely affects you and your baby's health, and what you can do about it, then you will love this book. At the back of the book, the author includes a copy of the Mother Friendly Childbirth Initiative. Be sure to take a look at this important concensus document and the list of groups and individuals who ratified and endorsed it - all the major professional organizations of midwives, perinatal nurses, childbirth educators, and doulas. Also take notice who did not endorse it - the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As an L&D; nurse in the USA for more than a decade, I've read many books on this subject, and this title crops up often for the well informed consumer. I do love the evidence-based practice that this author advocates, and I tend to agree with many of her assessments about the limitations and pitfalls of our prenatal and birthing practices in the obstetric community. However, as I was rereading this recently (preparing for my own birth-center delivery), I realized that many of the practices and philosophies she discusses are fairly out of date and no longer current practice. Fetal scalp pH, for example, hasn't been standard usage from what I can tell for almost a decade, and there are whole reams of studies out about the use of cytotec and change in policies about VBAC that probably should be addressed.This is really an amazing book, but if it could just be updated for the current decade, it would be invaluable. I hope the author is working on an updated/revised edition; if she releases one, I'll be one of the first to order it! As is, I'd like to give it 3.5 stars if that were possible."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is the book I wish I'd had when I was preparing for my first birth. It's a hefty, fully supported resource for informed decision making, covering nearly every situation a birthing woman might face. I was initially put off by the title, wishing it had simply been called Guide to a Better Birth (aren't all women \\"thinking\\" women?) But since the author challenges mainstream thought and medical dogma at every turn of the page, perhaps the title is fair warning: prepare to put on your thinking cap!Henci Goer is upfront about her bias toward natural birth, and after reading this meticulously researched book it's hard to imagine how anyone could come away not fully convinced. She methodically demonstrates how many of the complications and dangers associated with medically micro-managed pregnancy and birth are iatrogenic (doctor caused) and avoidable.I was particularly inspired by the clear information in support of VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean, pronounced V-Back) and the way the author gets right to the point: \\"The VBAC-lash is a particularly glaring instance of doctors abandoning their duty to patients and opting to look out for themselves at their patients' expense.\\" (p. 166) Every woman contemplating elective or repeat cesarean needs this information. Goer makes it clear that cesareans, while necessary in some cases, are being done too often and are always a risky choice, never to be entered into lightly.My only criticism is that she doesn't delve deeply enough into Group Beta Strep (GBS). Goer states that between 10% and 30% of healthy women are colonized with GBS. But she doesn't tell the reader what GBS is (a normal part of some people's body flora) or stress the point that colonization is NOT the same as infection. She tells us what the CDC recommends: screening for all women at 35 to 37 weeks and routine antibiotics in labor for all GBS positive mothers. She ends the section by saying, \\". . . the fall in GBS infections in preterm infants has been more than offset by a rise in deadly, penicillin resistant E-coli infections.\\" Unfortunately, she leaves us with that chilling thought, and offers no alternative ideas about how to approach GBS. Since colonization is so common, there will be many mothers who want to know about alternatives to antibiotics and how to further minimize the already low risk of infecting their babies. There are natural, holistic remedies for reducing or eliminating beta strep colonization and protecting against infection. She also doesn't mention that babies sometimes develop GBS infections in the hospital even after their mothers test negative for beta strep. Since about a quarter of women will deal with group B strep and possibly have it affect their birth plans, I wish Goer had treated it with the significance it deserves."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"My second baby is due very soon - I have been to 4 practices before finding one that would allow me to have a natural child birth. All because they suspect a \\"big\\" baby.This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn the answer to the question, \\"Why not just get an epidural?\\" - - or address the statement \\"I'd just as soon have a c-section before going through all the pain of a natural birth\\". Mothers who want a natural birth are too often made to feel they are foolish for embracing the pain and process of delivering the way of the cavewoman (this is what I call it).Compared to \\"What to Expect when You're Expecting\\", I felt this was a most accurate portrayal of the pros AND cons of epidural, episiotomy, c-section, induction and an array of other topics. Many other mainstream books out there don't tell the dirty truth, they just water down the topics and make it seem like no matter what you do you have made the right decision. It's simply not true. The last thing a mother needs to wonder or say at the hospital is \\"What is going on?\\". I think this book is essential to inform a woman of her rights and responsibilities when bringing another life into this world."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I disagree with the reviewer who stated that this is not a good book for someone who is making initial decisions about childbirth. This book was highly recommended to me and helped me to decide what options made the most sense for me and my baby. Henci Goer summarizes current literature in an easy-to-understand manner, presents the options with pros and cons on both sides.I did not find the book biased - but it does assume that you are willing to take an active role in making your birth decisions. If you are looking for your OB to make the call for you, this is not the book for you. But if you want to be an active partner with your care provider, I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Your eyes will be opened. If you are ready to trust your obstetrician and believe that s/he will make the best decisions for you and your baby, you need to read this book. Goer clearly lays out the pros and cons of various medical practices that are common in the U.S. She contrasts these with the common practices in other industrialized nations that have better outcomes for mothers and babies.Goer is fair in that she acknowledges that many obstetricians are doing what they believe to be best--they were trained in medical schools and residency programs that view pregnancy as a disease or condition which usually requires intervention. She also acknowledges that just because you choose a midwife doesn't mean you'll get better care and just because you choose an OB doesn't mean you'll get poor care. Each practitioner is different and it is up to the &quot;thinking woman&quot; to seek out a caregiver with whom she can work and develop a sense of trust.It is important to know your options. Few hospital birth classes will give you the real low-down on the side effects and complications associated with epidurals. Most obstetricians won't recommend you get a second opinion before performing a C-section even though it is major surgery and, more often than not, not a true emergency situation (obviously, in a true emergency, you'll be rushed to the operating room).This book will inspire you to seek out alternatives to the way your were born and many of your friends gave birth. Family and friends may think you're strange for not wanting to do it the way everyone else does, but that's often the case with pioneers. This book is not the best for building your skills and confidence for natural birth, but it's a good starting point to help you realize the benefits of natural childbirth.A great book to read along with this is &quot;Husband-Coached Childbirth&quot; by Dr. Bradley and any other books on the Bradley Method."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"A friend recommended this book to me. She was going the all natural homebirth route. I, on the other hand, will be delivering via hospital with the assistance of an epidural. I found this book VERY informative and honest. It it written by a Midwife, not an OB, so some of her views are a bit slanted toward MW's- which didn't really bother me. I think every woman should really know all of her options going into L&D and know ways to avoid a medically unncessary c-section. (If for nothing else, that chapter was worth the whole book for me!). It also lists all pros & cons for options during L&D. The only reason I give this book 4 stars, not 5, is because there are a few things she recommends/suggests that are totally out of date and behind medically. When I shared my Birthing Plan with my care provider after reading the book, I learned that a couple of the things the author highly recommended, our practice hasn't done- or seen done- in over 20 years! (such as limiting IV fluid, mediolaterally episiotomy, etc). So, just follow up with additional research by talking with your MW or OB when creating your Birth Plan and do not take Henci Goer's word 100%.

I was initially interested in natural childbirth for the \\"challenge\\" of it, but wanted to research the pros and cons of all options before deciding. Other books on natural childbirth offered good arguments that resonated intuitively with me, but always left me wondering how much of their opinions were overly-biased and how much were backed by solid research and studies. In contrast, the author of this book has done exactly what I would liked to have done if I had the time and resources--she has plowed through troves and troves of medical literature, studies, and statistics to reach her conclusions.The book is also structured in a way that presents the information in an approachable, easy to digest way. The main portion of the book first presents the author's findings and key data without having you slog through tons of dry references to study after study. Each chapter succinctly sums up the pros and cons of various medical interventions or more natural alternatives, and lists all pertinent 'gleanings' from the medical literature. The last 120+ pages of the book then gives the detailed references and citations that back each assertion presented in each chapter.All in all, highly recommended as a valuable source of well-researched information on childbirth.

I do not have access to all the medical journals and wanted someone to synthesize the information for us. Henci does this.Yes, she is admittedly biased against the hospital model of delivery. She states this openly in the introduction, and invites you to read on with that in mind. This book does not offer any advice on pain management, meditation, hypnosis, etc. But what it does do it is give you scientifically sound peer-reviewed research to support your decision to go natural.

I wanted to be able to read about what to expect, and then MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF. I question why this book was titled \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide\\" now, as it really gives you nothing to think about as much as it bestows guilt.Goer fails to play devil's advocate on the side of obstetrics, again and again stating that there are no \\"pros\\" to some procedures and tests. Oddly enough, the blurb on the book's back cover reads \\"But when it comes to one of the most important decisions of your life - how you will give birth - it is hard to garther accurate, unbiased information.\\" Interesting how Goer falls into the trap of bias herself."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I didn't enjoy this book at all.

Most of the things she rails against are no longer standard procedures (at least not in California hospitals), and staff are usually very familiar with and accomodating to patient requests. I finished this book with (incorrect) feeling that the hospital staff is out to get me. This is why I'd recommend books like &quot;Husband Coached Birth&quot; by Bradley. Bradley actually was an obstetrician for many years and his books give you an inside view of how these doctors think while providing the mother AND father with ways to cope with childbirth without fear or anger.

My justification is that this isn't a helpful book for anyone approaching birth to read.In fact, this book pushed me further towards a traditional hospital birth. It wasn't until I watched the e-class from my hospital with birth videos of natural and epidural births shown objectively that I decided I'd prefer natural.

The back cover of the book says, \\"...helps you compare and contrast your various options and shows you how to avoid unneccary procedures...\\" By this she apparently meant \\"don't do anything the doctor wants, refuse any medical intervention.\\" I did appreciate all the research presented in the book, she quotes many studies on the use of medications vs. none, the use of doulas, etc. However, this was balanced with the auther putting down any sort of medical procedure during birth. Every time I picked this book up I got so angry that my husband finally made me get rid of it. Even my cousin, a labor and delivery nurse who is very into natural childbirth hated this thing. The auther basically says that anything that your doctor wants to do is bad (and she obviously has very little respect for them). I agree that there are probably doctors out there that are very gung-ho on using any medical procedure available, I would also say that as a consumer, it's my responsibility to shop around until I find a doctor that fits my philosophy on childbirth. Also, I made several attempts to figure out what the auther's credentials were, and I still am unsure. I don't think she's even a certified doula. My opinion after reading the book is that if you really agree with her, you should be giving birth in a birth center or at home with a midwife because you're going to absolutely second guess everything being done in a hospital."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Overall, this book was very informative. Was disappointed almost 50% of the book was dedicated to citing the research that supports the facts shared in the main part of the book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I understand that a \\"natural\\" birth is the ideal for many women, but as my Dr. says, all births are \\"natural\\" when the end result is a healthy baby and mom. Some of us simply cannot have a vaginal birth and I am tired of reading \\"thinking\\" women's guides making me feel like a heathen b/c I don't want to almost die like I did with my first birth and have an Emergency C-section.I did think there was a good deal of info in the book, but please don't make me feel guilty for my choice-how about a little open-mindedness?"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"If you're anti-medical establishment and definitely thinking of having a natural birth, then this book is perfect for you. If, however, you're looking for an unbiased book, this is not the book for you. While full of helpful information, the author is very up front about being an advocate for natural birthing, and doesn't have much positive to say about medical practices or practitioners (OB/GYNs, hospital nurses, etc). For those who want a balanced look at both sides, this book doesn't quite cut it."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is well-researched and provides tons of statistics and information about what can go wrong when medical procedures are applied when they might not be necessary, and how often c-sections are performed. To my knowledge, this is one of the few books that gathers all these reports in one place. If this is the type of information you are looking for, great. Or, if you're looking for well-reasoned arguments in favor of a home birth to convince you or your partner, also great.The problem I had with this book is that it mostly ended up making me fearful for having a hospital birth at all. I am open to trying home birth, but for safety and my spouse's peace of mind, I know I will choose a hospital birth. I felt this book paints all hospitals and OBs as treating the laboring woman as a medical problem, and that I would have to constantly fight the hospital staff and my OB to avoid invasive procedures. It made me very fearful for my labor -- and having now readNatural Hospital Birth: The Best of Both Worlds (Non), I understand that fear can slow down or even completely stop labor! All feelings I want to avoid as birth approaches.However, I did some research online, and it sounds like the hospital near me (Morristown Memorial, NJ, often featured in a Baby Story on TLC) has very good staff that is very supportive of laboring women, and you can even give birth in a pool if your care provider agrees. Some women complained that the midwife they hired at my hospital was actually more rushed & proposing more invasive measures than the nurses on staff. According to \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide\\", this level of support only occurs in 5% of hospitals. However, her statistics are now over 10 years old -- it was published in 1999. It's also possible that being close to a metropolitan area like NYC helps. So before you panic that you can't possibly have a satisfying hospital birth, check out some message boards about women who gave birth at the hospitals nearby.Bottom line, if you want research in support of your choice for home birth or employing the services of a midwife or doula, this book is probably for you. If there is no way you'll be birthing at home and will be at the hospital, I recommendNatural Hospital Birth: The Best of Both Worlds (Non)instead."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I purchased this book on recommendation from a LLL friend (note: it is NOT LLL sponsored, though), when attending LLL classes with my pregnant sister. I had already had two babies - not in the US, but in England. I wanted to know what my sister's labor and delivery were going to be like so I could prepare myself (I was my sister's unofficial doula).I was intrigued and frightened at the same time. Labor and delivery in the US was a whole different ball-game than in the rest of the world and I did not like it at all (I was also gearing up for my own 3rd baby - to be born in the good 'ol US of A).In the US, you NEED to be your own advocate - and advocate for your unborn baby - otherwise, you will be steamrollered by the OBs and other hospital staff. Read this book! Knowledge is indeed power and you need this knowledge - and this power - if you want to have your baby your way, not someone else's. No one will volunteer this stuff - you have to figure it out for yourself. Empower yourself and you will have the birth you want, not a birth that is in time for your OB's vacation."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is a wealth of infomation about birth and the pros and cons of different interventions and routines in the birth process. However, it's biggest fault is making one feel guilty about choosing a hospital birth. But if you want to know how to avoid some of the routine medical procedures and stuff like that this book is a must."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a great book if you're hoping for a natural, non-invasive childbirth experience. The information provided will help you make informed decisions in the labor and delivery suite, helping you feel more in control.This is NOT a basic &quot;What to Expect at Your Baby's Birth&quot; book. This book is for you if you want to have as natural a birth as possible, and don't want potentially unnecessary interventions done by the OB staff in the hospital. The information could be overwhelming (there are so many things that can happen) to someone terrified of the whole birth experience, and this book is not a good first book about delivery. If you're fairly comfortable in medical situations and want to be informed, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"It doesn't really explain the birthing process so it is an \\"advanced read\\"; read it only after you have a basic understanding of the birth process. The book really explains the pros and cons of standard interventions that occur in a normal hospital birth and how to make wise, informed choices for yourself. In my opinion, if more moms read this the c-section rate would be lower (without sacrificing a healthy baby and healthy mom) and women would be more inspired to take responsibility for their body and baby. There is so much good info in here!I only wish 2 things...1. that the book had been updated more recently (protocols, drugs, etc change a lot in the medical community so you may get a little bit of out of date info or run into scenarios that just aren't likely to happen nowadays)and 2. that there were a better description of how to get your care providers to discuss alternatives with you. It's one thing to read the book and understand her research on a practical level. But, the Dr. or midwife can throw some emotional ideas into the mix that can make Goer's points seem less important. (For example, I was planning a delivery without unnecessary interventions. Baby was healthy according to NST, FMs, and BPPs but Dr. said, \\"if you were my wife I would induce labor\\" since I was a few days late. No mom wants to risk her baby's health for her own desires. And no matter that I knew inducing was more likely to cause problems than waiting a few more days in my case the Dr. really was trying to play on the vulnerabilites and uncertainties of expectant parents.) All the common sense and book smarts can fly out the window when dealing with the emotional aspects of parenting. Goer should offer more information on what other alternatives there are and why they could be valid. The book does this but the format could be a bit more \\"parent/ user\\" friendly. Sometimes I worry that Goer makes things clear with, \\"this is what you should do and this is what you shouldn't do,\\" but doesn't give a mom much direction.(Hope I didn't ramble too much- I kind of get on a roll when I am talking about childbirth. :))"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is extremely informative in all aspects of pregnancy and delivery. The book is based on research, rather than mainstream &quot;doctor&quot; culture, as most others are (i.e., What to Expect When You're Expecting) and will give you straight facts about various procedures and how to best equip yourself for a safe birth. It has information in there that doctors won't tell you- risks of various procedures in particular. When I read this book after having a primary cesarian, I was disgusted at how my doctor had totally glossed over the risks associated with cesarian births, and had not even hinted at some of the risks that could affect my body for future pregnancies. It is the job of every woman to be informed when making choices for her own body and baby, and this book is a wonderful comprehensive guide to start a woman on the path of the informed."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Henci Goer has done a phenomenal job reviewing the available research for parents. The book is broken down by specific research topics such as pitocin, epidurals, and cesarean. Each topic is again broken down into reviews of the research, pros and cons of procedures and recommendations to parents.If you want to use medical pain relief or other interventions during labor and birth, this book will help you understand the risks of procedures and give you suggestions for ways to minimize those risks. If you want to avoid medications and interventions, this book can provide you with research and resources so you can intelligently discuss issues with your caregiver.Almost all of the families I have worked with have found this book to be a very valuable tool to help them plan the birth they desire. It is written in easy to understand language, but does refer to medical research and procedures extensively. For that reason, a couple of my childbirth education students have commented that it was a dull or difficult read. There is no attempt by the author to hide her discouragement at the medical establishment because of their failure to practice according to research recommendations. For some families, this book works better like an encyclopedia or other reference book than a \\"read it cover to cover\\" book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is the greatest! I received a lot of information that is so useful in the practical approach to child birth. I will be having my second child in a couple of months, and I see now what went wrong last time. After reading this book I am confident that I will indeed go natural this time. I also am able to deal with the problems I had last time much better thanks to this book. So much better than another book I just read. I just finished another book \\"Husband Coached Birth\\" by Dr. Bradley. If you want to know what the real story is read this book. If you want to know what labor was like in about 1940, read the one by Bradley."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As a childbirth educator, doula and the immediate past-president of ICAN (International Cesarean Awareness Network) Inc., this is one of the first books I would recommend to women looking for information about birth. Solid information based on a wealth of studies, she truly informs women of their options and rights - sadly something that rarely happens in obstetrics today. There are many disempowering books on the market today focusing on childbirth, thank you Henci for providing us with an alternative - this is one of the very best!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I wish that I had read Henci Goer's book earlier in my pregnancy so that I could have been better prepared while chosing my care provider. I would have been more prepared to ask more intelligent questions about what was important to me. After reading her book, I feel very confident with my choice of using a midwife and a birthing center and so does my husband. Very valuable information that every pregnant woman should have early in their pregnancy, it is by far the best book I have read on this subject."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"On the other hand, if you believe that managing your health and your child's is a partnership between you and your health care provider, you won't find anything political or trust-shaking in this book. Instead, you'll be grateful that you've been given a great resource that allows you to knowledgeably and factually discuss your options with your health care providers. And if you have the right health care provider, (s)he will be willing to do so.Unlike appallingly trite pregnancy books such as &quot;A Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy&quot; and &quot;What To Expect While You're Expecting,&quot; Henci Goer presents ALL of the facts -- even the less pleasant ones we don't always want to hear -- and has the data to back it up. Goer didn't write this book to make Mommies feel good about their choices, she wrote it to ensure that Moms have the *data* to make the best *informed* choice.You may not like the &quot;ugly&quot; truth that Henci Goer brings to light -- that medicated, surgical births are often unnecessary and have never been proven safer than non-medical births. That doctors and hospitals have (gasp) financial motivations that could influence their recommended protocol. But she has indisputable data to back it up. Which is more than most pregnancy books offer nowadays."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is an excellent book, well written, informative, obviously researched, and full of details, down to the names of the medicines used in birth. The problem is that the author is staunchly pro-natural birth, and this can make her writing seem very one sided. I used this book for a thesis, and her views were very interesting. But read this book with open eyes: it's an excellent book, but written with very strong opinions in mind. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just something to consider."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book touts being up to date with research and current information regarding the issues facing those of us delivering in today's hospitals or other settings. I was really looking forward to a book that I could read that would provide me with research based information to prepare for my upcoming birth. Unfortunately, the year is now 2012 and the book was last updated in 1999. This means that the research that the book was based on is 13 years old! Unfortunately for this Thinking Woman, that is just too out of date.I know for a fact that things have changed for the better, probably in part because of this book. I think it's time for an update!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a wonderful book that assumes the reader does not want to be condescended to an told what to do, it rather presents the facts along with the the author's opinion in a way which lets the reader draw their own conclusions. Everything is backed up by data, including excerpts of studies in the back of the book.This is an excellent book for the woman who wants to know 'why?', not just what the experts opinion is. Henci doesn't just give you her opinion, she is very clear on why she came to that conclusion. In contrast, many authors tell the reader what is essentially opinion dressed up as fact.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Some believe this book is too negative on hospital births or obstetrics care; however, the author says in the intro that she prefers the midwifery model of care (as do most expectant mothers). The reality is that many women who read this book may want a natural birth to take place at the hospital. If you were to watch the cable shows on childbirth, talk to all your friends who have given birth, you will find that what Goer presents in this book is the norm for what occurs in obstetrics care. So, if you are someone like me who wants a natural birth and the only feasible choice is obstetrics care and hospital birth...you have to realize that natural births are not the norm in this model. That's where this book comes into play. I now know what to (typically) expect at the hospital. I know why my Doctor might suggest interventions. I know the pros and cons of such interventions. I know where I'm willing to draw the line on intervention. Finally, I feel empowered to be my own best advocate in having the natural birth experience I want. I recommend this book to any expectant mother. Get informed!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"So much of our birth experiences result from the choices we make both before and during labor. This book teaches us how to understand the decisions that need to be made and how to navigate the confusion of the obstetrical world. I am a Licensed Midwife and owner of Carolina WaterBirth, a birth center in SC. I often recommend this book to women looking for answers, and we refer to it in childbirth classes. In labor, I can truly see more confidence in the women who have given thoughtful consideration to their birthing desires. You'll be grateful that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I have purchased probably 6 birth books altogether and this is one of the only ones that actually instills me with confidence. I would categorize most other popular books as \\"pregnancy lite\\" reading for those who are comfortable taking their obstetrician's word as sufficient (The Mother of All Birth Books, What to Expect). I have also purchased a few more stylistically \\"hard core\\" home birth and midwifery books (Mother's Intention) about which certain criticism regarding bias could be leveled. Ms. Goer's has a point of view, naturally, but it is informed by sound research. This is a good book for cynics and skeptics because the research speaks for itself and all works are cited. Those who have a problem with the book, simply may not be ready to challenge the status quo and feel defensive when confronted with information that might require them to do that. Of all the books I purchased, this and Birthing from Within are the most useful. If What to Expect is a pregnancy primer, I'd call this pregnancy grad school."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Two of the most significant lessons I walked away with from this book was a sense of empowerment to trust my body and its ability to birth a child naturally and that child birth is a natural, beautiful and healthy process.If all women learned that she is the best person to determine her threshold of pain and that it should be her decision (along with the guidance, not dictate of a doctor) when medical technology should intervene, more women would have better birthing experiences.I am in my ninth week of pregnancy and reading through the book made me aware of questions I should ask during the pregnancy that may help me avoid complications and medical intervention once in labor. I am planning on having a hospital birth but using a labor professional as an advocate for me and my husband during labor. Reading this book made me aware that there are alternative solutions to &quot;problems&quot; one may encounter during labor, and the right labor professional would be the one to advise you about them.I highly, highly, highly recommend this book to any woman interested in taking a more active role in her pregnancy and childbirth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I read The Thinking Woman's Guide when I was in medical school, pregnant, and expecting my first child. I already knew I was going to become an obstetrician, and the book offered a refreshing counter-point to the high-tech, high-intervention approach to obstetrics I would be taught as a resident. Some of the data is out-of-date, and even a little misleading, but for the most part, Henci Goer argues eloquently for putting birth back into the hands of laboring women."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is the best book I've ever seen in regards to condensing current research on childbirth into readable and understandable terms. The author gives clear and concise descriptions of various OB procedures and interventions that are easy to follow. She gives pros and cons of each [working within her own bias, which she does freely admit]. I think this would be an excellent book for any couple expecting an uncomplicated birth to read. This is information that every pregnant woman *should* have access to in order to make good decisions.However, there is definitely an anti-OB bias [which the author admits] and this isn't a book designed to make you feel all warm and fuzzy about a hospital birth. Be aware of that going into this - the author raises very important but possibly disturbing points for those planning a hospital birth with an Obstetrician in attendance.My only dissappointment with the book is that there was no chapter on assisted delivery [vacuum cap and forceps]. I would very much have liked to see a chapter on the pros and cons of these common procedures and their safety for mother and baby. There is only one page that has a small bit of information on this, but no extensive discussion or gathering of the research data available. It seems a glaring omission from an otherwise excellent and complete book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Although I expected a natural birth perspective (which I share), I was disappointed in the book's overwhelmingly negative tone toward OB's. I would have prefered a balanced, relatively objective discussion. I expected it from a book called The Thinking Womans Guide.... If the stats are so glaring, a balanced discussion is better than dogmatics.This is an excellent book for those who have decided to give birth naturally. It is not one to recommend to friends to help them make the decision about their birth. It will turn many women off. A better book for an introduction to the benefits of natural birth and the drawbacks of managed care is Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn by Penny Simkin."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As a first time mom, I was somewhat scared about going through chilbirth. As far as talking to my mom about my fears was useless because I was adopted, and talking to my aunts just made me more scared. So I decided to purchase &quot;The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Child Birth&quot; by Henci Goer.Now to be honest with you, this book didn't put most of my fears to rest, instead it made some things about childbirth more scary. After thinking about most of the stuff that scared me I relized that what was so scary was the fear of the unknown.However, Goer presents a somewhat biased opinion(she even admitts it). The information that she presents is comprehensive and well supported, the appendices accounts for about a third of the reading volume of the book which includes Literature Summaries and an extensive bibliography.Goer presents information on the following topics: cesareans, inducing labor, IVs, epidurals, home births, midwives and obstetricans, hospital births, birth centers, and alternatives to hi-tech birth. Most of the information that she presents on the before mentioned topics will not be mentioned by your OB/GYN.I highly recommend this book as a tool to compare and contrast information and your options for childbirth. You may not agreee with everything that Goer says but it is good to know all of the information and make a decision that is both beneficial to your baby and to yourself."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"After I read this book I wondered if birth in U.S. hospitals is really as badly mis-managed as Henci Goer says so I chcked some of her claims in the Medline database of medical journal literature. It turns out Goer has really done her research and according to the medical literatre (which Dr.s presumably should be reading) she is absolutely right. OBs in the U.S are trained to intervene in births when nothing is actually going wrong yet, and these needless interventions frequently cause unnessessary complications for mother and baby. The research indicates that a hands-off approach leads to the best outcomes as long as there is no clear need for medical intervention. This is a lesson the U.S. medical profesion is having a hard time learning. They are trained to do somethng not just wait, even when waiting would be more beneficial.If every pregnant woman had the information in this book instead of simply trusting doctors to do the right thing it would lead to drastic improvements in U.S. health care for labor and birth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Henci's easy reading style enhances the facts that she presents to the &quot;thinking&quot; woman who is thankfully searching for the safe satisfying birth she knows she wants. The set up of the information is logical and easy to follow. I am just disappointed that Ms. Goer has not written a thinking woman--guide to pregnancy. I see so many woman reading the standard &quot;What to expect... and come in with ridiculous questions--too many holes and too general a guide. The field of obstetrics needs to be based on proven evidence and Ms. Goer gives the birthing mom her guide to these facts--empowering her with every word. I cannot thank her enough for helping us with our quest for normal birth!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"You will NOT like this book if you're looking for a book that presents all options as being equal. You will not read, \\"When it comes to giving birth, you could do \\"A.\\" That's a great choice. Or you could do \\"B,\\" which is just as good. And then there's \\"C\\", and if you choose to give birth that way, well that's as good as \\"A\\" or \\"B\\".\\" Do not buy this book if you want all your \\"options\\" laid out as perfectly equal and beneficial choices for birth. The author clearly states that she is not \\"neutral\\" and that she is no more objective than anyone else about what makes for optimal care.The author clearly states that she believes that \\"midwifery care is superior to medical management for low- and moderate-risk pregnant women\\" and that obstetricians are specialists who should only care for women who have high-risk pregnancies. She claims that her book \\"establishes that the routine or indiscriminate use of medical tests, procedures, drugs and restrictions - the hallmark of obstetric management - does far more harm than good.\\" This claim she backs up with an amazing amount of studies and research.This book will cause you to think about all the things you thought were \\"normal\\" and \\"necessary\\" parts of labor and birth. It will make you question why the huge majority of Western women are cared for by obstetricians and deliver in hospitals, when most of them have healthy pregnancies. And if the author accomplishes her goal, it will give you the ability to decide what is right for you.You WILL like this book if you believe childbirth to be a fundamentally normal and healthy event in a woman's life, not to be treated as a medical procedure that needs to be \\"managed.\\" You will like this book if you want to learn how to avoid all unnecessary interventions and to start small when intervention becomes necessary.You don't need to be planning a homebirth with a midwife in order for this book to be beneficial. If you simply want to be empowered to have birth that is individualized to YOU, where your labor and delivery is respected as a personal experience, and where you have the right to make informed decisions about the procedures you and your baby are subjected to, read this book.If you want to play a more passive role in your birth and have it \\"managed\\" for you by a specialist, don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Every pregnant woman should read this book early in her pregnancy. It is packed full of clear, unbiased information and facts about the common medical interventions that take place during birth, why many of them are undesirable or even dangerous, and how they can be avoided. It is fascinating to see how most of the research proves that medical procedures that American women have come to view as normal are in fact unnecessary. This book covers topics like Cesareans, the use of IVs during birth, pain medications, epidurals, episiotomies, and electronic fetal monitoring. It shows how such common beliefs as &quot;It's better to have a surgical episiotomy cut than a natural tear&quot; are in fact false, and why the medical profession has pushed them so frequently that they have become a &quot;normal&quot; part of giving birth. This book cleared up a lot of questions that I had and made me decide very firmly that I would prefer a long and painful labor to an epidural, which might relieve my pain, but could also cause myself and, even worse, MY BABY, medical problems down the line."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Ms. Goer has methodically reviewed the medical research in obstetrics and presented it in language that anyone can understand. She clearly explains why some of the most commonly practiced interventions in childbirth are not based in research.Henci Goer has also written a great book for birth professionals, and the best part of both books is that, including her own opinions, she puts her research skills where her mouth is. You don't have to be a medical researcher to get through this book because she has put the information into convenient summaries. You can hear a bit of frustration in her tone while reading the book, but that is because so many OB practitioners keep practicing in ways that are clearly opposite to what the medical researchers have shown is beneficial to pregnant and laboring women!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"In my opinion, this book best fits the woman who finds comfort in knowledge and who wants to educate herself on hospital delivery--what tends to happen, the outcomes of interventions on yourself and your baby, and how to avoid problems.For example, there is a chapter on epidurals that tells how they're done (with picture) and the pros and cons of the procedure.Do realize that the author does openly promote a &quot;natural&quot; style of birth (p.136). I wanted that, so I found this book incredibly encouraging and informative. It gives research that supported my desires and it tells procedures of how to avoid episiotomy, unneccessary c-section, IVs and narcotics, etc. This book also helped me to develop my birth plan and gave me confidence in my decisions.The last third of the book is filled with literature summaries to support the claims she made in the text. Full references are there, in case you want to look up the research article yourself."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Two of my greatest passions - birth and reading - have led me to this book among pregnancy books! Even before I became a doula, I devoured pregnancy and labor books by the dozens and I can honestly say that this one is a MUST READ for anyone pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant.As a doula, I ask every one of my clients to read this book. The information on drugs, induction and other hospital protocol is on-target and backed by scientific research.It's not just about &quot;natural birth&quot; either - it's a comprehensive run down of everything you might encounter during your labor and how to make the best informed decision for you and your baby."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a classic. Rather than spout her birth philosophy, Goer analyses the studies out there, condenses them into layman's terms, and lets you choose what works for you and your birth.

If you are ready to dive into the wealth of information out there, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"One of the most needed books about women's health care during pregnancy, labor and birth. I highly recommend this book and or buy it as gifts for pregnant friends."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I had been recommended this book to educate myself on what type of practices I might expect at the hospital. I think most pregnant women already hope to minimize the amount of intervention during labor and delivery without all the scare tactics of this book.Some bits of information were indeed helpful, and will arm the reader with questions for their medical provider on why certain options should or should not be employed (episiotomy, epidural, etc.) However, the tone is the book is so shrill and stridently anti-hospital that you come away with the impression that if the only safe and \\"right\\" way pregnant woman should give birth is to do a home delivery with a midwife. Frankly, that's limiting a woman's choices rather than empowering her to make decisions.Instead, I recommend people read Birthing From Within."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book provides the other side of the story as it relates to common birth practices in hospitals today. Definitely good information, but you can't take everything at face value.

Henci Goer's book is about what she feels is wrong with the medical establishment. While her information may or may not be true, it is irrelevent to me... I would have appreciated a more positive approach to what one can do to prepare for a &quot;better birth&quot; (as the title offers) versus her negative approach to what is wrong with current medical practice. The book I ended up buying that has been incredibly helpful, non-preachy, unbiased, and comforting is &quot;Easing Labor Pain - The complete Guide to a More Comfortable and Rewarding Birth&quot; by Adrienne Lieberman. It is unopinionated and very positive and is making me look forward to the birth of my first child and also giving me the encouragement and helpful tips I hoped to find on natural childbirth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I read this book, expecting to find information on natural healthy childbirth. However, the author largely focuses on the negatives of hospitalized births with OBs. It is informative and well researched, but left me feeling that I would have to be on the offensive in order to make sure I had a natural birth and avoid unnecessary interventions. I would greatly have preferred to hear more positive options, what women CAN do, what choices and tools we DO have. And so, I much preferred Birthing From Within by Pam England and have given it to several friends.Birthing from Within: An Extra-Ordinary Guide to Childbirth Preparation"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Is this book slanted? Yes! All books are toward the authors's opinion. Henci Goer is obviously a natural childbirth advocate!!! If nothing else, this book aids parents in understanding what topics are controversial in the natural birth/labor process and has helped my husband and I know what questions to ask and what topics should be covered to be prepared for a natural birth in a hospital. I do not think it should be your only resource, but it is recommended if you are looking into natural childbirth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I am a doula/childbirth educator and have approx. 6 copies of this book in my lending library. Henci Goer was nice enough to sign my copies which makes them even more personal. This is a book I have ALL my clients read. I think unlike so many pregnancy books out there this one gives you the tools via knowledge to be able to have the birth you want. Less interventions is always better but how do we go about doing that? Henci is very descriptive and gives the pro's and con's of each medical intervention. It's an objective view of childbirth but certainly makes you question the medical world. If you haven't read this book you should take the time, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book was comprehensive, clear, easy to read, well documented, and somewhat predictable. Each chapter talks about the pros and cons of common obstectrical practices. The cons invariably include a higher chance of C-section. The most useful parts were the chapters on how to interview a care provider. Overall I think it is a useful book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"If you are pregnant or want to be, this is the single most important book you can read. You may or may not read it cover to cover, but it will provide you with the tools you need to make informed, research-based decisions about the birth you want. And in case you, like most thinking women, are reluctant to trust a single source, Goer provides all the information you need to check her sources and see the research for yourself."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"With a title like \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide\\" I was expecting a balanced discussion about the pros and cons of typical medical ans non-medical interventions during childbirth. Instead it was a completely one sided criticism of all medical interventions. The basic message is all medical intervention is bad and you should fight with your OB/GYN to not have an IV, pain medication, ultrasounds or any medical testing since they are all dangerous and your OB is only performing these tests to make money, avoid litigation and because they are part of medical dogma.I was very dissapointed and I hope her point of view is a minority among doulas. I agree there are unnessesary medical interventions and that childbirth is a natural event, not a medical one, but I have a hard time believing that basically all OB/GYNs number one priority is making money and following trends rather than making sound, evidence based and safe decisions for a woman and her baby."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a fantastic book, full of information - including the references to where she got her data from, which is very important. Some authors just pull stuff out of their... I mean, they make stuff up, or they may as well be if there are no references to provide the evidence for what they are saying.As for the criticism that it is \\"not balanced\\": I don't know what she was supposed to do. Say that there are some good things about routine episiotomy (when there aren't any)? Say there that from one perspective, it's good that almost 1 in 3 births in the US are by C-section (when of course it's not good)? The facts are the facts and they are unequivocably in favour of a more natural birth, when at all possible (which is the vast majority of the time). She provides the empirical evidence for this position. Try finding empirical evidence (not just somebody's word for it) that the US C-section rate is just right, or that routine episiotomy is necessary, or that women should not be allowed to eat or drink during the hard work of labour. Although something may seem like \\"common sense\\" to a doctor, that doesn't make it a good idea.Yes, it's wonderful that C-sections exist for the few emergency cases in which they are required. Obstetricians are wonderful for that kind of surgery. But midwives are empirically proven to be safer birth attendants at low risk births. There is no way to be more \\"balanced\\" than that.The book is getting a little old now, however, and for a more up-to-date companion, I recommend the wonderful \\"Born in the USA\\" by Marsden Wagner.If you're reading this while pregnant: Have a safe and beautiful birth for you and you baby!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book has been the one out of many many books that I have read during my pregnancy.

Of all the books I've read this was the one I insisted my husband read."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN AND HIGHLY INFORMATIVE BOOK.

Women should be angry at the way they, and their babies, are treated by the medical establishment."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I have checked out many of Goer's sources, and her information is accurate and important for every expectant parent to be aware of. Some people think she is &quot;biased,&quot; but in reality, our system is broken and gets poor results compared with other countires. Goer clearly shows us why."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is an invaluable addition to my pregnancy library. Goer's presentation of the pros and cons of pregnancy interventions was very informative, and mostly reaffirmed my decision not to birth in a hospital.So many women seem to go into birth not really knowing what can happen to them, and what the little cut here, or a little drug there can do to them and their baby, and what other interventions will probably follow this one.I think any woman who is birthing in a hospital should definitely read this book first, and those of us who plan out of hospital births can get useful information from it as well."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I would like to give this book TEN stars. While pregnant, I read a lot of books. This one was outstanding.I cannot stress how important I think it is for every pregnant woman to read this book. Neither your doctor nor your pregnancy/childbirth class will provide you with all the information you need. This book will. I read it on a whim, and I feel so lucky that I did. It is full of information you NEED to know (and that most women don't).An aspect of this book that also makes it stand out from the rest is that the author doesn't ask you to trust her opinion -- she provides you with extensive references for the sources of her information.WONDERFUL!In the future, I am going to buy this for every pregnant friend."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"While the facts maybe true, I felt there is no need to portray the situation in black-and-white (Doctors are bad, home birth is good). IMHO a thinking woman will not accept such a one-sided view, and will want to understand both sides."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I heartily recommend this book. Be aware, however, that it is not a \\"Giggles and Grins\\" kind of book designed to make you feel good (the Girlfriend's Guide and What to Expect books are good for those who are content turning over their bodies to the \\"experts\\"). When you have information, you are responsible to do something with it - even ignore it. If you are pregnant and you want to manage this normal and significant part of your life, this is a must-read.The author definitely has a point of view, and it is one that you are not likely to hear other places. This makes it more valuable for decision-making - you learn another side to the many issues involved in childbearing.It is well-worth the effort to read this book and follow the references. Newer studies are out and some other books have been updated or published reflecting their results. However, the conclusions drawn in this book are still valid, and you can rely on them."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I feel this book is very biased. Read other one and find the ones that don't give such judgemental information."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Allow me to start with the positive aspect of this book: it provides support to women who want to have a birthing experience with little or no medical intervention. I'm sure those of you considering it have been scorned, mocked or condescended to when you've shared your desire for natural childbirth with others (especially other mothers). That is tragic and for that, I am happy that this book is out there.That being said, this book is entirely biased (as the author acknowledges in her preface) and contains misinformation. The most glaring example of which is the section on epidurals. HAVING AN EPIDURAL DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE AT ANY HIGHER RISK FOR HAVING A CESAREAN SECTION. PERIOD. First, the drugs used in epidurals today vary greatly from those used in the studies discussed by Ms. Goer. More importantly, even those studies that found a higher incidence of c-sections with epidural use could not draw a causal link. In other words, the epidural was not necessarily the cause of the c-section but, rather, the woman could have been headed for a c-section regardless of the epidural. Finally, there are just as many studies that say there is no link whatsoever between epidurals and c-sections. Ms. Goer selectively omits any discussion of these studies. I strongly urge all of you to take 30 minutes and read some medical journals on your own or call the anesthesiologist at your birthing place and just ask him/her your questions to get a different perspective.I ultimately decided to have a natural birth but not because of any of the misinformation in Ms. Goer's book. I feel strongly that had I chosen an epidural, I would not have put my baby or myself in jeopardy. Now, having done one birth naturally, I will certainly choose an epidural next time. There is no reason to suffer unnecessarily."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"i was looking for a good educational book on options during and for childbirth. This book was so negative against actual medical professionals (in OB practice). I couldn't get past the first chapter it was so bad."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I have had this book recommended to me quite a few times, so I picked it up. I have to say, that this book does a good job of trying to insure that the woman will not only &quot;think&quot;, but be frightened of anything done by an OB or in a hospital during pregnancy and childbirth. If all Obstetricans are really this horrid and unfeeling, that they would willingly impose tons of dangerous and unnecessary procedures on women- why are so many women still going to an OB and delivering at a hospital? Why are the majority electing for pain meds? This is just another book in a long line of books that assume that women today are just sheep who have no common sense what-so-ever, and that all would jump at the chance at a painful natural birth in their house if only they &quot;knew&quot;. This book also can drive a wedge of mistrust and suspicion between a woman and her doctor, leading her to not take the doctor's knowledgable advice or to refuse something in labor that can actually help, or force her to &quot;grit her teeth&quot; in pain through labor because she is so scared of the meds that can help. I for one, chose a doctor I feel is trustworthy who cares about me and my baby. I think women should be offended by this mentality cropping up that women are all stupid, don't care about their babies or are selfish if they chose a medicated, hospital birth. Any study done can be slanted toward a person's point of view. Talk to your doctor about procedures done in childbirth- they are human and they want you and your baby to come out healthy."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"It seems to me that this book encourages women not to listen to Doctors and to only listen to the methods in this book. It gives you some preparation for seeing a Dr but really tells you not to. Not sound practices. I know many women who have natural birth and they read many books to get different viewpoints."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book may be encouraging to women who want to have the 'natural' experience, but you SHOULD listen to your physician as well to balance it.I wanted a natural experience and ended up with a very complicated birth. I even had a doula to help me with the experience. My doctor was very supportive of trying to respect my wishes and finally, when my temp spiked to 104 and the baby still had not come out (36 hours of labor), she gave pulled out the stops. Later, she told me that she came close to kicking the doula out of the room.Natural is great for those of you who have the experience, I say, go for it. But realize that your doc has some experience too. And LISTEN to HIM/HER. The thing with the nature nazis is that they just don't know when to quit.As a result of the long birth process, my daughter spent a touch and go four days in the ICU and was only released from the hospital a full week after her birth. If I had it to do over again, I would have let my doctor induce me early and get that baby out. Hindsight is 20/20 and you don't have that kind of hindsight until something goes very wrong. IF nature takes it's course early on, go for it! If not, bag the natural childbirth idea as soon as your doctor gives you encouragement to do so."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This books is not helpful if you are an impending mother who wants to get balanced information about birth and the different options. I had to stop reading this book as all it did was make me feel guilt and apprehension about giving birth in a hospital - albeit with a supportive, non-interventionist obstetrician.Reviewers are correct in saying that the book has research to back up its statements but research can generally be found to support any view on things such as this, particularly given that no true statistical studies can be done due to ethical considerations of assigning women to birth methods.The book also uses things that are \\"negatives\\" of hospitals (lots of equipment) as \\"positives\\" of birthing centers (equipment to deal with emergencies)."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I only give it 1 star because there are some informative parts. But mostly it was very preachy, anti-doctor/hospital and very one sided. \\"My way or the highway\\"-like.The author doesn't believe that a hospital birth is any good and the best way to birth is at home or a birthing center. Obstretricans are evil. All that stuff.There were a few moments of helpfulness when the author would discuss generalities or procedures...but other than that, useless. Borrow from a library but do not support this author!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I found this book querulous and defensive. The author is much too eager to heap blame and criticism upon the medical profession. (For those curious: I am neither a doctor nor a man. I am a woman outside the medical profession, expecting my second child.) Although I read this book for the alternate viewpoint, it ultimately served to confirm my instinctive suspicions about today's birthing crusaders and the use of doulas. I had a positive experience birthing my first child in a hospital with my husband at my side and without a bunch of extraordinary demands and conditions, and look forward to a similiarly positive experience with my second child. My doctor (a male who graduated medical school in the '60s, for anyone wondering) is sensitive to my concerns, is aware of and makes use of the most modern approaches to childbirth, and is someone with whom I feel comfortable and whom I would trust with my life. Sorry to disappoint you, ladies."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"The invoice said that the item had no writing or hilighting in the book.

The author does not hide her mission which is to provide the reader with information that the mainstream medical establishment refuses to tell you. It has tons of statistics and information that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else. It also has tons and tons of additional information and references if you wish to do further exploration. The mainstream medical establishment views pregnancy as something a woman must be saved from and women are taught to believe that giving birth must be a high tech, traumatic event. This book empowers women with information, knowledge and most of all options that you won't find anywhere else. It reminds us that women have been having babies,( and continue to do so almost everywhere else in the world,) in a low tech and non-invasive way with much fewer complications then with high tech medicine."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I recommend this book. Henci Goer wrote this book using research and statistics to provide the reader with concise, factual, easy to read information.

Henci has written Obstetric Myth vs Research Reality, The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth, she has also written consumer pamphlets and articles in various magazines. Henci worked as a Doula for over 20 years and as a Lamaze Instructor for 10 years.This is a great book to add to the bookshelf of a Labor Doula, pregnant woman and anyone interested in learning more about the science behind the tests, medications and procedures that are often used throughout pregnancy, labor and birth.This is a book that should be used as a resource throughout pregnancy.The insightful information provided will assist the reader in making decisions. This book provides the pros and cons to the medical procedures and interventions that are often recommended during pregnancy and labor."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I was already very interested in a med-free/ low intervention book before buying this book. I had hoped that it would provide more hard core ammunition that I could use in dealing with friends and family defending my choices. It did not live up to my hopes in this way. I still don't feel that I can totally explain the &quot;why&quot; behind my choice.That said, it was still a very good book. I thought it did do a good job of laying out the case for why the doctors and hospitals respond they way they do.The book brought up many techniques routinely used in hospitals that I hadn't thought of our encountered in other reading as well.I thought this book was also very helpful for me in preparing to talk to my doctor. It helped me to know not only the right things to ask, but how to phrase things without sounding accusatory.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Throughout her book, Ms. Goer makes it apparent that several current birth practices are not supported by medical research. Eletronic fetal monitoring, routine I.V., epidurals, induction and episiotomy are just a few of the topics she addresses.This is a must-read for the woman who wants to be truly informed about her birth choices. Ms. Goer states her bias toward home deliveries and against the average OB, but she backs up her claims with medical research and includes the references in a (medical) literature summary in the Appendix. Ms. Goer provides the facts gleaned from medical literature as well as a risk versus benefit analysis so that her readers may make informed decisions about routine interventions.I highly recommend this book for every couple, but particularly the couple pursuing a natural birth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Henci Goer has written an excellent book that is great for anyone who wants to know more about the risks and benefits of different procedures involved in birth. The information is supported by an extensive list of research from reliable and well known sources. What I like most about this book is that it's straight forward and unbiased. It's easy to read but a bit dry. It's exactly what it claims to be- a guide for thinking women who want to know about the facts, benefits, and risks in childbirth decisions. I highly recommend this book for first time moms and those who want more information than you can get in the &quot;What to Expect&quot; book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Truely opened my husband's and my eyes to how much we did NOT know about childbirth. This is far too important an event to put blind faith in doctors and a medical system that don't always have your best interests at heart. Education is your most valuable weapon against unnecessary intervention. Read everything you can get your hands on about labor and birth, but if you can only read one book, read this one!!!!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I would also recommend it to ANY pregnant couple, since they will easily learn how to make informed, intelligent decisions of their own for their pregnancy, labor and birth. Knowledge of birthing choices is a key component to a safe and satisfying childbirth experience.This book keeps its promise to educate and empower, emparting vital information on the technology driven birthing world in which we find ourselves today, and how birthing couples can attend to their own agendas instead of serving those of their medical care providers. A MUST READ."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I first checked this book out of the library for a report, andended up ordering a copy because I was pregnant. This booklists all the pros and cons of many medical procedures, anddoesn't &quot;beat around the bush.&quot; The author does admit herown bias, however, the research presented backs up her beliefs.I have found myself referring to this book throughout my pregnancy, especially now that I am past my due date and mycaregiver is pushing for an induction merely because I havereached the 41 week cutoff date. This book is giving me theinformation I need to stick to my desire to let nature takeits course and to have the kind of birth that I want."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is the real deal on what's up with birth today. The author takes a hard look at many of the medical professions sacred cows, such as epidurals, episiotomy, iv, labor induction and management, just to name a few. Henci Goer has masterfully dug through the medical literature and gives readers the facts in laymen's terms. (More descriptions of these studies are included in the back of the book.) Every pregnant woman should read this book, especially those planning to give birth in a hospital. If you are only going to read one book during pregnancy, make it this one!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"The main reason that I bought this book was for expert help with writing a birth plan. This book covered all of the questions that I had regarding my pregnancy and upcoming delivery, and even covered some things that I had not thought about. I wish I were brave enough to go the midwife/home birth route, but since I'm not, I opted for the OB/hospital setting. Now I know what all of my options are or at least what I should ask my doctor about. It's written in easy to understand language. This book also served as a refresher course for me. My first child was born 7 years ago and lots of things have changed since then."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book has valuable research about medical procedures common in birth that can be valuable to someone wanting to learn more about their options. The author is biased - she declares this at the beginning - so read it with a grain of salt. Realize that she is trying to convince you that her viewpoint is the only correct one, based on the research. If you are a \\"thinking woman\\" as the book title proclaims to be a book for thinking women, then read her information and read other information and then sit down and THINK about what is best for you. No one can tell you what is best for you, but this is an accessible guide to some research studies that have been done so that you can feel you are making an educated decision for the health and well-being of you and your baby."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book was recommended to me by my doula. I did not read this book cover to cover, but used it as a reference to look up various terms and interventions. It was nice to have some more info other than the typical \\"everyone does it so it must be safe\\" that I was hearing.In the end, my goal was a natural birth in a hospital setting with as few interventions as possible. To prepare for this, my husband and I took a 12 week Bradley course and read the book Natural Childbirth the Bradley way. I had a successful, natural delivery and was glad I had done all the research.I recommend this book for all pregnant women. Even if you plan to use more interventions than I did, you should still read up on any possible risks involved so you can make the best choices for you.My only criticism is that this book is a little dated. They need to come out with a revised copy with more up to date info."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a great and very informative book. I highly recommend it to all pregnant women. As stated by many other reviewers, this book is biased. I believe that the bias is based on fact though and not just opinion. Women today should be made aware of the facts regarding today's \\"traditional\\" birth that can include IV's, epidural, episiotomy and often a C-section. I think we tend to over-trust doctors without doing our own research. In the last 50 years modern medicine has basically reinvented birth in the United States and turned it into a medical monster requiring tons of intervention. A quick look at birthing traditions before and still today in other countries can really open our eyes to the misleadings of medicine.The book covers all the major topics associated with giving birth and lists the pros and cons very clearly with cited references. The specific numbers that Goer lists are several years old but those numbers still continue on the same trend today. The theories and wisdom in her book haven't changed. I would recommend reading this book especially if you are planning an OB delivery in a hospital so that you are educated and can make your own decisions on the birth that you want to have. This book is empowering and educational!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I had read several reviews for this book here on Amazon, and thought it sounded like a good fit for me. I have more of a tendency toward the natural and holistic approach to childbirth, and this books seemed to fit the bill. While I did appreciate the section on avoiding episiotomies and some of the info on VBAC's, overall I was frustrated with and disappointed in The Thinking Woman's Guide. The author seems to have a true mistrust of doctors and hospitals. While I agree that sometimes \\"modern medicine\\" intervenes when it isn't necessary, I'm not going to second guess every little thing my provider says and does. How can you enjoy your birth experience if you're paranoid that whole time? Some parts of the book are confusing. On one page, the author says that in order to have a \\"safe\\" vaginal birth, women should avoid epidurals and other pain killers. But literally on the next page she says for a \\"positive\\" birth experience, you should *plan* to have an epidural. So, you're telling me it's not safe, but I should do it anyway? Huh?? The section that I found most upsetting is where the author talks about husbands as labor coaches. She basically says that no husband really wants to be a labor coach and men aren't typically very nuturing or instructive during labor anyway, so all women should hire a doula. Your husband should just sit in the corner waiting around to cut the cord. I found this ridiculous, and my husband (who was an outstanding labor coach during the birth of our first child) was offended. This book was definitely not worth the money I paid for it. I highly recommend looking around for a different guide for your pregnancy and birth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I have opted for as natural childbirth as possible because after lots of reading, including this book, I've decided that it's the way I'd like to do things. However, that being said, I find the tone of this book to be pretty alarmist. Labor and delivery can be unpredictable, and even if you intend to go natural, there may be circumstances that require medical intervention. This book serves to instill such panic about these interventions that you will be afraid to give your consent on them even if they should turn out to be necessary and appropriate.It is a helpful resource in that it is good to know what the different interventions are, what the different drug options are, and the pros and cons of each. Going into your labor as informed as possible can only be good. And to be fair, she does admit her bias against obstetric interventions at the very start of the book. It is a worthwhile read, but I would definitely recommend taking it with a little grain of salt. The author is a self-described \\"birth activist,\\" which definitely suggests some ideology in play that should be taken into consideration when reading this book.Overall, I do recommend it if you intend to go natural, but only as one viewpoint in the course of your decision making about what's best for you and your baby."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"What I was expecting with this book was a clear, unbiased look at various birthing options so a \\"thinking woman\\" could understand everything and make a good choice for herself and also more info on VBACs. This author considers a \\"thinking woman\\" to be one that wants a natural, unmedicated childbirth, attended by a midwife, at a birthing center or at home. If this is you, you can be assured that this book backs your stance and provides scary statistics to make you believe that birthing in a hospital with an OB is an irresponsible and dangerous choice at best. Although my plan for my birth experience was an \\"all natural\\" one and I can agree with this author's bias, I find the way she wrote this book, that I can't take it seriously and have actually returned it. I would highly recommend \\"Birth After Cesarean\\" for a factual look at VBAC (though I wish they had an updated version) and would look elsewhere for a \\"thinking woman's\\" guide."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I bought the book based on the title and some of the reviews that I had read, expecting a book that would provide the pros and cons of different scenarios and allow the reader to come to her own decision. The book did provide some interesting info and stats, but it was so full of anti-OB rhetoric that sifting through the bias made it hard to come to any sort of informed decision."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I read at least 10 book about pregancy/childbirth during my first pregancy. I read this book during my second pg and now I realize that all/most of the others were just \\"fluff\\". I am hardly a naturalist/holistic kind of person, but I knew after my first labor and delivery that I wanted things to be a bit different the second time around. This book provided so much knowledge that I was completely oblivious to the first time around that it is scary. I certainly do not agree with everything the author says, but I, at least, am now enlightened to the different sides of the issues. My first L&D started with an induction via pitocin, was very painful, endured an epidural and oral pain meds, and thankfully ended in a successful vaginal birth after 8 hours. My second pg, although induced again, I refused pitocin and had my water broke(baby was engaged) instead (which was not even given as an option the 1st time; 2nd time I asked for it), had absolutely no meds/epidural, used bradley coping methods, and 3.5 hours later gave birth NATURALLY to my second son. This book does not contain all the answers, but it certainly raises plenty of questions."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As a childbirth educator teaching in a hospital, I'm limited on the amount of information I'm able to give my students. Thankfully, this book is listed in the &quot;Recommended Reading&quot; section of our class textbook. Through this book, I'm able to inform my students about the risks of interventions, how to communicate with their care givers, and how to have a better birth. Unfortunately, alot of my students are weeks before their due dates and they miss the extremely valuable information this book gives on how to choose a competent care giver and how to truly find out how their care giver practices.The pendulum is swinging to a very high technological approach in birth. In the five years I've been teaching, the cesarean rate has doubled at our hospital. It's outrageous and not evidence based care, as Ms. Goer's book explains (and backs up with scientific studies and references).If you want to know the real story on epidurals, IVs, VBACs, and inductions, get this book!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I now incourage the couples in my class to read this book cover to cover and use the information when creating their birth plan.

It clearly lists all the possible methods of birth with accompanying statistics of complications. It has all the information you need to choose a doctor, hospital, birthing method, and a reality check of where America stands in natural birth.This book is not for every woman though. Some may feel offended at the mere thought of having a natural birth, some just don't care for alternative medicine. Instead this book is great for AP/organic eating/herbal supplementing/yoga going/alpha female who is not afraid of natural birth and is eager to make a very informed decision."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book didn't keep my attention as well as other birth books.

There is so much rhetoric & medical propoganda that scares people into thinking its irresponsible or risky to have a homebirth.

It was very informative and helped me understand things that could possibly go wrong and what options I would have at that point. I make it a point to be prepared no matter what I'm doing and being pregnant was definitely no exception. I would recommend this book to everyone, even if you've already had children, just so you know what options you have in case something unexpected happens. It does have some medical terminology in there, but it wasn't hard to figure out since I'm a massage therapist."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"A refreshing, timely alternative to mainstream, meaningless books like \\"What to Expect...\\" Encourages women to think for themselves and break the false assumption that just because a \\"doctor\\" is a \\"doctor\\" - he or she knows best, all the time, and always has the mother's best interest in mind. Really helped me see the risks involved with interventions in labor & birth - breaks the common, false understanding - often the idea sold to women newly pregnant - that it's a \\"no brainer\\" to get an epidural, or that a planned induction or c-section w/out medical reasons is a great scheduling technique without drawbacks. There are risks; there are drawbacks. Maybe they're still worth it - but know the facts!I give this book to all the thinking women I know when I hear they've become pregnant."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I'm not a mom yet, bought this in addition to a few other books when we started \\"trying\\". 3 years later I have read it several times and given it to many friends when I hear they are expecting. I like that it's a balanced opinion book, yes it is clear that natural is better, but it gives pros and cons for EVERYTHING, not just trying to push an expecting mom in any direction but giving her an educated view on all aspects so she can make an informed decision about the kind of birth that will be best for her and her baby's needs."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is a must-read for all women expecting (and even their partners). The chapters are written separate from each other so it is an easy book to pick up and put down to learn a little hear and there. It has opened up many areas of conversation and topics for my husband and I to discuss as we prepare for the birth of our child. We are intending a natural birth and it is very liberating to be able to have 'reason' to support why we decline certain medical procedures/interventions. Also, in the event that we need intervention we are informed as to what options we have and which we'd prefer!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book will definitely make you think! I love how all her information is referenced and you can see the sources in the back of the book. It's good to know your options and that there are non-intrusive methods of giving birth and dealing with potential complications. Read it through twice in a row and still use it as reference. Priceless!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is one of the very few books out there that tells you your options, encourages you do choose and embrace those options, and give you information to back it up. Almost the last half of this book sites the SEVERAL studies on every topic she discusses, and then you can see the outcomes of the studies, and choose for yourself.Yes it does tell you the many flaws in the medical, and it CAN be perceived as negative, but that's because the medical maternity system in hospitals today, is most crappy. So, if you are uncomfortable having a home birth, this book lets you see your options, and choose to have your best birth experience in the hospital. If you are looking for a book to tell how what to say to get your way at birth, there isn't one out there that I know of, you have to do the thinking yourself, and choose what to do."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This excellent resource provides research-based, up-to-date information on all aspects of birth. I particularly appreciated the formatting of each chapter, offering a quick and easy overview of each birth intervention and its pros and cons.This book, more than any other I read during my pregnancy, prepared me to be an informed consumer of OB/GYN and hospital maternity services. Our bodies, our babies, and our births deserve the utmost preparation. This comprehensive guide offers everything you need to know as you plan your birth.An essential companion for all pregnant women, whether planning a natural birth or hospital birth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is one of the best sources of information about childbirth.

I recommend it to all of my pregnant friends."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book does a great job of both explaining the problems surrounding birth in the US today and then backing up the explanations with scientific studies. I felt angry after reading this book that I did not have it before my first child was born, I would have done things so differently. I also felt grateful that I found it had it before my second!Though childbirth is seen as scary, it doesn't have to be. Educate yourself so you don't have to deal with regrets!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"The points I want to make in my review are thus: the book doesn't expect you to necessarily go out and approach your childbirth with a prescribed way...but rather the opposite. It inspires you to do your own thinking instead of taking your doctor's/aunt's/mother's word for it. When reading it, it's one of those \\"things that make you go hmmmm\\"...which is why it's called the thinking woman's guide...Second, and this is probably the most important thing I got out of it, it made me realize that in choosing my OB, I am a consumer, and I have the right to seek out an OB who would support my VBAC choices and respect the fact that I had already made myself a well-informed person. The first OB I had chosen ended up to be the wrong choice...her protocol was definitely not proven to be the best avenue for a VBAC, something I learned through my research...and the doc I ended up with was far more knowledgeable on VBACs.The VBAC Companion: The Expectant Mother's Guide to Vaginal Birth After Cesarean. I didn't use much out of Goer's book, but I'm thankful it gave me the confidence to make well-informed choices."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I read this book from cover to cover, even the references have more information. If you want to learn how to have a healthy & safe birth, or if you are feeling a little bit patronized by your doctor, this book is vital. I especially liked the chapters on breech, IVs, risks of c-sections, episiotomies, and the intervention rate comparisons between hospitals, birthing centers and home births. It is very fascinating to learn that OBs and hospitals have made births less safe, and you can have a safe birth at home with a midwife."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Of all the books about the cons of obstetric procedures I've read recently, this is the first one that I've not only finished, but enjoyed. The author does not come across as being one of those techno-phobic zealots who do little more than preach at any woman who disagrees with them.At no point did I come across the idea that if I had some procedure done, I was somehow 'betraying' my unborn child or 'shirking my duty'. Instead I was treated to accurate descriptions of what I may encounter, what each entails and how, in some instances, one leads to the other.I would definitely recommend this to any expectant mother or parents out there."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I read this while PG and I have to say now I realise a good part of it was true. HOWEVER, it really can make a person already nervous a little over paranoid of things that if you deliver in a hospital you won't have control over anyway. It was a good book and had good references of research. Kinda pushy on the unassisted side of delivering options."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I think that this is a no fuss way to describe things. It doesnt beet around the bush on information that is important. A must for any doula or wanna be:)"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I was expecting this book to be not only informative, but empowering to women and positive. It is informative, but so so negative with it's scare tactics about what \\"really goes on\\" in a hospital it sounds like it was written by a man. I am choosing to have a natural birth, but I choose to for other reasons, not because I have been frightened into it by now knowing what goes on the medical way. At the end of the day, I have to be open to the possibility of cesarean if it is required and would like to remain positive about that. Reading this book left me disappointed if I was to have a C Section. Don't waste your money or time with this book. Ina May's Guide to a natural birth is not only extremely informative without the negativity, but SO SO wonderfully empowering. It left me looking forward to the labor experience and provided confidence to trust my body. Still the best pregnancy book I have read."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"While this book raises quite a few good points, some of the suggestions in it seem dangerous to me. &#34;Refuse ultrasounds to date the pregnancy and assign a due date&#34; Are you kidding me? What mother is going to refuse an ultrasound for ANY reason? &#34;Refuse tests unless it is a life-or-death situation&#34; Well, it seems to me that by the time most issues become life-or-death, that they could have been diagnosed and managed through ultrasounds! That aside, the book repeatedly trashes the medical community as &#34;ignorant and habitually endangering the natural process of labor and delivery.&#34;Aside from the handful of thought-provoking points, this book is dry and difficult to get through. I'm a medical student, and some of the terms I had to look up, either because they're too new or too old, or just plain confusing. It's an informative book, but I would not buy it again or recommend it to another expectant mother."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is incredibly well supported by tons of research, and roughly 1/3 of it is literature reviews for the research used. It's easy to read and ought to make women realize that childbirth is natural, their bodies were designed to give birth, and that the vast majority of women can have their babies without medical intervention. Birth in America is a travesty, most OBs don't know what normal birth looks like so they can't assist a woman in giving birth naturally. There's a reason that the US has such abominable birth stats - and that all the developed countries whose stats are much better use midwives for healthy women's prenatal care and births!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I really like this book, it is full of information on Hospital Birth and this book is what made me feel confident enough to switch to a Birth Center...The author is definitley one sided but it has a lot of stats and good information."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Horrible and outdated book. She needs to cite each point in the chapter instead of at the end of the book. Makes numerous assumptions without evidence to back it up. When you look up her sources, they often don't support what she claim's they support. She is obviously incredibly biased against obstetricians. Her opening argument that obstetrician-gynecologists are \\"trained to view pregnant and laboring women as a series of potential problems\\" is frankly BS. She lost all credibility in her opening paragraphs. Her supposed knowledge about the medical literature is laughable. A simple pubmed search will bring up numerous problems with her assumptions on each topic. It's obvious she selectively cite's to her advantage. I do not recommend if you are really searching for an unbiased and comprehensive guide."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a must read. Pregnant women in America are simply not informed of the risks (and degredations) of current obstetric practices: they are not informed of their options and their rights. American doctors intervene in 90% of pregnancies yet America ranks only 23rd among the nations of the world in good outcomes (both mother and baby healthy). Holland, in contrast, uses obstetricians only 30% of the time, in the cases when they are really needed and Holland ranks #1 among nations as the safest place to give birth. Read why. It's fascinating and ultimately empowering for women."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Henci Goer is a serious researcher, and her book is an information-packed work just right for anyone who wants to learn what they can do to help themselves have a better birth experience. When I was writing my own book, GIVING BIRTH: A Journey into the World of Mothers and Midwives, I was impressed with Goer's research skills both here and in her book Obstetrical Myths vs. Research Realities. This book is key reading for expectant moms who want to know what they'll be dealing with in labor and birth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book was very much against hospital births and epidurals. I didn't like that the author assumed every woman would want to birth HER WAY. An epidural birth can still be a very wonderful birth experience. I got to enjoy my medicated VBAC because I was not in any pain and I could concentrate on what I was there to do - push out and birth a baby. I know women who have done birthing both ways and they were successful either way you look at it. You can be a THINKING WOMAN and still have a wonderful epidural or hospital birth. Reading this book is fine if you want a home birth or an unmedicated birth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"After reading this book, it is alarming the medical risks pregnant woman are unknowingly taking in the United States. I learned what routine medical interventions can do more harm than good. Now my husband and I can make informed decisions with full understanding of the side effects before the overwhelming time of labor. The book explains that sometimes the cure is worse than the symptom. My only warning is that the book can be distressing for pregnant woman who may have limited options for the birth and that it may be helpful if the husband, a family member or friend read the book."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is clearly very thoroughly researched. Many books with similar information are presented anecdotally, while Henci Goer backs up all information with medical research (cited in the index). Perfect for the skeptic!

Detailed and backed up by many studies, Henci Goer covers the things your doctors probably won't. Insightful and helpful for making decisions about your birth and maternity care."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"While this book contains good information and cites many research studies (a significant portion of the book is devoted to documenting research), the author's tone seemed negative to me. Ms. Goer obviously has some hostile feelings towards the medical community, and as the book progressed, this became distracting to me. I much preferred &quot;The Birth Book,&quot; by William and Martha Sears, which contains similar information and outlines the same pros/cons, but manages to be very positive."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is great! It really answered a lot of questions regarding epidurals, IVs, and other medical procedures that are used during labor. I feel more educated about the decisions I have made for my birth plan."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"If you are pregnant or want to be, this is the single most important book you can read. You may or may not read it cover to cover, but it will provide you with the tools you need to make informed, research-based decisions about the birth you want. And in case you, like most thinking women, are reluctant to trust a single source, Goer provides all the information you need to check her sources and see the research for yourself."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to read more about labor and delivery and form my own conclusions on what is best for me. I quickly found that this book is full of propaganda on the part of the author to sway the reader over to her way of thinking.Now, some of the information I agree with but some of it I don't. And in none of the chapters is the reader presented with unbiased options or data from which to form her own opinions.This thinking woman was not impressed and did not find this book helpful. I would recommend revising the title to \\"If you're not sure what to think then I'll tell you...\\"."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I found this to be the most helpful book I read on labor and delivery. While I ended up having a C-section, (after baby was nearly 3 weeks later than due date) and never went into labor even after attempted induction, my feelings about the situation were much more accepting than they would have been had I not read this. I ended up choosing midwives for my childbirth care, and their c-section rate was about 7%. The OB I started with had a rate closer to 25%, something it took several questions to get her to reveal. All in all, it speaks to the need of health care to be viewed as something we are actively engaged in wtih our care providers, not as passive acceptors of decision making we are not part of. This can be applied to all aspects fo health care, not just childbirth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I love this book. The thing I liked best about this book is that Henci Goer presents the information well enough to allow the reader to form his/her own opinions and make their own decisions. She gives her opinion, but it is more of an information book. It is very readable and can either by read from front to back or can be understood and works well as a reference - skipping to the information you need."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I am a believer that doctor's are not Gods and that the medical profession is more about money than safety. I really enjoyed Henci's plain English. She just tells it how it is and allows you to make up your own mind. Her factual representation is phenomenal. I am happy to finally read something that just is rather than a &quot;sugar-coated, life's perfect&quot; novel about pregnancy and birth. A MUST READ for people who like to think on their own. And for people who know that women can do anything including give safe and healthy births without interference."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book was fantastic. I have been researching birth subjects for months, and while every book I've read has offered statistics and opinions, only Henci Goer's Thinking Woman's Guide has the complete references easily followed to back up her statements. Even items that hold 1 single paragraph in her book have back up documentation going right to the source. I was very impressed, and would reccomend this book to ANYONE who is trying to become more informed about the options available for birth, and their accompanied risks. Many \\"experts\\" (doctors/midwives/etc) will tell you what they need to in order to get you to aquiesce to their reccomendation, without proving their statements. Henci Goer gives you a fairly non-biased view of the entire spectrum of options... something you probably wont get from your local Ob/gyn."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Modern society treats pregnancy and birth as a disease meant to be cured, not as the natural process of bringing forth a child. This book empowers women by providing them with information that enables them to make their own decisions regarding their care.By citing extensive research and her own experiences, Ms. Goer enables women to take the information available and weigh it carefully so as to make the best possible decisions for their own situations.An excellent resource for any woman who would like to take control of her birth experience and properly educate herself with the facts about labor and delivery."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book too biased in my opinion, even for me who am planning a natural, non-medicated birth next month. It makes it sound like you or your baby will die if you chose to use medication during birth, I have witnessed several amazing and uncomplicated epidural assisted births, so I use it just if I want to look up something specific, not a cover to cover read. I feel like the combo of \\"Natural Hospital Birth\\" and \\"Active Birth\\" would be all that I needed to read to feel really excited, prepared and confident for my natural birth process. Also working on reading Ina May's book, as well as Birthing From Within, but i still think the other two would have been enough"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a WONDERFUL resource not only for pregnant women, but also any childbirth educators, doulas, monitrices, midwives, and dare I say some more open-minded OBs... The information is presented clearly and fairly. She does occasionally insert her opinion, but all the facts back her up anyway-so obviously her opinions are based on fact, not myth, hearsay, propoganda, or fear. Someone who may find this book biased may just not be ready to accept facts and statistics that go against myth and popular belief (and what the billion dollar health industry wants you to believe.)"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I am planning a VBAC for May 2010. This book could just as easily be entitled \\"How to Avoid a C-Section in a U.S. Hospital Birth.\\" It has tons of really important information. My only critique is that on the chapter that addresses VBAC, the information on prostaglandins needs to be updated.I can see from other reviews that some women are put off by the natural childbirth bias of the book. I will say that, even if you're not down with the idea of \\"natural childbirth,\\" you still need this information if you want to avoid ending up with a c-section. I went into my first birth with an open mind, planning on a natural birth but open to interventions if needed. I ended up with the classic \\"cascade of interventions\\" ending with an unnecessary c-section.My advice would be to read this book as one of several books you read to prepare for childbirth. If you want to plan for pain relief, you can use information in this book to find out how to use pain relief in the \\"best\\" way (the way that makes it less likely to cause you to need pitocin and, subsequently, a c-section.)Really important for all mothers to know: labors are all different. You may have a fast, dramatic birth or one that the early labor lasts a few days or a week. When you're prepared with information, you're most likely to get the birth you want. Even if you trust your doctor, you don't want to trust your birth to your doctor. Be aware of which obstetric policies are truly helpful and necessary, and which are just based on out-of-date information and doctor's convenience. This book is one resource to help you do that. Another is watching the film, \\"The Business of Being Born.\\""},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I'm recommending this book as an alternative to \\"What to Expect...\\" It's written for a more intelligent audience, as the title implies, and it gives the evidence with the idea that the pregnant woman should be armed with information to make her own decisions. If you're not inclined to just trust doctors, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is not the best book to read straight through unless you're already a birth junkie. However, it is a GREAT reference resource. Each chapter covers a different choice/option during birth, taking a detailed look at why you might not want to make the current \\"standard\\" choices. What I really love is that every single fact is cited with a medical study listed in the appendices."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Few people have read the obstetric research as thoroughly as Henci Goer. If you're pregnant and want to really understand the pros and cons of obstetric procedures, you'll find the information you need here. You'll also learn about options many people aren't aware of. If you are studying to be a doctor, nurse, midwife, doula, or childbirth educator, or if you're writing about obstetrics,this book will save you many hours of research. Need an overview or a citation? Start here. I'm always amazed at this wealth of information, and it costs less than you'd pay for a single pound of fancy coffee!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a wonderful book because Henci Goer is honest and thorough in her presentation of the facts. Every fact she introduces she backs up with the actual study in the back of the book. This makes this a great book for men who 'need the proof.' She is not jaded against OBs, she is just clear about how they do business and their business is hurtful to healthy moms and babies that trust them. She has the research to back it up.I am a mother of four and currently expecting my fifth and have walked a long journey from highly medicated, dangerous, hospital births to quiet, peaceful, sacred home births. I have experienced much sadness and anger at having my birthing rights removed from me in a hostile hospital environment, and have experienced the triumph of laboring in my own home, protecting those rights and choices, and delivering my sweet baby into my husband's hands. I urge all first time expecting mothers and fathers and those who are not first timers, but unhappy with their past experiences, to give their next delivery as much thought, planning, and research as they would for a home or car purchase!!This is the perfect book for expectant mothers to read because it will tell them the FACTS that their precious OB will never tell them. This book will open your eyes wide about the dangerous hospital protocols that are 'standard' in nearly every hospital in America and explain how the majority of all 'things that go wrong' in a typical hospital birth can be directly linked to unnecessary medical intervention.If you are really serious about having a healthy and happy labor/delivery for yourself and your baby then this book should be the first you pick up!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I got this book at the recommendation of a friend who delivered all 3 of her children at home. As most people living in the US, I had biases about pursuing a natural birth, thinking that a hospital birth is a much safer way to go. Anyhow, whether one is a proponent of natural birth or otherwise, every woman has to be informed. However for those who support traditional obstetric management style especially need to know what it is they trust, and this is exactly what this book offers: pure, unbiased, research-based information. The choice is yours, but please, don't let your care-giver (your Doc or midwife) do the thinking for you.P.S. In line with the book goes a documentary called The Business Of Being Born"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is one of the most informative I have come across in regard to birth choices and practices... Although a bit American focused, still relevant to other developed countries. If every woman read this book I am sure there would be a massive shift in thinking about childbirth as less of a medicalised event, and more as the natural biological and emotional process that it is. A bit of a heavier read than other pregnancy/birth books but still understandable. Excellent overall and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Although we read every other birth book, my wife and I didn't read Henci Goer's book until after our first son's birth. Although we were thrilled with our son, the actual birth process was very disappointing and upsetting -- we felt railroaded into a series of events that culminated, inevitably, in C-section. Goer's book reassured us and reinforced our instincts, and spelled out for us exactly how and why that railroading occurred. She isn't militant or condemning, but explains the process from the point of view of the physicians, hospitals, nurses and other healthcare entities, and points out how their agendas don't always perfectly dovetail with the wishes of the person giving birth. I am an acupuncturist now, and am frequently involved in my patients' fertility and birthing issues -- Henci Goer's book is the only one that I tell all these patients they should read."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I read this book before giving birth to my second child. In my experience, the picture Goer paints of the US health system is an accurate one. I think every woman should be prepared with the information to make an informed decision, and this book helps to provide that. Bear in mind though, that most Dr's don't like to face informed questions from a patient..."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This is a great book for those who haven't decided how they'd like to give birth, and are exploring their choices. There is very accurate information and resources with links to the research. Very helpful for anyone who likes to look into the actual studies. For anyone who has already done research into natural birth, and made the decision to birth naturally, this book can feel redundant at times. Otherwise, extremely informative, great book that advocates natural birth choices."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I downloaded this ebook for free and I find it SO informational. I like to be well informed and as my husband and I plan to have children in the near future, I know I will be turning to this book more and more. If you found this book interesting, you should also check out the movie The Business of Being Born. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I originally borrowed this book from a friend, and decided it was worth buying. I'm 8 months pregnant with my first child and want to know as much as I can about labor, delivery and birth. This book presents good information straight forward with little hedging. She begins with her basic assumptions and what she understands a doctor's and hospital's basic assumptions to be. She addresses a variety of topics, and the table of contents is organized so that it is easy to find the chapter you want. I'll have to come back and supplement my review after I have my baby -- I'm sure a look back with be more informed than the look forward."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"With so much misinformation out there about pregnancy and childbirth, it is refreshing to get a look at the research and reasons behind those things that are common place in American birth. Full of statistical information, risks and benefits, and things to consider- this book offers the chance to really be informed about the choices you make during pregnancy and childbirth. Many of the technology that we find to be routine has been proven unnecessary, some even more harmful than helpful, yet if you don't know, you can't choose any better. This book offers the information needed to begin making better decisions, not about birth in general, but about your birth experience. I highly recommend this book to women (and their partners) to make fully informed choices during childbirth. Childbirth may not always go as we plan, but there is no reason we cannot go into it fully informed of all our options."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"One of the most frustrating things about buying and reading parenting or pregnancy books has been the proseltizing, condescening, and dogmatic views so many authors take. Parenting books would have you believe any other parenting method than their own is tantamount to child abuse. Pregnancy books would have you believe drinking a Coke or dying your hair should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This book is the same - OB/GYNs are money grubbers who compromise what is best for mothers and babies, while midwives are all-knowing, altruistic souls who always do the right thing. The author makes no bones about it in the introduction. The author does quote studies, but uses studies showing negative benefit of some action or treatment to argue that the opposite must be superior - lack of data be damned. If you want a \\"thinking\\" guide, look elsewhere. If you need reassurance that \\"natural\\" childbirth is gonna make you and your baby superior to everyone else, go nuts with this one."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Thought most of the insights presented in this book were too negative, and one sided.I'd recommend not reading this, unless you're sure that all of your opinions will be the same as the authors."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"The author has a great deal of knowledge in the area of childbirth, but has a very clinical view, which is a real put-off. At the same time, the book scares the reader when it comes to C-sections. I'm certainly not a C-section advocate, but I also realize that sometimes a C-section may be necessary. As a woman who is simply educating myself before becoming pregnant, this book gave me second thoughts about it all the way around! I would not recommend this book under any circumstance to first time mothers or those who have a medical condition which requires a C-section - a much better read would be Birthing From Within by Pam England."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is helpful if you are looking for for a biased viewpoint on childbirth but it is NOT AT ALL PHILOSOPHICAL!The book is over at page p.218 out of the 364 total because the rest of the pages are literature summaries of the articles the author uses to support her opinions. The book will not give a pregnant thinking woman a collection of facts or information from which to draw her own educated conclusions which is what I expected based on the title.I was shocked to discover,after reading the book, that the title seems to be a refernce to the self-importance of the author, as in \\"I am a thinking woman and this is my guide.\\" In this sense the title is insulting as it imples that women cannot draw their own conclusions based on unbiased information and she must shove her conclusions down our throats.I found all her compare and contrast tables to be archaic as they don't apply to the midwife care or hospital situations available to me. Things are not that black and white where I live!!! Visit your local hospitals before you beleive that the nurses will keep your baby away from you and interfere with your breast feeding, bonding etc. Check with midwives in your area before assuming they are not medical professionals and prohibited from attending to you in delivery and catching your baby in a hospital!The book is barely useful as a very general tool to read about how beneficial doulas are and how cesareans are often unnecessary etc."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I got mostly through the intro of this book and was immediately infuriated. I sent this book right back to the store.In the intro, it says natural is better, breast is best, I am not going to pretend that my goal is anything other than to convert you to my way of thinking. So hello? Who exactly IS this thinking woman? I don't think it's the reader because it sounds like they will be told what to think, period, end of story. I do not appreciate condescending tones in informational books. They make it emotional when I am purely in search of facts. It's true, I have never done this before and I am not an expert. But at the same time, I am not an idiot. I can read and comprehend. I can participate in discussions and form my own opinions and beliefs. Thanks for being straightforward with me, but I didn't buy this book to see one point of view. I bought it to see what my options were. I firmly believe there is no one right answer to all of this, and I would like the leeway to see all the answers in a factual way to decide what I want to do. I will do the best I can, but I will not be put into a mold, thank you very much! Not any mold. Not the modern woman's \\"give me drugs now\\" mold, and not the natural woman's \\"hypnobirthing\\" mold, probably not Bradley or Lamaze either. I will decide what to pursue after I am finished gathering information.I feel like it is CRUCIAL for women to get an overview of the various methods and to select a strategy based on whether it is something within their personality to do. Otherwise, I feel like it will be a waste of time when everything goes down as one will have to work as hard to \\"do the method\\" while already be working hard to get babies out.I would not recommend this book if you are on the lookout for multi-faceted, non-biased, factual information. Intead, check out \\"The Birth That's Right for You\\" by Amen Ness. That book really gives you the lowdown on the birth process and a lot of different points of view on how women might cope based on their personality. It isn't a side-by-side comparison on the different methods, but it is a realistic starting point and is chock full of information to better help a woman understand what she is in for."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I got this book as a gift. Was extremely put off by the author's biased opinion. She goes as far to say that female doctors in obstetrics just follow the male herd's opinion and have no mind of their own. If you have a mind of your own, get a different book - one that will lay out both sides of the argument in a non-biased manner. Also, be mindful of the fact that the information concerning obstetrics in the book is at least 15 years out of date."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book was not what I thought is would be. It was extremely one sided---siding with the author, very opinionated and extremely anti-medical. I ended up returning it because I thought it was awful and couldn't reason wasting the money."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I have had this book recommended to me quite a few times, so I picked it up. I have to say, that this book does a good job of trying to insure that the woman will not only &quot;think&quot;, but be frightened of anything done by an OB or in a hospital during pregnancy and childbirth. If all Obstetricans are really this horrid and unfeeling, that they would willingly impose tons of dangerous and unnecessary procedures on women- why are so many women still going to an OB and delivering at a hospital? Why are the majority electing for pain meds? This is just another book in a long line of books that assume that women today are just sheep who have no common sense what-so-ever, and that all would jump at the chance at a painful natural birth in their house if only they &quot;knew&quot;. This book also can drive a wedge of mistrust and suspicion between a woman and her doctor, leading her to not take the doctor's knowledgable advice or to refuse something in labor that can actually help, or force her to &quot;grit her teeth&quot; in pain through labor because she is so scared of the meds that can help. I for one, chose a doctor I feel is trustworthy who cares about me and my baby."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As a pregnant woman, this is the first book I purchased about birthing. The title is misinformative, as it suggests that the guide will empower women to make educated, informed birthing plan decisions. I am not disputing that the author's facts are accurate and useful, but has she ever had training on how to present a persuasive argument? I am relatively unknowledgeable in the arena of birthing, as this is my first pregnancy &amp; my first birthing book - so I cannot even begin to take such a biased &quot;argument&quot; (if that is what you could even call it), seriously! This author is &quot;going against the grain&quot; of what most people know about the medical community, and in order to dispute something of this magnitude (e.g. the entire medical community &amp; their practices in obstetrics), you better be a trusted expert and present your argument as such. Admitting a bias is not enough to persuade me to take this book as fact. Like previous reviewers, I was distracted by the persistent angry and doctor-bashing tone of the book. This book would have been far more effective had it acknowledged where the medical community is succeeding. Or is it failing miserably in all areas of obstetrics? This book provides not one instance (that I read, granted... I got irritated &amp; didn't finish the book) of how the medical community in general is getting things right. I find that hard to believe."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I had initially bought it thinking that I would get facts, but instead I found that it is based on someone's opinions about how they feel everyone should give birth. I would like to get my $10 if it were possible since it was a waste of money that went against my beliefs."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"There is good information in here, but the tone and material is VERY biased. I really wish I'd paid more heed to the reviews that mentioned this before buying. I am planning a natural, unmedicated birth and did glean some useful information from this book. However, the author's view on western medicine and OB/GYN standards are unabashedly negative.Some discussion of situations where intervention really is needed would have been quite helpful. The author lists many reasons why common labor/birth interventions are often unnecessary, but glosses over real situations where those interventions prevent serious complications with mother and baby. I certainly agree with the other reviewers who find the title rather misleading. In my opinion, a true \\"thinking woman\\" is perfectly capable of assessing opposing viewpoints for herself to determine what's best for her body and her baby. Of course, it's great to do research and read books like this so that you are informed and don't just follow medical recommendations blindly without understanding potential drawbacks. However, this book really felt like fear-mongering anti-establishment propaganda at times.I would also agree with the reviewer(s) who mentioned that anyone who reads primary research literature on a regular basis is going to be driven nuts by the lack of in-text citations. It's great that the author includes an annotated bibliography of her fairly extensive research. However, the sweeping statements and more specific references to studies are a bit tough to swallow without the actual reference/citation listed in the paragraph or sentence."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer is an informative, comprehensive book that all pregnant women and their partners should read. The information presented in this book is organized in such a way as to make it understandable and easily comprehensible. The author is very thorough in including all of the information needed to make an educated decision on issues such as choosing a caregiver or labor assistant, hospital or homebirth, and such important decisions as induction, episiotomy, electronic fetal monitor and many others. Ms. Goer outlines the basic information on such subjects and backs up her information at the back of the book with statistical information and the results of various studies on each subject. Although she makes it clear that she is a proponent for natural homebirth, she honestly and objectively presents the pros and cons of each topic to allow Mother's to make their own decisions.This book lays out the information in a matter of fact manner using non-judgmental language with opinions by the author respectfully and tactfully included. I found the information in this book likely to be inspiring to pregnant women that they indeed have the ability to empower themselves to make informed choices and insist on the quality of care they deserve. Ms. Goer sheds light on the effects of many commonly routine procedures that many women and their partners think of as helpful but are actually harmful to the mother and baby. I like that she backs up all of her information in the back of her book as this supports her theories, information, and personal opinions making them more credible. The Thinking Woman's Guide will be a source I am sure I will refer to many times in my Childbirth career and I will surely recommend it as a must read to all of my clients, friends and family. I wish I could give it 10 stars."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"While the author definately has a very strong opinion on her subject, I believe she does a very good job of backing up her statements with numerous studies and statistics. After a very disappointing birth experience with my first child, which ended with a C-section, reading this book gave me the knowledge and courage to leave my OB and hospital in the fifth month of my second pregnancy. This book focuses mainly on interventions such as pitocin, fetal monitoring, epidurals, etc., and there links to complications and c-sections. I would recommend this book to any healthy women that believes that childbirth is a natural process that should not be interfered with unless medically necessary."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"In all fairness, I do find the tone of this book distrustful and antagonistic toward general o.b. practices in this country. But the info is valuable, illuminating, and aided me in my decision to go natural. I should add that hypnobirthing techniques aided me even more, and helped me stay a little more positive (I'm naturally sort of negative).The surgeon/reviewer below is a great example of what I fear about doctors (male or female, and I've got several drs in the family). What he does for a living (refurbish women's 'damaged' vaginas) means that he's right and vaginal birth's a bad way to go? End of discussion. Wow. Life's too short, friend. I'm glad I chose a better man than you."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"In short, my first delivery was basically abuse at the hands of an OB. Had my sister not gone through a terrible C-section ordeal, I'm sure that I would have ended up with one and not know the true, life-long cost of that.Thanks to this book, I am having a home birth with my second baby. And no, I am not a granola hippie. I drink Coke and eat french fries. But I refuse to spend an important, vulnerable time fighting off one intervention after another. In the hospital, you may escape without a million interventions, but you will have to fight each battle one or more times, and you'll know that everybody thinks you are a pain in the ass. After reading this research you'll know you're right to avoid many procedures, but you'll still get treated like an idiot. And that is why I am going off the reservation."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Over 1/3 of the book was dedicated to the research given toward maternity care. The research is overwhelmingly negative toward OB practices....I disagree with alot of the post that gave it a lower rating that reporting these research findings as fact can be misconstrued as not \\"balanced, relatively objective discussion.\\" It's not fair to make the author seem biased when she's just reporting the facts. She can't help that the research most obviously points out that generally speaking, OB practices are completely based on opinion, pride, fear, and intimidation. Finding an OB that is actually willing to talk with you for more than 15 minutes is difficult and if you've found one...you've got a rare gem.The book is excellent for those who have decided to give birth naturally because it gives complete basis for such a choice. But I also feel that it highlights things that are not discussed for people that never gave it a single thought.....like most traditional patients.I also recommend any books on the Bradley Method."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I do like this book. I am pro homebirth etc IF that is what the mother wants, most of all, I am pro birthing choice.Anyway, I didn't find the book was telling me what to think, it was giving me information, I could either take that information or ignore it, simple really.I would much rather have some idea about birth and the intervenions including the possible side effects and go into labour informed, rather than go into labour having no idea about things or only the basics and wonder why x, y and z went wrong (unfortunutely, due to unnecessary interventions, my first birth was pretty damned rotten, I wish I had had this book back then).Anyway, read the book (in its entirety) and use the information as you best see fit."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I loved this book.The research is a little out of date, because it was published in 1999 (and it frequently cites sources from the early 90s), but from what I know of c-section and induction statistics, it is still very relevant.The author is very biased, but she admits it. (And her studies back her up! Anyone else read the appendices?) But I didn't feel like her biases overwhelmed her research. She even included sections about how to make make interventions more comfortable for yourself if you end up needing them. Meaning, she acknowledged that sometimes certain procedures (c-sections, epidurals, induction, etc) are necessary, and there are ways to make the experience easier on yourself. I found that very comforting and empowering.In short, I guess this book isn't for everyone. My doctor-trusting mom wouldn't like it, for instance. However, if you question medical professionals, especially when it comes to women's health, or want a completely natural birth and don't know if you'll be able to get one in a hospital, read this book. Knowledge is power."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is informative but it's so pro-natural childbirth that it tends to totally discount medical science and interventions. Although I feel childbirth should be a natural process and that modern medicine can interfere (mainly with precautionary measures), I still appreciate the necessity and value of obstetrics and medical doctors. Parts of this book are so extreme it seems as if the author feels obstetrics is a ridiculous and unnecessary medical field. It really turned me off to the book as a whole. It also seems that some parts were written to frighten people and make them suspicious of their physician/health care professionals, which I don't think is helpful or healthy. Other parts, however, are very informative and help you understand your options to help achieve natural childbirth. I think the book is helpful, but proceed with an open mind. . . and caution."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"This book is phenomenal. It is so well written, wonderfully structured, fascinating & not difficult to understand. In addition to details on the risks of certain procedures, the book includes helpful facts on how to improve your own outcome.Goer says she is \\"biased\\" towards natural birth & that made me reluctant to purchase the book at first. However, I think she's wrong - I don't consider that a \\"bias\\". That is like saying a nutritionist is \\"biased\\" towards eating fruits & veggies! Her \\"bias\\" towards natural birth is based on FACT, not personal opinion... *unnecessary* interventions carry risks that natural birth does not have. It's just fact.READ UP!!!! OBs are still doing dumb, senseless things like telling women they can't drink during labor. Even world-class hospitals, such as Johns Hopkins Bayview here in Baltimore, still does this. FIND OUT what the policies are & select a caregiver who practices based on the SCIENCE... not tradition! I'm so glad I did. (& switched out of Hopkins.)"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I found this book to be thorough and informative, with a couple of drawbacks. The statistics quoted to provide creedence to arguments was dated - some data was from the 1980's - so I tended to check some of the points made on the internet to better understand the hospital stats as they are now. Also, the author, while passionate, is really quite biased against established hospital proceedures. I agreed with her almost unilaterally, but found myself dismissing her more radical opinions as I would those of an unyielding aunt. I recommend this book nevertheless. Based on some of the author's comments I had a very constructive conversation with my care-giver and as a result feel much more confident that my needs will be met."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"A previous reviewer stated: &quot;The author is much too eager to heap blame and criticism upon the medical profession. &quot;That's only because they deserve it. I'm glad you had an excellent birth, but your story alone is anecdotal evidence isn't it? This book provides the scientific proof. This is not a 'touchy-feely' newage birth book. This is hard core scientific research. Does the author have a bias? Yes. But the question is why? Because study after study have shown that modern obstetrics is missing the point and ignoring the research -- and women and babies are suffering for it."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Henci Goer has provided the information needed in very readable terms for all women to have a better birth. Backed with extensive research, Goer clears up common misconceptions and obstetrical myths that are running rampant in childbirth in this country. As a childbirth educator, advocate and Labor Support Doula I would recommend this book to all pregnant women. Early in pregnancy most people want to read about pregnancy, thinking they've got months to go to read up on birth issues. This book really should be read early. If you read nothing else, read this!

Readers should be aware that this book is also very out of date (written in 1999). Many of the quoted literature is even older."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I recall having strong feelings of anger and frustrations after reading the book. What I gleaned from the book is distrust towards doctors; that western medicine and the people who work in hospitals are dangerous, untrustworthy, and only mindful of $$.. I've been in the field for the last 12 years working on the L&D; unit. I've seen the changes and evolving of western medicine take on birthing. Our doctors and nurses are continually educating themselves, attending conferences held by midwives, and doulas. Our nursing staff's are a mix of people with doula and midwifery experiences. We frequently have LM referrals because home births did not go as planned. Once they arrive, anything that we suggest, we meet with such resistance, distrust and even disdain! I swear it's because they (patient, doula) read this book! Empowering?! I think not! What a disservice this book has done to women.I myself gave birth both times naturally. I am an advocate for laboring and birthing naturally, but understands the need for intervention is sometimes necessary. The C-section rate is climbing, but so is the rise in high risk pregnancy; women who have chronic kidney failure, CF, high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertention, diabetes, serious heart conditions, who 10years ago was told they can never get pregnant or they would not survive the stress and trauma of pregnancy and birth.I was given this book 7 years ago and the information in this book is at least 10years old and way out of date and full of inaccuracies. I cannot reiterate how this book is not only biased against hospitals and the staffs, it contains outdated materials and Misinformation (where are her footnotes?). I would have given this book 0 stars! It is crucial to understand, open your heart, and have an open mind, be flexible. Know that having a child, your life will be forever taking unexpected turns; pregnancy, and labor is just getting you to practice adaptation. Be at peace with the path that has led you to having your babe in your arms. Critical thinking involves looking at all points. If you want a fair picture of hospital birth, and what to expect without all the scare tactics, please read Penny Simkins, Dr. Sears, Ina May, anyone, but Goer!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"There is so much to learn about childbirth that you will never hear from your Dr. or the Hospital. I highly recommend this book for any woman who would like to be able to make her own choices on her birth experience. You DO NOT need to be treated like an ill paitent and do what your Dr. tells you. In this case, they do not know best. There are many potential complications with the medical procedures and drugs they can provide. You can actually have a better, shorter, safer labor and delivery than you would have ever imagined if you do it naturally. This book will also introduce you to the role of the Doula birth partner if you don't already know how a Doula can help you make child birth a POSITIVE experience, rather than just another disappointing horror story to share with other mothers. Along with this book, you should at least read &quot;Birthing from Within&quot; and you should take a childbirth class other than Lamazze. Imagery Birthing, Hypnobirthing or the Bradley Method are all mother/child friendly techniques that help you understand how your body works and what it needs to do during labor and delivery. It's a way of making the pain bearable as it works to deliver your baby. It can be a positive experience as you will learn. Good luck to all you expectant moms and dads!"},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"I searched for books that would give me objective information using numbers and not opinions. I found most pregnancy books disagree with the statistical data. Do editors think women are too stupid for research? This book was great.

I hope there are fifty books like this in the future."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"As a Birth Doula and Childbirth Educator I recommed this book as a resource to my clients when they are looking for a good information based book.Henci Goer clearly shows concise information backed by medical and evidence based studies. She is a natural birth advocate, which she admits, and honestly states her biases. There certainly isn't anything wrong with that; it is her book and she isn't making up the facts or stating untruths, it's all in the evidence.A few reviews took offense to her tone and her biases and I found it very interesting how defensive a few people felt when reading the book. Ms. Goer does not have a &quot;natural birth at all costs&quot; attitude, although it is apparent that some readers took her opionions as such. She states the hard facts that are seen every day in every hospital in the United States; they are facts that not everyone wants or is able to hear.Ms. Goer is not trying to scare women about invasive medical procedures. The fact is that procedures like inductions, epidurals, vacuum extractions, episiotomies and cesarean surgeries are scary all on their own, and women should know all of the information about these procedures before pursuing them.The reality of it all is that not everyone wants to have an un-medicated or natural experience; and that is absolutely their choice. It is important that they have all of the information in order to make their choice an informed one about their bodies, their babies, and their births; this book gives women the information they need."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"...even if you aren't an advocate for natural birth. Though the author does have a bias towards birthing being as natural and unmedicated as possible, it is with good reason.I admit that I share her bias, though I'm going to remove my cape here and say that I believe it is more important for women to be informed about their birthing choices than to agree with me personally. I don't believe doctors tell women in enough detail what the risks or benefits are of any procedure or intervention. This book fills a large hole where the medical community may have forgotten or failed to mention something that might have otherwise made the woman's decision truly informed.Whatever your position on birth, this book is a worthwhile read, for the vast and heavily-supported information on the choices and options women have in childbirth."},{"Title":"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth","review":"Henci Goer's is the book recommended to any woman who needs an introduction to the pros and cons of birthing in a hospital using the medical model (OB is always right, epidural, episiotomy, c-section, etc). She is comprehensive, as you can tell from the Table of Contents. For every issue under the sun, she presents pros and cons. Although her only scientific background is her bachelor's degree and an unusual amount of reading on the subject, you do feel that she knows what she's talking about, in general. She has a bias, but she admits it upfront: she wants you to be afraid of turning your body over to a medical system that doesn't trust it and doesn't trust you, either.The problem with the book, what makes the first 80% of it so utterly unreadable to me, is how she presents her content. She divides the book into \\"prose\\" and \\"science.\\" The last 20% of the book is all of the journal citations and her reviews of particular articles and their conclusions. The vast majority of thousands of journal articles she cites are all from reputable scientific journals, and that part of the book is worth the purchase price.However, the first 80% of the book is without footnotes. When she makes a statement, she'll say something like \\"studies indicate...\\" or \\"research shows...\\" without indicating what studies and which research. Not all research is good research. Further, without a specific citation, I cannot go back and double check her conclusions against the original research. This is a very unorthodox approach and smacks of not wanting to be proven incorrect on any of her points.If you're not a particularly critical reader of scientific research, this book will be perfect for you. But if you have any kind of scientific background or are a critical reader, I would read the last 20% of the book and leave the text to the others."},{"Title":"Doing the Right Thing: A Real Estate Practitioner's Guide to Ethical Decision Making","review":"Deb Long really knows her stuff, and she makes a strong case for a renewed sense of ethics in the real estate industry.

Richard Ellman is no longer with us, but this is a monument of Yeats biography and criticism, the book which all subsequent biographers try to rewrite. The text itself, written as it was amidst a flurry of uncollected papers in the forties and with the co-operation of W.B.'s widow George, is understandably reticent about some elements of the poet's private life, notably his early lovers and extra-marital affairs; but the introduction printed with this new edition fills in many of the blanks, and gives the reasoning for Ellman's assertion that Yeats's affair with Maud Gonne was indeed finally consummated, confirming a suspicion hitherto based only on ambiguous references in letters and the poem 'A Man Young and Old'. Most of all, however, it is Ellman's sensitive and insightful treatment of Yeats's at once shy and self-possessed nature that impresses; the writer will never have a more accurate critic, and the man never a more sincere and biting appraisal of his contradictions. This is the place to start if you are interested in Yeats: you may not find the book or the man that you were expecting, an easy dreamy life of lost women and lake isles, but the portrait is truer, and the artistic genius more clearly delineated than in any other book on the subject, and there have been many. Ellman went on to write the definitive lives of James Joyce and Oscar Wilde; that his first essay in literary biography stands comparison with these is its own testament."},{"Title":"Yeats, the man and the masks (A Dutton everyman paperback)","review":"Ellmann was only 30 when he published this in 1948, less than 10 years after Yeats's death; he was the first biographer to see Yeats's papers in their chaotic entirety. What an astounding job! You'd think this would read like a warm-up for his later magisterial biographies of Joyce and Wilde, but \\"The Man and the Masks\\" holds its own against those works, giving a sensitive, economical portrait of an unusually fractured poet.Ellmann stresses Yeats's life-long effort to forge his thoughts into a unified system in the teeth of inbred skepticism, shyness and vacillation. He draws a discreet curtain over the sexual parts of Yeats's life but compensates with a keen understanding of the courage it took for this diffident, ill-read & dreamy man to make himself by fits and starts into a modern poet. My favorite parts of the book were the sections where Ellmann compares earlier drafts of the poems to the printed versions, showing just how hard-won Yeats's genius was. He tempers a critical eye towards Yeats's excesses--the wild mysticism, the Fascist sympathies, the arrogant public demeanor--with an understanding of Yeats's deep need for masks. According to Ellmann, Yeats's theories and systems weren't dogmas so much as postures he assumed to fulfill his own desire for a certainty of belief he never quite attained. Ellmann shows how that drive shaped the poems and ultimately rescued them from the deadness certitude would have brought. A classic study and an excellent starting-point for further reading on Yeats's life and work."},{"Title":"Yeats, the man and the masks (A Dutton everyman paperback)","review":"Ellmann was both a masterful biographer and first- rate literary critic. In this early book he writes an excellent account of the life of Yeats, and combines with an overall analysis of Yeats' literary development. He probes deeply into the symbolic and mythic meaning of Yeats' poetry and provides for the lay-reader a key to this often complex poetry's, understanding.Ellmann would go on later to write his much larger masterpiece , the biography of Joyce- but here as a young man he shows a surprising depth of understanding of the full range of Yeats' problems through his remarkable creative, and not easy personal, life."},{"Title":"Yeats, the man and the masks (A Dutton everyman paperback)","review":"The reviews quoted inside the front cover point out that Professor Ellmann's book is a critical biography and not a popular one, an apt distinction, as many of the fascinating events and facts of Yeats's life are sparsely covered. On the first page the book refers to W.B. Yeats as \\"The poet of Shadows,\\" and it goes on to explore Yeats's many dualities, whether between \\"the man and the masks\\" or reality and dream or the artist and the art. Yeats was a consummate artist who won the Nobel Prize for literature and was publicly active in many important issues of his time, such as Irish nationalism and the Irish cultural renaissance. On the other hand, he was a gullible man who believed in seances, automatic writing, and spiritualism, and the sections of the book on these aspects of his life make for tedious, soporific reading.Because he was writing a critical biography and first published it in 1948, Professor Ellmann gives short shrift to some fundamentally important aspects of Yeats's life, such as his many women and sexual confusion. For a livelier and more knowledgeable presentation (from the 1980's) on these aspects, see Ellmann's chapter on Yeats in \\"Four Dubliners,\\" entitled \\"W.B. Yeats's Second Puberty.\\"Ellmann also makes errors that illustrate how out of date the book now is. For example, Maud Gonne was the great love of Yeats's life and was intertwined \\"with all his thought and action during his youth,\\" page 241. W.B. Yeats proposed to her many times, but was refused. When he was about 50 years old and determined to be married, he proposed to Gonne again and was refused again. \\"[H]e then became infatuated with her beautiful adopted niece, Iseult,\\" page 222, who also refused him. Iseult was in reality Maud Gonne's illegitimate daughter, and for Ellmann not to know (or state) such a crucial fact diminishes his credibility. Of course, this mistake may be partially the result of the book originally being published only nine years after Yeats died and Ellmann receiving valuable help from Maud Gonne MacBride and Iseult (Mrs. Francis Stuart), as he acknowledged in the Preface."},{"Title":"Yeats, the man and the masks (A Dutton everyman paperback)","review":"\\"Yeats: The Man and The Masks\\" (1979, W.W. Norton & Co., New York) by Richard Ellman is a landmark study of the greatest poet of the twentieth century. As a literary biography, it does far more to explain how Yeats continually recreated himself as a poet than would a mere historical biography only full of facts. First published in 1948, this book is based on the unlimited access Yeats' widow gave Ellman to literally thousands of unpublished papers in the decade after the poet's death, and is full of keen philosophical insight into the poet's life and writings.Yeats' life and poetry were most influenced by two people - firstly by his father, who consciously sought to educate and shape him into a poet, and secondly by the woman who became the great love of his life. John Butler Yeats was a minor artist of the Victorian period who, although he could never quite achieve the visions he set for himself as a painter, was a great lover of the arts, and imparted his creative gifts to all his children. His was a very strong personality, and it dominated the family like an iron glove. Although they did not get along well in his formative years, Yeats acknowledged his father's very positive impact on his life and ideas in later years. Maud Gonne, on the other hand, was Yeats' partner in many of his early plans and schemes to resurrect Irish nationalism, theatre, and literature. He fell desperately in love with this tall, wild woman, but she never requited that love and broke his heart repeatedly. He pursued her for over a decade, and when she married another it looked at first as if he would never recover. But Yeats did survive, and his poetry was much richer for the experience of loving, and eventually outgrowing the self-absorbed Maud Gonne.Some poets prefer simplicity and are not overly complicated, being fond of wine, woman, and song. But Yeats (who definitely loved the first two, but had no ear at all for music) was a complex man of immense yearnings and dreams, and involved himself in numerous movements and causes throughout his life. He was, first and foremost, one of the driving forces behind the Irish literary renaissance. He was also the co-founder of Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which had an immense impact on drama by providing a place for Irish playwrights \\"to bring upon the stage the deeper emotions of Ireland.\\" He was an Irish Nationalist who dreamed of an Ireland independent of Britain, but who thought that violence was not the solution. He later came to see the that the \\"terrible beauty\\" of the Irish Easter Rebellion of 1916 was, in fact, a bloody means to a greater end. Yeats was also a magician and mystic who enthusiastically joined Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical Society, and later was an early member of the Order of the Golden Dawn - a Rosicrucian/Masonic-style occult society devoted to raising its members' consciousness to higher levels.The Golden Dawn drew upon the Western kabbalistic and esoteric traditions, and his involvement had a great influence on both Yeats the Man and Yeats the Poet. For instance, he experimented with s&eacute;ances and automatic writing as a means of contacting the spirits he believed helped him unlock his latent powers as a poet and a magician. But his great breakthrough came after he married the patient and witty Georgie Hyde-Lees (whom he called George) as he neared his fiftieth year. It was Mrs. Yeats' great gift for automatic writing, and well as Yeats' dogged persistence, that allowed him to develop his system of symbols, and to become a far deeper poet than the simple lyricist he had been in his youth. Yeats' poetic vision of masks, his gyres (pronounced with a hard \\"g\\") - whirling spirals shaped like two intersecting triangles, his belief in his daimones (spirit guides or perhaps even muses), and his phases of the moon corresponding to levels of human awareness all sound very odd indeed and make one wonder if he was not mad. These ideas combined, however, to take his poetry to levels he had never before attained. Even more than these, the most important aspect of his poetic maturation was that he achieved what he called Unity of Being, and what others might call the Completeness of Character or Personality, by slowly combining the many and various sides of his psyche into a complete whole. Yeats thus forged himself into the great poet he had always longed to be, and achieved a much greater power with his written words than any other writer of his day and age.As he grew into old age, Yeats became a revered figure and received many awards and prizes, but he was profoundly troubled by what he felt to be a lessening of his poetic powers. For someone who saw all art as \\"an expression of desire,\\" these powers were inextricably interlinked with his libido, and so in 1934 at the age of 68, he underwent a new surgical operation called the Steinach operation. This procedure was evidently a variation on a vasectomy, and promised renewed vigour and strength to those who underwent the knife. Whether it was real or all in his mind, amazingly Yeats poetic ability rose phoenix-like and sustained him during the last five years of his life, years during which his wife George sustained, nursed, and humored him for the sake of his work and their love.This early biography of Yeats strips away some of the intricate masks he created for himself - masks that he removed only for his closest family and friends. It is a vital literary biography for anyone seeking to understand how a minor Irish poet with some rather fantastic notions about magic and symbolism remade himself into the one of the greatest poets of all time. I recommend it primarily to those who enjoy literary biography, and who want to read in great detail how the life, loves, and poetry of W. B. Yeats were intricately and symbolically, intertwined."},{"Title":"Yeats, the man and the masks (A Dutton everyman paperback)","review":"In the sixties I dipped into this book for quotes to put in 'A' Level essays, but never read it fully.Having finally got around to it it was probably just as well because much in the complexity of themes would have escaped me.Yeats' life encompassed the turn of the nineteenth century and the drowning of the 'ceremony of innocence'. As a passionate Irishman, he was at the fulcrum of one of the vortices of this process. He was pivotally involved in the ongoing development of Irish nationalism and also in its cultural history, from Cuchulain (and before) to the Abbey Theatre. He brought to these concerns a rejection of conventional religion and a sustained and scientific as well as mystical approach to the occultism of Madame Blavatsky and others.To Yeats all these belief systems, as well as his own development as a human being, were all intertwined, and even in a sense one and the same.Ellman's biogrphy was first published in 1948, in a less sceptical age than ours, and he approached all Yeats' beliefs with no little understanding and appreciation. It is hard to imagine any academic now feeling able to give any kind of creedence to Madame Blavatsky: scientific dualism has given the world to the bankers, and now we cry, not even able to imagine how to get it back.I have not read the much newer two volume biography by the historian Foster, but understand that Yeats' occultism is given short shrift.Ellman to my mind in quite a short book by modern standards does a brilliant job of synthesizing themes, giving due weight to all and drawing out key points, especially, as another reviewer here or on Amazon.com has said, by drawing on eary unpublished versions of later published essays and poems.A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Yeats, the man and the masks (A Dutton everyman paperback)","review":"Though I have the greatest admiration for Ellman, I must say that this critical biography of Yeats has a few too many blindspots, is too vague and shapeless in its outline of Yeats' life, to satisfy entirely.

This book wound up being my resource for most of the origami I folded for the tree -- and yes, we did wind up having a tree with nothing but lights and paper decorations, and it was very festive! I was very new to folding origami -- \\"advanced beginner\\" -- and the designs, while they may appear to be simple, could be a little bit challenging because there are a lot of \\"use your judgement\\" folds. (I didn't mind; it meant that perhaps the first two -- or five -- pandas didn't look exactly right, but it was good practice.)Final thought: if you only ever own two books on origami, make one book a \\"for beginners\\" teaching reference, and make THIS the second book!"},{"Title":"Origami Treasure Chest","review":"I liked the &#34;Origami Treasure Chest&#34; for its diverse designs.

It has a basic Buddhist approach in living your life in the here-and-now, not regretting & re-living the past, or anticipating & fearing the future. To be \`mindful' is to be present to each moment. Sometimes easier said than done. Hence, the book's appeal as a primer or manual in learning to be \`in the moment'.I loved the way the book was laid out, with the eight weeks being divided by a preface page with a haiku-type reflection on that page. The ensuing pages of instruction have wonderful quotes on the margins (also leaving great space for making notes).\`A Mindful Way' starts out with 5 weeks of The Five Mindfulness Trainings. Each one a true exercise into deep insightfulness.I enjoyed the practice sessions which lead me to write out Mindful Memoirs, causing me to re-discover the parts of Self, left too long to languish in forgetfulness. The process of handwriting your memories is an excellent tool for allowing the subconscious to bubble up into consciousness. The breathing exercises, as well as gratitude expressions were so very helpful. I thoroughly relished the experience. So much so, that it has caused me to want to form a community of like-minds, & work through the eight week process together.I highly recommend this book to all New Thought community!"},{"Title":"A Mindful Way","review":"I've taken a \\"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction\\" class, got into the practice, and bought this book mainly because it was foreworded by Thich Nhat Hanh, who is the prophet of mindfulness and also my biggest inspiration. Reading this book was indeed a good review of Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings, I especially liked how the author put those wise sayings in the margins of the book, and the appendixes also look very helpful in organizing and running your own support/discussion group. However, I want to make two points.First, the author, Jeanie Seward-Magee, suggests different exercises each week, but one repeating exercise is to keep memoir/journal. The first week, you are supposed to write about your sitting meditation, but the rest 7 weeks, you are supposed to write about your past/future: from birth to age 7 in week 2, from age 8 to age 14 in week 3, ..., from age 50 to 70 and over in week 8. (If you are younger, then you should just write about how you'd like your life to be then.) I find this exercise rather contradictory to the essence of mindfulness, living fully in each moment anew! The author mentions in her book that this exercise is to let you \\"make peace with your past\\". I believe, if the past haunts the present, then, yes, you need to meditate upon it and fully own your feelings because the past IS alive in the present. But, otherwise, I'm not sure how we'll benefit from pondering upon the past or the future for as many as 7 weeks. So, I asked the teacher of my mindfulness class, and she said \\"I do not suggest a review of the past, unless it is already present, as in the case of trauma. To dig up the past is more thinking about life, that is no longer liveable. Life, this very moment, has more than enough in it to keep us busy. Contemplations can at moments be useful, but going to past or future is not a helpful way to use the energy.\\" A mindful living as I understand is, to welcome (not resist) each moment with a smile when it arrives and to say bye to (not grab) each moment when it leaves.Second, mindfulness is the 7th element of the Eightfold Path the Buddha taught, and one of the goals is to observe things the way they are without coloring/distorting them with our subjective judgments/feelings. This is why some mindfulness programs start with the body scan meditation so you can recognize your body sensation especially in stressful moments. If you label the situation as \\"annoying\\" or your feeling as \\"insulted\\", it is already judgmental implying that someone did something wrong. One alternative is to describe your body sensation, e.g., \\"tight stomach\\", \\"faster heart beat\\", \\"shaky voice\\", etc. This is exactly what \\"Seeing things the way are\\" means - without adding judgment. It would have been better if an explanation of this basic but important technique had been included in this book.For anyone interested in mindfulness or meditation, I'd like to recomend http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572247088 and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0861713214."},{"Title":"Success 2000 : Moving into the Millennium With Purpose, Power, and Prosperity","review":"I know opening success 2000 has changed my life for the good, and has unmasked my true life and purpose."},{"Title":"Success 2000 : Moving into the Millennium With Purpose, Power, and Prosperity","review":"I love this book and am grateful for having it as a resource to share with my coaching clients.

It is the starting point for all of my clients, whether they are seeking a change of employment, feeling unsure of their future, or looking for fulfillment in life. I have suggested for family, friends and those inquiring about coaching to read this book as a way of beginning to examine what is important in their lives. Are most people innately able to look at themselves and figure out what to do next? I know I was not able to do so, despite having advanced professional training in an allied medical field. I did not know where to start to make the changes I felt somehow were necessary for me to find fulfillment. Vicki Spina presents a user friendly format to assist the reader in self-assessment, and to start the process of reflection which precedes change.

Almost all of those books in that category promise what the book will do for the reader for the about the 1st and 2nd chapters and I did not see that in this book, which is refreshing. I love the fact the Author had the reader have hands on immediately. It's like Vicki Spina grabbed my hand and showed me a particular path that she has discovered for a hike. She captured my attention and the reassurance that I felt made me feel like the trail that she is showing me is really going to lead me to a surprising and spectacular view with a mouthwatering waterfall. The Author is believable, it's seems real what she is saying to me. So, if she wants me to pick up a walking stick along the way on the trail, I will. I also feel that she made the book all about me. She told her story but it was more to show me how, like a teacher having the student practice the work at the same time she's teaching it. That's what I have to say about her book so far and I am only on page 10. I know I have a treasure chest in my hands. Also, it's simple but in depth.

Being an unabashed Dick Francis fan, and having read all his novels, I haven't come across a better description of a race than this. In the opening pages where Admiral comes close to winning the race but comes a cropper with his owner and rider getting killed is simply incredible: the thundering horses, the challenges of the course itself, and the early morning mist, with the tension and the atmosphere, with the climax hitting you with the impact of a sledgehammer all make this my favorite passage in all of Dick Francis. Read it. You'll be hooked."},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"Admiral is dead cert to win, but the horse falls for no visible reason, and the jockey is crushed to death.Bill Davidson's accident just doesn't look right to his best friend Alan York, and after winning the race Bill should have won, Alan goes back to check the fence.

At 24 years old, he's an astute commodities analyst who works three days a week in London at his very wealthy father's Rhodesia-based trading company. But other days generally find him on a racehorse. He's quite an accomplished amateur jockey.The plot is rich in quirky characters, atypical thugs and subtle red herrings - with a love story mixed in.

This one is no exception."},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"I was amazed to learn after reading this one that it was Dick Francis' first novel. Francis was a very successful jockey--racing for the Queen Mother in the 1950's--and after a career-ending injury, he penned his memoirs. Following that success, he developed and incredibly successful second act as a novelist.I discovered Francis' work last summer--and I have plans to read everything he's done. In the 3 books I've read, his heroes are all gentleman sleuths--full of character, empathy, and wits. In Dead Cert, the trend continues with Alan York, a young amateur jockey trying to uncover the mystery of why a copper wire was intentionally hung to trip his fellow jockey. York is on his own resolving this caper, having failed to fully convince the police that this was anything more than an accidental death.The writing is of a high caliber, the characters are wonderfully drawn, and I always learn a thing or two about horses--and England--when I read Dick Francis. There's also something quaint about reading a book set in an age before computers, cell phones, and DNA evidence. Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"Dick Francis didn't save the best for last. I have read all the DF novels except Blood Sport, which I have ordered and expect it anyday. I have loved every single one, but Dead Cert is my favorite, although Bonecrack and Whip Hand are close favorites.Dick Francis is an excellent author because he is a master at combining three elements into his novels. Horses:), danger and mystery, and romance. If anybody reading this reveiw has never read a DF novel, please do so, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"In yet another gripping story of mystery, murder and British steeplechasing, Dick Francis continues his amazing streak of hit novels.His real appeal is not racing or mystery however, it is his ability to create characters who are admirable, honorable and self-reliant. If you're looking for troubled, self-loathers who \\"somehow\\" overcome their weakness and become unwilling and unwitting heroes, don't look here. Francis' heroes revel in their abilities to withstand evil, overcome it, and end up smiling in spite of it all.Kudos once again for Dick Francis and Dead Cert!"},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"This is the first of Dick Francis' racing novels, although not the first I read. In fact, I was amazed to see it was numero uno. Even Robert Parker, another mystery master, took one novel to get it right. Francis, in racetrack parlance, broke from the gate fast. All the elements are there: A likeable hero who pursues the truth at great personal risk; a sweet but never turn-the-page-torrid romance with a bend in the road; outside knowledge about an interesting field, and an interesting villain one can almost sympathize with on some level. It grabs you right away with the murder of a jockey during a race and never lets go, right to the surprising conclusion -- one, incidentally, which our hero desperately wanted not to be so. Enjoy. It's a great start to a great, long ride. Francis' first and one of his best."},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"While savoring each page of this book, I found it hard to believe this was Dick's first work. The plotting is complex, airtight and delightful; the characters each distinct and realistic. For some reason, at times I felt like the plot had elements from \\"The Avengers\\" (the classic television series, not the dud movie), although done more seriously. The book was as entertaining to read as the series was to watch. Dick builds suspense masterfully. There is one scene in particular, a \\"cat and mouse\\" hunt, that Dick draws so skillfully. The reader experiences the slow tension build up, until he or she is almost in a sort of agony, as the scene continues and continues and continues. Dick has a knack for really getting into his characters' heads and the worlds they live in. As a result, the reader is able to identify with the narrator, who gets caught up unexpectedly and deeper in intrigue, in a weirdly engaging film noir-ish style, but not quite as dark. Dick cert makes writing look effortless!"},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"DEAD CERT by Dick Francis.STORY BRIEF:Alan has a good relationship with his father who is extremely wealthy, so Alan doesn't need to work. He spends his time as a jockey riding steeple chase horses. He lives with his friend Bill and Bill's wife and children. The book opens with Bill riding the lead horse in a race. A bad guy strings wire over a jumping fence which causes Bill's horse to fall, killing Bill. Alan is right behind Bill and sees the wire, not knowing what it is at that time. Alan investigates Bill's murder. Someone wants Alan to stop investigating and threatens him.REVIEWER'S OPINION:The cover of the book says \\"Dick Francis The Grand Master of Crime Fiction.\\" Sorry, but I disagree. Too much illogic and stupidity. Alan's father tells others \\"Alan has a Sherlock-Holmes-type nature. He is good at sniffing out trouble and bad guys.\\" Well, I don't recall Sherlock Holmes doing stupid things. Sure Alan figures out who the bad guys are and causes them to get caught, but he does stupid things along the way.Stupidity examples:1. Alan sees the wire that killed Bill. At the time he's not sure what it is. Does he immediately go to the authorities to investigate? No. He spends hours at the hospital with Bill's wife, and then later goes to the race course to investigate. He sees the wire. Does he take a picture of it or take someone with him as a witness? No. He goes away and brings someone back later, and by that time it's gone. The local policeman questions a few race course employees, but he doesn't do any more investigating. The reason is there is no second witness to the wire. Also, why did the bad guy wait hours before removing the wire? Not logical.2. Thugs attack Alan telling him to stop investigating. He receives more threats. He is about to run another race, and he expects the bad guys will put up a wire to take him down. His thinking is \\"I don't want the other jockeys to get hurt, so I'll stay in front and take the wire.\\" STUPID!!!! He is wealthy. He could easily hire some private investigator or body guard types to hide near the various jumping fences with cameras. They could take pictures of bad things happening and probably prevent it. Did he do anything like that? No. Instead, his horse hit the wire, he fell on the ground, got tromped by other horses, and then a bad guy walks up and kicks him in the head and ribs, giving him amnesia, a concussion, and broken ribs on top of the other injuries. Would Sherlock Holmes do that? No.3. Alan knows a bad guy is sitting in his office, has a gun, and wants Alan dead. Alan's weapon is a roll of coins in a bag. Alan goes to the bad guy, plans to sneak up on him and hit him before he can be shot. Why doesn't Alan take a better weapon or someone with him?Incomplete ending:Alan has a scuffle with a bad guy. The bad guy gets injured, but the book ends without saying what the injury is. Is the guy dead or alive? Will there be evidence to put him away? We don't know. The happy ending is \\"Alan didn't get injured in that scuffle.\\"Unsupported romance thrown in:This felt like the author threw in a romance without paying attention. It wasn't realistic. Alan meets Kate. He thinks she is beautiful. They have two dates: one out to dinner and one at her home. He kisses her once. She kisses like a sister. He looks forward to awakening her passionate nature later. He tells her he loves her and wants to marry her. He proposes more than once. There was no character development about her. Does she have anything upstairs? She never said anything of interest. I don't know what they talked about. What made him love her? This needed some dialogue.No cell phones:This was published in 1962, before cell phones. Frequently I thought how different this story would be if Alan had a cell phone. I suppose it is interesting to be reminded of what life was like without them.My favorite part:I really liked the story about Tompkins who owned a local bar. Thugs beat him up and destroyed his property. They wanted weekly extortion money. I liked what he did to protect himself and what he did with other local shop owners. He did smart things that worked. He was my hero. But his story wasn't big enough. It was a minor side story.NARRATOR:I will probably avoid the narrator Tony Britton if I can. I think he would be ok for British people, but his British accent was hard for me to understand. I had to concentrate and pay careful attention. It took energy. Hearing American speak is easier and more enjoyable for me. Some reviewers complained about his voice for the drunk character Joe. I didn't like it either, but it was only a few scenes. My problem was his narration of the whole book. Don't get me wrong. I love to hear people speak with a British accent in conversation, but for some unknown reason it didn't work for me in this book.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 8 hrs and 9 mins. Swearing language: none that I recall. Sexual content: none. Setting: around 1960 England. Book copyright: 1962. Genre: mystery suspense. Ending: happy although incomplete."},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"I have been reading Dick Francis' books for years, and although I have every single mystery that he has written, this one definitely is one of my favorites. He is a true artist of suspense writing; when the villian(s) are finally revealed the reader can't help but be knocked breathless. This book may have been one of his first, but the reading public should be grateful that it wasn't his last.

I liked it because it was clever and engrossing. I would never have expected the ending. Alan York was made to seem very real and a very kind person. He was also extremely smart. I have read many more Dick Francis books since then including: Nerve, Bolt, Risk, Reflex, Whip Hand, and Twice Shy. They are all marvelous, but none as intreguing as Dead Cert. I think every one should read it."},{"Title":"Dead Cert","review":"This is the first Dick Francis mystery and I like it the second best. I like &quot;Nerve&quot; slightly better, but only slightly.

The map is updated yearly by the makers and it gives very clear markings for all highways and streets. It also lets you plan out a route, so that you can mark the exits and side streets, to get where you want to go. It is very easy to get lost in Europe, as the highway system there is not as well marked and defined as ours here in the United States. With this map it's like you are a native driver from there. Last time we used it, to drive around Florence, it got us to where we wanted to go without getting hopelessly lost, which is very easy to do there as the road signs are very confusing (and no --we don't speak Italian!.

The book's pace was moderate, most of the characters were well developed, their personalities grew as Jeri learned more about them. I think what I enjoyed most about the book, though, was the setting. I liked reading about the characters bobbing about in my neighborhood, and actually visualizing the areas they visit and drive through. I get the same pleasure from reading the Kat Colorado books, though I think Dawson is generally a better read."},{"Title":"Take a Number","review":"I tend to agree with the previous reviewer, both on the number of stars and the developed characters. I enjoyed &quot;Don't Turn Your Back on the Ocean&quot; more; possibly because it was set around Monterey, CA where I spent some years. &quot;Take a Number&quot; fleshes out some of the characters so that you admire or sympathize with them or have disdain and contempt for them. Jeri Howard starts out with a case of hunting for missing money (hidden assets in a divorce case) and ends up investigating a murder. Her client, Ruth Franklin Raynor, is suspected of murdering her estranged husband but there are lots of other suspects with plenty of motive and less than ironclad alibis. Janet Dawson's strengths seem to be in developing her settings and her characters. The plots are okay too but not extraordinary. (I was going to say &quot;earthshaking&quot; but seeing as how the mysteries are set in California that might induce the author to bring in an earthquake in her next book!) I enjoy the series and still have a number of them to look forward to reading."},{"Title":"The Nuer. A Description of the Modes of Livelihood and Political Institutions of a Nilotic People.","review":"This book is one of the classics of ethnography - indeed, one of the works which defines what ethnography and anthropology are.The Nuer is an account of a group of pastoralists living in the Sudan as Evans-Pritchard knew them when he did field work in er... uh... the late 30s early 40s. The first half of the book is a detailed and lively (for an academic) account of their way of life, the seasonal rhythms of the year, and their intense interest in cattle.The second half of the book than deals with the main subject of the book: the social organization of the Nuer. E-P moves to a greater and greater level of abstraction, creating a more and more crystalline view of the patterns of kinship and marriage that underlie Nuer life. The main structure is the lineage system - a group of people all related from a common ancestor through an unbroken line of male succession.This book is famous because of E-P's account of the lineage system. The concept of the lineage and descent became key in anthropology, and E-P's Nuer materials helped provide the perfect example of the lineage as theorized by Radcliffe-Brown, E-P's teacher.As a result of this book, anthropologists spend the next two decades running around all over the world looking for lineage systems. As it turns out, this sort of system is not particularly widespread across the world - at least not in its pure form. Indeed, it turns out that E-P's formulation was too neat and clean and too crystalline. As one pundit put it, &quot;not even the Nuer are like The Nuer&quot;. So one drawback of the book is the false clarity that it provided. This was useful in the forties and fifties, but meant that eventually the study of kinship and social organization would have to move out of the paradigm E-P had set up.Another problem with the book is the fact that it takes place in a vacuum. It is easy not to notice that the Nuer are under the sway of British authority and had recently been bombed when E-P arrived. The colonial context of the book is supressed.There are other critcisms that could be made of the book - it is now a half-century behing the times - but it stands up today as a good read and a fascinating argument. The fact that reactions to it have been so extreme - overwhelming enthusiasm, abiding hatred, quizzical puzzlement, cow obsession - point to the fact that a book doesn't have to be loved forever to be read forever. Like all classics, The Nuer both good to read and good to think."},{"Title":"The Nuer. A Description of the Modes of Livelihood and Political Institutions of a Nilotic People.","review":"I disagree completely with the &quot;reader from Washington&quot; who wrote it is a boring book. Probably he/she didn't read more than the first two, more descriptive chapters. This book became &quot;a classic&quot; because it was a turning point in the history of Anthropology, specially because of its analysis of the political system of the Nuer."},{"Title":"The Nuer. A Description of the Modes of Livelihood and Political Institutions of a Nilotic People.","review":"The complexity of Nuer relations with their environment, because of herding cattle, is detailed in the first chapters. (Nuer name thier cattle and can distinguish scores of them.) In the later chapters Evans-Pritchard takes us through how herding leads to patrilineal descent and the formation of lineages and clans. This social organization dictates whom a man will marry, how the bride price will be paid, and how most disputes are settled. The work helps us understand the nature of feuds, both their negative aspects and their positive ones. The social organization is further shaped by conflict with the Dinka, a neighboring tribe.The analysis gave us a paradigm for how lineal organization works leading to important insights in North America as well as Africa where clan organization is common.Both Nuer and Dinka are in today's news because of the conflict in southern Sudan. Their earlier \\"wars\\" are hardly more than quarrels by the standards of northern Sudan's brutality.It's not uncommon to meet Nuer refugees in Tucson because of war's ravages."},{"Title":"The Nuer.

I ordered this book because it states that it tells you how to do it step-by-step. This is false. Let me tell you what this book has in it: Gossip. Conversations with this Patricia Drake Hemmingway lady between her and her supposed friends about doing TM and who else they know who is doing TM. Stories about how her and her friends traveled to the TM courses/lectures. The conversations that took place with her and her friends after she got back from the TM courses/lectures. (Not about what they learned while there.) And about 10 chapters on how TM has helped people deal with work stress. - This book is basically a poorly written ad for TM. (Which by the way, has gone up from the 1970's price of about $125, to the new 2007 pricetag of $2,500, base price. So apparently only the rich have stress.) I also think that this Patricia lady likes to hear herself talk, and this book is the fix that gets her going. L A M E.

Bruce Lincoln, one of my favorite writers of history. His works on Russia have given me, time and again, new insight into that country, its people and history. This last work is another excellent example of his writing, marred only by what I think is some poor editing. I don't know at what stage of this work Mr. Lincoln died, but it appears that, if he had survived through the final editing stage this book would have been in a different form. There are more than a few redundancies, which should have been picked up by an alert editor, and I'm sure would have been by the author if he had been around to do so. That criticism aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this work, once again learning many new things about the Russian psyche, as brought forth through the history of St. Petersburg. There may be a bit too much about architecture in this work, but I consider it a &quot;work in progress&quot; that will now, unfortunately, never get into the final shape its author intended. It's a loss for all of us."},{"Title":"Sunlight At Midnight St. Petersburg And The Rise Of Modern Russia","review":"Lincoln's &quot;Sunlight at Midnight&quot; has some excellent moments, but is frequently superficial and a little dull. The book is primarily a cultural history of St Petersburg, featuring the usual cast of writers (Pushkin, Gogol, Belyi), poets (Blok, Akhmatova, Brodsky), and composers (Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich). The Romanov rulers and their tastes in architecture are discussed extensively, as are the Soviets and their tastes in censorship.The first three chapters are primarily a cultural history of imperial Russia following Peter the Great's reign. They deal mostly in court affairs and architects, neither of which are particularly interesting. Next come descriptions of Petersburg's literary and musical history, which are spotty and do not compare well with the detail of Solomon Volkov's &quot;St Petersburg&quot;.The tone changes abruptly when we reach the late nineteenth century, and the reliance on artistic sources gives way to a more popular account of the revolutionary period. Events are well presented but the story is told too quickly. The months between abdication and Bolshevik takeover, for example, pass in a single paragraph. I would have gladly exchanged twenty early pages on the styles of palace facades for some details of the provisional government's failure and the October coup.The chapter on the Leningrad siege is a masterpiece of narrative history, but the book unfortunately returns to cultural matters and Soviet repression of artists in the postwar period. This is interesting stuff, but not remotely as gripping as the events of the previous decades and written in a cursory style more suited to a review for a knowledgeable reader."},{"Title":"Sunlight At Midnight St. Petersburg And The Rise Of Modern Russia","review":"In _Sunlight at Midnight_, historian Bruce Lincoln tells the story of Russia through the city of St. Petersburg. This works well, and in many places (like the city itself) it is both beautiful and brilliant. Unfortunately, his history is uneven. The usual cast of characters connected to this place are here: Peter and Catherine the Great, Rastrelli, Quarenghi in the 18th century; Pushkin, Gogol, Faberge, Dostoevsky in the 19th; Blok, Akhmatova, Brodsky and Lermonotov in the 20th. The association of these great minds and personalities with the city breathe life in the cultural telling of the history of Russia through the story of this marvelous city.However, as a previous reviewer has noted, the emphasis Lincoln puts on the events of the city are a bit skewed. The tremendous expense Catherine and Elizabeth invested in object d'art is interesting, as are the details of the construction of the Winter Palace and (numerous) other royal dwellings in and around the city. But to spend such an inordinate amount of time discussing this while only briefly addressing the two decades between the wars seems out of balance. Similarly, the post-war history of the city was addressed in really a cursory manner compared to the amount of detail given during its growth in the early and mid-19th century.These criticisms aside, the history of St. Petersburg makes for a fascinating narrative of broader events in Russian history, from the failed Decembrist revolt in 1825, to the revolutions of 1905 and 1917. This is a book I would certainly recommend for those traveling to St. Petersburg, given the detail and connections between landmarks and larger events in Russia (and the Soviet Union.) I do wish Lincoln had addressed the unique - odd may be a better word - place St. Petersburg has in Russia. It is a stunningly beautiful city, and is immensely popular with Westerners: it is the most \\"Western\\" of Russian cities. But it is not really Russia. This awkward truth is pointed out in various places (as the city is being built, during Napoleon's invasion, during the Terror), but I believe it warranted more consistent reminding to the reader: St. Petersburg is a \\"window on the West\\" in a very real sense of Russia being locked outside of Western Europe, looking in; imitating, being influenced by, but certainly not a participant in the West - and as such, not entirely \\"Russian\\", either.Lincoln is a wonderful writer, and his retelling of the 900 seige during World War II and descriptions of the marvelous collections of art (now in the old Winter Palace, the \\"Hermitage\\") are first rate. His love for the city is evident in the writing, and in many respects, the concept of national history told through its most influential city works as a narrative thread. Certainly worthwhile for those who are familiar with the place, or for those intending to go."},{"Title":"Sunlight At Midnight St. Petersburg And The Rise Of Modern Russia","review":"Perhaps it is fitting that this is Bruce Lincoln's twelfth andfinal book.

This book has excerpts of Lu Xun's short stories in Chinese on one side of a page and the opposing pages have appropriate vocabulary words from the stories with their Pinyin romanization (with tone marks) and the appropriate definitions.BTW, the simplest way to describe Lu Xun is to say that he is sort of like China's version of Franz Kafka."},{"Title":"Lectures on the English language","review":"Famed conservationist George Perkins Marsh is also known for his knowledge of the history of the English language, from its historical roots to the direction in which it seems to be heading.

Not to mention beautiful artwork on the cover and throughout the missal.Even if you've never been to a traditional Mass, you will probably find this little missal most helpful.

It's a booklet, not a full missal, so its focus is on the Ordinary of the Mass and has the parts of the Mass that do not change with each week. It has both Latin and English side by side, so that you can glance with your eyes over to the English if you do not understand the Latin. It also has notes as to when to sit, stand and kneel, as well as notes about the meanings behind the parts of the Mass. In addition, it has prayers to say before the Mass, and before and after communion, as well as good sections in the back on an examination of conscience, additional prayers and the rosary.It's a very handy book to have, and even when \\"graduating\\" to a full Latin Mass missal, (with propers for each day), it is still a good travel missal to have.A note of caution: The group that produces the booklet, Ecclesia Dei, sells the missal at $7.00., and you can buy it for less than that from other places. So, I wouldn't buy it for more than $7.00, and unfortunately, the sellers that I have seen as of today are selling it for a lot more than it's worth.

I would pass this over unless you are an avid Bukowski fan and try something else."},{"Title":"The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills","review":"This book is Bukowski's finest collection of poetry ever published. As with all prolific writers, Buk's books often come with more filler than sustenance- that is not the case here. The poems written for/about Jane highlight his most soulful collection. The usual mask of nonchalance has been stripped away, along with the chains of his self-created tough guy/barfly image. The tenderness and warmth are unfiltered by his masculine facade. Moving, desolate, and often humorous, this book is nearly flawless. It is written in such a way that anyone can read and understand. It isn't written in a flowery, deeply symbolic style that makes younger readers hate poetry. This book is from the heart, mind and fists of a man who has loved, suffered, hated and laughed. Anyone who has done likewise should be able to appreciate the raw beauty presented within. Make no mistake, the alcoholism, sex and madness that made Bukowski famous are all represented here as well. This is the book to read if you are interested in the most three-dimensional portrayal of the late poet."},{"Title":"The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills","review":"This collection of poetry is perhaps Bukowski's finest. It marks a significant transitional period in his work, from the earlier imagist poems--more clearly &quot;poetic&quot; in form and content--to the later style for which he is best known and loved--the raucous, colloquial, hard-boiled pieces that rendered the distinction between prose and poetry seemingly null. The book's opening piece exemplifies this new style and Bukowski's new poetic persona. &quot;What a Man I Was&quot; tells the story of a wild western outlaw who terrorizes a small town and is then hung from the gallows. He is misunderstood, vulgar, and reviled. When the outlaw swings from the gallows, he doesn't express fear, hatred, sorrow, self-pity, regret or uncertainty. He is a staunch materialist who looks at a woman's breasts, mouth watering. The best poems in this collection are those written for Jane Cooney, who died prematurely from a life of serious drinking. These poems betray an affection and tenderness that is typically absent from Bukowski's work and which is often obscured by the hard-boiled exterior of his persona."},{"Title":"The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills","review":"This is actually a collection originally published in 1969.

This is, however, not just another &quot;names and dates&quot; history book about WWII. General Horrocks is more interested in conveying his personal view of the war from his unique perspective as a corps commander. In doing so he comes across as a very kind-hearted and gentle man caught up in a war which he hates but knows must be fought. General Horrocks is quick to admit his mistakes and is refreshingly humble in contrast to the more famous generals of the war such as Montgomery, Bradley and Patton. Unlike these titans, General Horrocks comes across as much more human in the compassion he displays for his men and the anguish he goes through when he must order them to their deaths. This is a good book for those interested in probing deeper into the history of the war in Europe but it is not a &quot;typical&quot; war story."},{"Title":"CORPS COMMANDER.","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon.com because I had read his other book, A Full Life.

You're all seen A Bridge Too Far, and this shows why the Brits didn't make it to the Paratroopers in Arnhem, there were too many Panzers in the way. The British Intelligence didn't believe the reports of their existence. What struck me was that Monte actually sent Horrocks home on leave during the Battle of the Bulge.

Isaac's daughter Rachel, as his assistant also comes to help. An herbalist arrives, desperate to see the bishop to give him a warning but the poison in his bloodstream kills him before he can tell his excellency about the threat.In Girona, two young men each claims that they are heir to a large inheritance. One of them Jacob disappears during a pirate attack. The other claimant Luca an herbalist attempts to set up a practice. When two of his patients are murdered by poison that he had a messenger deliver, the townsfolk's want him tried and executed. Isaac implores the Bishop to wait before convening the court because he believes it was not Luca who delivered the poison. He also believes that these events are somehow related to the dead herbalist who tried to warn the bishop. In his own intuitive yet practical way Isaac tries to expose the guilty party.Medieval Spain comes vividly to life in the reader's mind after reading A POULTICE FOR A HEAVEN. It feels as if the author is chronicling events that she witnessed. The characters are well developed and it is fascinating to see the relationship between Christians and Jews during a period of religious strife. The people of Girona peacefully coexist with only minor troubles breaking out between the two religions. The protagonist might be blind but he sees more clearly than most people. Fans of historical fiction centered on a good mystery will want to read this novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Swallow Barn","review":"Basically a plotless book that contains a series of sketches depicting life on a Virginia plantation circa 1830.

I spent the first part of the book wanting to meet the O'Sullivan's to compare ghost busting notes, the second part being slightly frustrated by the emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism. I came away with the decision that the overt Buddhism did not outweigh the help that this book would give to searchers on the path towards understanding the nature of the unquiet dead.The personal stories recounted in this book range from the tragic to the down right frightening! The first story of Kadamba Simmons and her murder is perhaps the most tragic, yet it also leaves us with a feeling of hope as she finds peace in a shower of butterflies at her burial.Their information regarding possession would be of help to a lot of the living. I have found that those who \`dabble' in the paranormal seem to expect to be possessed at some time or other.

Noo...and another thing, you said, \\"that every other religion aside from Christianity is false and will send you to hell if you follow them\\". The reason that the book says it is because it is the truth! All other religions are man-made, and there is NO OTHER WAY TO HEAVEN OTHER THAN THROUGH JESUS! It says in the Bible, \\"Jesus said, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'\\" (coming to the Father means going to Heaven, and not going to Hell) John 14:6Jesus is not a power-hungry dictator, he just wants people to follow him. To be his Child. To belive that He made the sacrifice that he did. John 3:16 says: \\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\\" And these people did not believe in Him, so they perished! And thats what will happen to anyone who does not believe in Jesus. To the people that are not Christians- you can accept Him now, or you can wait until you die. Then you will have an eternity to realize that you were wrong and burn in Hell. If you want to become a Christian, all you have to do is sincerely pray this prayer, \\"Dear God, I know that I'm a sinner. Thank you for sending your Son to die just for me. I truly believe that he did. Please forgive me of my sins, and take me into your loving arms. In your name, Amen\\". It's that simple. Please, don't wait until it's too late. Accept Christ into your life now."},{"Title":"Triumphant Return: The New Jerusalem (Left Behind: The Kids)","review":"There really isn't too much to say other than there's a reason the Left Behind series are a set of best-selling books. Truly great Christian literature that shed light on what is prophesied to come. I've been hooked on the series since 2000, & was saved by the message contained within. And it's not just these books anymore, I began to hunger for the Bible as well. However, God has many ways to get His foot in the door, and the Left Behind series is a great example. I'm forever grateful that God found a way in.Jenkins and LaHaye are truly doing God's work through these novels, and I know not by how popular the series has become and how many people have come to know and accept Christ as their Lord and Savior, but how many stone-throwers & bashers you see writing negative reviews about these books. There is even one individual--who has written a review here on this book--who has proven that he is still oblivious and ignorant of what is printed in these books, even though he \\"claims\\" to have read them. This dude has gone so far as to call Christians \\"evil.\\"If you need proof of his ignorance, look no further than this statement: \\"Meanwhile, the Christians will be saved no matter how evil they behave, because they've got Jesus on their side.\\" That is so NOT true. Being saved is more than saying \\"God, save me. I believe in Jesus, so I'm good to go.\\" Being saved isn't a free ticket to do whatever you want to do. According to his statement, Satan--despite his evil--will go to heaven because he knows and believes of God and Jesus' existence. God knows your heart and knows if you mean it or not, and being saved isn't some excuse to do evil. You're either evil or good, which is represented by \\"the fruits you produce.\\" An apple tree isn't going to produce grapes. If this dude had bothered reading the series at all, he would have noted that a preacher was left behind in book one.So what is being saved, really? It's accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior, and committing yourself to do His will, DESPITE our human failings. It's putting aside your own will to do God's. That's not saying we aren't all human and won't make mistakes, b/c it will happen more times than we want. But true Christians are committed to do better, & don't believe themselves to be better than unsaved people--just forgiven--which is the whole point. You can't be a Christian and still continue doing evil and wickedness, you can't be both good and bad, you can't be both hot and cold. So if all this is true, what's up with the stone-throwers and bashers of Christians? Well, what do you expect? Jesus Himself was hunted, beaten, and executed, and said that if even He is treated this way, how can we expect any different? When I originally read his review, I was angry, but now, I read it and smile because I realize--that it wasn't just me that FELT the powerful message of God--that the Left Behind series has just that powerful a message to not only save people but to get such a vehemently negative response from a non-Christian.That dude is so afraid to believe that everything in the Bible is true that he would explain it all away with his own lies and ignorance. Just guessing, he's so into his lifestyle that he doesn't want anything to change the status quo. If this guy is so against Christians, why would he even consider reading the Left Behind series in the first place? Maybe searching for loop holes but couldn't find any perhaps? I would say \\"If you hate it so much, why subject yourself to it?\\" But, instead, I'll just say, \\"Do what you want to. Seems that's what you're gonna do anyway.\\" So when you read his review, do this:1. Smile2. Accept it as a 5-star rating from someone that doesn't want to believe & doesn't really know what he's talking about3. Read the books and make up your own mindOh, and by the way, I love the books, they truly changed my life, and unlike another certain reviewer, I actually did my homework. I looked up every prophecy in the Bible--not just Revelations as Mark did (I read the Bible cover to cover)--and have come to only one conclusion: with the exception of the prophecies yet to come, all the prophecies thus far have come to pass exactly as they were fortold thousands of years before. Just FYI."},{"Title":"Triumphant Return: The New Jerusalem (Left Behind: The Kids)","review":"They have great service and quick delivery. Books in very good shape - no pages marked. As in the other remarks, I was able to finish the series."},{"Title":"Triumphant Return: The New Jerusalem (Left Behind: The Kids)","review":"This is a really great book, with the Glorious Appearing being the coolest. I've read it about four times in bookstores, and it never ceases to thrill me. As for what Mark Moore says, he is describing Christianity like it is: but from a negative point of view. The Bible is not a myth. Anyway, this is a good book, and I think it would be cool if they made another series about the temporary release of Satan and the rebellion.In Christ,"},{"Title":"Triumphant Return: The New Jerusalem (Left Behind: The Kids)","review":"I have always enjoyed the adult series of Left Behind books. The kids books are just as good. The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book. These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens. I enjoy them and I am an adult."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"Robert and Suzanne Massie are both wonderful, accomplished writers, and in &quot;Journey&quot; they open their hearts to us as they tell of their 18 year journey raising their son, Bobby, who has hemophilia. Today the disease is much more easily treated than when Bobby was born, in 1956.The Massies describe their struggle to do the best they could and to ensure that Bobby would have the most normal life experiences possible. They describe their encounters withdoctors and nurses, some warm and nurturing, others coldly uncaring and clinical. In the book, Bobby himself writes of his own journey, with hundreds upon hundreds of necessary transfusions, and with many periods of enforced idleness so hardon a young boy.In one of what is the most meaningful passages for me, Suzanne describes how distant she felt from other young mothers of her circle as they chatted about daily small matters, about the PTA and their children's sports teams. Suzanne's life had been unutterably altered not by a crisis event, but by an ongoing momentous struggle. As the mother of an adult autistic son, I fully understand her feelings.This is marvelous book about love, family, grit, and the triumph of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Old Testament History","review":"This book provides a detailed look at the history of the ancient world as it directly relates to events in the Old Testament and the Jewish people. The geographic, political, cultural, and religious aspects of those times and places provide a necessary context to better understand the OT writers, their writings, and their audience. The author of this book is admittedly sympathetic to a traditional, Biblical view of history. However, many, if not most, world events after the Divided Kingdom seem to be thoroughly documented with extra-Biblical sources.While the book is filled with information, the writing style is not overly academic and would be easy for the casual reader to follow.The edition I read was published in the early 1970s. Perhaps more discoveries since that time have provided additional information either supporting or contradicting the conclusions in this book. For this reason, I might recommend a more current version or a newer work entirely. In addition, this book could use more tables, charts, timelines, and better photos.All said, this book has given me a better understanding of the cultural context surrounding the Biblical OT narrative."},{"Title":"Old Testament History","review":"I really am enjoying the book. I use the present tense as I have not yet completed my journey (I use this word strategically.) through it. It contains too much material to soak up in one study I am afraid, but makes for an incredible look at the lives around many of our Old Testament friends. I would encourage anyone who is looking to take a look at the Old Testament from a fresh, new perspective to pick up this book. Dr. Pfeiffer does an incredible job of consistently bringing the study back to the Word of God as not to make the study overly academic."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"If you've bought (or just read) a \\"Dummy\\" book before, you know what it's like. Just like every Dummy book I've read, there's tons of info; some you'll use and some you won't, laid out in easy to read chapters. As soon as I opened the book, I started learning some stuff that I didn't know before, such as how to decide what personality type a puppy has when you're trying to pick one from a litter. There was also a lot of info about how to know which personality type would be best for you. There's also the usual info about choosing a breed, which people don't usually seem to heed much (even though they should), chapters on illnesses, etc. I keep it by the chair where I often read and just flip through it, reading as I go. Both my dogs are old and I haven't dealt with puppies in many years, but I expect that I will be sometime in the not-too-distant future. This book will be a big help."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"One of these days I want to get a puppy, but when I do, I want to raise my puppy the right way. I think it's good to do some research ahead of time to prepare for everything involved in bringing a new puppy into my life. Puppies for Dummies covers everything relating to choosing and raising a puppy in addition to everyday life with a puppy. I really enjoyed reading this book because it is well written by a professional dog trainer who has a good writing personality. Sarah has written in a language that makes even the trickiest puppy problems easy to fix.

It's easy to flip to the specific section you want to read, like the section on housebreaking, but it's also a book that you can sit down and read cover to cover.We've now had a puppy for nearly three months, and I wish I would have ordered this book before we got her. I have \\"Golden Retrievers for Dummies\\", which is great for details and quirks about her breed, but this puppy book gives more specific advice for dealing with puppy behaviors and training.If you're getting a new puppy soon, I'd highly recommend both this and the companion Dummies book that's specific to your dog's breed.Disclaimer: I was provided a free copy of this book via The Vine review program in exchange for my honest review.

The beginning is all about picking the right dog for you and preparing your home ready for your dog. Also, it goes over what kind of diet is health for your puppy. It also goes over areas of training your puppy to be well behaved to tricks that will impress your company.

Recently I bought another pup to keep my one remaining old dog company, but my new pup is a HIGH-INTENSITY ANIMAL! Even though I love him to pieces there are many days that I wonder \\"what in the blazes did I do getting another dog at my age and health!?\\" Then I picked up this book, and it helped me go back 16 years and remind me how I trained all of those pups in the first place (though 16 years ago I did not have this great resource for my information, and trained my dogs with basic knowledge I had from having grown up with dogs as a child.). With this book and a little guidance from my vet for my new pups \`special issues' (like hyperactivity and temper tantrums - i.e. very willful, and not being able to put a collar on him due to collapsing trachea) I am once again in the drivers seat. Literally overnight I have been able to go from things being in absolute chaos here - with my older dog ending up at the vet twice in 2 weeks from the stress of the intensity - to calm. Thankfully! Cause I was wondering if I and my older dog / or I / was going to survive this new little \`ball of fire'. Don't get me wrong; he IS a wonderful little dog; just very high wired and intense. And, I needed good direction on how to handle him and train him; which I found in this book. Now that I know how to handle him in a way that is firm yet loving, consistent, redirecting, non-confrontational, with me as the one running the house instead of him; well, he is a much better behaved pup. Even calm a lot of the time! And, my older dog has gone from looking sad to once again being the happy, gentle soul he was. Cause instead of \`letting' my old dog to stand up for himself I now put a stop to the over-the-top antics from my new pup. Like when my older dog doesn't want to play, so the new pup starts dragging my old dog out of the crate pillow and all, I now (carefully) use a halter to leash my pup and get him under control. And, leash him to furniture to \`rein him in' and \`tone him down'. It's amazing how willing he is to behave himself most of the time in order to walk free! Until I get the special halter I ordered here on Amazon for the new pup, I have to be careful (the halter that's coming won't touch his neck or trachea). But, the point is; that I no longer allow the pups \`issues' to let him run the house. Cause allowing him to have free rein created a little monster, which wasn't healthy for any of us. Even though this book isn't meant to specifically deal with special issues with a dog, the information is a great learning tool for how a dog thinks, and thus how to interact with them and train them to be a really good family member. Now my older dog is (only) happy to have this new little friend, and so am I. I am so glad I got this book."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Received my product in less than a week. I was updated promptly and billing was flawless.

I'm a new puppy owner, and found much in here frustrating -- she doesn't talk much about crate training, for instance, because it makes her cry to see a dog in a cage, so she suggests you just tie your pup to yourself all day. Do yourself a favor: the information in How to Raise a Puppy You Can Live With is far more helpful and complete, and the writing in The Art of Raising a Puppy is far more readable and enlightening. I can't vouch for the other puppy books, but the two books I mentioned are worth your time and money; this one is, well, for dummies."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"When I adopted my puppy, this book was recommended to me. I dutifully went out and bought it. As I was reading it, it had many suggestions for what you should do but no tangible examples of implementing those suggestions. For example, they might say \\"don't hit your puppy with a rolled up newspaper\\" however they don't necessarily give you a reasonable alternative. I believe this to be more of a function of the editing by the \\"dummies\\" staff than a reflection on the author. In what I can only interpret as his own editorial comment on the book, my puppy proceeded to pee on this book -- needless to say, after that we threw it out.I went back to the bookstore and picked up:\\"You and Your Puppy\\" by James DeBitetto, Sarah HodgsonSarah Hodgson is the author of this puppy book but somehow, with the addition of James DeBitetto, there are much more real-world suggestions for how to train your puppy. Many of the passages are word for word the same as the dummies book. However, instead of having just one paragraph about a topic, they expand on it and give you additional detail so that you can translate their \\"theory\\" into practice.In short -- the Puppies for Dummies is not really very good for people who are truly interested in learning a humane and positive way to raise their puppy. It is basically the USA Today of puppy books -- just scratching the surface without providing any meaningful information."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This book was truly useless. I read it and sold it because I knew that I would never want to look at it again. It's very elementary (hence the name, &quot;For Dummies) and many sections are not very helpful when it comes to training. I had many questions after I read this book. Maybe I made the mistakes to read other books before this one which just blew me away so that when I read this book, I wasn't very impressed....In addition to the somewhat inferior content of the dummy book, it also lacked the many black and white photographs that I came to appreciate in the other readings which really drove home the points that these readings made (Pictures are worth a thousand words - when I see a &quot;sit&quot; sequence, that does a lot more for me than being told &quot;pinch this, push there, and pull that). If you are on a budget and want to save money for dog toys, quality dog food etc for your puppy/dog, don't get this book. Spend your $ more wisely by getting Kilcommon's Good owners, great dogs. That book will be your friend and advisor, while this one will just end up on your book shelf, because it doesn't have the info you need on a daily basis to really help you and your dog.

It also doesn't adress how to deal with such a behavior. All it says is \\"nipping is bosy and manipulative and needs a firmer regimaent.\\" It then says to follow the advice in the following chapters, but it never even adresses this issue.All the information is just incredably breif and wont answer any questions you might have with answers or proof. This might be an ok choice as a small guide, but if you are truly interested in learning more about your puppy, this book is to breif and will not go into any needed detail.The puppy calander is also pretty useless and basically just takes up space. if you want a puppy dairy just write in a notebook.

She spends too much time showing how to force your puppy into position, and any good dog trainer will tell you that puppies learn best and fastest when they figure out what you're asking on their own by luring with food etc. The author often suggests \\"hugging\\" as appropriate praise for a dog. While hugging is tolerated by many dogs, it is really considered quite rude in the dog world and isn't the best way to reinforce behavior.She also relies on a lot of unnecessary equipment, such as the \\"teaching lead\\" which she invented and suggests using choke collars for all puppies.

And like raising a child, everyone has their own opinions about how it should be done. Therefore, it's impossible to write a book that encompasses every idea of how to properly raise a dog. That being said, this particular book is full of great tips and advice on how to make sure your puppy grows up to be a good dog.You probably won't agree with everything in this book, but you don't have to follow every piece of advice. The pure volume of information is more than enough to make this book worth it. There is something about pretty much every aspect of raising a puppy, and almost all of them are amazingly helpful. I also like this book because it tends to lean towards more of a rewards based system rather than a punishment based system, which has proven to be more effective.Overall, I would say this is a great book to start with if you are just getting your new puppy. It will get you through the beginning stages of development but if you have a particularly stubborn (or maybe good) dog, then you might have to get another book that is more tailored to the specific breed you have.

All of the information was helpful and concise."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I just have to say that it has been quite fun and funny seeing how many Dummies there are in the world. I remember in the early 90's trying to learn DOS, the obsolete computer operating system with the flimsy 5\\" discs. The best part about it to me was the humor. You really do learn from this format if you are learn by doing type of person, rather than a learn by reading person. I have to be hands on, and this series allows you that. With well over 2000 Dummy subjects out there, there certainly no end in sight.So here we have Puppies for Dummies. Quite a stretch. But even with different Authors in all these books, the humor is still there. Maybe it's due to laughing at yourself for needing it. I actually don't need a dog training book, but (sorry for the bad pun), you can teach an old dog new tricks. That being me. I had a black Lab for 12 wonderful years, and honestly I believe I was just lucky to have such a smart pup. I rescued her when she was about 3 months old, and was not doing so well at the beginning with a lot of doctor trips, but in under a year, she was a very happy puppy. I work from home so I was literally with her most hours of the day. She never had accidents (until she got older) and literally rang a bell when she had to pee. So, like I said, this is not normal, and no one should ever expect such obedience. But, it has been a while since she passed, and I have been considering getting a new pup, and thought, why not start again here.If you are experienced with dogs or not, this book is actually quite intriguing with plenty of notes to keep in mind for today's world. I would think the most important careless Dad in me was feeding. I just let her eat as much as she wanted. She got occasional scraps or a bone etc. and never a problem. She got some weight on her during her older years, but still very active. So the nutritional areas of the book are worth the price of admission. However, it just leaves me wanting more.Basically this book is a perfect starting point to prepare yourself for what lies ahead. You may even rethink getting a puppy or dog afterwards. In other words, this is a book to get before you jump in. I am ready for a new pup, but holding off a bit longer. Reading this is more like talking with a friend who knows better. It certainly does not push you away from the idea, but makes you take it a bit more seriously. It's a huge responsibility that so many ignorant people can't handle. Then the pets are abandoned. You need to love this living being, and promise to nurture it. Are you a \\"good home\\" for a dog? You'll find out with this first step."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Getting a puppy can be an emotional response, not very well thought through. Our one year old son absolutely loves dogs, and we were thinking seriously of getting a puppy for the whole family, but particularly one he could grow up with and have as a best friend in his early years.Then we read this book. The author is down on puppies for small children. Also on letting puppies on the furniture, playing tug of war, and lots of other things. Reading through the book, I often felt it was consciously trying to take all the fun and spontaneity out of owning a puppy.The author, a professional dog trainer, lays out rules and tips for raising and training a puppy. Lots of great information, but also lots and lots of structure.That may not be a bad thing. In fact, it might be the best way to go about raising a puppy -- especially if you're a professional like the author. You can train your dog to do what you want, when you want, how you want. But if you find a more spontaneous and romanticized vision of dog ownership attractive, you may find this book stifling.What this book did for me was to convince me not to get a dog. That my family and myself weren't ready for the responsibility and problems. That it's a huge undertaking requiring discipline and from all concerned. If you find a hard, disciplined work ethic attractive, and maybe if you are the kind of person whose desk is always neat, then maybe this is the book for you. It provides a reality check, sobering advice, and a handy toolkit for asserting control in just about every aspect of your life together with your dog. And as we all know, control makes us all feel better.This book led me to the rational decision. But maybe sometimes rationality isn't, or shouldn't be, the bottom line. Maybe sometimes you just want to get a dog and enjoy its life together as true companions. Maybe sometimes you need to just go down the rabbit hole and learn to live with the consequences. If that is your vision, this book may just be a buzzkill.Your call."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I have a lot of experience with dogs -- search and rescue, AKC obedience and tracking titled dog, etc. I didn't expect to get anything out of this book, but was looking at it to see if it is one I would recommend to newer dog owners. Indeed it is. Hodgson offers some very good dog psychology in this book. I do wish there was more on clicker training and a few of her methods are a bit more \\"harsh\\" (though they aren't really harsh, just not as positive as they could be and still get top results). Overall, this is one of the best books out there for the new dog owner, whether they are getting a pup or an adult dog.Things of note in this book. I love that she points out some of the drawbacks of getting an older pup from a breeder. These are valid points that are seldom mentioned in books for the newer owner. The section on puppy selection doesn't have much to offer the advanced dog owner but offers far more info than the average \\"everything you need to know about your puppy\\" book. Chapter 5 presents excellent advice on dog \\"stuff.\\" When it comes to dogs and cats living together, Hodgson is overly optimistic about this when it comes to terriers and sighthounds, and doesn't give enough instruction on the topic. Cats may die as a result. Chapters 6 and 7 offers good information on dog psychology and bonding. She gives excellent information on setting an example for your pup, and how to socialize. This is much better than what I have seen in other books for new owners. There is interesting and helpful advice on thunderstorm fears, and it is applicable to other fears as well. Though she does not offer as much clicker training as I wish, she does a good job of explaining the basics -- she compares clicking to taking a photo of the behavior that you want. Many, many potential behavior problems are covered and she offers good advice on preventing or overcoming them. The book has the best chapter on housebreaking that I have seen. The books main flaws are in the health section. There is shallow coverage of medical/health issues with some odd comments. For example, on page 316, when discussing demodectic mange, Hodgson says, \\"Demodex mites, which are noncontagious, are usually transferred from a mother dog to her pups during nursing.\\" Does Hodgson know what noncontagious means. because that sentence seems to be contradicting itself.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"For first-time owner's - an ESSENTIAL GUIDE and confidence booster for raising a healthy pup.Everything from woe to go.Covers the first two years of your pup's life.What to do and achieve at each developmental stage of your pup's first year according to pooch's needs.SIMPLY GET IT.

While I do not agree with all aspects of it, I must admit MS Hodgson covers all aspects. Perhaps one of the better parts of the book is the fairly complete index in the back of the book, making it one to keep far longer than just the initial life of the puppy.

It became an obsession to them, but to their credit they did a lot of research by visiting the pound, Dumb Friends, local breeders, other owners and doing a bunch of reading. This book is the culmination of that process just before picking up our new addition. The girls give it a big thumbs up!Obtaining a new puppy feels to me similar to adopting a child. It's a big job. We have lots of cats and for the most part they do their own thing. A dog's another story. They need big time attention. We grew up with dogs and have general knowledge of their needs and behaviors. This book really helps to put a solid reason behind everything and gives you the basic know how to choose and take care of your youngster.I read some of the negative reviews, and I think they're being hard on the simple premise of the Dummie books- an easy, step by step way to get one going without tons of dull minutia. I enjoyed reading this one.It starts with laying out \\"what you're in for\\"- boy, is that the truth; a brief presentation on breeds; how your personality and needs fit your choice of animals- very important; searching for the pup; getting your place ready(again, it sounds like a baby coming); puppy needs- health, food, exercise and lots of love; dealing with basic problems(we love those reality shows with spoiled animals or children in need of a 911 Nanny or the Dog Whisperer). The kids loved the insert of color photos of cute dogs.This is a neat, general reference that will get you started and give you a foundation to do more studies and help with your decision making process.As for us, the girls chose, very wisely, a Zuchon- a cross between a Bichon Frise and a Shih Tzu from a neighborhood place called \\"Fuzzy Pups\\". They had visited there for the last couple years; the owners very much encouraged their visits and in the end, it was a perfect fit for all of us.

For example, the author recognizes that some puppies may actually like the Bitter Apple spray and she provides a different suggestion for another type of chew retardant. She also provides several different suggestions for dealing with a biting puppy and she differentiates between how to deal with biting skin vs biting pant legs, shoes etc.Re house training, there is advice on different approaches including paper training, crate training, puppy pads and a combination approach.

This book is written from the assumption that you have the luxury of searching for your perfect dog over a long period of time, and that any dog that ends up in your home will be perfectly suited to you and obey every command. I bought this book because I ended up with a very young puppy (less than 8 weeks) that had been dumped. I decided to keep it and raise it myself. But never having raised a puppy, I decided to get a little help from a book that seemed on the surface to know what it was talking about. The most often repeated bit of advice in this book? Never end up with a puppy that is less than 8 weeks old.I found this book utterly unhelpful and presumptuous. I have read several other For Dummies books, and have found them witty and insightful, but I have rarely in my life felt as talked-down-to as I did reading this book.Ultimately, I have decided to do the best I can with the advice of experts such as vets and training specialists, and to completely ignore this book altogether."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Like a lot of other reviewers said, this book was recommended to me by a few people. After reading it, I'm not really sure why. Maybe because these \\"Dogs for Dummies\\" books are plastered all over pet stores, so a lot of people buy them. I found the book to be extremely hard to follow, with no sensible flow. Granted, there are good points in the book, and a lot of the suggestions worked, and so I'm giving this book 3 stars instead of 1 or 2. I really wish this book were organized in terms of age of the puppy. It would've been helpful to have a large chapter dedicated solely to the first two weeks. Instead, there are bits and pieces of information regarding the first few very important weeks scattered through each chapter, under different headings. There are so many references to other chapters and pages, that I now have (ironically) dog-eared pages all over the place.That being said, I'm now going to try out \\"The Art of Raising a Puppy\\", which some friends who have raised numerous dogs (including K-9 unit service dogs) highly recommended as \\"the best puppy book on the market\\"."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I just want to lay out that no one book covers everything. A blend of various resources must be examined when venturing out into puppy-ownership-land. This book is good to acquaint you with the basics: assessing your lifestyle, gearing yourself (and family) up for owning a puppy, doing your homework on the breed, where to buy, what to get for the puppy (and your home)puppy stages, common problems, helpful tactics and solutions to said problems and fun stuff: training, games and commands. This book or the Complete Idiot's Guides are fine for this. I also recommend, like others, The Art of Raising a Puppy by the Monks of New Skete.Then, I recommend getting a breed specific book about training your dog. Breed profile books are helpful as well, but the real difference between each dog is temprement and breed-specific details, that usually rear themselves during the house-training and obedience training.Also, contacting the American Kennel Club and finding your breed's Club and asking breeders questions is also a good idea. Obviously, this advice is more geared towards purchasing a purebred puppy, but every breed also has Rescue chapters, if that is what you want.And, as always, ask your friends with dogs (who have taken an active role in puppy-rearing) and ask them questions and compare what you've learned. Visit their vet and ask them questions too.Once you get your puppy, I would also hang on to the breeder's info because they will continue to be a resource for the life of your dog and beyond.If this sounds like a lot of work or too much trouble, I would not recommend getting a pet. I do not mean to sound self-righteous, but I think raising a puppy is right up there with parenting, also something to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I was new to puppies, and didn't have a lot of time to read book after book. I thought the layout and the information in the book was wonderful. She gives several ideas on how to do things--based on your dogs personality not everything works--and tips on how to do it. I admit, that I did not always have my dog on a leash attached to my waist, but keeping your puppy with you is certainly better than having him wreaking havoc on your home while you're cleaning up his last mess!

Now that my puppy is 9 months old I can say that some of the info in the book was helpful (like explaing the stages of puppyhood), but most of it wasn't. I mean who on earth has time to tie their dog to themselves 24-7? It just isn't feasible if you have a job/kids/life. As another reviewer mentioned, she doesn't mention crate training which is probably one of the best tools for training a puppy. Also the information about exercise was wrong for my puppy breed (Rhodesian Ridgeback). She claims a Ridgeback just need 2 X 15 min exercise a day. I suppose if you want the dog to rip your house apart then that would be enough.Basically if you are going to get a puppy (and have no experience) I can offer some advice that would be a lot more helpful than this book.1) Crate training2) Reward good behavior, ignore bad behavior, be consistent3) Take your puppy to obedience training.The END"},{"Title":"Puppies For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Perhaps the most exhausting and least fun entry in the \\"Dummies\\" series. There are 360 numbered pages of tips for choosing a puppy and interacting with puppies and young dogs. In order to comprehensively follow the advice of the author one would need to single-mindedly dedicate their existence to the selection, care, and training of their new puppy. For the first six months they would be far too busy to miss the 95% of their lives that had to be abandoned in order to properly care for their new puppy. I suspect that anyone taking the book seriously would experience a huge amount of guilt and crippling worry should they allow a waking moment to pass without being 100% focused on puppy welfare.There is some useful information in this book, and it will help a new puppy owner to identify areas for which they should secure the additional information necessary for specific training and care. \\"Puppies for Dummies\\" is more about telling you what you should be doing rather than about how to actually do it.And if you want to discourage someone from taking on the responsibilities of pet ownership simply lend them this book.

My favorite was Puppies for Dummies, the 2000 edition.

Especially important was the timeline--what training the puppy needs at what age--in order to grow to her best potential. The organization is excellent with easy-to-locate topics: a detailed Table of Contents and a complete Index.Throughout the book, Hodgson stresses positive training and reinforcement, offering many important and helpful tips on how to be the most effective teacher you can be.I tried the \\"teaching-lead\\" Hodgson describes, keeping my puppy attached to me by a lead at all times at home.

Bielakiewicz, Andrea Mattei (which discusses the highly effective method of clicker training for dogs at length), these two books offer no-nonsense tips for raising my pup, not to mention the added bonus of teaching my pup over 10 commands in just days (!) with the aid of a clicker. Betsy Brevitz's \\"Hound Health Handbook\\" is also another excellent reference book which offers credible advise from a writer-turned-vet behind the award-winning [...]. These books are must-read for owners who are experiencing problems in obedience training and/or understanding their dogs.

I was a little disappointed that I didn't really care about her story; I was more interested in her meeting Slade than about this filmmaker. Also, what was the fixation with saying Jenny was a blonde with blue eyes? After the fourth time I read it, I was thinking \\"Okay, we get it. Please move on.\\" There were some characters in this novel that I still have no idea what they look like, but there's no way in the world I don't know that Jenny is blue-eyed and blonde-haired.Pros: Authors usually try to make the main character loveable, or at least make readers sympathize. Jenny had such a hard edge on her, that although tough to love, I had to admire her spunk. She refused to lean on any man to get by. She loved her job and she was good at it. I liked how outgoing and blunt she was with men, and learned a few things about research. Although I never wanted to be a reporter in my life for the exact same tactics in this book, it was interesting to read about the rivalry between her and Slaid.She ate some of the worst food in the world, but her jokes and dialogue at every single dinner tickled me. Jenny was a great main character to write about, and I liked her boyfriend too, as blunt as he was. I thought Slade had great charisma, especially in the Victoria's Secret scene. I'd want to meet Slade!I am a little skeptical of this title though, because the main character was so blahzay when it came to what men want. Personally, I think the title should have been \\"Who Wants That?\\" or something to that effect, because the main character went through relationships, career expectations, story lines, and even her friends went through transitions to better/hinder their future."},{"Title":"What Men Want (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"Dont'be fooled by Jenny Geroge's pain vanilla name. She's a reporter with with wit,drive, and plenty of resources who finds her match in her arch rival, the journalist, Slaid Warren. Their professional relationship is stormy and tense with an undercurrent of sexual energy that neither one of them accepts or acknowledges. As these two compete to one-up the other for the best stories, they find themselves together in the Caribbean, both going after a Hollywood Mogul with a dubious past. Add to this, Jenny's problems with Chris, her live-in-boyfriend, who is embraking on a little romantic adventure of his own and you have the ingredients of a lively, taut story.Deborah Blumenthal, whose first book, FAT CHANCE, I also loved, writes with verve and of humor.There are more than a few twists and turns in WHAT MEN WANT as Jenny George discovers that what she wants in more important than what men want.I found myself eagerly turning the pages to find out what was going to happen next.It is a highly entertaining and satisfying book, one I can recommend it with great enthusiasm."},{"Title":"What Men Want (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"Jenny George's most prepossessing problem at first is her name, it's so plain and perky that she never expects she'll be able to become a serious reporter. Then, she gets a shot at it, and she's in a race to get the goods on a charming, yet unethical film maker who may be guilty of serious white collar crimes. She's competing against her nemesis, Slaid Warren, for the story, and Slaid is not above using tricks to get the edge. While all that is going on, her personal life is going downhill behind her back as her live in boyfriend decides he literally wants a new model of girlfriend, a vapid covergirl he works with on an ad campaign. When the truth hits Jenny squarely in the face, she realizes how weak the old boyfriend is, and suddenly, Slaid starts to look a bit more interesting.*** Though at times the plot seems to meander, there is a coherence and intelligence in this novel that most books of the genre lack.

The sample on the fictious company Evergreen Lawn Care is very helpful as many aspects of how the business plans to succede are discussed.The only minor drawback is in the employment section. These days when people advertise for a job, a telephone number is not included due to control demand. Email addresses, fax numbers, and in rare cases mailing addresses are mentioned. Furthermore, since this book was published recently, the author should have stressed the importance of developing a website for employment issues as well as marketing and other concerns.Otherwise, this book is a very useful resource for the many people who are even mildly intrigued at the prospect of starting their own business."},{"Title":"How to Start a Business in New York City","review":"This is a valuable book (resource) for budding entrepreneurs. It seems to try to cover all the bases for starting a small business, but it can't do them all well in the space available between its covers. The book is only 288 pages long. If you are in the planning stages of starting a small business, then I highly recommend you get a copy of this book. Read it, study it, and outline it. There are helpful checklists to help you grasp the subjects. You will come up with a plethora of keywords and terms that you will want to google to find Web pages giving more detailed (and maybe more current) information.I am a SCORE counselor (Senior Corps of Retired Executives) who typically does face-to-face counseling sessions three nights a month. It would really be neat if my clients would read this book BEFORE they came to their session with me because they would pretty much be \\"educated customers\\" ready to ask educated questions. Our sessions would be so much more beneficial.My favorite chapters were:1. Initial business concerns2. Your business' structure3. Business start-up details5. Sources of business assistance (SCORE is mentioned here)7. Your smart business plan (and a good sample plan is included)8. Obtaining the financing you needThe book is weak when it comes to how the Internet can be used in corresponding, hiring, and marketing. But this is just one example of how googling keywords and concepts found in the book will make the book more complete. Don't treat the book as authoritative on the law. It isn't. Nor was it ever intended to be. It is light on tax information as it relates to small business.I was particularly impressed with the material presented in Chapter 2: Choice of Legal Entity. That subject is sorely ignored in most small business books, and it is critically important. It is a subject I regularly must spend a great deal of time discussing at my SCORE sessions. This book does a pretty good job on the topic.Chapters 4 and 9 through 12 are easy to find fault with. The topic of each could fill a book. But having these topics covered definitely will help a budding entrepreneur know some of the issues they raise.I would have liked the book more if Chapter 6 (marketing) had been less superficial. When I read it I got the impression that the author was more a public relations expert than a marketing expert. I generally categorize public relations as a subset of marketing. Marketing includes advertising, public relations, and a whole host of other promotion techniques. I did not get this message when I read the book. I also would have liked the book better if the Internet, email, and Web sites had been discussed more. But there are many books on those subjects. Therefore, I can't complain too much about the limited discussion of computers.When you read this book it may feel a little like it was produced on an assembly line. Maybe it was? There are 50 versions of this book sold; the only state I haven't found a copy for is Montana.

Yes, there were some Southern Jewish slaveowners. In 1830, there were about 225,000 Southern families who owned slaves, including 322 Jewish families. About 59,000 of the families owned twenty or more slaves, including 23 Jewish ones. About 11,000 of the families owned fifty or more slaves including 4 Jewish ones.

He is lying, and this book refutes those lies. It is informative and useful.If this book inaccurately quotes Louis Farrakhan, then its critics should use that as the basis for their dislike of it. When an author disproves a noted religious figure's statements, and that figure's adherents demonstrate an inexplicable refusal to deny that the statements were made, you can usually be certain that the author is correct.Louis Farrakhan demonstrates that you don't have to be a white Christian to be a dangerous racist spreading lies and promoting genocide---he's actually the only non-white non-Christian that I know of who is doing so in this country---but that's about all."},{"Title":"Ministry of Lies: The Truth Behind the Nation of Islam's \\"the Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews\\"","review":"I suspect, (and I am Man enough to say that I could be wrong) from the material presented here, that there is a huge degree of fallacy contained within the pages of this book. Let me point out a few things:1)It was stated that (European)Jewish slavers enslaved only pagan white slaves, and that Jewish slavers ceased to be involved in 1000A.D., 500 years before slaveships started carting off enslaved Africans out of Africa. Yes, there were some Africans who sold out their own African Brothers and Sisters, in service to their White Massa. Yes, there have been cases of white-on-white violence and enslavement, but if European Jews ceased to be involved in the slave trade, and if they were not involved in the TransAtlantic Slave Trade,and if European Jewish slave traders had no part whatsoever in enslaving Black people, as this book states, THEN HOW DID A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE all over the African Diaspora END UP WITH EUROPEAN JEWISH LAST NAMES such as WALKER, WINKLER, TURNER, COLEMAN, KAUFMAN, AND CONE? Malcolm X (and other Black and SOME White Historians) was not lying when he talked about how European slavemasters forced their names, particularly THEIR LAST NAMES, on African people, to signify their status as property of their WHITE slavemasters. Therefore, the purpose of the X is to signify the UNKNOWN AFRICAN NAME that Black people originally had before being enslaved.2)There is a lot of emphasis on the Arabs enslaving Africans, and I've seen a lot of white people and IGNORANT Black people say, \\"Why do you Black Muslims claim the religion of your Arab Slavemasters? Don't you know that Arabs were enslaving Africans before the TransAtlantic Slave Trade?!!!\\" First of all, yes, there were, and still are some Arabs that are and were enslaving Black people. And there were some cases where some Africans had other Africans in bondage. However, this is NO COMPARISON WHATSOEVER to, and DOES NOT NEGATE OR DIMINISH the slavery that EUROPEANS unleashed on AFRICANS, ASIANS, INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, OCEANIC PEOPLES, and SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLES OF COLOR. Why?1)It was the EUROPEAN who developed and practiced CHATTEL SLAVERY, which is designed to reduce the enslaved to a subhuman state by nearly killing the slave - a state less than a dog. Howard Zinn even states this very same thing in A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.2)And before anybody says, \\"Well,there were Free Black people who enslaved Black people, or Indians who enslaved Black people brutally in places such as Louisiana\\", let me say this: YOU CANNOT have Non-whites enslaving other Non-whites without first having WHITES ENSLAVING NON-WHITES.3)In the book, THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY, by Susanne Everett, she shows how GREEKS AND ROMANS were enslaving African peoples LONG BEFORE the Arabs even thought about it. The Arabs did not come into Africa until the 7th Century A.D. The Greeks came into Africa roughly around the 8th Century B.C., then the Romans came in roughly around the 3rd-2nd Century B.C. Obviously this would have been SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS (roughly around 1400-1500 some odd years) before the Arabs even touched African soil. Therefore, it is MATHEMATICALLY and TRUTHFULLY impossible and assinine to state, \\"well the Arabs were enslaving Blacks before the Europeans\\". Also:a)on pg.15, Susanne Everett states:It is an uncomfortable fact that the Greeks. . .were UTTERLY DEPENDENT on slavery. THE ABOLITIONOF SLAVERY IN GREECE WOULD HAVE DISRUPTED THEWHOLE FABRIC OF ITS SOCIETY. From the 6th centuryB.C. in ATHENS and otherGREEK CITIES, slavery effectively replacedother forms of dependent labor. For the Greeksof the classical period (480-338 B.C.) it wasUNTHINKABLE THAT SOCIETY SHOULD BE ORGANIZED INANY OTHER WAY. Plato's REPUBLIC was firmly basedON SLAVE LABOR, although he drew the line, in war,at enslaving his fellow Greeks - he advisedsoldiers to 'keep their hands off one anotherand turn their energies AGAINST FOREIGNERS'.b)On page 17, there is a picture of a Roman slavemarket, with 8 slaves. One of the slaves is aBLACK WOMAN; the other slaves are Whites ofdifferent ages, and genders.c)On page 12, there is an excerpt from THE ODDYSEY,dealing with slavery, and a caption which statesthat,\\"Slaves in Ancient Greece . . .were none theless the absolute CHATTELS of their masters. . .\\"d)On page 25 is a picture of a statue of a Nubian/Kemetan slave that was a house slave in a Greekhouse. The caption reads, \\"The Household SlavesOf Ancient Greece\\". A caption reads that thestatue is of, \\"a black slave boy probably boughtFROM THE UPPER NILE\\", and that he is leaningagainst an amphora, a Grecian vase.4)In the documentary, \\"A Great and Mighty Walk\\", The late great Dr. John Henrick Clarke talks about how the Ancient Africans were asking the Arabs to get their Greek and Roman slave masters off their backs. He says (and this is nearly an exact quote), \\"They (the Arabs) did get their European slavemasters off the Africans' backs - but the Arabs also REPLACED them on the African's backs\\". He goes on to show and discuss how the Arabs introduced Africans to Allah and the enslavement that they brought along with that.5)Michael Bradley, a white historian, talks about the Hyksos, a EURASIAN predecessor of White Jews, who invaded Kemet in the 15th Century B.C. and enslaved several of the Kemetan people (who by the way, WERE BLACK AFRICANS). He speaks of the hypocrisy of how the Exodus story has been taught to have us thinking that White Jews were enslaved in Egypt, when it was actually the other way around - the Hyksos, predecessors of White Jews, unleashed a brutal enslavement on the Black Kemetans, for roughly 400 some years (Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm............), until they were driven out by the Black Pharaoh Ahmose I. By the way, this would have been some 1500 years BEFORE the year 1000 A.D., when European Jewish slavers \\"ceased to be involved\\" in the slave trade, as this author would have people to believe.6)Before anyone yells out reverse racism or rants about this being \\"Anti-Semitic\\", let me quote Roman historian TACITUS who wrote this in the 1ST CENTURY (Hmmmmm. . .Who else lived in the 1st Century?Hint: he was hung on a cross):\\"Many say that the Jews come from ETHIOPIA.\\"7)Dr. Yosef Ben-Jochannon talks about the original Jews who were and STILL ARE of AFRICAN ORIGIN, in WE, THE BLACK JEWS.I don't agree with everything Farrakhan says, but he does speak a lot of truths that ameriKKKa refuses to deal with. I also doubt that the author of THIS BOOK has studied Farrakhan or the Nation of Islam with any serious depth to effectively critique what the N.O.I. has said, shown, and proved. I also doubt that he met with Tony Martin to discuss what Tony Martin published, either; or if he did, he probably had a MONOLOG instead of a DIALOGUE with Tony Martin. I also doubt that he has studied the ORIGINAL origins of the Jewish people, as I have stated in points 6 and 7, above. And I SERIOUSLY doubt that what I stated above, could be refuted, which in closing, would render Harold Brackman's book faulty.

What is/was the motive for even writing a refutation to the Nation of Islam's book? In analyizing the references and cross-referencing said references with the NOI book, it becomes apparent that Harold Brackman's sources are extremely faulty, outright distortions, with degrees of hyperbole mixed in.The main question a studious reader must ask is, what is it about the jewish people, both past and currently, incites so much examination? This examination includes the scisms within jewish culture, how jewish people conduct commerce, the defense of the nation/state of israel to name few. Harold Brackman's work, we come to find out has been paid for by his jewish employers. That fact alone is cause for some skepticism as to the acurracy of his sources and his motives for writing the book. Corrolatively, one has to ask a similar question regarding the NOI research department in writing their book.Since the jewish people's motives seemed to get attacked by various groups and individuals, it would be intelligent to answer the question, what precisely is anti-semitism, and is being jewish a racial category separate from the acrual religion of judiasm? Harold Brackman's work would have gone alot further in establishing a dialogue if the above questions had of been placed in his discussion, and answered cogently by jewish person's. Lastly, for the reader who is looking for a validation of vitrol against the NOI, Harold Brackman provides this activity. This work is not unbiased. As a reader of this work, I continually asked the question, is there a definition of racism clearly gleaned from this work or not. The answer was no! It would be much more sensible if jewish leaders convened an intelligent forum or conference, and addressed the NOI work to the public. If jewish leaders would do this, then this work might be taken a bit more seriously than simply a BLACK male scholar being used as a pawn in a very trecherous game.This book is not work it's purchase price!!"},{"Title":"Ministry of Lies: The Truth Behind the Nation of Islam's \\"the Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews\\"","review":"Obviously the author of the following quote is a .........?\\"demonstrates that you don't have to be a white Christian to be a dangerous racist spreading lies and promoting genocide---he's actually the only non-white non-Christian that I know of who is doing so in this country\\""},{"Title":"Outback Husband (Romance, 3594)","review":"[from the back of the book] **** RIGHT MAN -- WRONG MOTIVE!Juliet Laing couldn't bring up twin toddlers and run her beloved cattle station single-handed.

It is written very much in the way of an armchair political scientist sitting in England and musing on the happenings in this far away, exotic land.Ponderously written and poorly researched, this tale follows a GRU officer and his estranged wife who decided to stay with the Afghan rebels, and her lover, the leader of the tribe, the leader of the tribe, and the action of the invasion and resistance.Choppy and difficult to piece together at some points and containing more than a few grammatical errors and misspellings, this book is sometimes very difficult to read. Islamic sounding names are giving everyday objects to make the narrative sound authentic and exciting but it falls terribly flat.The characters are dim, very shallow and terribly predictable. Obtuse dialogue and impossible at best scenes are everywhere to be found. World events are forgotten and the writer concentrates too much on the stiff, story board characters and what he thinks they must be like and less on the flow of the account of what's supposed to be going on.I was very disappointed with this book.

The author, an investigative reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, however has written a fairly balanced biography that neither embraces Thomas nor condemns him. In fact, although the author did not have access to the Justice's private papers and correspondence, he did extensively interact with Thomas in covering the Court and in researching this volume. This is not to say the book is without deficiencies. The most notable problem is that a very limited amount of attention is devoted to Thomas's decisions. Instead, readers are referred by the author to Gerber's First Principles: The Jurisprudence of Clarence Thomas for in-depth analysis. The focus here is predominantly biographical and that has strengths and weaknesses in doing a judicial biography. The acid test of any Thomas biography, of course, is the Anita Hill controversy; here the author is somewhat too inclined to stake out an unsatisfying middle position: \\"Although it was plausible that Thomas said what Hill alleged, it seems implausible that he said it all in the manner Hill described\\"(at 251). Whatever one's views of Thomas, this book does afford a valuable insight into the forces that shaped him and how he ended up arriving on the Court. It will be interesting to see how Thomas's own forthcoming autobiography addresses the same issues as are covered here."},{"Title":"Judging Thomas: The Life and Times of Clarence Thomas","review":"Several years ago, The Weekly Standard ran a cover story calling Clarence Thomas the most powerful conservative in America. He truly was at that time.Foskett does a fair job stripping away the controversy and polemic to examine the man, his background, and his life. There is obviously the story of Thomas' confirmation to the Supreme Court, and a fair amount of time is devoted to those few weeks in the Justice's life. Far more interesting than that is his life before Washington, and before the political appointments, while he was still growing up under the stern eye of his grandfather, Myers Anderson.Without understanding the world that incubated Thomas it is impossible to understand why he could view the world and the American judicial system as he does. To understand Clarence Thomas more fully one must understand Myers Anderson, the dominant force in his early years. Foskett accounts for the apartheid caste system of the Jim Crow south that trapped and warped so many people.Passionate reactions about Thomas will exist for a long, long time. His ideas stand on their own merit. This book truly gives the reader a glimpse at the humanity of a man who thinks for himself and will set the judicial tenor of the court for years to come."},{"Title":"Judging Thomas: The Life and Times of Clarence Thomas","review":"Few people are dispassionate about Clarence Thomas, but the author manages to hold passion in abeyance in presenting a well balanced -- and in many ways, inspirational -- review of the Supreme Court Justice's life and times. Love him or loathe him, it's hard for any reader not to come away from this book with enhanced respect for Thomas. . . for his success in overcoming obstacles in Jim Crow southern Georgia; for his equanimity and courage during the Senate confirmation process; and for the personal warmth and compassion that he masks behind a taciturn, often dour public demeanor. The author goes to great lengths to show how the values forged by Thomas's grandfather, Myers Anderson -- self-reliance, industriousness, relentless work ethic, pride, individual charity, skepticism toward government -- have helped to inform the Justice's worldview. The reader does not have to march in lockstep with Thomas's views to admire his Horatio Alger lifestory."},{"Title":"Judging Thomas: The Life and Times of Clarence Thomas","review":"I was left wanting more. I felt the book was written to achieve a certain number of pages instead of providing me information about Judge Thomas.

I was not interested in reading so much informatin about the people who employ him or the people he met on his life journey.The book did address some of Judge Thomas early social ideas, but the book seem to be written without much input from Judge Thomas.

Anyone could watch Anita and tell she was a liar; it was all over her face, and was apparent in her demeanor. That woman had one objective, and every left-wing wacko, radical feminist, socialist, communist,and liar on the planet tried to support her false claims that she twisted into ugly lies about innocent events.These \\"reviews\\" are a waste of time.

It seems like every time the book makes it onto a school reading list, someone, somewhere, challenges it. (It's ironic that the book also landed on Laura Bush's list of the ten best novels for people of all ages, since the ones who challenge books are oftentimes the same ones who follow mindless, slavish devotion to the Bush regime.) That's the sort of thing that attracts me like a fly to honey, because no one ever challenges books for the right reasons. When it comes right down to it, there's only one right reason to challenge a book on a school's reading list: because it's a bad book. I'm sure there's someone out there who would say of people who challenge books because they have \\"bad language\\" or \\"champion the homosexual agenda\\" or are in some way \\"explicit\\" that they're doing what they believe in their heart to be the right thing, and so are honorable. I'm not one of those people. I think they should all be rounded up and carted off to form their own community in Kansas, where they can all be on the school board and choose all the books in the school library to make sure nothing offensive ever passes the eyes (and minds) of their beloved oversheltered rats. (It would make a great social experiment, too, and the parents' heads would explode when their kids still managed to discover sex and profanity without ever once having read Catcher in the Rye. But I digress.) In any case, I have found it very rare that these two conflicting reasons for trying to get a book out of the hands of the nation's school students intersects. But, after eleven months of trying to stomach this dog, I confess that this is one of those times. I do think this book should be kept away from schoolchildren. Not because of any explicit content; I must not have gotten far enough to find the offending scene(s) (or the parents of today are even more sensitive than I berate them for being). Just because it's the kind of book that a kid gets assigned in school, suffers through, hates, and then takes one more step down the path to abandoning reading because it's such a damnable chore. If I'd have had to stomach this in high school, I might have ended up feeling the same thing. Nothing of any consequence whatsoever happens during the portion of this book I read (and I admit that I used the strictest possible interpretation of the fifty-page rule on this one). We get so little character development that there's no justifying of nothing happening during the portion of this book I read. And it lacks entirely the readability that would have kept me going past fifty pages despite having no character development or plot advancement. I find myself wondering what on earth those first fifty pages were for, and why some merciful editor didn't make massive cuts to them. I'm sure that any information that would later become useful could have been distilled into a tenth of the space. But I'm not to put myself through, extrapolating from the time I've already spent trying to make myself read this, another three and a half years to see if I'm right. Onto the bonfire it goes.

I'm not disputing the validity of the chicano experience, but this book renders it artificial, flat, and unbelievable.A very basic story line that might have been interesting if explored more deeply is embellished with false conflicts. The family disagreement over the right way to make a living - cowboys versus farmers - is explored in its few nuances early on, but superimposed over the entire remainder of the novel to the point of grinding boredom. A little boy (our narrator) runs out of his house at night and is positioned to witness several people murdering a man, who just happens to die right next to where the boy is hiding, looking into his eyes while breathing his last.

The merging of cultures within the book resonated with our complementary units, and the protagonist's search for identity resonated developmentally with the young adolescents. Below are several of their reviews after reading the book. I hope they're helpful!Bless Me, Ultima was assigned to me in my 7th grade language arts class, and like most of the books I am assigned to read, I was not too excited. This book surprised me, though, with the beauty of its writing. The twists and turns of its plot kept me begging for more. Young Antonio Marez is growing up in the llano of New Mexico. He is struggling with finding his identity and choosing over his mother's culture of peaceful farmers and his father's culture of rough and loud vaqueros. Along with this issue Antonio struggles with retaining his innocence and accepting the fact that he is growing. When Ultima comes to live with them she shares advice and knowledge that guides him through these difficulties and teaches him about his true self. She makes him think deeply about his fate and where his faith lies, where as Antonio's mother is always pushing him to be a priest and does not even consider his opinion. Without the guidance and knowledge of Ultima his journey into manhood would be much more difficult. This is a great book if you are looking for a book about coming of age and finding your identity or just a book to savor and enjoy the writing. --Claudia B.Bless Me, Ultima is a fantastic book. When I was assigned to read it in my seventh-grade Language Arts class, I wasn't too excited about it. But as I read more of it and thought about the deeper meanings, Bless Me, Ultima started to grow on me. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. The concepts in this book are deeper than those in most I have read. This is especially true when Tony, the protagonist, is learning his life lessons. The one that stood out to me the most was a quote that his mentor Ultima said: \\"You are growing, an growth is change. Accept the change, make it part of your strength.\\" I like this quote because it is true. Growth is change, and change is the only thing one can depend on in life. I found that the book was all about Tony's transition from his childhood to his young adulthood. He matures tremendously throughout, and I enjoyed seeing how he confronted various decisions. --Christina N.I am a seventh-grade student who read this book in a Language Arts class. This book, though I had never heard of it, is actually fantastic. When we first started reading, I was not excited, but after getting into it and realizing the deeper meanings, the book grew on me. The protagonist Antonio Marez, is a small boy living on the border of New Mexico in a small town called Guadaloupe surrounded by the llano (New Mexico desert) and farmland. Even at a small age, Tony sees death and murder. Many of the soldiers returning home from WWII are sick with war and go mad. Also, Tony's family friend Ultima comes to live with them for her last years of life. Tony knows that Ultima is a curandera (healer) and that she uses magic to help people escape from curses put on them by brujas (witches). Ultima heals Tony's uncle and makes enemys along the way. Immediately, Tony is faced with choices involving what he will do when he grows up, what religion will guide him, and whom he should trust or fear. By the end of the book, Tony sees death, hate, and madness. I recommend this book for all ages who want a good read and likes to think. --Ben K.I am a seventh-grade student who recently read Rudolfo Anaya's Bless Me, Ultima. At first I was really irritated with the book, but then the plot started thickening and it got more interesting. Plus, discussing the book with the rest of my class helped me get a better understanding. While I do not recommend this book to someone who wants an easy vacation book, this would be a great choice for a book group. I'd recommend this to middle school teachers for their classes, too, as it enables a lot of discussion and debate. --Alexis T.I'm a seventh-grader and I read this book because it was assigned. It was a good book that starts out slow but gets better the further you get. In the book, seven-year-old Antonio has a relatively normal life until he witnesses a murder and Ultima, a mysterious curandera (healer), moves in. Then he starts to see life in a different way. Bless Me, Ultima is a well-written book, but read the first few chapters before you judge for yourself. --Sophie B.Bless Me, Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya is a wonderful book. It is about a young boy named Antonio Marez and his striving to find himself. I'm a seventh-grade student and was assigned to read it in Language Arts class. At first I didn't like it because I thought it was moving very slowly, but as I read on and we talked about it in class, I found the deeper meaning. The book has to move a little slowly in order to get all of the information and details that really do make a difference. Once I finished the book and went back over it in my mind, I understood the book even more. Anaya gives you little hints throughout the book that you only realize in your subconscious. Many of these hints are in Antonio's dreams, which I did not pay close attention to until the end, so be sure you do! --Phoebe A.I have just finished reading the book Bless Me, Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya with my 7th grade Language Arts class. This book is about a young Mexican boy named Antonio Marez. Antonio has some hard decisions to make. Specifically, he feels that he must choose whether he is going to follow his mother's dream and become a priest, or if he will pursue his father's and become a vaquero and roam the land. I really enjoyed reading this book because it really makes you pay attention to what you are reading. --Marlene S.I am 13 and in my Language Art class we read Rudolfo Anaya's Bless Me, Ultima. It might be slow at first, but once it gets going it is a hard book to put down. It will keep you interested until the end. Religion plays a major role in this book, with the protagonist Tony and his family living in one house. His parents have different religions, but are still able to love each other and co-exist. Tony's mother Maria is a devout Catholic and believes in God. Tony's father Gabriel does not have a strong religious faith. They raise the kids Catholic, going to church, talking about sins, and praying. This leaves Tony with hard decision about what religion and direction he will choose. This book opens up your eyes to the world around you. --Gabie H.Bless Me, Ultima is a breath-taking novel by Rudolfo Anaya. This book balances religion, Spanish folktales, and identity in a mysterious way. I have completed this reading in language arts class. It has been a fantastic experience, and I recommend this wonderful book to anyone who enjoys a deep, meaningful read. The protagonist's name is Antonio Marez. He is the youngest of six children. He lives in a religious world, near Guadeloupe. His mother is a devout Catholic and comes from the Luna family, a family of farmers. Antonio's father is a Marez, a roamer of the llano (plains). Then Tony's life changes, completely. Ultima the curandera (a healer) comes to live with the family. She is filled of wisdom, magic, and mysterious powers. Some people acknowledge her as a bruja (witch). As Antonio grows at Ultima's side, he begins to see things a different way. --Andrea B."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I read this within a weekend. Loved it.

It is different from other books i've read.This story is about a young boy named Antonio. He lives in Las Pasturas, New Mexico with his 2 sisters, his mom and his dad (Maria and Gabriel). His 3 other brothers are away at war. Antonio's grandma comes to live with Antonio and his family because she is too old to take care of herself.It starts off slow but in the middle and end of the story is when everything happens.In the story, Antonio, who is only turning 7, has trouble deciding what he wants to be when he grows up. When Ultima comes to lives with them she has a major influence on Antonio's life. Since Ultima is a curandura, a person who heals people using herbs, Antonio is mostly around Ultima most of the time so it effects what Antonio's mothers dreams are. Antonio's mother wants him to be a priest because she thinks he can be the most successful one out of the family.Each person has their own little accomplishment that they want. Antonio's father, Gabriel, wants to move to California with his sons to get away from the small town. Antonio's 3 older brothers want to move away from their family and live their own life alone after coming back from the war because they think that they are old enough. Ultima wants to teach Antonio about being a curandura but his mother wants him to be a priest.This story basically teaches about religion and good verses evil. Also about life. Antonio struggles with life, what he wants to be when he grows up. Ultima and Tenorio represent good verses evil in the story. Tenorio is angry because he thinks Ultima put a curse on him and his family and he thinks that he caused his daughters to get sick and die. Tenorio rebells throughout the story against Ultima and he won't let go of his beliefs. He says that he wants to kill Ultima and will some day.Gabriel is really hard headed about things. He always wants things his own way, but at the end of the story he changes and he is more understanding about Antonio and his family.Overall, I think this story teaches about life and religion. It is a good book if you are really intrested in religion."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me Ultima was something new to me. I learn alot about the culure and background about spanish culture and religion. It is a very spiritual book about a 7 year-old (Antonio) journey of growing in the town of El Puerto. He is then rejoiced and joined by the goodness of Ultima. Ultima in the story plays as his guider and mentor about his beliefs and life in his environment. As a little kid growing up he has alot of questions and is very curious about his beliefs. Throughout the novel he tries to find himself, comes across many decisions that effects the way he is. He encounters many people and many deaths (this is too much for a little boy) but still these occurence helps him through his way of being a man. He tries see points of view and and contrast whats good and bad. He is influenced by people and see's the actions of other people; as Ultima symbolizes good and Tenorio as evil. He becomes in touch with internal conflicts of what to do with his life, since his parents want two separate things they want him to be. I recommend this book for anyone who trying to understand how things are because you may relate to it.

The book contained several parts where the author used graphic language that would be inappropriate for younger readers, and they would curse in Spanish and in English. I think that the book had a strong plot, and there were points where the book was drab such as the beginning where it told about where they lived, and other parts where the book was very entertaining such as the part where Ultima cured Lucas. I think that his portrayal of Antonio as a little child was very good because little children are those who are still trying to figure out what is true and where they want to go.I think that I would read other books written by Rudolfo Anaya because I thought that this was one book that really entertained me. My first impression of the book was it was boring and a waste of paper to write about just by reading the back, but after reading the book itself, I thought otherwise. The many deaths and actions done by certain characters made this book very good. I think that if there was no violence in this book, I wouldn't have thought this book was good. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading about the journey of life. Though many of us don't have the extremes of seeing death before our eyes, we face death everyday.I would rate this book a four out of five because I thought that it was one of the greatest books written that I have read. I have never read a book of this type, but after reading Bless Me Ultima, I am considering reading these types of books more often. I do think that this book should become a movie due to the fact that there was much action occurring through the book. Basically, I thought that Bless Me Ultima was a very well written book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"As a requirement of our English II class for Ms. Roberts, we had to read Bless Me, Ultima. I know that many of my classmates found it to be a joke, but I quite liked the book. It was monotonous at times, but the action still kept coming. It showed the biggest differences between good and evil. Bless Me, Ultima made me realize that a person at a young age has to make very important decisions concerning his or her future. Tony, the main character, was always making decisions based on what he was taught and who taught him. For instance Ultima taught him how to use herbs and how to attain them with respect to the Earth. Later on in the book he had to attain herbs with Gabriel, his father, and he did not have Ultima with him.Tony had to decide what his real religion was in a way. His mother wanted him to become a priest, but not only a priest. He would be the first priest in the family since his ancestors, the Lunas, came to Las Pasturas. Then again there was Cico, a friend, telling him about the Golden Carp and his godly ways. What was he to believe?Bless Me, Ultima also showed the hardships that one could endure while they are growing into a young adult. Tony had to learn how to speak English, while he came from a Spanish-speaking family. He was well educated and he loved to learn. People were always encouraging him to go far. The gang, however, didn't pay any attention to his itelligence except for when he took his first communion and when he was skipped to the third grade.The battle of good and evil in this book has been greatly portrayde. Ultima taught Tony what was good and what was evil. Tenerio was always threatening Ultima and the local townspeople that protected her. Tenerio's daughters were barujas or witches that do black magick. Ultima opposed their magick and brought peace to Las Pasturas and el llano (the llano is a large flat ground that is level.The one thing that I did not like about this book is it left you hanging at the end. Rudolfo Anaya did not tell you what Tony became when he became an adult. I was interested to find out what he became since this is what the book is basically based on. I wondered if he followed his Marez blood and become a vaquero (a cowboy) or follow his mother's wishes and become a priest for the Catholic religion."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima was a good book. Rudolfo Anaya really captured the magic of good end evil using Ultima symbolizing good, and Tenorio Trementina and his three daughters as evil. Mr. Anaya did a good job describing the Catholic religion in the book, by describing a few of the stories like how the Virgin Mary became patron of Mexico.Antonio Marez, main character of the book, tells the story. His parents, Maria Luna and Gabriel Marez, both want him to choose a path for his future that is related towards each of their own families. His mother wants him to become a farmer or a priest like her side of her family, but his father wants him to be a vaquero (cowboy).Ultima moves him and teaches Antonio about the magic of good and evil. I am Hispanic, so I understood everything that was said and the magic of the book. By the end of the book he witnessed 4 deaths, Lupito, Narisco, Florence, and Ultima.The main focus of the book is about the powers of good and evil. It talks about evil witchcraft, and the good powers of a curandera (healer). Ultima healed one of Antonio's uncles by breaking a curse the three Trementina Sisters, witches and daughter of Tenorio, put on him.I really recommend the book to those who have descent knowledge of Spanish. I do warn that there's a lot of profanity in Spanish. Disregarding that, I really liked it, so I give it a 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"The book Bless Me Ultima was not a book I willingly chose to read.

Two of his brothers leave and one stays. Antonio did so well during first grade, his teacher skipped him to third grade.Antonio through out the book has many internal conflicts about religion and Ultima. Antonio's mother wants him to grow up to become a priest and his father wants him to become a farmer. It seems that Antonio doesn't do anything he wants to do, his parents pick everything out for him. It seems through the whole book, he spends all his time pleasing his parents. Towards the ending of the book, Antonio loses his innocence witnessing deaths and the actions of those closest to him.I'm not going to reveal anymore about the book, but I don't really recommend this book. The beginning of the book is extremely boring and doesn't get the slightest bit interesting until the 14th chapter."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"When my English teacher told me that I had to read a novel for class, I was very upset. I felt that I had something better to do than to read another dumb boring book. I am glad that my teacher decided to have us read this book this year.Bless Me, Ultima was a great tale. It was very involved and full of drama. I liked how Rudalfo Anaya was always combining Spanish with English to give the book a certain aura. I am not a native speaker of Spanish, but I do have Spanish class and I knew some of the phrases and words that he used in the book. He described some of the most important cities and named them in Spanish. The llano is a great example of descriptive writing. A llano is a large flat ground.Mr. Anaya brings the llano and las pasturas to life in one's imagination through the vivid descriptions that he used- both in English and in Spanish.If you read this book, I believe that you will find that it is very enjoyable. I found myself engulfed in it. It is truly a page-turner.

They way Tony's struggles are described and the use of the dreams .... it is amazing. Do your self a favor ... read this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Ok. So the book was pretty good. I think the last couple of pages were the best... but i don't see what everyone is talking about when they say that the theme of this book is so rich and this and that, but what is the theme. Is it that with life one learns, or is it a good is stronger than evil. the latter of the two comments is what i hear most often, but for those of you who have read the book the ending sure didn't follow that latter theme. So basically i'm posing a question: what do you think the strongest theme of this book is?"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Anaya takes the reader on a ride inside the heart and mind of a little boy growing up in New Mexico.

If you are interested in Hispanic culture and traditional medicine, this book offers interesting insight."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I LOVED the book because of the message and the lesson it tries to send to all of us. If you really think about it, Anaya is asking us a question that relates to the question: Why do bad things happen to good people? The drunkard was trying to help Ultima, yet was killed in the process by Tenorio, who was not punished for this sin. Later, when Antonio asks God in his dreams to forgive the drunkard, God replies, &quot;I will forgive him, if you also ask me to forgive Tenorio.&quot; When Antonio says no, he realizes that he wants a God who is forgiving, yet only to the people he wants to forgive. I believe that Anaya is trying to tell us that we must believe in what we believe in, and not what others tell us to. Just like Antonio, who battled between Mother and Father, Luna and Marez, God and Golden Carp, Ultima and Antonio, we see that at the end, Antonio comes to a conclusion that he is all of these yet only one. He is both a Luna and a Marez. Anaya is telling us to draw from our own experience, and live life like that. Only then will we reach our true destiny, neither good or bad."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"A powerful message that Rudolfo Anaya is sending out.

He is pulled and tugged between his father, a llanero whose lifestyle is already dying and his mother, whose family are farmers named Luna and who have the strength of those who can bring life from the land. His mother's family is descended from the first priest in the region--something his father warns him they don't like to talk about. Tony, the protagonist, also must struggle to emerge from the conflict between his Hispanic cultures and the larger culture outside his small town--a struggle his brothers are losing in their return from World War II. The struggle also leads him to explore the local Native lore of the Magic Carp. Tony's understanding that everyone struggles all their life for answers emerges under the tutelage of his grandmother, the strong but gentle Ultima, a traditional curnadera. He comes to realize that life is a struggle for meaning and that understanding comes from that struggle--not from a miraculous inspiration. This story is a great one for young or old.

The relationship between the mother and father and the two different worlds they come from was the most interesting part of the story. And to see the way this affected the children.

One in particular was the internal conflict that the main character Antonio has. However, Antonio's internal conflict is made less complicated when Ultima, the curandera, came to live with Antonio's family. With Ultima living with Antonio, the family dymanics change. This change helps develop the novel and the main conflict.This change made me realize how the novel fits into the American Culture. You see, Ultima experiences a new life with a new family. That causes changes in her lifestyle. How does that fit into American Culture? If you think about it, the people that migrant to the United States change their lifestyles because they are in a new environment. Like Ultima, they experience conflict in their new lifestyle.When Ultima enters her new family, neighbors gossip and begin calling her a witch. Similiarly, people call immigrants names like \\"mojado\\" or \\"wetbacks\\" because they cross a river to enter the United States."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This is an excellent book depicting the cuentos of our ancestry.

Anaya is an amazing writer. His prose is beautiful. His story is fascinating, telling the tale of a Latino boy growing up in the American Southwest over a half-century ago.

At first I was rather dissappointed with the book, and I still am because I am religiously opposed to many of the eliefs mentioned, but I must admit that it holds literary work worthy of credit. It allows the reader to have a peek into the Chicano culture and see their beliefs which are a mix of Catholicism and traditional. Witches and the like are believed to exist in the WWII time-based book. The novel focuses primarily on the struggle of a young boy, Antonio, to discover God, or, the being that controls everything. It truly is a magnificent novel in its style, sccenery, imagery, etc. My one, or two complaint(s) about it is that it conatins the dreaded &quot;F&quot;-word in it. Also, it contains several somewhat graphic scenes involving witchcraft-like happenings and some gory fights/deaths. Even though it has all of this I still would reccommend it.

Growing up with the mix of cultures and superstitions of Spaniards and Native American makes you wonder about the true god.

The reality of the relationship of many Hispanics with the occult, and how Catholicism is often mixed with Santeria, and espiritismo is exposed in this book.Anaya is a great writer, very easy to read, but you do need to know some Spanish, and some Spanish Culture to really understand this book.I wish that this book would have helped some to break free from superstition and occultism.

If I needed a nap, this story never let me down. It took me hours to read just a few pages. I would sit down to read the book and then after a few minutes my eyes would get heavy and dry and the story never helped me wake up. I would rather sit around looking at the ceiling and counting how many holes there are in it. Or maybe even see how many fibers I could count in the carpet. Any of those things were more interesting than \\"Bless Me Ultima\\".The story was so boring. It's about a 7 year old boy who can't decide whether he should be a priest and a farmer like his mom wants him to be or a vaquero like his father wants him to be. Personally, I wouldn't be wondering what I want to be when I grow up at seven years old. I would be out back climbing trees and walls and playing tag with friends and riding my bicycle around. When he finally decides that he wants to follow his mother's dream, then he starts questioning the meaning and the warrant of religion. This is another thing that a seven year old wouldn't be doing in his free time or anytime at all. The story was obviously told from an older person's view and should be portrayed in that older person's view.Another annoying thing about the book was the frequent use of Spanish throughout the dialogue. I don't speak Spanish so this put a real hamper on my pleasure of reading the book (if any at all). The Spanish always ruined the mood of the events happening. It made you stop and think, &quot;What is this person trying to say.&quot;I was waiting the whole book for it to get interesting, but it never did. There started to be a little bit of action towards the end of the story, but then it stopped with the end of the book.Another thing I didn't enjoy was the frequent use of symbolism. I am not a fan of symbolism. I wish that writers could just tell it as it is without having to show it as something else.The only reason why I gave this book one star was because that was the least that I could give it. If I had a chance to, I would rather give it no stars. I guess you could say that that one star was for giving me long nights of great sleep.Thanks everyone for hearing me out.-MACKEY"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me Ultima is one of the unsurpassed book I had read in all my life because it is thrilling and attention-grabbing. My favorite character is Antonio because he is courageous. Bless Me Ultima tells you about how Latin people live and their cultures. What I liked about the book is that it has Spanish words in it like ! una mujer con un diente, que llama a toda la gente. I thought that was really creative. What I didn't like about the Bless Me Ultima is that the brothers could have been nicer. I advocate Bless Me Ultima to people who know how to read Spanish and to people who like superstition and mystery books."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"For being a fairly short book, it took me a long time to drag myself through this one. For one, I had to wonder if an editor had even glanced at this book. A lot of the writing and dialogue reads as if written by someone with English as a second language. Sometimes to the point of making the writing so cheesy, I had to stop and put the book down a moment and rub my head in exasperation. The story doesn't flow well, and sounds very contrived.I couldn't help rolling my eyes at some of the characters. Primarily the side characters such as Antonio's school friends. A character named \\"Horse\\" that actually neighs and whose eyes roll back into his head when he's nervous? Not to mention that Antonio's friends seemed to have a vocabulary of about three words. \\"Damn.\\" \\"Chin**da!\\"(The Spanish \\"F\\" word) and \\"Bullsh**t!\\" One of the primary reasons I avoid Chicano books is because authors tend to make the characters very obnoxious, and this book is no exception. It definitely doesn't help that you can literally count 20 exclamation marks on a single page. I don't believe I've ever encountered as many exclamation marks in my life as I have in the pages of this book. Virtually every single dialogue line ends in an exclamation mark.On the whole, I'm assuming the primary reason this book gets such high reviews is because of the \\"thought provoking questions\\" the author brings up in the book. Though I feel it's hardly any more than a person would consider with a little introspection of their own. I honestly cannot understand why so many high schools have this as required/recommended reading for English class, of all things. Philosophy, social studies, something along those lines, perhaps, but this book does not belong in an English class."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless me, Ultima is a book that takes place in New Mexico, in Las Pasturas, it's about a young boy that is growing up, and is too mature for his age.

If you like action packed books, filled with mystery and magic, this is the one. It's never boring and a really powerful book that might just leave you questioning life itself.

Antonio is torn betw his father's cowboy side of the family who ride on the llano and his mother's village and farming relations. Many conflicts are presented here: Hispanic vs American culture, Catholicism vs paganism, parents' expectations vs the child's desires, Spanish blood vs native blood.Antonio's life is forever altered when his aunt Ultima, a curandera (healer) comes to live with the family; she teaches Antonio many things, most importantly how to gather the self-knowledge that will help carry him into adulthood."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I have just finished reading Bless Me, Ultima in my English class and I can say that it is a good choice.The book is about a young Mexican boy, Antonio Marez, growing up in New Mexico during the mid 1940s. It begins when he is six years old, and Ultima, a curandera or healing woman, comes to live with his family because she is getting too old to live by herself. Through Ultima's gentle guidance and support, Antonio faces his uncertainties and learns to go on with life.Antonio's parents are opposites, his father being a Marez, people of the llano (the desert land in New Mexico), and his mother being a Luna, farmers and people of the moon and the earth. His father wants Antonio to grow up free to roam the land and become a vaquero, as he once was. His mother wants Antonio to be a priest, a man of learning. Antonio is torn between them regarding his future.Throughout the story, Antonio also faces confusion over religion and spirituality. Ultima believes in God, but she also believes and works magic. But there is no evil in Ultima and Antonio is confused over Catholicism. His mother wants him to become a priest, and though he does believe in God, he wants understanding from Him, answers to his many questions.From a very young age, Antonio witnesses death. Death of a war-crazed man, Lupito. Death of a good family friend, Narcisco. And finally the unjust death of Ultima, killed by an evil man vowing revenge on Ultima for the death of his two daughters who were brujas (witches).Through the trials he is faced with and the death of his beloved mentor, Ultima, Antonio learns to go on with life and leave the past behind. He realizes the power of good over evil and understands that truth is more powerful than that which is prescribed by custom.A lot of what goes through Antonio's mind through the story is similar to the questions I have had through growing up. I can relate to him and to the other characters in the book. And I have learned that mankind is no different in spite of age, race, religion, culture, and upbringing.Kudos to Rudolfo Anaya for his first novel that brings Mexican-American culture to the reader and a genuinely poignant &quot;growing up&quot; story that can be read by all ages."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"&quot;Bless me Ultima&quot; is a wonderful story based on the &quot;Chicano&quot; or Northern New Mexico native people culture, religion, and customs that tells us about the relationship between a six year old boy called Antonio and an Old wise Lady called Ultima who is a &quot;curandera&quot; or healer, and how Anotonio faces a lot of difficulties and has to deal with curses, healings, dead people and mean friends and becomes a man of learning throughout his chilhood with Ultima's help.Since the author is from Northern New Mexico and the book takes place in two real small villages called Las Pasturas and Puerto de Lunas wich are located North of New Mexico i think Rodulfo Anaya put a little bit of his life experience into the story to remark the origins of a culture that tends to dissapear as new Chicano generations come to this world which makes the book more exciting and more valuable.I really enjoyed reading this book because i could follow the story very well considering that english is my second languaje and that i'm still having some problems with grammar and sentence structures and because i like reading mythical stories and i'm very familiar with them. Another aspect of this book that i liked and i found familiar was that New Mexican culture and Colombian and Latin Americna culture in general have a lot of things in common such as believing in ghosts, witches, curses, spirits, etc; and that the religion is the same and that there are not really too many differences within it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima is ultimately a novel about belief. In Southwestern America, there are many systems of belief which compete for the devotion of an individual--Catholicism brought by the Spanish, polytheism which has existed for thousands of years, and the worship and adoration of nature itself. This book is a story of a young man, Tony, and his quest for truth. He encounters all of these systems of belief, and endures a great deal of suffering in his youth. These experiences mold him, and the book focuses on his attempt to find the great truth amidst so much hardship and among so many types of faith.Anaya is a great storyteller, and this book certainly does not lack in action. The supernatural element is very strong, and very compelling, and the novel leaves a strong impression of unity and harmony with nature, even in the face of a very real and very powerful evil. This struggle of faith is very well represented in the book.I do have a few objections to the book. First of all, Tony is a VERY young man, yet he seems to have a maturity level that few adults ever achieve. He speaks very correctly, and ponders things which no seven year old kid has probably ever dreamed of. Also, the actual story is sometimes a little shaky, such as when Narciso is murdered and the jury rules it a suicide (though they found no gun anywhere near where he was shot to death). These are relatively small objections, though, and do not detract from a good book.This novel is worth reading, even if most of the characters ask questions that don't end with a question mark. Hey, no writer is perfect. It is certainly worth reading, and provides an interesting insight to the unique culture of the Southwest."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Rudolfo Anaya's \\"Bless Me, Ultima\\" is a wonderful depiction of the Mexican-American culture. I highly recommend this great work of literature to young adult readers since it not only serves as a window that allows them to take a look into the experiences of a Mexican-American family divided by war, but also allows them to view the world through the eyes of a young boy struggling to find his identity.The universal human concern which seems to be most prominent in \\"Bless Me, Ultima\\" is the coming-of-age and self-realization of the young boy, Antonio Marez. Antonio is confronted with numerous conflicts and the need to reconcile the opposites in his life. The strongest conflict for Antonio to face is the clash between his father's pastoral lifestyle and his mother's farming tradition.Antonio's mother, Maria Luna, represents the farming tradition-settled, modest, devout. As in his dream, the mother's family has expectations of Antonio. \\"This one will be a Luna,...he will be a farmer and keep our customs and traditions. Perhaps God will bless our family and make [him] a priest\\" (5).Antonio's father, Gabriel Marez, is linked to a lifestyle which Maria Luna considers coarse and wild: the life of the cowboy roaming the free plains. Like the Lunas, the Marez family also expects Antonio to carry on their traditions. \\"He is a Marez... His forefathers were conquistadores, men as restless as the seas they sailed and as free as the land they conquered. He is his father's blood\\" (6).Througout the novel, Antonio is being pulled by opposing forces and it is Ultima who in the end helps him find a middle ground. His father and mother's traditions are not the only conflicts he must face. He is also torn between good and evil, love and hate, a Christian God and a pagan deity. It is Ultima's advice that helps Antonio discover who he really is. \\"LIfe is filled with sadness when a boy grows to be a man, But as you grow into manhood you must not despair of life, but gather strength to sustain you\\" (245). In the end, Antonio finally understands what Ultima means and thus gains passage from innocence into awareness, finding a balance between the divided forces which tug at him and being able to define his own identity. \\"Take the llano and the river valley, the moon and the sea, God and the golden carp and make something new,...That is what Ultima meant by building strength from life\\" (247)."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Beautifully written, Anaya brings the culture of the southwest Chicano alive. Antonio grows up before our eyes, nurtured and taught by wise and magical Ultima. He is struggling with faith: Catholism, local legends/myths and the magic he witnesses that heals and transforms. He asks the age old questions concerning life and death, god's purpose and meaning in the world and the life force of the earth, the plants and animals and the curandera. I was particularly struck with a conversation between father and son, &quot;You mean God doesn't give understanding?&quot; asks Antonio. His father replies, &quot;Understanding comes with life, as a man grows he sees life and death, he is happy and sad, he works, he plays, meets people--sometimes it takes a lifetime to acquire understanding, because in the end understanding simply means having a sympathy for people. Ultima has sympathy for people, and it is so complete that with it she can touch their souls and cure them--&quot;&quot;Bless Me, Ultima was Anaya's first novel, and the first book of his I've read.

This is no ordinary little boy though his destiny was sealed at birth by an old woman know as Ultima. Ultima is an old curandera, a woman of good magic and healing. Antonio, the little boy, is the crossing of two ancient bloodlines the Marez and Luna. These families are as opposite as night and day, the Marez being wanderers and herders while the Luna are constant and silent like the earth that they till. Antonio is torn between becoming the preacher that his mother wants and going to California to make his father's dream come true. His life is forever changes when La Grande comes to join the family. Ultima introduces Antonio to a world that is new to him the world of magic and pagan gods. When Ultima comes to live with the family she instantly gains a rapport with the little Antonio who spends much of his time with her learning about her herbs and even help her to save the life of his uncle Lucas. Trouble follows Ultima many of the Catholics in the town believe her to bee a witch but she finally dispels this notion by walking through a portal that is protected by the sign of the cross. Antonio eventually goes to school and is confronted by the local kids but when he stands up for himself he is praised and asked to join their little gang. He eventually realizes that he is different that the others and finds himself in with a group who stands out as well. Antonio is troubled by dreams in which God is angered at him for doubting God and believing in the golden carp. Ultima reveals that it is Antonio's destiny to be a man of learning which makes his mother very happy but crushes the hopes of his father who's other sons have forsaken him, Antonio was his last hope for his dream of a vineyard in California. Bless me Ultima is a story that is told wonderfully from the eyes of a child who sees his whole world change as he learns more and more. The perspective of the child lends an unbiased view to all of the action which is nice to see. Even as Antonio changes and sees his whole world change around him he still seems to view things through the innocent eyes of a child and we are still kept interested in the book by the internal and external conflicts that Antonio faces. This is a book that I would recommend to anyone out there. The various lines throughout the book that are in Spanish make some things a little tough but they can be easily translated with the help of a Spanish-English dictionary. The book is a slow read at first but is overall worth the time to read. It is a very good book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"The religious and spiritual symbolism in Anaya's book, Bless Me, Ultima blend beautifully with the powerfully described New Mexican setting and culture that surround the novel's main charatcer, Antonio, and place him at the center of a series of thematic struggles including the classic struggle of good vs. evil, the difficult decision of choosing between one's apparent destiny and giving in to one's choices, and the intense discovery and formation of alternate beliefs in a higher being.Anaya places Antonio in a Catholic household of Mexican descent in the rural setting of Las Pastures, New Mexico; illustrating the natural beauty and land-based lifestyle that Antonio grows up knowing. Tony's mother is a faithful and passionate Catholic, believing in the imporatance of direct prayer to God and the adoration of the Virgin Mary. She sees and feels the holyness that surrounds Tony's being from his birth, and raises him in hopes that he will some day become a priest. The characterization of Tony's father provides a nice contrast that lends an insight into the formation of Tony. His father is a man of the land, using it respectfully and living in symbiance with it to ensure the heathly lifespans of both his family, and his family's land or llano. The contrast in Tony's parental upbringing sets the stage for his future conflicts concerning the true existance of a God, and the reasons for the existance of good and evil that he witnesses in life.Symbolism is a cetral tool that Anaya uses to artistically convey Tony's journey and his discoveries, amazments, and disappointments along the way. Perhaps most finely crafted is Anaya's creation of the golden carp, used to represent the startling effect of peace and joy that Tony feels after discovering its existance. The golden carp itself is a symbol of an alternate idol of worship besides the Christian God that Tony had grown to believe in through the teachings he recives at home, school, and at church. The fact that Tony is willing to belive in the golden carp's existance, as he is both amazed and mystified by its beauty, is made to appear especially surprising through the description is the things that Tony is denying in order give into the peace and happines he feels in the golden carp.At one point, Tony is at sunday school at church, and the priest is describing to the students the concept of an eternity. An eternity, he proceeds to explain, is the amount of time it would take a bird to pick up every grain of sand on a beach, one by one, and fly it across the pacific ocean to deposit on a shore in Japan. And then, when the entire beach has been transported, he does it again, and brings every grain to the other side, a million times. That's how long an eternity is, and that's how long you will stay in heaven or in hell. This concept frightened me like a week ago, I can imagine how it might affect an eleven year old boy. Yet, the beauty of the golden carp, and the balance that it's existance creates within Tony is more than enough to allow him to betray the doctrine he has been taught to believe in and risk finding out the hard way exactly how long an eternity is.The book's symbolism is far deeper than what I can describe in this review, and it includes themes like free will vs. destiny that I have not mentioned. Overall I can say it is a beautifully written book, with easy to recognize parallels to the inner-turnmoil of the reader, and I recommend reading it at least twice to truly appreciate the ideas and messages conveyed in Anaya's novel."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I read this for a class almost ten years ago... and I have shared this book with everyone from my brothers and sisters to my cousins, grandmother and even work collegues ever since.

The book also enlightened many of us readers to the difficulties of one culture and the conflicts we have in common concerning faith and religion.

I can't say I didn't like it, but nor can I say I liked it. It was just one of those reads where I thought about it for a moment, and was then ready to move on to the next book.While just a young boy, Antonio's family takes in Ultima, a respected healer in the community who also helped deliver Antonio. She knows he's special, but his parents have differing plans for him. His mother would like him to be a priest, and his father wants him to roam with him. Antonio isn't sure what he wants, he knows he admires Ultima and he has a deep belief in God, but there are just so many questions that he would like to have answers to. And there are so many bad things happening in his community that the questions just keep coming.These people just didn't seem like regular people to me. Maybe it was just a difference in culture, but somehow I don't think so. The little boys were just heathens and acted like wild animals. Now I know little kids have lots of energy but it was extreme. And the main character, Antonio, I just didn't feel a connection with at all, he was a little strange. I think about the only character I did end up liking was Ultima and that's just because she was a strong woman character.The plot was a little out there for me with everyone accusing people of different things and taking on some vigilante justice. Since they had cars and highways I figured it wasn't too far back in the past so it just didn't seem like things that could actually happen. And the plot just kind of meandered around without a set purpose. It just followed Antonio while he asked questions. There was some violence and death in the book but there wasn't anything that could be considered directly offensive. And it was a quick read if nothing else. Oh, I should make note that it helps to know spanish for this book, there's a lot in here that isn't translated.Just not to my taste at all and maybe there was something I missed. I just couldn't get into this book.Bless Me, UltimaCopyright 1972277 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Rather than recap the book's plot, as so many others have done, I will simply state that this book deserves a five-star rating for two reasons:1. It broke the door wide open for hundreds of Hispanic-American writers. It is to Chicano literature what Native Son and Invisible man are to African-American literature.2. It is a completely commonplace narrative technique, the bildungsroman (or coming-of-age story) set in an entirely new place (for its time), with an entirely new set of actors, situations, cultural beliefs, and literary traditions.There are countless minor reasons I could use to justify my position, but the bottom line is that it is an important literary work that will have a long life for both of the reasons I've stated above.Plus, it's a damn good book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Antonio Marez is a young Hispanic boy whose family is marked by a basic conflict between his father's wandering vaquero life and his mother's religious farmers. He finds his life changed when, in the last days of WWII, the curendera from his father's llano moves in with the family. Elderly and wise, Ultima takes Tony under her wing, teaching him about nature, the spirit, and the world. Tony witnesses the killing of a soldier stricken by PTSD, starts school, and welcomes his three older brothers home from the war. The drama really starts, however, when Ultima is asked to cure Tony's uncle, who had been cursed by some local witches. Ultima's cure works, but when one of the witches later dies, her father promises to make Ultima pay. The conflict for Tony is harrowing and bloody, played out in the midst of a spiritual awakening and crisis as he questions the Catholic faith of his family.I cannot believe that I have never heard of this novel or its author before I picked out the audio version, read by Robert Rodriguez. Apparently, this is a classic of Chicano literature. The back of the CD case compared the novel to Moby Dick, but I think a better comparison is To Kill A Mockingbird. Tony is an exceedingly likable protagonist who is trying to navigate the oftentimes harsh world he finds. The author presents the llano, the town, and the people with a vivid eye and an understanding of human nature. Tony is connected to a spiritual, mystical world, in which dreams foretell what will happen and witches exist. Some of the dreams are a little long, distracting, and somewhat pointless. But otherwise, the story flows well and the magical realism fits in well with the plot. Robert Rodriguez does an excellent job reading the story, and makes Tony a very appealing narrator. The only difficulty I had was with the use of Spanish here and there. A little bit of Spanish education did not help me understand it much, but the use was infrequent and did not inhibit my enjoyment. This is a book to be enjoyed, and a delight to listen to. This book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I read this novel for two reasons: first, because I had not yet read this classic work of Chicano literature, and second, because I wanted to participate in \\"The Big Read\\" initiative within the community where I volunteer. For those of you who may not know about this initiative, it is sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, and is an effort designed \\"to restore reading to the center of American culture.\\" Communities can choose one of sixteen books, and then design a month of special programs and events focusing on that book. The idea is to get as many local citizens reading the same book, at the same time, as possible. From mid-March to mid-April 2008, \\"Bless Me, Ultima\\" is \\"The Big Read\\" for East Los Angeles, a primarily Mexican-American area near downtown Los Angeles.\\"Bless Me, Ultima,\\" by Rudolfo Anaya, is a lyrical and deeply spiritual coming-of-age tale. Set in New Mexico during the years just before and after the close of World War II, the novel is told from the viewpoint of the child, Antonio M&aacute;rez. In his own eyes over the course of the novel, Antonio ages from an innocent boy of six, to a mature youth taking his first faltering steps in an adult role at age nine. In between, the boy is exposed to four deaths. These and other events force him toward trying to fathom the mystical polarities of life, especially good versus evil, and forgiveness versus revenge. He struggles constantly with the antagonism between the Catholicism of his mother and the rich native paganism that is abundant in the local culture. The child also feels torn between four separate paths toward adulthood: one toward the rich earth-bound farming life of his mother, a second toward the free open-plains cowboy lifestyle of his father, a third toward the priesthood that his mother so fervently desires, and finally, a fourth path that his three older brothers take toward the unknown world outside his understanding and experience. Thus the book is Antonio's spiritual passage toward a more mature understanding of the world and his place in it.Antonio's spiritual guide on this journey toward maturity is his loving paternal great aunt, Ultima, a famous \\"curandera\\" (healer) who comes to live with his family at the opening of the book.I was disappointed with this novel, probably because I expected more from such a famous classic, but also because this book is being promoted by the National Endowment for the Arts to help \\"restore reading to the center of American culture.\\" I wanted a better book for such a lofty goal. This is a good book, but it has many flaws. In particular, it is not a profoundly enjoyable book to read. There are just too many long stretches where event are described in endless boring detail. The author admits that the book is, in great part, a fictionalized autobiography. Obviously, he must have found it too difficult to edit out nonessential detail. If this book was chosen because it is a Chicano classic, then it does not seem to have enough Chicano meaning at its core, and frankly, there are better examples of Chicano literature that might have been chosen instead. On the good side, the writing is rich and lyrical, the characters are unforgettable, the violence is offset with many humorous incidents, and there are also countless heartwarming examples of deep friendship and family love throughout.As a fanatical lover of good literature of all kinds, it pains me to see a book like this foisted upon the public as a piece of art that should be read by all. I am glad that I stuck with it and finished the book. There were times when I was sorely tempted to give it up. In retrospect, the book was more enjoyable than the process of reading it. I will enjoy hearing what others have to say about this book during upcoming events that are part of \\"The Big Read\\" in East Los Angeles."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; is an excellent book that many teenagers can identify with. The theme of faith is exposed throughout the entire novel and it is one in which all teenagers struggle to understand. Adolescents have a general tendency to question everything in their search to find their personal identity. Religion assists them in their understanding of themselves and the world around them.Antonio is the main character of the novel, which as a young child constantly questioned the beliefs forced upon him. He was caught in between two different systems that to some extent tormented him. These two systems came from each parent. His mother Maria had high expectations of Antonio to become a priest. She was a devout Catholic who associated growing up with sin and punishment. Antonio became terrified of becoming a sinner:&quot;My own mother had said that losing your innocence andbecoming a man was a learning sin. I felt weak andpowerless in the knowledge of the impeding doom. Whenwould this happen...It could today, tomorrow, a week,a hundred year, but it would happen.&quot;Antonio's father, Gabriel, on the other hand, was not a believer of Christianity. He believed in the land. He believed that the land was sacred and that hurting the land was a sin. He viewed growing up as a process that was neither good nor bad. Gabriel pressured Antonio to love the land so as to pass on the family tradition of becoming a cowboy.It was these two conflicts that collided and emerged during Antonio's First Communion when he expected to literally feel a sense of communion with this Catholic God. Instead he felt nothing and from this day forward he was in search of the truth. Antonio had to make a decision through his life experiences that would utlimately help him decide which road to take and what to believe. He had to keep an open mind and come to the realization that these two different religions were just different ways of making sense of the same issues."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Through one's journey, one will face and overcome all the hardships and conflicts, as the consequence, one will attain knowledge, maturity, and experience through those conflicts and live upon it. The theory has been testified through the everlasting history, and also Rudolfo Anaya shows it explicitly in his novel, Bless Me Ultima. The novel, Bless Me Ultima, basically is about a six years old young boy's, Antonio, journey to the world he has never believed in before, to the world between good and evil, where no one is innocent and pure virtuous, to the world where everyone sins against each other. Antonio, the main character, as the apprentice of Ultima, the curandera or the healer, he learns the knowledge of goodness and power of nature, from his mentor and also as a close friend, Ultima. While Antonio learning the ethic and moral behavior from Ultima, he also sees and interferes with the sinister evil that exists within people's deepest desire and greed. On the way of dealing with evil, Antonio loses his innocent and also he comprehends that \\"nothing in the world is fair\\", everyone has to deal everything with his or her every own power. At the end, Ultima is devoured by the evil, Antonio loses people he cares about, but the things he will never lose again is the fact that there is no absolute power that will devastate and ravage evil and the knowledge he receives from Ultima and the world. Evil will never end as long as the greed in people's heart will not to be destroyed."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I believe the major accomplishment of Bless Me Ultima was that it created a way for a reader to look through the eyes of a child who was very mature in the beginning, almost too mature, and even more mature near the end of the story. It takes you on a ride with a young man named Antonio and his mental growth during a period of two years. The literary element that stood out the most to me in this composition was tone. The tone of the book made the book. It's ideal was to guide on the thoughts of young, mature children and how they react to certain situations. Rudolpho Anaya chose to look at everything very maturely even though the main character was a young boy. It mentions that Antonio shall be a priest in the first chapter, but the opposition is that he will become a vaquero. Antonio must be mature to have such ideas about his future at his young age.Ultima was a character who was brought into the story in the beginning of the book. She serves as a mentor to Antonio as their relationship is much like a teacher student relationship. Ultima teaches Antonio of how the world really is and about religion. She instills strong Catholic thoughts into him. Ultima also teaches Antonio how to make healing herbs and other remedies. Ultima is with Antonio the full time of his character progression. She actually develops his maturity level through the knowledge she passes on to him. After Antonio's witnessing of Lupito's shooting, Ultima cares for him and tells him things that help him to understand things. Antonio's question's were related to religion because they were also related to heaven and hell which were derived from the fate of the men shooting and the fate of the man who was shot.The book, Bless Me Ultima, was an average read by my standards. I didn't think there was much of a wow factor in the book because the climax and action scenes were too slow to develop and weren't very promising due to the lack of actual events. The character developments were great though. This is one of the things that set the book above the rest. The character developments were long and thought out so that the reader could actually get and image of what the character would be like in real life and how they would react to certain situations. Another thing about the story was that it was difficult for me to get into. The book was more dramatic than action packed so it really isn't my type of genre. I found myself dosing off to sleep at times where the plot was thin. But I would recommend this book to fans of dramatic stories or fans of Rudolfo Anaya. I would rate this book as an average read for high school students which show much examples of literary elements and devices. I don't believe this should be a movie on account of movies don't do so well without some action or suspense. The book did none of this for me. But if it were a movie, I'd picture Antonio as a young man who gains much knowledge and matures at the same time. Ultima would be portrayed as an old wise lady who serves as Antonio's teacher, and Antonio's parents would be portrayed as having different backgrounds, thoughts, and ideas. All in all a good book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"An epic tale of a boy (aren't they all?) and his struggle to find himself.I just read this in High School and I say it's the best thing those bastards every made,or tried to at least,me do.My favorite book ever.I honestly don't think it gets any better than this.It makes you think and ask questions yourself.This may not appeal to everyone because it asks questions about religion and thats a lot more than some religions will let you do.Get the book even if you're not a book reader or if you can't even read have someone read it to you.A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"&quot;Sometime in the future I would have to build my own dream out of those things that were so much a part of my childhood.&quot;--Rudolfo Anaya Rudolfo Anaya, storyteller extra ordinaire, has cleverly pieced together those &quot;thousand fragments of memory flitting through [his] mind&quot; to create a rather unique American novel. This enchanting tale lends all of us a stronger understanding of the spiritualism and humor that is present in Chicano culture. With brujas and withchcraft, mystery and murder, curanderas and owls, the magic of this masterpiece sets it apart from any other. The reader is immediately drawn in to the story by Anaya's warm descriptions of el llano y la raza, the land and the people, of New Mexico: &quot;She took my hand, and the silent, magic powers she possessed made beauty from the raw, sunbaked llano, the green river valley, and the blue bowl which was the white sun's home. My bare feet felt the throbbing earth and my body trembled with excitement. Time stood still, and it shared with me all that had been, and all that was to come...&quot; Anaya's story is revealed through the eyes of an innocent child of seven, Antonio, who has become lost in this &quot;labyrinth of time and history undiscovered&quot; with the destination of manhood and &quot;ultimate&quot; understanding. He struggles to find his own identity searching the magical hills of the llano, the dominant presence of the river, and the mystical powers of his dreams. It is here that the answers exist, somewhere among Ultima's wisdom, his mother's dreams, and his father's rebellion: &quot;I waited, then said. 'Now we have come to live near the river, and yet near the llano. I love them both, and yet I am of neither. I wonder which life i will choose?&quot; The answers to life's mysteries only seem to come with each new experience Antonio encounters, and Anaya makes each new experience one of entertainment and interest: &quot;The lights moved in all directions, but they couldn't find him. Some of the lights swept over me and I trembled with fear that I would be found out, or worse, that I would be mistaken for Lupito and shot. Many shots found their mark.&quot; Under Ultima's careful guidance Antonio's soul blossoms as he discovers who he is in all that is good and strong and beautiful. He learns to take life's experiences and build strength from them and to depend on the magical strength that resides in the human heart. It is as Antonio begins to run with new resolution that the journey to manhood can be complete, when he runs &quot;to preserve those moments when beauty mingled with sadness and flowed through [his] soul like the stream of time.&quot; Anaya offers a more realistic interpretation with his dynamic protagonist and fluid test as opposed to most folkloric material dependant on the static myths told time and again. This is perhaps one of the most engaging novels I have read.

Bless Me Ultima deals with issues many young adult can relate to, such as developing an identity and religion. The novel focuses a lot on the theme of religion. Many teenagers struggle understanding what religion is all about. We grow up going to church with our parents every Sunday, wether we like it or not, and wether we are getting it or not. In Bless Me Ultima,Antonio stands between his mother Maria who is a devoutly catholic and his father Gabriel who is a cowboy. Antonio decides not to follow either one, but to stand by Ultima who is a Curandera (healer). Ultima tells Antonio,\\"As you grow into manhood you must develop your own truths.\\" These are powerful words for any teenager. As a parent we often think for our children, decide for our children and take actions for our children. As children grow, it is important to allowed them to find their own identity,not what we want them to be. In the novel Antonio's mother wanted him to be a priest. That made Antonio terrified and afraid to do wrong. In the other hand Antonio's father wanted him to be just like him. I believe for some of us parents that is usually normal. We expect our children to be more like us and often better than us. I believe strongly that we need to set limits and allow children to be who they want to be as long as they are not harming themselves or others. Antonio had to make a decision through his life experiences that would ultimately help him decide which road to take and what to believe. He also had to keep an open mind, which for many teenagers is hard to do,but at the end it is them who benefit from it. Rodolfo Anaya's way of writing is powerful because it touches the reader in an emotional way. He makes it easy for the reader to understand the chicano culture."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I rate this book a 6.5 on a ;scale of 0-10.

I didn't see much plot into it and I like books where everything come together and you start realizing on page 199 why something happened on page 9.

This is the only reason Bless Me Ultima scored as high as it did. I wouldn't even recommend this book to a friend unless he wanted to learn a few choice words in Spanish and has already read all of the Harry Potter Books (that was a joke).

Perhaps the many years between the first read and second read gave me a better appreciation of how well Rudolfo Anaya writes.

It is a great story of coming of age."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Great story.Fast reading.

Not my favorite book, but I am not a fan of the style of writing."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Anaya has the style that creats images and scenes in one's mind that makes the story line very interesting.

Both the movie and the book have Spanish words in it. Some of the words are names for medicinal herbs and some of the words are Cuz words. Ultima was the name of a Medicine Woman in northern New Mexico during the late 40s and early 50s. The author does a wonderful job of relating both fiction and non-fiction into the story."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I thought that this book was wonderful.

That's how good it was! This is a great book if you want to learn a bit more about the Mexican- American culture &amp; its religious influence. I encourage everybody to read it. Its funny and ENCHANTING!!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This novel by Rudolfo Anaya certainly lived up to the &quot;blessing&quot; part of the title. From the begining of the novel when Ultima came to live with the Marez family to after she died, the supernatural forces were constantly at work. From witches to golden fish to owls that carry souls, the constant reference to the spiritual world sets this novel apart from any other. Don't get me wrong, the novel is excellent, however some of the action which takes place remains beyond believability. Granted the novel is fiction, yet based on that it is representing the life of the Indian culture I found it far fetched. Overall I give it a seven as entertaining and interesting."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"_Bless Me, Ultima_ is a great book that I would recommend to any reader. Not only does the book keep up an interesting plot, but the reader also learns more about the Chicano culture. Rudolfo Anaya did an excelent job of portraying a story that can relate to people of all cultures and time periods while focusing on the Chicano culture. Antonio, the main character, is the typical college-bound senior who is trying to decide which of life's paths they are going to take. The only difference is that Antonio is only in the third grade. Not only is he making crucial decisions in elementary school, but he is also more mature than many of today's teens. The way that Anaya allows the reader to decide what will happen before it does with foreshadowing through dreams keeps a person interested and awaiting what will happen next. The suspense is continually building with the clashes between social groups and the fine line between his mother and father. The two main social conflicts lie between the farmers and the vaqueros; the Lunas and the Marez. _BMU_ also includes many literary devices but the most common is imagery. Throughout the book, the author paints vivid pictures of the scenery around where the action is taking place. This allows the reader to &quot;be there&quot; while the action occurs. I would strongly recommend this book to any person who wants to read a book that is realistic and explores the gaps between cultures and social classes. I definetly give this book &quot;two thumbs up!&quot;"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This book has lots of magic realism. And funny things like kids peeing. The river has presents and a carp. Don't eat the fish."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima is a classic tale of growth and fate; heritage and wisdom. Anaya paints a landscape of water,desert and spirit as he shares one boy's longing to understand his purpose in life. The father of Chicano literature offers yet another powerful tale of growth and discovery."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me Ultima, a book that defines a little bit nof Lation culture. One thing that I can relate to is that of a curandera (one who helps people ) which is an old lady named Ultima. Ultima is always there for Antonio which has many problems in his life. But Ultima is always there to help him out. What I could relate to is that of the Latino last name, which defines the family and who you are. One main symbol of this story was that about Ultima's owl which was to her like a guardian angel. This book is great and gets your mind involved very quickly"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I really wish that I got as much out of this book that the other people who reviewed it did. I think it's great that a lot of people liked this book, I just don't care for it. The book to me simply repeats the main character's thoughts over and over again. It seems like there is no starting point or end to &quot;Bless me, Utima&quot;, it's just a middle. Tony's questions about God and faith and life are never answered. I guess this was the author's way of leaving you the reader to think about these questions yourself, but since Tony was the main character, I think that he should have thought about the questions more. The main character usually &quot;grows&quot; as the story goes on, but I saw no growth in Tony, I actually think he immatured by the &quot;end&quot; of the book. The only good part of this book are the parts about the culture of the people, but it hardly saves the story. I had to read this book for the 9th grade, and I don't think you should read it unless you have to. Even if you &quot;have to&quot;, try not to. You only have one life, don't waste part of it by reading &quot;Bless me, Utima&quot;."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I would not suggest this book to anyone. I fell asleep reading the first chapter.It is so dry and I hardly had any interest in it from beginning to end.Your eyes begin to hurt because you have to stare at the many pages it has.The story is told from the point of view of a six year old boy named Antonio. Through out the book Antonio is on a journey to find himself and to come to terms with life.The book doesn't really pick up until the end and it still isn't as dramatic and suspensful as one would hope it to be.Before this book I have never heard about Rudolfo Anaya and I dont think I'll be reading any of his other books. If you like suspence and drama this is not the book for you!I enjoy many different kinds of litteriture and this book suprised me as being boring as heck!!!I wish I could have enjoyed the book, but unfortunately I didn't. If you like a sence of spirituality and religion then this is a book for you.That is what the story is mostly about.So if your in the mood for a really great nap buy Bless Me Ultima."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me Ultima was a book we had to read for our English class. Overall I did not like the book. It had a good plot but not an entertaining one. The book was pretty boring. It had many climaxes and kept you wondering whether or not the book was over. The book didn't concentrate on one single theme or purpose. It had many themes which made it a little confusing to find the point of the book. The book was partially written in Spanish which made it a little confusing cause I don't know a lot of Spanish. It also changed the names of the characters between the American and Spanish names. The content of Spanish did help a little with the setting and the culture of the people. The book had action, magic, family, witches, and lots of other stuff. The book was mainly about life. Conflicts in life, with out people, your religion, and yourself. It had fighting, loss of life and problems. THe book also had a lot of swearing, a lot of it in Spanish. Between the climaxes the book was boring but at the climaxes it got a little interesting, but the ending wasn't very good. She died, and that was all. The plot was good overall but its not a book that I was really into. I would choose not to read this book if I had a choice."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I don't understand why people give this book just one star. I mean in south america we have been reading books in English and when we didn't knew the meaning of a word we pick up the DICTIONARY. Anyway I found this book to be so creative and tender. If you read it carefully you can see the strugle between MACHISMO and knowledge in latin american culture."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"A wonderful book that makes people really think about it long after they are finished with it.

Antonio is a super kid who has to deal with his own religion doubts while being introduced to the myth of the golden carp. There are alot of religious encounters: Ultima and her white magic; Florence's disbelief of the Christain religion; Narciso's tragic death, among others. The religious atmosphere kept me wondering what Antonio would beleive in at the end. He is really a wonderful kid and is the center of attention throughout the novel. There's not a boring part of the book. I can't wait to try some of his other work over semester break."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I first read Bless Me, Ultima 20 years ago and recently re-read it.

I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This was my first experience with Rudolfo Anaya, and what a read! Once I started I just couldn't put this book down, and by the end I was ready to read it again. Anaya's characters are so heartfelt and his descriptions of New Mexico are wonderful. The dialogue between the young boys in this novel is also good for some side-splitting laughs too! This is a great story about family ties, coming of age, and good versus evil steeped in the magic and folklore of the southwest. Any fans of Gabriel Garcia Marquez will love this one. It is an instant classic. I can't wait to go pick up Anaya's other novels!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This is a smart book. I had to read it for school and I enjoyed it. I learned a lot about the history of the land or as they say, the \\"llano\\". I also speak a little bit of Spanish, so this book helped increase my Spanish abilities, by adding small quotes in Spanish. I liked this book. The boy is portrayed amazingly. His confusion about life and God is explained very well and truly moved me. At one point in the book, I was almost moved to tears. You should read this book, definitly."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I enjoyed the mystical, earthy quality of this book. My interest was less from the \\"Chicano/a\\" point of view and more from the metaphysical viewpoint. The story was romantic and ethereal, even the dark parts were poetic. I enjoyed grandma's reverent appreciation for the earth, and the young boy's gratifing realization of his \\"Bruja\\" grandmother's gifts."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me Ultima was something new to me. I learn allot about the culture and background about Spanish culture and religion. It is a very spiritual book about a 7 year-old (Antonio) journey of growing in the town of El Puerto. He is then rejoiced and joined by the goodness of Ultima. Ultima in the story plays as his guider and mentor about his beliefs and life in his environment. As a little kid growing up he has allot of questions and is very curious about his beliefs. Throughout the novel he tries to find himself, comes across many decisions that effects the way he is. He encounters many people and many deaths (this is too much for a little boy) but still these occurrences help him through his way of being a man. He tries seeing points of view and contrasting what's good and bad. He is influenced by people and sees the actions of other people; as Ultima symbolizes good and Tenorio as evil. He becomes in touch with internal conflicts of what to do with his life, since his parents want two separate things they want him to be. I recommend this book for anyone who trying to understand how things are because you may relate to it. Many times in life we don't see the good or bad side and we go through life questioning why things happen to you; this book it will keep you in touch with your spirituality."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. I re-read it every year and I feel the same strong emotions each time. It has something for everyone: crazy antics of 7 year old boys, in-depth discussion of religion, a touching relationship between a young boy and his grandmotherly mentor, supernatural events. I could go on but you just have to pick it up and read it for yourself. By the way, I teach Spanish and my students read it each semester, and 95% of them love it (I think the other 5% never actually read it.)"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I just completed Bless Me Ultima as a required reading for my sophmore english class. Did I find this book to be all it is cracked up to be? Let's take a look:This story is about a seven year old hispanic boy, Antonio and the stuggles and decisions he has to make as he grows older. The story really begins when a dear family friend, Ultima (also known as La grande) come to live with Antonio's family. Ultima is a well known curnadera; one of the best around, however, many people believe that she is a witch, who's work the evil of the devil. Because of this, she is put under public scrutiny. Many want to kill her, a man named Tenorio being of the most eager to put her to death. Antonio, already at witt's end, trying to decide which life path to choose, along with his questions about God and his beliefs, takes on the added burden of defending Ultima, as well as taking the wrath of learning and supporting her ways.Good storyline? Yes...however, Rudolfo Anaya is known as one of the best chicano authors of his time, and that he is. The book involves a lot of spanish, which causes the non speakers to miss out on parts of the book. I'm not sure about you, but I like to understand what im reading. It was not a bad book, but I would only recommend it to native speakers. It would be more interesting if you understood the language used, and the religious aspects involved. I got so caught up trying to understand the words and the rituals, that I couldn't fully concentrate on the story before me.Bless Me Ultima has a good storyline and the author is a good writer, but interest will be lost unless you understand the language used and the customs performed. The above is why I give Bless Me Ultima three stars."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"i had to read Bless me Ultima for English. It was an assignment. So i started reading the book and the more i read the more i saw what the book was about. So when i got finished with the book our teacher gave us an assignment to do. We had to pick a question that he had writen down a on a sheet of paper which contained a few others. He had also put on the paper, anything that you can think up of. I chose to tell how Ultimas magic affected Tony more than any of the other &quot;gods&quot; that were introduced and i have found out why. The book showed how not everything you believe in is true. It also showed the power of Ultima as in what she could do when the people came to for help , after the priest tried to get ride of what every it was and failed."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"In the beginning, I didn't find 'Bless Me, Ultima' interesting at all. But as the story went on, the characters developed, and I started to understand what was really going on. From mid-way until the end, the book was very good, and I liked the way symbolism showed the way in the story."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This is a great and unique book design for people with an open mind. Anaya is a writer who in his writing uses his native language along with the English language, which makes it unique from all the other books. Bless Me, Ultima, doesn't only emphazise on the topics of culture and religion; however, it also makes one ponder on those mysterious situations that we encounter in our everyday life. Anaya, makes one want to be a child again, with his funny (yet interresting) experiences,and his great use of language, and imagery. Defenetly, my favorite book!!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"OK, I was forced to read Bless Me Ultima by my AP english teacher. While I found it to be a good book and certainly worth reading, I found Anaya's preoccupation with intertwining chicano culture into the novel very bland. Also, much of the diction is trite. For example, Antonio repeatedly tells us &quot;...my soul felt sick...&quot; or &quot;...my soul felt sad...&quot;. The effect would have been greater if Anaya had forced us to see how Antonio felt rather than tell us straight out. The use of a religious/spiritual theme saves this book by making us ask ourselves the same questions that Antonio asks himself."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"this is a truely wonderful book. Anaya displays the Hispanic culture wonderfuly. Antonio is a young hispanic boy that lives in New Mexico. Antonio has meny enteresting conflicts that take place during the book. One of the major conflicts was between him and his parents over what he is supose to do with his life. His mother wants him to be a piest, and his father wants him to live off of the land like his family did. One day an old woman named Ultima came to live her last few months with Antonio and his family. Ultima takes Antonio under her wing and shows him the ways of the curanderas. She teaches him about herbs and the spirits of the earth. she is the only person that knows what Antonio will become. All during this time he is having trouble with his faith in God. If you have not read this book it is a must read, if you have read it again!!!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"The Deep Thoughts of a Seven-Year-Old Bless Me, Ultima, a novel by Rudolfo A. Anaya, has many clashing elements. These includes conflicts between child and parent, Catholicism and Voodoo, and boy and man. These conflicts revolve around a young boy named Antonio, his family, and an old lady called Ultima. One conflict in the story is parent versus child, pertaining to the parents' dreams for their children. Antonio's father hopes his three oldest sons, Leon, Eugene, and Andrew will work with him on the highway until he can move the family to California. However, after returning home from fighting in World War I, Leon, Eugene, and Andrew realize that they no longer belong in their home town. Antonio and his mother are involved in a controversy over Antonio's future occupation. She dreams that he will become a priest. Antonio accepts this, but throughout the story he questions his faith, especially when his first communion does not turn out like he expected. Antonio's questions about his faith lead to the conflict between Catholicism and Voodoo. Antonio was raised praying at the Virgin's feet, but when Ultima comes to live with his family, he is introduced to a darker religion. He sees Ultima cast an evil spell from his uncle. An owl that watches over Ultima pecks out the eye of an enemy. These events lead Antonio to question why God could not heal his uncle and why an evil man goes unpunished while a good man dies. Antonio is confused even more when two of his friends tell him a tale about a god who was turned into a golden carp. When he actually sees this golden carp he believes the tale, but is tormented because Catholicism says he should have no other gods other than God. The main conflict in this novel is the one of boy versus man. Antonio is a young seven- year-old boy who is dealing with adult issues. He sees men murdered, a horrible sight for anyone to witness. He is questioning his religion, something many people do not face till later in life, and he is trying to determine who he wants to be, another issue many do not have to deal with till they are much older. Overall, this young boy is facing situations he should not have to face for many years, and is being forced to become a man long before his time. This book is considered a western, however, it is very different from the typical Louis L'Amour novels or John Wayne movies. In most westerns, religion is overlooked, but in this novel, religion is a very important aspect. Instead of a story about a shoot-'em-up cowboy, this is a story of a young Mexican boy in New Mexico following World War I. Antonio's father regards California as the traditional get-rich-quick west, because he is living the hard life of a pioneer in New Mexico. Bless Me, Ultima is an interesting book which will cause the readers to ask questions. If you have an interest in voodoo, this book will give you some insight on the subject. If you are questioning your own faith, it is possible that Antonio will address some of your questions, although answers may not be provided. Overall, Anaya has written an engrossing novel that depicts the dreams, questions, and events in the life of seven-year-old forced to grow up too soon."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I fell in love with this book. It is one of the most moving books that I have ever read in my life. Parts of the book were so funny that I laughed out loud.

Whenever new friends ask me what it was like to live here, I tell them to read Bless Me Ultima. Anaya's book is filled with the spiritalism and humor that make life in Northern NM special. His character of Ultima is as real as I have ever read. Perhaps others will read the book and take it as a piece of far-out fiction. However, from reading this book, I know that Rudolfo has experienced the mystery of this sacred area. This book stands head and shoulders above anything else Anaya has done. It is already a classic for Chicano readers and is practically a Bible for those of us who are from the area."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This is a lovely first novel from the very talanted Rudolfo Anaya, an upcoming Southwestern writer who teaches creative writing at the University of New Mexico.

I think that since I live in New Mexico, and Rudolfo Anaya is a really acclaimed author of the state, we should &quot;appreciate&quot; this book.I'm sorry. I just can't do it. I can't see why this is a classic. I guess it was an okay book, but even so, I hated it. Not because it was necessarily bad.

The young voice of the story, Antonio shows the struggles he encounters around every turn as he &quot;grows into a man&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this book. Antonio's coming of age is definitely something that grabs you and won't let you go. His life is permeated by catholicism, curanderismo and pagan beliefs of his ancestors."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless me, Ulyima was like book like I have never read, it started off slow and gradually got more exciting. I had two opinions toward the book, one is positive and one is negitive. I liked this book because Antonio was like myself as a child. He is a small kid who is trying to find the truth of his faith. This cahracter was not perfect like most characters, but he portrayed as an innocent little boy. He was a sneaky little child who followed his father everywhere and got into fights at school. THe side of the book I disliked was the way he potrayed the Catholic Church. It seemed like there were cuss words than any other book I have ever read. I thingk he showed many bad sides of the Catholic Church including the way we pray. I don't think I would read another book by Rudolfo Anaya because it was very confusing getting into the novel. I also would read his work because of the cuss words. I would rate this book as a 3 star because of my conflicting opinions on the book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; a novel by Rudolfo Anaya was a book that aroused very little emotions in me. I read it, did the work, took the test. that was all. I searched for things in the book that would hint to read another of Anaya's book, but nothing came up. Don't get me wrong, the book was pretty enjoyable, a little slow moving, but decent none the less.The characters were brilliant and the story line was amazing. Anaya also did a good job of portraying the life of a Chincano family and community at the end of WWII.The way that Anaya describes the llano and the spirits of all the things around Antonio, the main character, is beautiful. Anaya is such a descriptive writer. I could practically see and smell the cure that Ultima, Antonio&#8217;s best friend and a cuarndero, was conjecturing up for Uncle Lucas. I could feel the icy cold swirl around me as Antonio was walking home in the storm after the Christmas play.One thing that bothered me about this story was the large amount of religion used/talked about in the book. I have nothing against any religion, but he used so much of it. The one thing I enjoyed about the religion of the story, was Antonio&#8217;s constant inner conflicts between the catholic religion and the pagan religions. I loved the story of the Golden Carp, it was a nice, offbeat addition to the story.The thing that bothered me most about the story was the fact that Antonio was only six. I got so distracted by that. I would read about the conflicts he was going through, and I couldn&#8217;t fully digest them because all I kept thinking was, this kid is only six. I know when I was six, I wasn&#8217;t seriously thinking about what I wanted to be. I don&#8217;t know any six year old that was.Overall the book was decent. For the most part the characters were totally believable and the plot was in a good order. I wouldn&#8217;t really recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"We just finished reading Bless Me Ultima in our English II class, and I can honestly say that I am glad. Rudolfo Anaya's portrayal of a young boy trying to choose the right path in life is quite amusing. Most people would probably agree with me when I say that there are not many seven year old boys who are seriously thinking about choosing to be what their mother wants them to be, or choosing to be what their father wants them to be. Children think about playing in trees or in the dirt; not becoming a priest or a vaquero.The dreams that young Antonio experiences are closer to visions of the future, than real dreams. He sees himself and his brothers near the river. He also sees himself going with his brothers to a whore house. The boring and meaningless dreams get longer and longer as the book progresses.The action actually picks up in the book about fifteen pages from the end. This pointless book carries on for chapters at a time and I do not suggest reading it unless you can handle the constant descriptions of vomit and urine."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I recently finished reading Bless me Ultima as an assignment. The novel starts out by Ultima comes to live with Antonio and his family. Antonio is the narrator. Antonio's mother wants him to become a priest. Antonio does what his mother wishes and doesn't even think about not pleasing her and the family. Antonio spends all of his time doing what his mother wants. I don't think the author was realistic about real childs behavior. Anaya put so much pressure on Antonio about communions and family. Realistically, a seven year old boy is not seriously thinking about a life career being what his mother wants. Seven year old children are more interesting in playing with friends.The book was extremely boring at the beginning, and didn't get the slightest bit interesting until the 15th chapter. Most of the whole book talks about the llano and Antonio's long drawn out dreams, which foreshadow some of what happens in the beginning. The book has ALOT of religion. The up side to the story was I was able to learn more about the Catholic religion. I don't recommend this book if you don't know some Spanish. I actually don't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I finished reading this book a few days ago, and I think that the book was worth reading. Rudofo Anaya does a great job describing scenes from the story. Because it is a little mouthy at times, I would not reccommend this book for youger readers.Bless Me, Ultima is a story about a youg boy named Antonio who is growing up and having many dillemmas in the way. Antonio wants to obey both his mother and father even though his mother wants him to become either a farmer or a priest, and his father wants him to become a wanderer. Antonio's non-catholic friend, Florence, tries to talk Antonio out of his religion while Antonio tries to talk the same kid into becoming a Catholic like him. Antonio struggles to live a normal life with the help from his most dearest friend, who lives with the family, Ultima. She is Antonios \\"rock\\" he learns a lot about the land and his family from her. She is a curandera, one who cures by magic.(...)This exciting and thrilling book will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was not expecting much from a Spanish novel , but it was more than I expected. The authors great look into growing up, makes this a good book for you to read."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Unlikely though it may seem, Bless Me, Ultima, a chicano coming of age story, reminds me of Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. While superficially, Bless Me, Ultima deals with the unique problems of a young boy in a New Mexican society during World War I, in reality, it is the basic American story of trying to grow up in a hypocritical society. Like Huck, Antonio the protagonist finds hypocrisy in religion; he cannot understand why G-d would punish the good and forgive the bad. Antonio witnesses several murders and deaths, much like Huck, which manifest his religious and philosophical dilemmas. Despite occasional Spanish phrases in Bless Me, Ultima, the majority of the language is easier to understand than the confusing dialect in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I liked the book because beneath Antonio's story lie themes and symbolism about religion and life. I enjoyed analyzing the symbolic undercurrents. Other readers who like to think beyond the literal language in a novel will enjoy this book, but anyone who gets confused by foreign phrases should avoid Bless Me, Ultima."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I'd have given this book negative five stars if it were an option. This novel has a mind-numbingly boring storyline, with almost zero plot, characters you couldn't care less about, unrealistic scenes, cheap symbolism and dumb 'plot twists'. Why anyone would want to read about a stupid little boy who follows an old con artist around 'curing' people with 'curses' that are probably nothing more than the flu is beyond me. I found it difficult to care about Tony's family and their problems. I felt that it was a quasi-noble effort to represent a struggle between good and evil, considering that no one in the story was pure good or pure evil."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; by Rudolfo Anaya a few weeks ago for my English class, and I don't really find the book very interesting. The book is written from Antonio's point of view, talking about his childhood(when he was only turning 7).It started with Ultima, a curandera, staying at the Marez household for she was invited to live with them because she is old and has nowhere else to stay. Ultima has helped many families, especially the Luna and Marez family. It continued with Antonio witnessing Lupito shot by the river. A few days later, Antonio's three older brothers came home from world war II, but two of them left for Vegas a few days later. Antonio was upset, but was still kinda happy because one of his brothers stayed home to work and go back to school. Later on in the story, Antonio's Uncle Lucas was cursed by the Trementina sisters because he witnessed them make their special dance to the devil himself. Ultima was asked to help Lucas for nobody else can heal him. The best doctors and healers have tried, but nothing changed in Lucas' condition. Ultima, with the help of Antonio, fought evil and turned the curse around. Antonio's family, together with the townspeople, were very glad and thankful that Ultima was able to win against evil. Fall started, and Antonio had to go to school for the first time. He was nervous, but he survived the school year very well. As a matter of fact, he even got to skip second grade and move on to third grade! His whole family, especially Ultima, were very proud of him. Tenorio Trementina became angry because one of his daughters died. He cursed and called Ultima a witch. He wanted to kill Ultima. Narcisco, however, tried to prevent this with all his might. He even risked his own life to save Ultima's. He died by the juniper tree. A little before spring, Antonio received his first confession, and a few days later he received his first communion. He thought after receiving first communion, all his questions will be answered by God. He wants to know why all the good people die, but the evil ones like Tenorio are still alive. Then his two older brothers came back home and left again a few days. This time, Andrej went with them. Antonio wondered if he'll ever be able to spend time with them. A few days back, Antonio's friend, Cico introduced him to another 'god'. It's the golden carp, the god who forgives and punishes those who deserves it. Very few people know about the golden carp. Cico and Antonio were about to tell Florence about the golden carp because he doesn't believe in God, but Florence drowned and died. Towards the end of the story, Tenorio's other daughter died. He is now determined to take Ultima's life away from her. Many people tried to save Ultima's life. There was Antonio, who walked some ten miles to warn Ultima, his mother's brothers to fight Tenorio, and his father. Unfortunately, Tenorio was able to kill Ultima's owl, who was her spirit. She died a few minutes later. Tenorio was immediately shot by one of Antonio's uncle.I didn't really like the book because it kinda left me hanging. Many people wanted Antonio to become a priest, some wanted him to be a farmer, and others wanted him to bring out the true Marez blood. Anaya never said what Antonio became to be when he got older. Also, it got me upset and it made me feel sorry for Antonio. For such a young boy, I think it's just depressing that he witnessed so many deaths. There was Lupito, Narcisco, Florence, the Owl, and Ultima. That is just awful! The book is full of actions, and I will not want it to be a movie because I think it will be full of violence especially with all the cursing of the kids from Antonio's school! Does Anaya not like kids? The way I see it, he doesn't seem to like kids because they weren't good and cussed a lot in this book.A pretty interesting book, full of proving love and thankfulness for each other, and of course, action. I will only recommend this book to a few selected friends."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Hey, my first review! Feel free to tell me how I did.Just finished reading this for my college english class, and I was blown away. From the very first page (yes, a cliched comment I know but it's really true!) I thought I was in for something special. I mean just listen to this: \\"Ultima came to stay with us the summer I was almost seven. When she came the beauty of the llano unfloded before my eyes, and the gurgling waters of the river sang to the humof the turning earth. The magical time of childhood stood still, and the pulse of the living earth pressed its mystery into my living blood.\\"Wow. Best intro to a novel I've ever read.Fawning aside, I really sympathized with Antonio's coming-of-age story, combined with his attempt to decide spiritual truth from fiction. Ultima, the wise \\"spirit guide\\" of the novel, gently pushes him in the right direction, but the novel is really about Antonio as he struggles with pressing doubt. He must choose between his mother, the Lunas, and the Christian God, and his father, the Marez, and paganism.Word of warning: this is no light read, and is not for kids. I found some of the content downright disturbing, and it's not happy-go-lucky. But I think that makes it even better. Anaya spins a wonderful web where he incorperates the beautiful and the mournful in life.I really appreciated this book becase I am going through a lot of doubt in my life now. If you are an adament atheist, or Christian, don't bother with this one. It'll be lost on you (and I know firshand. I read \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" when I was a dogmatic atheist and couldn't appreciate it as a literary work). This book is best for those who haven't lost that sense of mystery of life, or those who want to reconnect with it. If you think you have the answers, you'll probably just be cynical about \\"Bless me\\".Allright, no review is complete without finding some feet of clay. Antonio's status as the \\"chosen one\\" is never explained and it comes across as a somewahat sloppy literary construct. Not subtle enough for me. I'm hard pressed other than that, but then again I haven't read through the negative reviews. I wanted this review to be my opinion alone (in as much as it my alone), and not a reflection of others.If your'e looking for a work of Litino literature, a coming-of-age-story, or a place to sympathesize with your own doubts, \\"Bless Me, Ultima\\" is a can't miss. Highest recommendations.P.S. If you're interested in reading my four-page paper on the choices Antonio faces in this novel, feel free to ask for my e-mail (urls are not allowed in the reviews proper)."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I thought it was a pretty interesting book. It had many descriptive words that really paints the picture in my mind. Antonio Marez is six years old when a curandera named, Ultima comes to live with his family. The fight for religion is crucial in the little town of El Puerto, and some men say that ultima is really a witch who kills people. The book goes on about how antonio views his life in his perspective. I recommend it to people who are in antonio's state but beware it has some profanity and it can be boring at times."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"When I first started to read Bless Me, Ultima, I didn't really know what to think about it. It was strange, interesting, but at the same time boring. When Antonio is six, a curandera, or Ultima comes to live with his family. Ultima could heal through herbs and magic. I didn't really understand the book from that point. I wanted the story to be more realistic for me, and I wanted to relate with some of the characters. To me, the whole healing with magic didn't work. Probably because I am not of the hispanic culture that I didn't understand or believe what was going on. One thing I did understand and relate to is that Antonio was pressured to become something when he wasn't ready to. His mother was pushing him to become a religious leader. On a scale of one to five stars, I would have to rate this book a 2.5 or 3. It told a great story of a boy growing up with many adversities and how he overcomes them. But at the same time, we need to be awake to read it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This is by far the best book that I have ever been forced to read. It also ranks high in all of the books that I have read. It casts a spell that makes you turn the page and read more. My teachers have gave us some bad books in the past and this makes up for it. I suggest that everyone reads it. I do warn people that there is some spanish cursing and a lot of blasphemy. Those are the only detractors."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Anaya's masterfully written novel detailing the events of a young boy's coming-of-age definitely deserves all the critical acclaim it has receieved, up to and including the prestigious Premio Quinto Sol Award. His superb techniques only enhance the mesmerizing story of Ultima, Antonio, and how they touch the lives around them. Anaya's symbolism is unparalleled in modern fiction; the connotations he subtly makes with elements of nature help readers to connect the entire story together. He points out life-altering universal truths, and his characters are developed such that readers can identify Ultima in their own lives. Anaya also adds a Steinbeck-esque quality to the reading; as John Steinbeck used inner-chapters to symbolize parts of his _Grapes of Wrath_, so Anaya uses dream sequences to symbolize parts of _Bless Me, Ultima_. The dreams are never confusing and only add to the novel as a whole. Potential readers should take caution, though; religious themes run deeply throughout this novel and may upset stauchly devout Catholics. Also, Anaya frequently uses Spanish words and phrases that, if one knows the basics of the language, add enormously to the novel's detail. English-to-Spanish translation books do exist, but may detract from the enjoyment of the novel. Though cautions exist, I firmly believe that everyone should read Rudolfo Anaya's _Bless Me, Ultima_; it is a wonderfully written, masterfully executed Chicano novel. I recommend it to anyone with a love for magic and reading in general"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I have recommended this book to many people! There's a dreamy, mystical way in which this book was written that is seductive and irresistable.

I believe that Rudolfo did a supreme job of showing a classic battle between good and evil without making it very obvious. The way he is able to enchant the reader by showing us the troubles of growing up and the questions we all ask ourselves about religion is truly magnificient. To anyone who is thinking about buying this book I highly recomend it and I hope that you enjoy the wonderful style of writing that is sure to capture your imagination."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Reading this book, as enjoyable as it was, brought about mostly layers upon layers of sybolism and conflicts. Therein, though, lies Anaya's greatest acheivement: his ability to mask such contrasting elements as the Marez and Luna blood, and the Chrisitian trinity with Pagan Idealism into the everyday life of his 6 year-old protagonist. The running theme of evil coming in threes (the three bruja sisters, the three dead indians, his three womanizing brothers)seems to only emphasize Anaya's eventual comfort in the community's original polytheistic roots and his distrust of organized religion. A great book with interesting characters, a blatantly Romantic plot, and beautiful descriptive text."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"i read this book when i was in 7th grade, i loved it. it worth reading the book and visiting NM to see the city"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I read this book years ago and was happy to reread it.

You will love this book it gives you an idea of the past in New Mexico and coming from small villages and towns. As a Hispanic coming from New Mexico it brought back the memories. I loved it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I have read this book more than once. The first time, I was forced into reading it. Like most students, I rushed through it as quickly as I could. During my process of speed-reading, I noticed that this novel had characteristics that distinguished it from others that I was also forced to read. Maybe it's because I am Hispanic, like a majority of the characters in the novel, that I could more closely identify with it than a number of my classmates. The second time, I chose to read it. I wanted to analyze the book and give it a closer look that I know I didn't give it the first time. I understood the novel well. Thanks to my unrelenting English teacher, I quickly picked up on much of novel's symbolism, imagery, and motifs that I hadn't noticed the first time. Not only did the analysis give me a better understanding, it practically changed the meaning I acquired the first time from reading it. To the untrained eye, the large amounts of Spanish contained in this novel could have made it extremely difficult. The dialogue gives it a realistic atmosphere, which is further emphasized by the profanity used by the characters. I thought it was funny, actually. I can vividly recall my elementary classmates displaying an array of colorful four-letter words when the teacher's back was turned. In that aspect, I closely compare it to Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. The imagery in this book was gorgeous. Anaya did an excellent job of describing the scenes, characters, and action sequences so much that it seemed like I was actually witnessing them. An example of imagery that particularly stood out was the illustration of a rabid character with \\"saliva curled around the edges of his mouth and spittle threads hanging down and glistening like spider threads in the sun.\\" The story raises the complicated relationships between medicine and belief, mysticism and the supernatural, and the long time disputed argument, does God really exist? Throughout the novel, Antonio, the main character, repeatedly battles with himself over many issues that we, especially those of us in our adult-lives, are facing day by day. All of the characters were beautifully crafted, especially Antonio. The quality that makes them so attractive is their realism. Bless Me, Ultima, is an extraordinary window into the mind of growing six-year-old learning, living, and experiencing. While reading this book, you don't tell yourself that you are indeed reading, but you make connections with all of the characters. I recommend this book to everyone. This novel challenges the audience to recognize that there is a mystical dimension to everything. It's an easy reader, but you may want to keep a Spanish-English dictionary available."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I chose to read &quot;Bless Me, Ultima.&quot; I really enjoyed this book by Rudolf A. Anaya. This book has two main characters; they are Antonio and Ultima. The character in the book is also called Ultima, Grande for respect.Ultima is growing old and has been a good friend of Antonio's family for many years. In tradition they decide to ask Ultima to stay with them in the town of Guadalupe. To their appreciation she agrees to come live with them. When she comes to stay with them Antonio knows that he and Ultima will become good friends. Ultima teaches Antonio many new things. They also grow very attached to each other.Ultima has a magic touch. She is able to help sick people or people who are in need. Some people believe that she is a witch, others think that she is evil and try to avoid her. Some people think that she just has a special gift to help people in need. She will help anyone who wants or needs her help. Everywhere she goes her owl always goes with her. Ultima collects many herbs. For every herb she collects she pinches off a tiny piece and puts it in a leather pouch that she wears around her neck. Do you think that this pouch that she wears is a good luck charm? She teaches Antonio many of her ways. Many times when Ultima was removing a curse or helping someone she would say, &quot;Have Antonio help, he understands the power.&quot;Antonio wonders what he should become when he becomes an adult. His mom wants him to be a priest and farm the land. While his dad does not think that is what he should do with his life. One summer he meets a friend from school named Cico. Cico shows him what his God is, his God is the Golden Carp. They go and see the Golden Carp. Antonio begins to think about what he really believes. He is not sure if he really wants to be a priest or what he wants to do. When he meets the Golden Carp his mind wonders even more. Thoughout the story Antonio sees many deaths for his young age. Out of the four deaths that he had seen, he had blessed two of the people. Do you think that Antonio will become a Priest? Even before his Conformation class the children would pretend he was the Priest and have him bless each one of them.I really enjoyed this book called, &quot;Bless Me, Ultima.&quot; I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys a little suspense and to anyone who enjoys reading. I believe that his book is a great book by Rudolf A. Anaya. Also, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about different cultures. If a person wants to know the answers to these two questions, Do you think that the pouch that Ultima wears around her neck is a gook luck charm? and Do you think that Antonio will become a Priest?,&quot; I suggest that you read this book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I liked this book for many different reasons. The story had many different sub-plots and ideas that I really liked. Religion was one of the big ones. The mix of Catholicism and Pagan ritual was a great description of the melting pot that was New Mexico. The story of a young boy finding himself and making choices that would effect his life was another great story. I found out after reading the book that the story is based on Anaya's life. So in a wasy its a autobiography. The story is really interesting and I recomend it to anyone. Especially people looking to find themselves."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Anaya's storytelling abilities blew me away. The rich descriptions and beautiful stories are what attracted me to the novel. Though I am unfamiliar with spanish, I did not find that to be distracting to the novel, but enhanced the culture that the novel was centered around. Antonio being torn between two worlds and wanting to make both of his parents happy was a theme that I thought many people could relate to. Several people have had to go through an experience of choosing between living their life as they want, or following the wishes and demands of their parents. Ultima became a great role model to not only Antonio, but any reader who might have gone through or going through an experience like that. But it was the myths and legends throughout the novel that proved to be my favorite part of the novel. These stories not only allowed me to look closely at a culture that I was unfamiliar with before, but also showed the richness of Anaya's descriptions."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"&quot;Bless Me Ultima&quot; is written by the father of Chicano literature, Rudolph Anaya. &quot;Bless Me Ultima&quot; is a story of a young boy who is torn between family, friends, and religion. This story also gives insight into the Chicano culture.&quot;Bless Me Ultima&quot; is set in the llano, or plains of New Mexico. Antonio Marez is six years old when Ultima and elderly curandera comes to live with the family. Ultima's coming symbolizes the maturing process of Antonio. Antonio's parents argue over his future life and education. Antonio's mother wants him to follow her family tradition and become a farmer. His father wants him to follow his family tradition and become a cowboy. Antonio's parents argue about the disposal of his afterbirth. Ultima decides that she will dispose of the afterbirth so she will be the only one to know his destiny.Antonio faces many challenges throughout the story. He faces conflicts of religion. His friends Cico and Samuel along with his mother are catholics. His other friend Florence is an athesist. This conflict increases Antonio's confustion about the world. Antion tries to understand the nature of good and evil. Antonio faces many new challenges when he starts school. He is faced with peer pressure. People tease him because they think Ultima is a witch and because his friend Florence is an athesist.Antonio witness three deaths in the story: Lupito's, Narciso's, and Florence. The deaths bring up the issue of good and evil. The central theme of the book is the struggle between good and evil.&quot;Bless Me Ultima&quot; gives excellent insight into the Spanish culture. I personally learned many new aspects of the Chicano life. Such as the curandera or healer comes to live with the family and religion playes a vital role in Chicano life. &quot;Bless Me Ultima&quot; would be and extrodinary book for a teenager or adult. The book explains the struggles of a teenager. Intern you people could relate to Antonio's problems."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Brothels, the devil, shoot-outs, witchcraft, and pagan religions are all viewed and examined by the innocent eyes of a child in Rudolfo A. Anaya's novel, Bless Me, Ultima. By telling the story through a child's mind, Anaya gives the reader a fairly unbiased view of the conflicts in the story. Since Antonio, the protagonist, is constantly having internal conflict, the reader is also kept occupied by the book, which also contains a lot of action. The vaqueros often parade through the story, riding on horses and carrying their guns. If a reader knows Spanish, they would also be quite amused while reading because some of the characters frequently use Spanish swear words.The Spanish dialogue in the book sometimes causes a problem, because the reader can't always understand what the characters are saying to each other, and the dialogue is not always clarified in the narrative. As was reading this novel, I was frustrated when I couldn't know exactly what the characters were saying without depending on my Spanish-English dictionary. Another problem I had with Bless Me, Ultima is that the beginning few chapters are a bit too slow because they focus mostly on the setting up the story.This book is also packed with significance and symbolism, and is perfect for an English class to read together. Although the reading was slow and hard to understand in the dialogue at the beginning, I would definitely recommend this book to any age group of mature readers.Jennnifer ShawLowell High School"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I bought this book because the school board banned it from the tenth grade reading list in this small valley town. The teachers protested to no avail. It was banned because a parent did not like the tiny amount of profanity in the book.This is an excellent book which has great moral value, exhibits some aspects of hispanic culture and would make for excellent classroom discussion. The \\"smattering\\" of profanity in English and Spanish was nearly non existent within the scope of what the author was attempting to portray. Good book for any one age 12 to 100."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I read this book on school assignment but I ended up really enjoying it. I imagine it would have particular interest for those who speak some spanish and/or looking for a glimpse into Mexican/American culture.Bless Me, Ultima is a strong coming-of-age book with a heavy theme of innocence. Antonio, the main character is searching for religion and torn between the expectations of his parents. His father's family, the Marezs, are restless cowboys whereas his mother's family, the Lunas, are tied to the dark earth. Why these seemingly complete opposites married eachother, I never really found out, but Antonio must now deal with the consequences.I was pretty engaged throughout the book. I personally really liked the supersticious parts about Brujas (witches) and Ultima. It was interesting the way nature was described and dealt with. There was just a huge amount of respect, which may be different from the average American at this day and age.The events that steal Antonio's innocence are powerful and thought provoking. This book is a stimulating experience and I reccomend it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"As a Hispanic, I cannot believe that I hadn't read *Bless Me, Ultima* earlier. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. Anaya is a superb storyteller.As it is in the Hispanic culture, elders are supposed to be taken care of whether or not they are family. So, in comes Ultima, an elderly curandera. A curandera is a faith healer, not a witch. However, some people may not see the difference between the two. The proper and respectful term to Ultima is Grande, meaning \\"wise one\\".Antonio is the youngest boy in this particular family who has taken in Ultima. He is fascinated with everything related to Ultima. When he greets her for the first time, he calls her Ultima. He is scolded by his mother but Ultima intercepts. He's the only one who calls her Ultima throughout the book.Ultima seems to have taken a fascination with Antonio. She selects him to accompany her to collect herbs and whatnots for her \\"practices\\". Also, when some people are curses with spells by the witches, Ultima takes Antonio with her to help break spells.There are many things happening in this book. One thing that happened was that one of Antonio's uncles was afflicted with a spell that nearly cost him his life. When Ultima and Antonio break a spell, a local man and his 3 witch daughters vow revenge. One by one, Ultima encounters and breaks a spell, increasing Antonio's respect and curiosity of Ultima's powers. When a spell is broken, something terrible happens to the witch daughters, which increases their father's hatred for Ultima.You just have to read the book. There is a lot of symbolisms in the book. The symbols are not subtle. You'll be reading but pondering over the symbols in your mind. Overall, Anaya tells this story wonderfully. There is no boring or slow parts in this book. Something is always happening which keeps you alert."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima, is a very intriguing novel. The storyline keeps you hooked throughout almost the entire book. I really enjoyed this. Nothing was really that slow going besides maybe the beginning. Bless Me, Ultima exposes the reader to the Mexican culture. You experience the daily lives of both the men and the women. The men work in the fields and the women take care of the home and the children. The kids attend school and help both of their parents.Readers learn about their religious beliefs and traditions. For example, most of the Mexicans are Catholics, but others are Atheist or believe in a different type of a god: such as a fish or a part of nature.Magical realism is used throughout the entire story. The Curandera, Ultima, is magical and causes several miracles and strange things to happen. The Mexican traditions and hardships are also revealed. The young boy Antonio experiences things that only adults should have to go through. The reader gets to walk with him on his journey to manhood. He learns through experiences and strenghtens himself. He ends up becoming an amazing human being with connections to the earth that most people take for granted. I recommend this book to every type of reader. I promise nobody will get bored or want to set the book down. Go ahead and give it a try you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Anaya has written this book as a homage to the eternal struggle of the Chicano. Chicanos continually wrestle between their native american (or quiet Luna) nature and their conquistador Spaniard side(or the free-spirited Marez). Furthermore, the combination of cultures has led to a religious struggle between the beliefs of Catholicism and those of Native American mysticism.In \\"Bless Me, Ultima\\" Anaya has done a wonderful job of touching on the stuggle for identity that the Chicano experiences, as well as, those searching to find who they are. The beautiful, true-to-life language draws the reader in and carries the reader on an incredible journey of a young boy who at the end of the story, through the loss of his innocence, becomes a young man. This story will be a long-loved classic for people who enjoy multicultural themes, as well as for those Chicanos who love to hear their personal history finally told.This book has been one of my personal favorites since I read it at the tender age of 16 and now 9 years later my worn-out copy still gives me the same gratification each time I read it. Moreover, as I grow older I delve deeper into Anaya's true intentions behind the story."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I recently finished the novel Bless Me, Utlima. I really did not enjoy the novel at all. The book was boring 85 percent of the time. Whenever something exciting would happen, the novel would drop the subject and wouldn't mention the event or situation that occured for a couple chapters. For example, Tenario threatened to seek his revenge on Ultima for cursing his daughters. However, after the novel told the reader that, it dropped the subject, and didn't mention Tenario again for over 4 chapters. The novel was like a boring rollercoaster that never really seemed to get exciting.The novel talked way too much about Antonio's constant struggle with religion and finding himself. It is really hard to believe that a kid who is so young, like Antonio, worries about such subjects. Kids his age are outside playing with their friends, where as Antonio was worrying about choosing a religion, and deciding on whether to be a priest like his mother wanted him to be or a vaquero like his dad was.I also didn't like how the novel never told the reader whether or not Ultima was a witch. Evidence throughout the novel pointed the reader in the direction that she was, but never completely clarified it. I wish the novel had told us whether she was or not because that would have helped answer a lot of the questions that I had.All in all, I simply wasn't that impressed with this novel. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they like reading about a people growing up and making decisions on their own."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"One of my top 5 books ever written on the planet. If you ever had a grandmother who loved you out of childhood and into adulthood, who saw who you were, you will get what this author is saying and celebrate how beautifully he said it. If you grew up a member of the great American unloved, you know who you are, raised in day care, far from family, you may never get it but you may see enough in here to wish you could. Who thinks the book is about New Mexico, or latino culture, or Huck Finn gone Spanglish? I am taking you out to the parking lot to settle that forever~! Then I am going to pick you up and take you into my kitchen and love you so that you will understand what connection and human and belonging is all about."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Rodolfo Anaya's novel, Bless Me, Ultima tells a remarkable story about a boy named Antonio whose pure heart, innocence, and spiritual bond with a curandera named Ultima give him the strength to survive in world that surrounds him with nothing but evil, sin, and death. Tony's bravery and ability to cope with the evil he is forced to witness, while still managing to maintain his innocence helps the reader sympathize with him, his confusion about the Catholic religion, and his quest for being a good person. Many of us are brought up going to church every Sunday with our families, and we are forced to believe that everything we hear during mass or read from the Bible is true; we are also lead to believe that it is wrong to question our religion and its teachings. However, sometimes things just don't make sense, and Rodolfo Anaya does a wonderful job in this book of demonstrating many inquiries of the Catholic religion that most of us have sometime in our lives, but are too afraid to actually question them out loud.As I read Bless Me, Ultima, I was taken on an enchanted journey filled with both mythological tales and the reality of both religion and family life. I could not tear my eyes away from the pages of this novel, without anticipating a new twist that would await me in the next chapter. The author's vivid description of the Christmas play that Antonio and his friends put on at school was one of my favorite parts in the book. I think Rodolfo does an excellent job of providing such thorough descriptions of each one of the boys that the reader is able to envision the comedic and chaotic mess occurring on stage as Tony and his classmates attempt to tell the story of \\"The First Christmas.\\"Not a word is wasted in Bless Me, Ultima; every word is a contribution to the novel and the powerful story that it conveys. Rodolfo Anaya's way of writing is magical and powerful; it touches the reader's emotions on a very spiritual level. I really look forward to reading more of Rodolfo Anaya's work, especially if they are all as extraordinary as Bless Me, Ultima."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This edition of the book is a real collecter's edition for sure!

I respect all religions but I have full faith belief in my own tradition as a Navajo person. A lot of the situations that occurs throughout the book was exciting to read considering in my own culture we have similar beliefs. Knowing each ethnic group once had its own traditions and practice is interesting to learn about yet makes me wonder what ever happened to that tradition that it phased out with newer generations. The only thing preventing me from giving this book 5 stars was I felt like the author abruptly rushed through the story to come to an end. I wonder what became of the family after the final scenrio. All in all, this book made think a lot about religion, One God versus my own culture versus mainstream society. In the end, it made me realized I have a strong hold on my own tradition, culture and beliefs that is rejected by mainstream society yet I feel complete. This book is a good read, if you have time pick it up and read a few pages. I liked it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Every summer I read at least one book that is on the list of banned or challenged works. This year, I chose Bless Me, Ultima, in part because I've lived in New Mexico for a a short while, and this is clearly a story of Hispanics whose families have lived in the area for generations. It is also the coming of age story of a young boy, torn between two societies, one his mother's the other his father's.Antonio, the narrator and central character, is approaching both starting school and his first communion. Viewing himself as a good Catholic, he looks forward to taking in the body and blood of Christ so that God will become a part of him and thereafter he will find the answers to so many questions. Before he can accomplish this, however, many things occur, affecting his life in many ways, and raising more questions than answers.The most important and influential event is the arrival of Ultima, a curandero, also called La Grande, who has come to life with the family. She is healer and teacher, whose life is winding down. As she and Antonio become close, he learns through her, and an encounter with the golden carp, the beauty of the world and that life is more complicated than even his church and priest admit. A number of events in the two years this tale spans cause Antonio to question everything he had accepted of life before.The number of incidents in this young boy's life, and over the span of this book, do seem unreal. So many deaths, emergencies, and the like happening to one so young, and him right in the middle of many of them, does stretch the imagination a little. They will definitely have an effect on how he lives the rest of his life and what he decides to be as a man. Will he be a farmer? A vaquero? A priest? At the end of the book we don't know. That was not the author's purpose. What we are given is the formation of a boy's view of the world. And a very good story in the end."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This book has magic all over it in every way. Ultima is a curandera who comes to Antonio's family to help out and protect them. She winds up fostering Antonio's spirit and turning him into a young boy who is both intelligent and sensitive.

I just never figured out what Anaya was trying to tell me. It seems clear that all the characters and events are allegorical in some way, but I simply couldn't make the connections. I found the juxtaposition of catholocism and mysticism interesting, but the young narrator's wisdom and enlightenment was simply off-putting. I mean, come on, the kid is supposed to be 5 years old when the story starts, and what--6 or 7 at the end? His level of self awareness and reflection rivals that of a philosophy grad student. If the main character had at least been adolescent, I MAY have believed he existed. . ."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I would never purchase from this seller.

Taking him on a mystical journey through manhood. With influence from Ultima, who from the first time that they met, made a huge impact on Tony. Ultima seems to have the power to make people see things for what they are and the reasons behind why people act the way that they do. With heart thumping violence a tear jerking psychological battle between right and wrong, Tony becomes a MAN."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"The book Bless Me Ultima, by Rudolfo Anaya is an extremely thoughtful and provocative story. A great deal of this story revolves around the conflict between young Antonio's belief in God and other spiritual ideas such as Ultima's powerful curandera abilities and the Golden Carp.Though many deeply christian, especially Catholic, readers may find this book a stretch, it is not anti-christian in the least. Instead it examines many conflicts without really taking a certain side within these conflicts. A very good book to read for anyone from a teenager to an adult a Catholic or an atheist."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I recommened this book for the reason that, it is about a little boy named Antonio Marez and he is six years old. The book is about how he struggles in life and his beleifes in God. For example, most of the people that he finaly gets close to ends up either leaving or dieing. So i would recommened this book to a lot of spanis speaking people, because it informs you of a lot of spanish information."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless me UltimaA boy named Antonio, at the age of seven he became a man. The family is very religious and Antonio's mom thinks Antonio has what it takes to be a good priest when he grows up. On the other side his dad thinks that Antonio should become a cowboy just like his dad. Antonio really does have what it takes to become a good priest. At his age he has witnessed the death of three people including a close friend of his, and to Narciso he had confessed and prayed to before he were to die and go to heaven. Antonio is mature for his age because he was first in first grade but his teacher promoted him all the way to third grade for the next year. He is not a genius or anything but he worked very hard and got straight A's on his report card.Ultima is a healer that is very old, and so old she could be close to her death. Antonio's mom wanted Ultima to live with the family as thanks for all she has done for her and for her family. Antonio has dreams that have a weird moral to it, in one of them he saw Ultima helping his mom to help born Antonio. In that dream both his mom's and dad's sides of the family were fighting for Antonio's future. His mothers' side wanted Antonio as a priest and his dads' wanted him as a cowboy. Antonio is so attached to Ultima he found out a way to take that to be strong so he'll never forget her beautiful clean soul. She on the other hand has taught him to be good and she showed him how to cure people, but most importantly taught him to how valuable life is and to grow from bad experiences and use that to make life positive.This book made me more intelligent about life, it's given me good information that I never had thought about before this book. It showed me that life that is bad is not a bad life but one that is misunderstood. That's something that had me thinking, when I thought about it makes perfect sense. It will be confusing if you give up on it too quickly just remember when you're reading this book that it will only get better, cause I remember at the first ten pages I thought it was going to be boring but by the time I got to the next chapter something big happens to Antonio that will only get you to keep on reading it that you just get so into it. To me I thought the book made it seem like the mother exaggerates, cause after bad situations happens she goes to the living room to pray and drags all of the family to pray with her. I also thought that the time that all of this was happening was like a long time ago but its not it was at the time of World War 2, I thought it was like at the 1700's. Antonio to me seems like a saint because he is only 7 and he doesn't get into any sort of trouble. Religion is a big part of this book especially because Antonio and his family are catholic, so they do a lot of rosaries and prayers."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"In Bless Me, Ultima, not only is the reader exposed to the harsh realities of prejudice against Mexicans but the reader is also shown the angry feelings shown towards \\"brujas\\", or witches.The main character, Antonio, is a Mexican but attends school with a large number of white kids.

However, the heavy use of Spanish annoyed me quite a bit. It also led me to believe that the author, Rudolfo Anaya, was too proud of his heritage. This man found ways to incorporate Spanish into the story when it was absolutely unnecessary, and in my opinion, uncalled for. This novel was my academic level, yet I constantly had to refer to the Spanish translations. After the first few chapters, I gave up trying to read anything in Spanish.However, the best part of the novel was the controversial issues on religion. Hoping his first communion would bring him the answers to why good people die and evil people go unpunished, Antonio is disappointed to learn that it does not. His unanswered questions lead him to doubt the Catholic religion and consider another faith. Reading about his struggle was interesting and easy to relate to.Others who might also be able to relate to this novel or enjoy it, is one who understands Spanish and is willing to be enlightened on different insights about religion."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"We just finished reading Bless Me Ultima in our English II class, and I can honestly say that glad. Rudolfo Anaya's portrayal of a young boy trying to choose the right path in life is quite amusing. I can honestly say that there are not many seven year old boys who are seriously thinking about choosing to be what their mother wants them to be, or choosing to be what their father wants them to be. Children think about playing in trees or in the dirt; not becoming a priest or a vaquero.The dreams that young Antonio experiences are closer to visions of the future, than real dreams. He sees himself and his brothers near the river. He also sees himself going with his brothers to a whore house. The boring and meaningless dreams get longer and longer as the book progresses.The action actually picks up in the book about fifteen pages from the end. This pointless book carries on for chapters at a time and I do not suggest reading it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless me, Ultima is the story of a young boy who grows up in new Mexico and his experiences as told by him in first person.Antonio is the product of two contrasting families, the Lunas and the Marez. Through out the book both families want him to follow in their ways: The Lunas want him to be a priest and the Maraz a Vaquero. The tale chronicles his experiances through school church and some difficult subjects that can be only taught by life.On the surface the book is has a great plot and array of characters, but this book is so much more than that. It conveys many ideas through hinting and Antonio's experiences. It touches on war, religion, westward expansion and many others.Get this book if you just wnat a good read or if you would like to probe a little deeper, either way you will be satisfied."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima is a book I would recommend because it deals with issues young adults can relate to, such as, developing our own personal identity. Not what our mother wants, our father wants, or what the family expects, but our &quot;own.&quot; Antonio, the main protagonist of this novel has to face the opposing forces in his life to create himself, a combination of all he has lived through. Ultima tells Antonio, &quot;as you grow into manhood you must develop your own truths(112).&quot; I agree, as we become older, hence wiser, we must take our own stand, make our own decisions, establish our own beleifs. We can not expect our parents to decide for us, tell us what to beleive, who to become. We have to take responsibilty for our actions, our life.This one human universal concern is developed by Rudolfo Anaya throughout the novel by the reoccuring theme of the loss of innocence. In order to develop a personal identity as young adults, one must lose their innocence, that is, leave their childhood behind ( if at all possible). Antonio realizes that, &quot;the innocence which our isolation sheltered could not last forever (14).&quot; Here, Antonio recognizes that although we may want to maintain the child within, full of innocence and no knowledge about the evils of the world, it is almost an impossible and inevitable event in life, that may not be bargained with, compromised or posponed.Ultimately, all in all, Bless Me, Ultima, is a great novel easy to read, and to relate to, as it deals with issues we all must deal with/ encounter in that painful transition from childhood to young adulthood. As we fully open our eyes to the crude reality of the world, we develop our own personal identity, through losing our innocence. This the novel clearly outlines."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I read this book for school, and it totally (...). The plot was boring, and the book was full of death and despair. From the way that the author wrote the book, it sounded like he hated children. He gave them too complicated lives, and thoughts too profound for children.

I really really liked it, but most of the people in my class hated it. They said it was a total rip-off on TKAM (i think the real problem is the amount of work my teacher gave us...but let's assume they thought it was a rip-off).First of all, this is nothing like TKAM. Nothing like it. While TKAM takes place in Alabama, BMU is in New Mexico. The central themes of this novel are good vs. evil, while the ones in TKAM are more about segregation and doing what is easy vs. doing what is right. Also, this book focuses on religion and magic. Really focuses on those themes. This isn't TKAM!!!With that point of contention aside, I can now focus on other issues. I really really liked it because it seemed to be realistic but managed nonetheless to incorporate magic and mystical themes. And no, Mrs. S, Ultima is NOT the main character of the book. She just stands in the corner and spouts words of wisdom at people. Tony is the protagonist and that's that.This book is very deep and explores many concepts that may seem uncomfortable to people. Maybe that's why my classmate's didn't like it. I liked it because it made me think outside the box (is the Golden Carp really a god?!) and becuase it was interesting.

I think he does an exceptional job of portraying a young child going through the maturing process in a Hispanic community but seemed to forget how old he was. The reason I add Hispanic is because many of his customs and the way he thinks and acts is because of his Hispanic heritage. I think this book would make a good movie, but only if the director was able to find actors that could portray the characters well enough. It could be done, but it would be hard.I think Anaya chose to make the main character too young. A seven-year-old boy just doesn't think about the things that Antonio does. Most of the time I forgot that he was only seven, then it hit me again and I was shocked. Also, some of the events he makes the child go through are very devastating, but he seems to take them in stride, using them to help make his decisions.I think it's an interesting book. You should read it for yourself though; I don't want to tell you what it is or isn't. I think everyone should make his or her own decision on this one."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I fell in love with this book when I began it, it has a beautiful rhythm, is very realistic, has wonderful accents of Hispanic culture, and really takes you to a vivid, alive world that is set in the US but feels like another world. As far as plot, this is mostly a psychological and philosophical story; don't expect a lot of action though there is a fair share of it. But thing that bothered me the most is the glorification of paganism combined with the degredation of Christianity. I am not overly squeamish about reading literature that does not believe the way I do, but in this book it was excessive. I got sick of seeing the Christians and the Christian faith shown as being empty, fruitless and inadequate. Had there not been this much blasphemy (several examples in nearly every chapter) I would have given this novel a four or quite possibly a five. Other than the religious aspect, the only other problem is that the ending chapters are weak and unsatisfying. This is overall a decent novel, but certainly not a &quot;masterpiece&quot;."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I realize that this book has certain interesting twists and a few engrossing segments, but I believe this book, as a whole, to be a terrible waste of time. This book was filled with prostitution, witchcraft, and blasphemous ideals. I believe that any story that needs prostitutes and brothels to carry on its story is a terribly pitiful piece of work. The theme of the book dealt with witchcraft, voodoo, and devil worship. I was personally offended by the use of several different blasphemous suggestions and thoughts. Just the consideration that voodoo and magic is more powerful than God was upsetting to me. This novel, in several instances, puts down all beliefs in God, as a friendly being, by portraying him as an overbearing, uncompassionate, and unforgiving dictator who only brings suffering and toys with people's emotions and personal lives for no particular reason.This book had way too many little stories put together into one big story, and this made it even more of a bore. The book seemed to go on and on, without really having a good ending to tie it all together. Antonio's questions about God were never answered, and the book ends with a woman, who has been proved to be a witch, blessing a little boy. Another thing that hurt this book's refinement was its incessant use of vulgar language. Throughout the book, nearly every character and especially the children used horrible language that, if in a Hollywood film, would ensure an R rating. All of the reasons I have mentioned are obvious reasons why I would not recommend this book to anyone. I would actually go so far as to warn people not to read this sad, literary flop."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"\\"Bless Me Ultima\\" es una historia desde un punto de vista de un ni?o.

I was required to read this book for school and did not enjoy it as much as some of the other books that I have read. The plot is somewhat dry and not very exciting. What was interesting was the character development throughout the book and what each character represented in Antonio's life. I'm not sure I would recommend this book to others but you may want to read it if you are interested in culture and religion."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Rudolfo Anaya has written a novel in the first person, so it of course does seem autobiographical. Antonio Marez starts telling us his story at the age of about 5, before starting school, and then takes us through a few years until, as a self-defined \\"man,\\" he tells his mother to take his sisters away, in the face of the final tragedy.And that final tragedy is..........?The death of his beloved Ultima, the curandera who has blessed him.Antonio is the youngest son of a cowboy-type father (Marez) and a mother from a farm people (Luna). Unlike his brothers, who take after their father, Antonio has a lot of his mother in him, and spends time learning to farm with the Lunas. His mother would like him to become a priest, or at least a \\"man of learning.\\"So, this is a sort of \\"coming out\\" novel, but the protagonist is younger than usual and he never does really come out, in that sense. Catcher in the Rye this book is not.His school mates are pretty funny, with one tragedy, Florence, the non-believer, who drowns. I think some of the names didn't translate well, especially Florence. Florencio is a fine name in Spanish, but Florence in English is almost always a female name. Same with Bones (Calaveras), Horse (Caballo), etc., they are nicknames that sound a lot better in Spanish than when they are translated into English.Tenorio? Well, he is painted as evil, and he does act pretty stupidly, but Ultima does show her true nature when she tells Antonio to forgive him (Christ-like, \\"for they know not what they do\\").This book is worth reading, but it will take a while to finish it. Maybe have something a little lighter on the side to read while you dip in and out at intervals, like other chores you have to do little by little. Diximus."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Well I had to read this in high school because the teacher made us, but anyway I had to read this book again because of the comprative religion class that I was taken. It wasn't that good when I first read it, however, as I was reading it this time it seemed a lot better because I could understand most of it.The story is about thecoming of age of a little boy, written as a reflection back to his childhood, and how he ultimately learns responability and decisions based on the things one person does through Ultima.It's a pretty easy read, and the story does not have a climax to it, but it's a decent book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I think when Ultima put a curse on the Trementina sisters, it made Tenorio hungry for revenge, and eventually killed her. \\"The curse of the Trementinas shall bend and fly in their faces.\\" (p.97) That means Ultima put the curse on the three sisters. \\"Tenorio has blamed la Grande for his daughter's death!\\" (p.128) This shows that Tenorio was probably more than a little angry. \\"I have killed the owl [Ultima] with a bullet molded by the Prince of Death!...The witch is dead, my daughters are avenged!\\" (p.258) That means he killed Ultima by killing the owl, and had his revenge. It would seem that Ultima putting the curse on the Tremintina witches changed the course of the story.The relationship between Antonio and Ultima is very close. They seem to share a bond that nobody else knows about. \\"This was the last child I pulled from your womb, Mar&iacute;a. I knew there would be something between us.\\" (p. 12) Antonio was a changing young boy who was trying to decide who he was. \\"Oh please tell me which is the water that runs through my veins.\\" (p.120) This shows his struggle of who he is more like, his mother or his father. Ultima's part in the story was to be the one to help Antonio along his way. \\"She took the thin and placed it around my neck... \`A small pouch of helpful herbs...It will keep you safe.'\\" (p.124) This shows her giving Antonio some magic protection to help him grow up. Antonio learned that Ultima's power was stronger than that of a priest. \\"Was it possible that there was more power in Ultima's magic than in the priest?\\" (p.99) Ultima had taken off the curse that the priest could not.This book was okay, but it took way too long for the climax. It was really lacking energy for a large part of the book. I might consider reading another of his books, but I doubt it, if they're similar to this one, because I would probably skip to the end just to avoid the pointless parts. I would not recommend this book to a friend because I'm not that bad of a friend, I don't think anybody wants to read such a boring book, with only one or two interesting parts. I would rate this book a five out of ten because it's not horrible, it's just not good either. A movie version would be better, because it would be more interesting, I think. I believe that having the book partially in Spanish made it harder to comprehend, so having it all in English would have been better. Otherwise, it wasn't too bad."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I realize that this book has certain interesting twists and a few engrossing segments, but I believe this book, as a whole, to be a terrible waste of time. This book was filled with prostitution, witchcraft, and blasphemous ideals. I believe that any story that needs prostitutes and brothels to carry on its story is a terribly pitiful piece of work. The theme of the book dealt with witchcraft, voodoo, and devil worship. I was personally offended by the use of several different blasphemous suggestions and thoughts. Just the consideration that voodoo and magic is more powerful than God was upsetting to me. This novel, in several instances, puts down all beliefs in God, as a friendly being, by portraying him as an overbearing, uncompassionate, and unforgiving dictator who only brings suffering and toys with people's emotions and personal lives for no particular reason.This book had way too many little stories put together into one big story, and this made it even more of a bore. The book seemed to go on and on, without really having a good ending to tie it all together. Antonio's questions about God were never answered, and the book ends with a woman, who has been proved to be a witch, blessing a little boy. Another thing that hurt this book's refinement was its incessant use of vulgar language. Throughout the book, nearly every character and especially the children used horrible language that, if in a Hollywood film, would ensure an R rating. All of the reasons I have mentioned are obvious reasons why I would not recommend this book to anyone. I would actually go so far as to warn people not to read this sad, literary flop."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Without a doubt, this novel has had the most lasting effect on my life, more than anything I have read.

Anaya writes with lyricism and poetry."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This is a rather long work tha plods along like a melting glacier about the story of a youg boy, his family and his attachment to a healer known as Ultima.

I don't know what it is about this book that sticks with you, the characters, the witch craft, or the journey of discovery that the book takes you on. I would advise that you read it slowly, dissecting every scene. The metaphors in this book are amazing."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bought this as a gift for a friend. She could not put it down. Have been a fan of Rudy Anaya for many years. This has to be one of the top three books on the experience of Hispanos in the Southwest. Excellent read."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima is an intriguing novel, taking place in Guadalupe, New Mexico. Based around values and morals, Rudolpho Anaya takes us through the young life of Antonio Marez, the six-year-old protagonist of the novel. Bless Me, Ultima shows his great interest and rare bond with the new guest living in his home along with his family hardships and challenges against his personal beliefs.From the very first day Ultima stepped into Antonio's life, he noticed an instant connection, and with their special relationship, young Tony would learn more than he could have ever imagined. Antonio reveals that Ultima, a women known to have healing powers and for her use of folk magic, is the old women from his dream and learns that she alone knows his destiny. Antonio and most of all his mother Maria, are eager to learn just what his destiny entails.Witnessing horrific events such as the death of Lupito, a struggling World War II veteran, and the murder of the town drunk Narciso, Antonio becomes confused about his beliefs. Ultima turns out to be a guiding light for Tony, teaching him about proper morals and goodness, leaving you to wonder how he will take in all of her unique lessons.Overall, Bless Me, Ultima is an great read. It keeps you interested because the storyline is not only excellent but it is also very detailed and even includes several phrases in Spanish. I thought Rudolpho was very clever in doing this because its something I've never seen before in other novels I've read. As you read, it keeps you guessing about events to come and how the characters may change. It's definitely a page-turner, especially with the help of the mysterious Ultima as one of the main characters."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I was required to read this book for my English class and was honestly expeecting to hate it. It turned out that it wasn't awful, but wasn't great. It seemed to drag in parts and some of the descriptions bothered me, but the big problems I had with it were:1) Religious overkill. I understand the religion was a central part of Tony's life, but there was a little too much of it for my tastes. A little editing out of it might have made me cringe a little less.2) Tony's classmates. These 6/7/8 year old kids are constantly fighting, wrestling, and cursing. I'm all for a little blood and bad language, but seriously. I have a hard time believing kids this age act like that all the time. I did NOT like that at all. I really just wanted to give them all a good smack.3) Was he really 6? Tony is supposed to be 6 when this book starts, but you would never guess it. He is WAY too contemplative and willing to please for a 6 year old. This kid is constantly questioning religion and society and is worrying about whether can please both of his parents and whether or not he'll be a priest or a farmer.3.5) Nobody is that perfect. It seemed to me that Tony had no real flaws. Yes, he witnessed a lot of evil and wrong doing, but other than that the kid is an angel. Do you know anyone who is a perfect student, always kind and willing to put others before themselves, contemplative and concerned with the world around them, and always wants to please their parents? Do you know anyone like this who is 6?Bottom line: Don't bother with unless you're really a fan of this type of writing."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I really enjoyed the book, it was actually fun to read. It is also funny if you are catholic because some of the scenes in the book remind you of your family."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Honestly, I didn't read this book for pleasure, I read it because it was assigned to me in my Chicano & Latino Arts & Literature class. However, as I read it, I couldn't put it down. It was an easy read, I'd say a high school book, and although there were dabs of spanish words throughout the novel, I who have only taken spanish class in early high school remembered most of the words, and helped to add a more native feel of the book.This book is a coming of age story of young boy, and what his family goes through when Ultima, a curandera ( folkhealer) moves into their home. I've read other naive reviews, who really don't appreciate what this book is giving. It brilliantly combines both Latino culture with Native American culture, which is known as Chicano culture. As the reader, you get to watch Antonio mature as he deals with thing that most 7 year olds don't deal with like seeing death. You can relate to him no matter what your background, whether your parents pressure you, or you've ever felt left out at school or among your friends, or if you've ever stuck up for something you believe in even if others don't.He grows with the help of Ultima, and her owl, which is her symbol. He feels safe whenever the owl is near. His dreams at time can be really symbolic but they just foreshadow his innerconflicts with religion and being pressured whether or not to follow his mothers way of life, or his fathers way of life or if he should branch out on his own.I'd highly reccomend this book because it really does give a better understanding of the chicano culture, while presenting a heartwarming story about a young boy coming to age."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima is a book I would recommend because it deals with issues young adults can relate to, such as, developing our own personal identity. Not what our mother wants, our father wants, what our family expects, but, our &quot;own.&quot; Antonio, the main protagonist of this novel, has to face the opposing forces in his life to create himself, a combination of all he has lived through. Ultima tells Antonio, &quot;as you grow into manhood you must develop your own truths (112).&quot; I agree, as we become older, hence wiser, we must take our own stands, make our own decisions, our own beliefs. We can not expect our parents to decide for us, tell us what to believe. We have to take responsibility for our actions. This one human universal concern was developed by Rudolfo Anaya, through the reoccuring theme of the loss of innocence in the novel. In order to develop a personal identity as young adults, one must lose their innocence, that is, leave their childhood behind (if at all possible). Antonio realizes that &quot;the innocence which our isolation sheltered could not last forever(14).&quot; Here, Antonio recognizes that although we may mant to maintian the child within, full of innocence and no knowledge about the world, it is almost an impossible and inevitable event in life, that may not be improvised, posponed, or prolonged.Ultimately, all in all, Bless Me, Ultima is a great novel easy to read, and to relate to as it deals with issues we have all encountered to an extent. That painful transition fron childhood to young adulthood, which results in the development of our own personal identity, through the loss of innocence."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I heard this book was one of the top 20 books to read before you got out of college. I took my MEChA advisor's advice and read this book, since it was the only one written by a Chicano Author in the big list. This books is about Ultima, and she comes to live with the family. Ultima is a curandera who knows the fathe of the youngest child, when one of the parent's thinks he will be a priest, and when the other parent thinks he will be a guy who lives in the llano. Ultima teaches the kid a lot about life itself. If your a Chicano Student and haven't read this book, your missing out!!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I have to say I really enjoyed this book. I also have to say that I have learned a lot from it. It's the kind of book that I can relate to. Antonio is out to find his way and is growing up and so am I. He posed questions that challenged his faith and so have I at a point in my life. I can relate because even though I'm 15 going on 16 I have felt the way Antonio felt and sometimes still do. I guess you can say I saw a bit of myself in this book, although I have never seen anyone die, I have never gotten into a fight, and I have never met or lived with a curandera. I so recommend this book to anyone because the theme in this book of how hard it is to grow up is one I think we can all relate to. I think we've all been at a point in our lives where we have so many questions, yet the answers don't come when we want, or we don't understand them. Then the whole parent thing. Antonio's parents had plans for his future without really considering what Antonio wanted. I think there are some of us who's parents have a career they want us to follow, but we don't because we want to do something else with our life. Even though I was forced to read this book for a class, I have to say I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"The book, Bless Me, Ultima written by Rudolfo Anaya is a story of a young boy, Antonio, who lives in the outskirts of a town called Las Pasturas in New Mexico. The story starts to unfold when Ultima, la curandera, a women who cures with herbs and magic comes to live with Antonio's family. Antonio is taught to understand people and their ways by the wise Ultima as well as her magic which is sacred. Throughout the novel Antonio recounts his fears, aspirations, and hopes as we live his life in the eyes of a six year old boy, who is wise beyond his years.I would not consider reading any of Rudolfo Anaya's books because his novel, Bless Me, Ultima did not catch my interest. The plot took too long to unfold and was not exciting to my expectations. I would not recommend his books to any of my friends because they are not interested in the way he tells the story or the story itself-it is a little on the old-fashioned side. Anaya wrote the book well and used wonderful literary elements to understand the book from different perspectives, but it was not my type of literature.This book should not be a movie because people would leave in the beginning , the plot takes to long to unfold and to catch the audiences interest. Overall the story was not great, if you have nothing better to do, then read it."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me Ultima was an interesting book. It had quite a few unexpected twists and turns, which made the story even more exciting to read. Rudolfo Anaya did a ton of research, both on New Mexico and about growing up in New Mexico. Rudolfo did a little bit of basic research on witchcraft as well, but not a lot of it. It was just enough to make the story flow and be believable at the same time.Rudolfo's novel was a gripping story about how a young boy, Antonio, had to get along with a few situations, which we would hope wouldn't happen to us. He has to deal with witchcraft and fights which matched the good and evil's wits against each other. There was much bloodshed and death that this poor little boy had to get through, and throughout most of the story he was only in first grade!Bless Me Ultima was chalk-full of symbolism. One really good technique that Anaya portrays while writing Bless Me Ultima, is that he tries to make the reader understand the story better with a great deal of symbolism and does a very good job of it to!The only reason I would rate this book a four-star is that most of the dialogue was in Spanish. I don't know Spanish at all, so it was kind of hard to follow the story. I know that the language was a good background image of the people of new Mexico, but it was a little cumbersome to keep flipping to my reference page of Spanish words. This caused me to have to reread the sentence, phrase, or sometimes paragraph to get the real meaning of what the word meant. It wasn't really in the text as much, but in the dialogue. I always can tell what a book is about when I read the dialogue and I am a firm believer that dialogue helps the everyday person understand what the story is about, almost like symbolism, but better, because with dialogue you know what the characters are thinking then.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to take an adventure through a young boys mind and his voyages. Rudolfo Anaya is a great writer, since his technique is greatly separate from anyone elses writing technique."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"One goal of the book was to display to the public only some of the pressures that a child will face during his or her process of maturing. In this story, Antonio has to deal with pleasing his parents, pleasing his friends, and still being able to be and do what will please him. Wherever he goes, he feels he needs to fit in and be what everyone wants him to be. He ends up feeling helpless and confused because he discovers what most of us know: You cannot please everyone. The needs he should have been concerned with primarily should have been his own, but being the good and obedient son and friend, he tries to take on more than he can handle. It is understandable that he wants his parents to be proud of him and his friends to accept him, but the first thing that he should do is first be proud of and accept himself. This was the part that I related to most, because I understand those pressures that he was going through. I have to deal with them every day of my life. Fortunately, he has a better understanding of how to survive life by the end of the book.Ultima and Antonio have a unique relationship, but that was what made it so great. Ultima knew about the things that Antonio was going to ask her before the thoughts even entered his mind. Every time they talked to each other, Antonio learned something new. Ultima always had some lesson to teach the related to every situation they encountered. Therefore, every conversation Antonio had with Ultima made him grow up and mature a little more. Ultima served as a guide and friend to the little boy. She seemed to be the one who understood his feelings best when he felt like no one did.Bless Me, Ultima started out to be semi-interesting, but then toward the middle, I felt like it started to \\"drag.\\" One aspect that I took notice of, though, was the issue that Antonio was having with the conflicting faiths. On the one hand, he would choose to be Catholic like he was raised to be and he would follow the word of God, but on the other hand, Cico had introduced him to the Golden Carp. This newfound deity seemed to be so influential that it caused Antonio to question his faith in the Church. I liked these parts in the book, because they point out that even the most devout and religious people can be tempted to stray from their beliefs. The indecision about his faith was especially great in some parts of the story, because he felt like God abandoned him at times. There were so many of his questions that were left unanswered. He thought that the answers would finally come once he was communed, but it didn't happen, and that left him unsatisfied. He considered worshipping the Golden Carp instead."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I recently finished reading Bless me Ultima as an assignment. The novel starts out by Ultima comes to live with Antonio and his family. Antonio is the narrator. Antonio's mother wants him to become a priest. Antonio does what his mother wishes and doesn't even think about not pleasing her and the family. Antonio spends all of his time doing what his mother wants. I don't think the author was realistic about real childs behavior. Anaya put so much pressure on Antonio about communions and family. Realistically, a seven year old boy is not seriously thinking about a life career being what his mother wants. Seven year old children are more interesting in playing with friends.The book was extremely boring at the beginning, and didn't get the slightest bit interesting until the 15th chapter. Most of the whole book talks about the llano and Antonio's long drawn out dreams, which foreshadow some of what happens in the beginning. The book has ALOT of religion. The up side to the story was I was able to learn more about the Catholic religion. I don't recommend this book if you don't know some Spanish. I actually don't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I would consider reading other books by Rudolfo Anaya; however, the chance of me actually reading one of his other books would be extremely low. There are so many good books out there waiting to be read that would interest me much more than anything by Anaya, that I wouldn't have the time or the will to read his books. For that same reason, I would only recommend this book to someone else if they asked about it. In that case, I would tell them that it was a pretty good book. It was thought provoking and deep, but it wasn't the most thrilling, upbeat, edge of your seat, can't wait to read more kind of book. This book would make a great movie. The slow or boring parts of the book could be cut out or spiced up to make the story more exciting. The direction and acting would have to be perfect in order to accurately depict the book. The actors would need to look rustic, act sort of rustic, and portray an almost solemn image. The book Bless Me, Ultima was well written, and the story was well thought out. This is an excellent book to read if you have nothing better to read.Antonio is a young boy who begins his descent into manhood when Ultima, a wise and trusted friend of his mother's, comes to live with him. Antonio and Ultima are soul mates. She understands him and his needs like no one else does. Ultima is Antonio's mentor and protector. Ultima guides Antonio along his journey into manhood. She is someone he can talk to and ask questions to. When he does ask a question, Ultima gives him an answer that he does not completely understand so that Antonio can figure out the answer himself and in the process, learn something about himself or about life.Anaya most effectively created the struggle of religion and faith. The reader could clearly see that Antonio was confused about what to believe in. For so long he had believed that God was the only god, and that at his first communion, God would enter him and answer all of his questions. When this didn't happen the way he had expected it to, he questioned his faith. When he saw the golden carp and beheld its beauty and when he began to learn the ways of Ultima's magic, he began to question his religion. This aspect of the story was the most thought provoking, to Antonio and the reader. The book also portrays the struggle between good and evil, growing up, and letting go of dreams."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"I believe the major accomplishment of Bless Me Ultima was that it created a way for a reader to look through the eyes of a child who was very mature in the beginning, almost too mature, and even more mature near the end of the story. It takes you on a ride with a young man named Antonio and his mental growth during a period of two years. The literary element that stood out the most to me in this composition was tone. The tone of the book made the book. It's ideal was to guide on the thoughts of young, mature children and how they react to certain situations. Rudolpho Anaya chose to look at everything very maturely even though the main character was a young boy. It mentions that Antonio shall be a priest in the first chapter, but the opposition is that he will become a vaquero. Antonio must be mature to have such ideas about his future at his young age.Ultima was a character who was brought into the story in the beginning of the book. She serves as a mentor to Antonio as their relationship is much like a teacher student relationship. Ultima teaches Antonio of how the world really is and about religion. She instills strong Catholic thoughts into him. Ultima also teaches Antonio how to make healing herbs and other remedies. Ultima is with Antonio the full time of his character progression. She actually develops his maturity level through the knowledge she passes on to him. After Antonio's witnessing of Lupito's shooting, Ultima cares for him and tells him things that help him to understand things. Antonio's question's were related to religion because they were also related to heaven and hell which were derived from the fate of the men shooting and the fate of the man who was shot.The book, Bless Me Ultima, was an average read by my standards. I didn't think there was much of a wow factor in the book because the climax and action scenes were too slow to develop and weren't very promising due to the lack of actual events. The character developments were great though. This is one of the things that set the book above the rest. The character developments were long and thought out so that the reader could actually get and image of what the character would be like in real life and how they would react to certain situations. Another thing about the story was that it was difficult for me to get into. The book was more dramatic than action packed so it really isn't my type of genre. I found myself dosing off to sleep at times where the plot was thin. But I would recommend this book to fans of dramatic stories or fans of Rudolfo Anaya. I would rate this book as an average read for high school students which show much examples of literary elements and devices. I don't believe this should be a movie on account of movies don't do so well without some action or suspense. The book did none of this for me. But if it were a movie, I'd picture Antonio as a young man who gains much knowledge and matures at the same time. Ultima would be portrayed as an old wise lady who serves as Antonio's teacher, and Antonio's parents would be portrayed as having different backgrounds, thoughts, and ideas. All in all a good book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Reading this book from the perspective of a person who has been raised an atheist, I was not at all impressed with the strong use of Catholic rituals and beliefs that were littered so freely through the first half of the book. In fact, had we not been required to read it for English II, I would have given it up in disgust. At first I was completely put off by the vehement use of controlled religion that seemed to be pushed on the characters in the book and, therefore, on the readers.Once the book seemed to take off, after much anticipation, I began to not hate the forcefulness of God and strict religious reference quite so much.Towards the end, the spiritual developments that the main character has gone through seem to make the book worth the long suffering wait. The climax between good and evil seems to be directed towards the unorganized aspect of religion, as God and the Church are questioned. The author seems to realize that there are flaws no matter what religion you are, and that you cannot push your beliefs onto anyone.I am against censorship of any kind. I believe that a person can write whatever he/she wants, and I realize that is what enables me to write this short essay now. But I do not think that such a religious book should be read by any who have been surrounded by religion pushers and atheism-haters their whole life. And I definitely do not think that such a book should be read in school, as life teaches us lessons, and I doubt any student got much of an enlightenment out of it. I may be wrong, but school is supposed to not have anything to do with God, am I correct?Overall it was a decent book, and I probably would never have touched it had it not been given to me as an assignment. Maybe I am being too harsh on the whole religion aspect, and I suppose that everyone will have their own personal views and problems or benefits from the book.I cannot write good reviews because I am too set in my own opinions."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This book shows the hardships of the WW2 era, although not much affected by the war, these poor families of New Mexico are struggling to develop on a culturally-changing country. This novel had a lot of tense moments in it, but to me, these moments are hard to impress on me through writing. Perhaps because I grew up on movies, lazily making the action sequences come to me, reading an action sequence is like a chore to me. So therefore I didn't exactly like this book as much as the next one, but there is a lot, I mean a LOT of symbolism in this novel, giving you a fresh look at all of its points of view. To tell you the truth, I would consider reading some of Rudolfo Anaya's books, although I didn't like Bless Me, Ultima, he could do a lot better, and I have room for him to see his other work. I would rate this book (on a scale of one-ten), a six. The reasons I took off four is because it was boring at most parts, but the symbolism and the emotions in it really saved this sinking ship. I do not believe this novel should be turned into a movie for multiple reasons: the book is far too extensive to try to portray in film, and it is best to leave it as a book and let the reader imagine what the characters look like and act like.

Some other things that I did not enjoy about this work of art were that the kids acted so much older than real life six and seven year olds, and I did not appreciate how they were constantly fighting and wrestling. I do not agree with violence especially when small children witness the crazed acts of murder, and hate.

All in all a nice book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"As a Hispanic, I cannot believe that I hadn't read *Bless Me, Ultima* earlier. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. Anaya is a superb storyteller.As it is in the Hispanic culture, elders are supposed to be taken care of whether or not they are family. So, in comes Ultima, an elderly curandera. A curandera is a faith healer, not a witch. However, some people may not see the difference between the two. The proper and respectful term to Ultima is Grande, meaning \\"wise one\\".Antonio is the youngest boy in this particular family who has taken in Ultima. He is fascinated with everything related to Ultima. When he greets her for the first time, he calls her Ultima. He is scolded by his mother but Ultima intercepts. He's the only one who calls her Ultima throughout the book.Ultima seems to have taken a fascination with Antonio. She selects him to accompany her to collect herbs and whatnots for her \\"practices\\". Also, when some people are curses with spells by the witches, Ultima takes Antonio with her to help break spells.There are many things happening in this book. One thing that happened was that one of Antonio's uncles was afflicted with a spell that nearly cost him his life. When Ultima and Antonio break a spell, a local man and his 3 witch daughters vow revenge. One by one, Ultima encounters and breaks a spell, increasing Antonio's respect and curiosity of Ultima's powers. When a spell is broken, something terrible happens to the witch daughters, which increases their father's hatred for Ultima.You just have to read the book. There is a lot of symbolisms in the book. The symbols are not subtle. You'll be reading but pondering over the symbols in your mind. Overall, Anaya tells this story wonderfully. There is no boring or slow parts in this book. Something is always happening which keeps you alert."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima, is a very intriguing novel. The storyline keeps you hooked throughout almost the entire book. I really enjoyed this. Nothing was really that slow going besides maybe the beginning. Bless Me, Ultima exposes the reader to the Mexican culture. You experience the daily lives of both the men and the women. The men work in the fields and the women take care of the home and the children. The kids attend school and help both of their parents.Readers learn about their religious beliefs and traditions. For example, most of the Mexicans are Catholics, but others are Atheist or believe in a different type of a god: such as a fish or a part of nature.Magical realism is used throughout the entire story. The Curandera, Ultima, is magical and causes several miracles and strange things to happen. The Mexican traditions and hardships are also revealed. The young boy Antonio experiences things that only adults should have to go through. The reader gets to walk with him on his journey to manhood. He learns through experiences and strenghtens himself. He ends up becoming an amazing human being with connections to the earth that most people take for granted. I recommend this book to every type of reader. I promise nobody will get bored or want to set the book down. Go ahead and give it a try you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Rodolfo Anaya's book Bless Me Ultima, is a story of a young six year old boy trying to make the right decisions in life for himself, for his mother and his father. He is torn between growing up being a farmer like his father or a priest like his mother's wishes. He witnesses a lot of sin and a lot of bad things for a kid his age.A lady of great respect and the wisest woman in his family comes to stay with him and his family, Ultima, or La Grande. He looks up to her in the highest way, as she teaches him various things, from her curandera (a folk healer) practices, to the way she used the earth for her cures. People thought of her as a witch, which was one of Antonio's arguments to the people, and kids of the town.This book gives a really good description of how it is to have questions on the Catholic religion as a kid, or as an adult, especially if you grow up in a Hispanic family. Having some words is Spanish gives it a better feel for the way it is growing up in his household, and imagining his family interacting with one another.The description of the house and the windows in the winter put me there in the kitchen. The smell of breakfast in the morning before school, and his mother calling him and his sisters down for breakfast, was also a great description that also brought me back to when I was a kid, and getting ready for school and having my mother call me down to my mornings feast.Overall this book gave me a great feeling, as I imagined myself there. I found it hard to put the book down when it was time to come to a stopping point and do my everyday things. Each chapter was such a great adventure and learning experience, that it always left me in suspense.

It was apparent within the first 40 pages or so that my students probably wouldn't like it, but I wanted to finish it for myself. I really enjoy Latin American literature. This is not quite as good as that, but I do enjoy Mexican-American culture and language, so I did like those elements of the story, particularly Antonio's struggles with religion and identity. Having been raised in a Catholic family, I understood a lot of the rites of passage being described, and was somewhat envious of the little boy's devotion; I myself never felt that religion played a large part in my life. I didn't see receiving communion or first confession as a life-altering experience. In the end, neither did Antonio, but the belief he had in something greater than himself was real and unconquerable. In the end, though Antonio was unable to completely reconcile his conflicted faiths, he was at least able to acknowledge that life is not as simple as we as kids would like to think. Understanding is a life-long pursuit, not something you wake up with one day. While this can be terrifying, it can also be beautiful. This, I believe, is the message of the novel.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, FROM A NATIVE NEW MEXICAN!"},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Bless Me, Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya, is a story of maturation of a young Hispanic American boy named Antonio, during the 1940's. This story, though it sounds fairly straight forward, is anything but average. Bless Me, Ultima mixes the supernatural world and the traditional Catholic ideals. The young protagonist must choose for himself his fate whether to be a priest/farmer and follow his mother's wishes or to become a man of the flesh like his father's people. The boy is torn by his high morals and sins that are occurring around him. The novel tries to answer many of life's moral questions such as this. The author accomplishes this. His mentor and closest friend, Ultima, uses the spiritual world of herbs and medicine to counteract against the evil that had taken place in the small towns in New Mexico. Ultima represents pure goodness and the character named Tenorio is a representation of pure evil. The last &quot;showdown&quot;, is the ultimate battle between goodness and evil, like in the book of Revelations in the New Testament Bible which depicts goodness to ultimately win over evil and the people are saved from the sins of the world. &quot;It is because good is always stronger than evil... The smallest bit of good can stand against all the powers of evil in the world and it will emerge triumphant&quot;(Bless Me, Ultima 98). In many ways, this novel has parallels to the novel The Crucible by Arthur Miller. Much of the novel is spent chasing evil in the form of witches. As in The Crucible, innocent people are accused of witchery because the townspeople were fearful of things they could not understand. Antonio sums up human nature by saying, &quot;I think most of the things we call evil are not evil at all; it is just that we don't understand those things and so we call them evil. And we fear evil only because we do not understand it. When we went to the T&eacute;llez ranch I was afraid because I did not understand what was happening, but Ultima was not afraid because she understood-&quot; (248). The accuser who takes revenge against the pure goodness of Ultima takes her life but not her soul. The goodness is left in the form of young Antonio. Evil actions that takes place in the towns of New Mexico included: prostitution, drunkeness, witchcraft, having other gods, and murder. Through maturation Antonio is able to ask himself, must one lose their innocence? &quot;Had I already lost my innocence? How? I had seen Lupito murdered... I had seen Ultima's cure... I had seen the men come to hang her... I had seen the awful fight just now... I had seen and reveled in the beauty of the golden carp! ...How had I sinned?&quot; (165). This is a major theme important to people living in the 20th century. Antonio is witness to all of these sacreligious actions and questions where God is to let these things to happen. He is very unsure of his faith towards God since he sees three deaths, Florence, Narciso, and Lupito. Antonio goes on further on to ask himself, does one gain understanding by losing innocence? His father's answer was simply stated, yet with much truth, &quot;understanding comes with life, as a man grows he sees life and death, he is happy and sad, he works, plays, meets people-sometimes it takes a lifetime to acquire understanding, because in the end understanding simply means having a sympathy for people&quot; (248). How could we make sense of the deaths, though? Three of the towns deaths were beings who were evil: two of the witches who cursed Lucas, and their father Tenorio. As the deaths of the evil were necessary for the end of the witch hunt, the goodness is also believed to die to bring the town back to harmony. According to the Bible, this fight between goodness and evil is predicted to occur at the end of the world. At this time, the believers of the savior will be saved, while the unforgiven go to either Hell or Purgatory. A major question for the working class and Antonio is education help you in life? My answer to how I believe the author would answer this is that school education helps us progress in this world, but only the religion will help you get through the after life. This novel asks the major questions posed in humanity and deals with it in an innocent yet knowledgeable way. Looking through young Antonio's eyes, we can see from the perspective of the innocent what is wrong with our beliefs and in general, our world. Anaya does a fantastic job asking question and answering in his own way some of life's unexplainable happenings. I would recommend this book to everyone, but especially for those looking for answers to why bad things happen and how to overcome them."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Rudolfo Anaya, a prominent Chicano writer, has a distinct style of writing as he dives into religiosity in his best known novel \\"Bless Me, Ultima.\\" Published in 1972, this fictional piece is set in Anaya's homeland of Las Pasturas, New Mexico, and has been proclaimed a classic piece of Chicano literature. The beauty of Anaya's novel lies in his ability to write simplistically while still maintaining a tone full of emotion.Just like his other novels (\\"Heart of Aztlan\\" and \\"Tortuga\\"), Anaya fuses dense word choice with raw emotion. This heavy emotion is created thanks to Anaya's youngest fictional character--seven-year-old Antonio M&aacute;rez. Anaya's readers explore the land and spiritual customs of New Mexico only through the naive eyes of Antonio. Antonio finds himself stuck in a spiritual/religious conflict. Will he commit to his mother's way of life--living harmoniously with the farm land, or with his father's way of life--living the life of an always moving vaquero?Every character in Anaya's novel is deeply religious because it is their Hispanic custom. But the custom and belief system of Ultima, a curandera (healer), changes Antonio's life and decisions even more. He now sees even more confliction--the Church versus the healer.While composing the story line, Anaya writes \\"Bless Me, Ultima\\" through the perspective of Antonio. As they read Anaya's novel, readers have to step into the shoes of a young Hispanic boy as they witness every one of Antonio's life and religious uncertainties. Even though Anaya leaves his readers expecting more of a resolution at the end of his novel, Antonio finally realizes that his heritages, although they are very opposite, can be unified."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"... and a river valley that traverses it. I first heard Rudolfo Anaya at a lecture at the Kimo Theater here in Albuquerque, 3-4 years ago, and was impressed. Sadly it has taken me this long to finally read his \\"classic.\\" Anaya first published this book in 1972; the story takes place during, and just after the Second World War. Anaya's setting is fictional, but based on the surroundings it must be in Eastern New Mexico, in a town probably on the Pecos River. The \\"llano\\" is the Spanish word for the windswept high plains that form the eastern part of NM, and extend into much of Texas. Overall, it is an area that is mainly desert, save for a few river valleys, and should never have been put under the plow, since there is not enough natural moisture to sustain agriculture.The story is told through the eyes of a boy who is six years old as the book commences. He has a dream, which encompasses the circumstances of his own birth, including the attending mid-wife, who is his grandmother, Ultima. Shortly thereafter she comes to live with his family, and they form a tight emotional and spiritual bond. The vast majority of the characters are drawn from the Chicano (Hispanic?) community. His home is located on the edge of the llano, and overlooks the town in the river valley. His mother's side of the family is quiet, hard-working farmers of the valley; his father's side are the men of the llano, emotional, high-strung, in need of the freedom and movement of the high plains. Ultima is a \\"curandera,\\" one who heels with magic, spells, and herbs. The boy, Tony, has three older brothers, who all mange to return from WW II, but they are restless, and two of them quickly leave. Much of the action takes place during his first year of school, and there is a reasonable amount of dramatic tension to draw the reader through the book.Anaya has the boy address many of the theological issues that arise during a very precocious coming-of-age, including certainly strong doubts about the moral power of priests, and some of the underlying tenets of the Catholic Church, which might have been a bit \\"shocking\\" in the Chicano community at the time of publication. Through Ultima, Tony is introduced to the healing powers of natural herbs, which may be quite valid, and the incantations and beliefs of a spiritual world that are highly dubious, such as the spirits that haunt lives because they were not given a proper burial, and the practices of witches. These forces, more primordial than those of the Church, are usually triumphant. Another prevailing theme throughout the novel is the \\"Yin and Yang\\" forces of mother and father that are shaping Tony's destiny.For one who has come to the Southwest late in life, Anaya writes with enough Spanish that a dictionary on the side table proved helpful, though I was eventually able to figure out the Spanish f-word, which the dictionary lacked.The novel has motivated me to do some camping in eastern NM, on that llano, hopefully when the winds die down a bit later in the spring, and is a wonderful introduction into the beliefs held by (some) members of the Chicano community that surrounds me. However, I did not feel I could give the novel a full 5-stars due to the \\"black and white\\" clear-cut nature of those who were good, and those who were evil, and I also think that no 6-year old child, precocious or otherwise, could express the concepts, and raise the questions that Tony did. It is indeed the adult voice of Anaya being imposed on the child. Finally, the \\"magic realism\\" did not work as well, I think because of its mixture with superstition, as it does in Marquez or Allende.Still, many thanks for the nudge towards the \\"neglected\\" eastern portion of our state, and I might very well read one of his other novels, \\"Albu(r)querque\\" while at the campsite."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"One of my top ten favorite books of all time. I especially loved this book because it painted such a good picture of New Mexico, The Land of Enchantment. Not to be (too) corny, but this was an enchanting story. Ultima is a curandera, one who is still in contact with Mother Earth--and the last of a dying breed. Having lived there for a while, I can tell you that there really is something special about New Mexico, and this book does a great job of capturing that special something."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"In this beautifully written coming of age tale, Anaya delivers part of the Mexican/American experience. The loss of innocence in the story refers to a religious quandry for Toni, a six year old boy. Should he adopt his mother's culture and become a priest or should he become like his father's family, the Marezes, and wander the plains as a cowboy? Should he accept the Catholic faith brought by the Spanish or the paganism, naturalism, and mysticism of the indigenous people whom they conquered. Both strains culminate in Toni, and he feels he must make a choice. This is pretty heady stuff for a six year old precocious though he was. His mother kept a Christian altar in her living room where she prayed every morning. She was a Luna(moon) who stayed in place while his father was a Marez (variation on the word for sea) who was always restless.Then Ultima, the elderly community curandera came to live with them. She was a faith healer or shaman whose craft was handed down through the generations and had as its roots the belief in nature, superstition, and magic. She practices her craft and even saves Tony's uncle when western medicine has failed. She removes curses and is accused of cursing Tenorio's three daughters, two of whom die. There are many allegorical images in this book, and certainly Tenorio and his daughters represent evil. Ultima represents good.(pg.255). It is their final conflict in which Tenorio kills Ultima that forces Toni's hand.Seeking some sort of resolution between his love for Catholocism and his love for nature, he asks why his friend, Cico, doesn't tell others about the golden carp he worships. \\"They would Kill him...The God of the church is a jealous god; he cannot live in peace with the other gods. He would instruct the priest to kill the golden carp.\\"(pg. 237)...you have to choose,Tony,...you have to choose between the god of the church, or the beauty that is here and now.Ultima represents his heritage of mysticism, magic, and witchcraft in the sense of a good witch. She teaches him the magic found in tree bark, herbs, and other plants which she uses to cure people of ailments and remove spells. But it is Toni's father that provides him an answer to the age old question of why bad things happen to good people. \\"Papa... why is there evil in the world? ...Most of the things we call evil are not evil at all; it is just that we don't understand those things and so we call them evil. And we fear evil because we do not understand it...sometimes it takes a lifetime to acquire understanding, because in the end understanding simply means having sympathy for people...Ultima has sympathy for people, and it is so complete that with it she can touch their souls and cure them...No greater Magic can exist...Ultima tried to teach me that the tragic consequences of life can be overcome by the magical strength that resides in the human heart.\\" (pp.248-249) As she lay dying she gave Toni this advice \\"Love life and if despair enters your heart, look for me in the evenings when the wind is gentle and the owls sing in the hills. I shall be with you...\\"(pg.261). It is at this point that Toni first addresses his mother as a man and not a boy. (pg. 259) In the end Toni doubts the faith of the Lunas and favors the faith of the golden carp, a symbol for the beauty in nature.This novel has all the characteristics of first rate literature. The language if not always lyrical is elegant. The sentence structure is simple and will appeal to a wide range of readers. The story is an engaging one set in a Mexican American community. However, it deals with the universal themes that challenge all cultures. The unique melding of the Catholocism of the Spanish invaders and the paganism/mysticism of the indian tribes provides a fresh canvas on which to paint these themes. This is not merely Latino literature, and to so characterize it would debase the universality of its themes. Read it as you would read the Catcher in the Rye even if you are not a WASP.I am an afluent anglosaxon female raised in a large midwestern city, but I did know a good bit of Spanish when I read this. Much of the Spanish in the book is slang foul language. It is not central to the theme and even if you don't understand it, you will have no trouble reading this book. If you are curious, ask a Spanish speaking friend. Only the family surnames are of some importance. I was delighted to discover this fine writer and believe that he should be read in every high school as an example of high quality modern American literature. We are so lucky to have this giant melting pot. Where else could an affluent middle aged white woman such as myself get such an inside view of what it is like growing up hispanic in small town New Mexico. God ( or should I say 'Golden Carp') I love this country and her literature. This one is a classic. I can't recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"A good read that reveals the aspects of Mexican-American Catholic culture in the 1940's."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"Rudalfo Anaya's novel captures very clearly the dualities of life. The innocence of childhood and its difficulty, paganism and organized religion, the need for personal freedom and the desire to please those around you/feel secure, etc. I think the complaints about the lack of realism are not well founded. Anaya has not set out to write a realistic novel. The childhood events are seen through a sort of magical lens that allows them to morph into literal visions of symbolic ideas. And, yes, there is a good amount of Spanish in the novel, but it does not hinder a non-Spanish speaking person's ability to comprehend the action. There is a perfect blend of free-spirited adventure and fun, mixed with the difficult decisions that children must make concerning what they will believe and what ideology with govern their lives. It is true that the main character is extremely mature for a child, but we must allow Anaya a little poetic license to make the story complex enough to be truly engaging for adults. Anyone interested in an entertaining story that is not afraid to tackle big questions (particularly religous issues; why doesn't God listen? Why do people have to suffer?) should enjoy this work."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"This book was very informative about growing up in an Mexican-American culture which is I think why it was so highly rated because it really elaborates on subjects such as: spirituality, organized religion, respect for elders, etc. Honestly this is not my genre of choice but if you are looking for a real inside look on chicano culture this book really puts you in the place of the main character (Antonio Marez).Antonio is a young chicano boy who is growing up in New Mexico during the time of the end/after WWII and how he copes with the pressure of pleasing the different families he comes from. This book really tells how different the chicano families can be. Antonio's father Gabriel is from the Marez family who has a wild history and is known for having cowboys in the family. Antonio's mother Maria comes from the Luna family which are known to be calm farmers (very Catholic). Antonio is the last hope for following the traditions in either family because his brothers have gone to war and chose different paths straying away from both cowboy, farmer, and preist. Antonio is finally led to his answer by the elderly curandera Ultima that comes to live with him.Bless Me Ultima had great symbolism and was well written but is just not my type of book."},{"Title":"Bless me, Ultima: A novel","review":"In my English II class we had just finished reading the novel, Bless Me Ultima, by Rudolfo Anaya. Although it seemed that many of my classmates despised reading the story due to numerous reasons, I was fortunately one who enjoyed reading it. It is basically about Antonio, a young boy, coming-of-age who goes through life with many concepts about what he is going to be when he grows up, what religion to follow, or which of his parent's dreams to carry out. Along with his trials and tribulations, he has Ultima to guide and advise him in his difficult times and provides him with her acquired knowledge and wisdom to have courage to overcome his own ordeals in life. In general, I liked the idea of this piece. However, I felt that Anaya could've written the story so that the plot progressed just a bit faster because personally, I despised having to think too much of what was to unfold in the upcoming events. I did in fact find the religion idea of the story interesting because I myself can relate to his obligations of what to believe in. The obligation of worshipping the Golden Carp was quite crazy but I found it a creative sense in the writing. Overall , I felt the book has touched me somewhat, and made me think about things that relate to my own life as I read the story.

Their analysis of the \\"intra-psychic\\" dynamics of Black life in everyday America is extremely insightful. Their observations on Black / White sex within this societal's framework is outstanding just as well. Overall, the book holds up, isn't dated and should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Black Rage","review":"This book is a classic. It truly helped me as a White to understand the ongoing impact on race relations of the dynamics that were created in slavery. It is particularly helpful in understanding how slavery dynamics are played out in cross-racial sexual relationships. The only flaw is that it is HOPELESSLY sexist, reflecting the gender stereotypes of 1968. This sexism rises to such a level that parts of the book are difficult to read. Because of this, I have stopped using it as a required book for my classes, but still, this book helped me to personally understand the adaptive responses of African-Americans given our oppressive system."},{"Title":"Black Rage","review":"I bought this book for clinical insight from an African American psychologist perspective due to the fact that black scholarship and intelligencia is not respected within the social service industries of counseling, recovery and therapy. I have not finished reading it but, I am well pleased thus far.

Duidelijk is zijn verwantschap met begin 16de-eeuwse Italiaanse Manieristen als Paramagianno, die net als hijzelf ideale lichaamshoudingen of gezichtsuitdrukkingen elegant overdrijven. Maar Currin gaat nog verder. Hij parodieert en combineert vrouwelijke schoonheidsidealen van uiteenlopende eeuwen. Zo waren de kronkelende uitgerekte vrouwenlichamen met name populair in het Manierisme. En het was tijdens de Barok dat de Vlaming Rubens graag vlezige vrouwen met pronte buik- en bilpartijen schilderde. Naast die invloeden zie je bij Currin veel terug van de anekdotische, even perfecte als gelikt aandoende tijdschrift-illustraties van de Amerikaan Norman Rockwell, die actief was rond 1955. Wat Currin typisch \`neo-nu' maakt, is zijn interesse voor cartoons en oude toneel-, reclame- of pornofoto's, die vaak het uitgangspunt vormen voor zijn portretten. Op die afbeeldingen kijken de mensen vaak net zo wezenloos als de personages als op zijn schilderijen.\`Ik vind het grappig om zo'n gezichtsuitdrukking nog net geloofwaardig te houden,' zei Currin daarover.Omdat zijn werk niet conceptueel maar juist weer wel \`vrouwonvriendelijk-seksistisch' was, verketterden zowel de kunstkritiek als de cultureel-correcten Currins hyperrealisme.Hoe hypocriet of kortzichtig is dat? Want intussen laten westerse vrouwen steeds vaker hun borsten vergroten - en mannen blijken daar maar weinig bezwaar tegen te hebben. Dus zo wezensvreemd is Currins werk dus toch ook weer niet. En inderdaad, de gegoede burgerklasse, met wie hij in zijn schilderijen zo graag de spot drijft, viel dan ook als een blok voor zijn werk. Gemiddeld doet een Currin-doek zo'n 200.000 euro. Dat is te duur om het in Nederland zelfs alleen maar te kunnen exposeren. Om Currins werk in het echt te zien moeten we dus naar New York, Tokio of Londen.De kunstkritiek draaide na verloop van tijd enigszins bij. Want Currin bedient zich weliswaar van voorspelbare trucjes, maar die dwingen door hun technische vakmanschap wel groot respect af. En het op neo-achtige wijze combineren van cultuurhistorische ideaalbeelden levert bizarre portretten op, die het niveau van schuine moppen verre overtreffen.Als Currin zich inhoudt zie je zijn meesterhand nog beter. Bij een teer houtskool portret van Rachel tonen zowel zijn krullerige \`handschrift' als de witte \`ophogingen' hem als neo-evenknie van Rubens of de 18de-eeuwse Boucher en Fragonard. Deze twee Franse kunstenaars maakten in hun tijd trouwens ook schalkse genrestukken, werken waar we nu mild om glimlachen.Currin intussen wil nog brutaler worden. \`Juist omdat ik nu niet langer over zulke vrouwen hoef te fantaseren, kan ik mij permitteren ze nog seksistischer af te beelden.'"},{"Title":"John Currin","review":"John Currin's work occupies a very odd space.

It provides thorough information on where to start, what to expect, how long it will take, what you will see. (Kayakers note: his average times are a bit slow).

It is a fairly easy read up until the final section.Reti basically begins with a section on tonality (harmonic and melodic), discusses atonality in a second section, and then moves into his main goal \\"pantonality\\" which he approaches as a phenomenon within fundamentally atonal music. (He briefly touches upon and attempts to define terms such as \\"bitonality\\" and \\"polytonality\\" and discusses pitch centricity (without really uses this now familiar term. I felt this last section was a bit fuzzy compared to the clarity of the first two sections but pulled one really interesting idea from the book overall which made it worth reading, melodic tonality.Reti speaks of an interesting concept I was previously unfamiliar with: melodic tonality. Reti uses the term \\"melodic tonality\\" in regard to folk music like Moussorgsky, or Debussy and some of his music - think of the parallel harmonies that Debussy is so well known for - supporting a melody (which might be gregorian chant-like in its construction)."},{"Title":"Ulysses Grant: Personal reflections : a novel","review":"I was given this as a joke present and a joke it shall remain. The author (...) portrait of General Grant is very disturbing, and I don't mean this in a good way. General Grant was a very heroic man and a very loving husband and father. Any book will confirm this, Miss Sauers portrays him as a sex-addicted rapist. I am offended to the core at this. He may have been sex-addicted, but in a good wat, with his own dear wife. This book is truly wretched, frightening, and an example of the worst form of writing. (...)"},{"Title":"Ulysses Grant: Personal reflections : a novel","review":"There have been some terrible books written about General Grant. I have several hundred of these turkey's in my personal library. But after reading this abysmal tripe, I have to award this tome the dubious award of \\"all-time worst Grant book.\\" This bizarre honor has serious competition, but there is no doubt Victoria Sauers takes the cake as the worst \\"writer\\" (in heavy quotations) to ever tackle this subject.Where to begin? Sauers apparently has no clue who Grant was, or what his personality was truly like. The real Grant was a remarkably decent, loving husband: monogamous, faithful, devoted and affectionate. He was an equally loving father to his four children. There is no one who ever accused him of cheating or having one-night stands. Does Sauers care about the real Grant? Hell no! She makes up a fictional Grant that is one of the most disgusting characters ever devised, a character bearing no resemblance to the real man at all. What gives with this author?Sauers concocts a bisexual Grant who rapes his boy servant and who goes on to bed various officers wives. It was difficult to actually finish this vile piece of trash, but I forced myself to due to curiosity to see just how bad it could get. The verdict: extremely bad.I was also sick and tired of the religious quality of the book and the fundamentalist Christian ideology espoused in the book. Grant didn't care about religion, but Miss Sauers is obsessed with God, the 10 Commandments and anything else of a religious bent.A previous reviewer mentions that Sauers portrays Grant as \\"sex addicted,\\" and this is too true in this hideously warped narrative. In all probability, Grant *was* sex addicted, but he restricted his amorous attentions to Julia, his wife. Had Sauers written a novel about Grant's real private life and had she bothered to get the facts straight, then this novel would have probably been a delightful read. As it is, this one belongs in the bottom of the nearest ash can. This is truly an abysmal book, character assassination at its most disgraceful. If General Grant were alive today and was confronted with this book, I would pray an ambulance would be nearby. He would need it because a quick perusal would have caused the dear man a cardiac arrest."},{"Title":"Ulysses Grant: Personal reflections : a novel","review":"Although this was published several years ago, it seems to have quickly slipped into the obscurity it so richly deserves, so I have only now discovered it. And I sincerely wish I hadn't. This strange, sick novel is not only the worst Grant book I have ever heard of (it makes Jeffrey Marks' pathetic mystery novels look like classics of modern literature,) it may possibly be the worst novel I have ever read, period.For reasons only Sauers can explain, she has chosen to deliberately trash Grant in this novel, depicting him not only as a drunk, but as a cad and creep who bears as much resemblance to the real USG as Mother Teresa does to Paris Hilton. The novel is, as far as I can tell (the author's style is extremely incoherent,) a dialogue between Grant's ghost and his \\"spirit guide,\\" who points out to him the various ways he screwed up his life.And what a life it was! According to Sauers, Grant not only cheated on his wife, Julia, pracically non-stop throughout their marriage (!), he sexually molested a young male servant of his (!!), and, just for good measure, was such a terrible parent that he allowed his son, Fred, to be molested by a drunken soldier (!!!)Need I say more? I can't explain what inspired Sauers to write such nonsense (let alone what inspired anyone to publish it,) but I can only say--I'm quite serious here--the book reads like the product of an extremely disturbed mind. Avoiding this book shouldn't be too difficult, but if it happens to cross your path, I can't say how strongly I believe it should be ignored.No, I can't say I liked this book much."},{"Title":"Office skills","review":"First time ordering a book on line.

Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Heart Does Not Bend","review":"That Makeda Silvera is talented is beyond doubt. This story is engaging and the characters are authentic. The language flows elegantly; images are persuasive and at intervals the words are so lyrical they would slip off your tongue if you were to read them aloud.In \\"The Heart Does Not Bend\\" Ms.Silvera paints a portrait of a family which is recognizable beyond the confines of the Jamaican community. Mama, the matriarch, is complex and self contradictory. She loves her children but cripples them with her criticism and disapproval. Her homophobia exists alongside her willingness to accommodate members of the gay community whom she finds entertaining and exotic.Mama's daughter inherits her strength and her self righteousness. Her sons are a motley crew. The eldest is devoted to and dominated by her. Another, although he loves her, is deeply injured by her unwillingness to be supportive of him and is unable to forgive her, even in death. Her youngest son is charming and irresponsible. Mama, disgusted by this son's irresponsibility, raises his son whom he has abandoned, to be charming and irresponsible.Small things about the novel disturb me. Educated Jamaican professionals do not speak patois in a formal setting. Ms. Silvera has doctors and civil servants speaking rank creole. I also have an uncomfortable feeling that Ms. Silvera was in a hurry to finish the story; certain elements of the plot strike me as underdeveloped. Notwithstanding these, by no means fatal detractions, the novel is a good read."},{"Title":"The Heart Does Not Bend","review":"The first time I saw The Heart Does Not Bend by Makeda Silvera, I instantly picked it up. The cover photo caught my eye, and I knew it was going to be worth reading-or at least I hoped so. The cover has the face of a young black woman with her eyes closed, and the hibiscus flower just below. That was what drew me to this this wonderful book. The Hibiscus is Jamaica's National Flower, and when I flipped through the book and saw that most of the dailogue was in patois (broken English), I fell in love right then and there!!!I loved this book for many reasons: it was set in Jamaica, my homeland, it's about migrating to Canada, which I did, and the writer paints a picture that is so authentic; you could almost see, smell, hear, taste, and touch everything she writes about. She is like a painter, the way she describes everything was beautiful! I also loved the fact that the author was generous enough to include the recipes for Christmas cake, and Sorrel drink. I do plan to try these one day, since I've never made either one. It really took me home! I could relate to the story on many different levels, and felt connected to the story from the very beginning. There were a few similarities that made this book really fascinating to me, that I read this book in no time at all. At the end of the book I almost started reading it all over again because I now had all the info I needed about the different characters.The book starts off in present time and then goes back into the past, which I really liked. It made me so much more eager to read it in order to put the pieces together. The grandmother, Mama, seemed like a really loving, and kind person, yet her final decisions were shocking! Her daughter on the other hand did not know how to love her own child. Her grand daughter loved and cared for her and even sacrifised her lover for her, and it seems this all went unrewarded. Her unruly grandson, who only took advantage of her every chance he got was the one who she rewarded in the end.It just goes to show that in love, there are no guarantees. Just because you love someone unconditionally, with every fibre in your being, make sacrifices for them, help them, take care of them etc. etc. does not guarantee you a place in their heart. I guess this was what I learned after reading this book. It seems very simple, but it's hard to grasp until you've lived it. This is my 4th attempt to write a review for this book and I suppose the time was not right. I had not \\"gotten\\" this message until very recently, so I'm very happy that my computer logged off during my previous reviews--even though I was furious at the time. Every thing in life happens for a reason. I read this book for a reason, and I'm so glad that I did.This was Miss Silvera's first novel, and I'm sure she is VERY PROUD of it. I know it made me very proud to be Jamaican!

The level of honesty in this book is eye-opening and refreshing to say the least. The use of patois throughout is courageous and it is this choice, more than any other, that lends a certain authenticity to the work that ultimately makes it a success. In one stroke, Ms. Silvera has brought several groups who are so often overlooked to the fore: Jamaicans in Canada, gay men in Jamaica, lesbian women. So many people go to \\"foreign\\" (countries) to obtain a better way of life, and this book beautifully shows the way that families are often bisected by the very binationalism that ensures their survival."},{"Title":"The Heart Does Not Bend","review":"When i first saw this book in the store i was wishy washy about geting it but once i did i could not put it down.

I little dreamed that by pure chance I had picked up a masterpiece, but I had. St. Exupery was one of those superb freaks that - all too infrequently - nature can produce: a man of action with the mind of a philospher and the soul of a poet, with the ability to express them all with lucid clarity.He was said to be a terrible pilot, and intellectuals will pooh-pooh his 'metaphysics'. Forget that. When he disappeared, flying reconnaisance over the Med. during the war, we more normal mortals lost a marvellous example of how fine humans can be when given the chance, and humanity lost one of its graces. He was only forty or so, and had he lived he would have been recognised as one of the greats both of literature and of cultivated thought. As it is we have only these few little jewels of books by which we can appreciate his qualities and perhaps realise that we, too, can be so much better than we are.'Flight to Arrass' is an account of a reconnaisance flight over occupied France, probably based on his personal experience, first at high altitude, then lethally low. In this extraordinary pilot-writer's mind, potential sudden death becomes transmuted into a magical account of memories which provide beauty, humour and wisdom, and his extraordinary ability as a writer puts you in the pilot's seat as you have never been before. You live with him the peril of being there, and you enter the wonderful world of his mentality in his detached response to terror and imminent abrupt extinction. All his books give you immediate access to a world of experiences which you otherwise will never meet, seen through eyes of unique maturity and intelligence.Listen, in the same way that flowers are their own best advertisement, St. Ex's books are their own best recommendation. For me, 'Flight to Arrass' is one of his best, and it will cost you less than a cheap lunch. You owe yourself contact with this better example of humanity. The work of the translator in the case of St. Ex. is also as near perfection as you will find - A pleasure to read. If you have not read any of his books, then lucky you, in that this magical world as seen through his eyes is waiting all fresh for your discovery. Don't wait. Buy it now. I recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Flight to Arras","review":"This is an intellectually emotional musing of a pilot while on a reconnaisance mission in the midst of the hopeless Battle of France in the summer of 1940. Do not expect graphic descriptions of air combat, for only one eventful, though dangerous mission was told, interspersed by Saint-Ex's recollection of the human virtues and the war itself.In this work he delves with clear logic about life and the meaning of life, of loyalty, love of country, the meaning and feeling of facing mortal danger while looking through his life in one slow kaleidoscope.It is easy to see the prevailing athmosphere of defeatism that have enveloped France, and his writing was no exception, though justified. France cannot go it alone, with its 40 million against the 80 million (population) across the Rhine, and how the way of life that predominate in his country differs from its more industrial neighbor.One of the great modern French stylist, Saint-Ex must have given headaches to the translator, for he wrote in a lyric poetic fashion difficult to translate (this is the Lewis Galantiere translation). One must pose occasionally to savor his prose. Here in colorful intensity he lays down in vivid detail his humanity and shows what made his writing different from other aviation literature. His popularity is such that people sometimes stresses the &quot;Saint&quot; in his name in order to prop him higher than the rank of hero worship. But his life does not fit that image. A man of many talents---cardplayer, mathematician, caricaturist, chess player, poet, writer and of course, aviator---he was however a baffling personality who defied straight description: A gifted mathematician, he rejected that intellectual circle; a man who likes action, he hated to exercise; one of the great writers of France, he did not wish to be a professional writer; a skeptic, he wanted to believe in God.There are critics who described his writing as sentimental hogwash, the harbinger of hollow ideas, the man who can &quot;replace the human brain with an aeroplane engine&quot;, et al..but his writings displayed (in this reviewer's modest opinion) a noble image, and for good or bad, he must be judged in the end by what he wrote. The sale of his books speaks for itself.This is a highly recommended reading experience."},{"Title":"Flight to Arras","review":"the book is st.-ex's thoughts and reflections as he flies a suicide recon mission during WW2. it is not an action novel, but does have some exiting parts to it. it is a thoughtful look at life. the book is not just an interesting look into the mind of someone on a doomed mission, but is motivating, thougth provoking and insightful, and has some great lines to live by. i liked it better than his other book wind, sand and stars, and my copy is all marked up and highlighted and i refer back to it often. i would reccommend this book without hesitation."},{"Title":"Flight to Arras","review":"It took more than one try for me to really get into Flight to Arras. Saint-Exupery is not the easiest of writers to follow, despite a superb writing style, because of being so deep into philosophy. And, once I did finally reach the point of being ready for this book, I was astounded. Absolutely! As always, St-Exupery taught me So Much.To anyone who likes Saint-Exupery and wants to read this, I would say: Go for it. Don't force yourself through it, though. Wait until you're really at the place where this book will take to you, on its own."},{"Title":"Flight to Arras","review":"In this autobiographical story, Saint-Ex tells of the already lost battle he found himself in during 1940 in desperate, war-torn France. He and his crew get sent on a hopeless reconnoissance flight mission over the burning City of Arras. Faced with almost certain imminent death, he is brought to the point of where he can't help but ask himself: &quot;Where's the sense in all this? What am I doing? Why am I doing this?&quot; And as we live through the harrowing experience with him, he lets us see into his heart and mind as he tries to find some answers.. What he comes up with is defined by solid thought resulting from acute observation (Metaphysics my foot!) of man and mankind, certainly more poignant now than ever and therefore surely timeless... And since it's Saint-Ex who relates all this in his unique humble-but-not-so-humble and profoundly human style, this is not only an exciting read about a dangerous time, but it is infused with charme and humour like some superb wine with its unique flavour and aroma. A great little book by a great man."},{"Title":"Flight to Arras","review":"Saint-Exup&eacute;ry is best known for his children's classic The Little Prince. He is also known for a classical account of peacetime aviation - of flying in the days when it was both fun, and quite dangerous - rendered inWind, Sand and Stars. Jules Roy, a pied-noir (an Algerian of French extraction), and fellow pilot, wrote a portrait of the author in the eponymousSaint-Exupery (Les Classiques de la Manufacture French Edition). The present book is another facet of the writer, when he flew in combat for the French air force.Arras is the capital of Pas-de-Calais, in the far northeastern part of France. The month is May, 1940, when France suffered its catastrophic defeat at the hands of the German army. The author is ordered to perform a reconnaissance mission over Arras, which has already fallen to the Germans, and the town is in flames. Only one in three \\"routine\\" missions (sorties) of his squadron return to base. His assignment is much more dangerous. In many ways, it is a suicide mission. He survives though, and this is his account, a brilliant one that combines the adrenaline-rush of being shot at, and having the bullets miss, with a philosophical mind that is attuned to the particulars of a bullet's trajectory as well as the macro picture of a great nation experiencing defeat.It is a short book (and in my opinion, would have been better if it was 15 pages shorter), but Saint-Exup&eacute;ry packs a lot it. There is the succinct analysis of the General Staff's \\"logic\\" in sending him, and his crew, on a reconnaissance mission whose findings could not possible be used. He understands the \\"military mind\\" all too well. There is also an excellent descriptive analysis of flying a plane at high altitude (33,000 ft., plus) long before the Boeing jet liners made such flights routine, with the major inconvenience being the middle seat. Saint-Exup&eacute;ry wears three layers of clothes due to the cold; he has to exert himself strenuously to manually shift the lever mechanisms; the oxygen lines tend to freeze, which lead to partial blackouts; he has 103 gauges that he must watch, etc.Sartre's novelTroubled Sleep: A Novelcovers the same terrible month for France, and depicts the long column of refugees moving south. Saint-Exup&eacute;ry covers the same ground, better, and briefer. The author writes movingly, in some brilliant chapters, on the disintegration of the French army, the contempt of the civilians for it, and the civilians own plight as they took to the road. Rumors abound when all normal communications is severed: \\"crazy rumors that sprouted by the roadside every mile or two in the form of ludicrous hypotheses... The United States had declared war. The Pope had committed suicide. Russian planes had set fire to Berlin. The Armistice had been signed three days ago. Hitler had landed in England.\\" 150,000 French died in a single fortnight.Descriptive passages? Consider: \\"The peace that is on its way is not the fruit of a decision reached by man. It spreads apace like a gray leprosy.\\" Or: \\"The bullets were transformed into lightning. And I flew drowned in a crop of trajectories as golden as stalks of wheat.\\" Philosophical insights? Consider: (concerning his one flight to Arras) \\"...we had learnt even more about ourselves than we should have done after ten years in a monastery.\\" Or one for our times: \\"What a paradox- that men who possessed wealth should claim the right, over and above their possessions, to the gratitude of those who were without possessions!\\"I really was considering giving this book 6-stars, until I got to the last 15 pages or so. His loose philosophical ramble, about the concept of \\"Man\\" vs. \\"man,\\" the needs for sacrifice, the equality of man (in the military?! \\"The private and the captain are equal in the Nation\\"), and in the midst of massive killing, \\"My civilization was the inheritor of Christian values.\\" which was not used ironically, all in all, didn't make much sense. My dominant thought was that he wrote these pages while still suffering from oxygen deprivation.

The town, Arras, over which Saint-Exup&eacute;ry is destined to fly in this story, is where the heavy curtains were first made, and now it appears it will be curtains for Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, his navigator and gunner, because hardly any planes returned from missions over Arras.There is no safe route to Arras. If one flies high, the German Messerschmidts will come down from above and strafe one's plane to destruction. If one flies lower down, the ack-ack of the anti-craft will tear one's plane to shreds.

I loved it, everyone I've loaned it to loved it, you will too!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Lorna Landvik proves with her latest novel, Oh My Stars, that she is a force to be reckoned with in the world of fiction writing.At 18, Violet Mathers has been abandoned by her mother, abused by her father, suffered humiliation at the hands of her classmates, and lost her arm in an accident. All this might make the average person want to jump from a bridge.And that's exactly what Violet intends to do. She boards a San Francisco-bound bus in Kentucky, determined to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge and kill herself. But when the bus breaks down in North Dakota, she meets Kjel, who dreams of stardom, and his guitar-picking friend, Austin, who is black and challenges Violet's beliefs about segregation. The guys begin a journey to stardom, and Violet is going along for the ride.Oh My Stars is not like Landvik's other books - and that is a good thing. Now they all are wonderful books filled with humor, sadness, and reality, but somehow Oh My Stars cuts much deeper and stretches Lankvik's talent. And that stretch won't disappoint you. I will remember this book for a long time and will highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I have read several of Landvik's books ~~ Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons, Patty Jane's House of Curls and Tall Pine Polka. I have loved every single one of them ~~ and this one, Oh My Stars, is just right up there with them! This book is perhaps my favorite so far simply because it is heartwarming and written so eloquently.Violet Mathers is a character after my own heart ~~ especially when she described camping out beneath the stars on her travels with her two best friends, Kjel and Austin, both musicans. Yes, she suffered a horrible accident and had a lonely and isolated childhood. Yes, she was abused by her father and abandoned by her mother. Told she was ulgy all of her life, Violet escaped into her sewing designs till a factory accident cut off her arm at the age of 16. On her way to the Golden Gate in San Fransico to committ suicide, her bus breaks down in Pearl, North Dakota. There she meets Kjel and his family. Inevitably, her life changed in an instant.Violet travels with Kjel, Austin and Austin's brother, Dallas, to perform at different bars. On the cusp of success and making a record with a big time label company, tragedy hits the group and they disbanded. However, it was not the end for Violet as she found love and happiness.It is a wonderful story ~~ lyrical and upbeat. Even in the beginning when Landvik was describing Violet's home life, it wasn't depressing like you would think it would be. It was written as a matter-of-fact which is believable since Violet narrated her story throughout the book. Reading this book is like being there. You can smell the campfire and feel the cool breeze blowing on your neck. You can see the women swooning over the Pearltones as they played their music and feel your feet tapping in time. Landvik has really written a story that captures the imagination and doesn't let go till long after the last page has been turned.And to be honest, it's been quite a while since I've shed some tears while reading a book ~~ this one definitely pulled at my heartstrings while reading it. I love it! I am so glad that she has written this one!

Oh My Stars was a fairly good story, but there were so many editorial errors in the book, I almost wondered at one point if the story had changed or Violet's loss of her arm was a joke. On more than one occasion she supposedly \\"wiped her hands\\" or \\"wrapped her arms around\\" something. This just sounded ridiculous for a one-armed character.

First of all, this is usually not the type of book I would read, but after hearing two other people rave about it I decided to give it a try. I have since read another of Landvik's stories but it couldn't live up to this one.This is an overall heart-warming story (with angst and depression in it) of a young woman who had the worst childhood and worst luck, and yet, through the help of those around her, was able to completely change her life for the better and change her attitude towards life.

It has great historical information as well as a wonderful story of young adults coming of age in the depression era.

Violet had a extremely difficult childhood in early twentieth century America; her mother abandoned her at a young age and her father was a mean drunk. When she was older, Violet got a job in the local thread factory. She loved everything about her job. Tragedy struck on her 16th birthday, when she lost her arm in a threading machine accident. Violet pushed all her friends away and almost succumbed to her sorrows. On a bus ride to California and the Golden Gate Bridge, Violet dreams of and is determined to be the second person to jump that famous landmark. However fate intervenes, her bus has an accident in North Dakota, and the riders are rescued by the local townsfolk. She is rescued by Kjel Hedstrom and his family. Kjel is a unique person who greets each day with saying \\"Oh My Stars\\". He befriends those who tend to be left behind by others. At first, Violet's relationship with Kjel and his friend Austin is strained, more from the pity and empathy than actual friendship. Once they go on the road, and create a music group called the \\"Pearltones\\" does their relationships change and grow. She tells her story with such conviction; you start to believe that they were an actual group. They have become her family and have given her hope for the future. However, Kjel is paralyzed in a senseless drunken act and their life on the road ends. Violet is rescued from her despair by Austin Sykes, someone who has been there all along for her. Excellent writing, characters who become your best friends or enemies, music that jumps through the pages, a little bit of everything to keep you immensely satisfied."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"In Mount Crawfiord, Kentucky Erlene Mathers abandons her daughter Violet to be raised by her spouse Judd, a terrific mechanic but an abusive ugly drunk with no quality time for his wallflower giraffe of a child, dubbed Olive Oyl by her peers. In 1935, Miss Eugie Dodds hires the lonely almost sixteen year old Violet to work the night shift at the Marcelline Threads factory. The shy unhappy teen, whose first name is apropos, finds acceptance and a feeling of belonging for the first time in her life. However, on her sweet sixteenth birthday, a machine accident amputates her arm.Once released from the hospital, Violet concludes she has nothing but bad memories in Mount Crawford so like many others takes the bus to California, but a crash in North Dakota strands Violet and others. Musicians Austin Sykes and Kjel Hedstrom rescue everyone. Violet likes the kind black Austin, but is quite attracted to Kjel and joins the duet, who hopes to pioneer a new style of music to a still somewhat depressed America as the show has just begun.OH MY STARS is a terrific look at the mid 1930s in America. Fans will appreciate the metamorphosis of Violet from her belief that she is the ugly duckling into a confident swan symbolizing America coming out of the Depression. The cast is fantastic as the audience will believe they are traveling with the heroine and others as readers discover the wonders of the country while Violet seeks her groove. Lorna Landvik provides a delightful Americana tale that will elate historical readers with its depth of characterizations to include the land.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I wanted so much to love this book, but I just never could care enough about the abstract mismatch of characters and I found myself distracted by most anything...leaving the book for days then picking it up again and hoping it would get better. It was not a bad read at all, but it wasn't as memorable a novel as I'd hoped."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"All of Lorna's books are great and this one is not an exception"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Lorna Landvik is a name that always catches this reader's attention. Whenever she has a new book out, it automatically is on the must-read list. While OH MY STARS is quite different from PATTY JANE'S HOUSE OF CURL and her more recent ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BON BONS, Landvik's latest does not disappoint.This is the story of Violet Mathers, a woman who started out in life unloved and unwanted. She was made fun of by her peers and by her family, and when she is left with only one arm following a horrific accident in a sewing factory, she knows that her only choice is to end her life. At the age of 18, she leaves her father, gets on a bus bound for San Francisco, and patiently waits for the bus to end its journey. Her plan is to be the second person to end their life by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.But fate has something else in store for Violet. The bus never makes it to the West Coast. An accident that leaves the bus stranded in North Dakota becomes the turning point in her life. A family kindly takes her in. One of the family members, a handsome young man named Kjel (pronounced \\"Shell\\"), patiently and lovingly helps change Violet from a very depressed and insecure teenager to a confident and happy woman. To say it simply, Kjel gives Violet a reason to live.Soon after, Kjel and his good friend Austin, a black man for whom Violet feels repulsion in the beginning, decide they want to travel around the country. Their story takes place in the late 1930s, and she has been taught that white and black people do not mix. Kjel, however, never sees a color difference, and the two men are best friends. Kjel convinces Austin and Violet that they are going with him on this trip. They leave North Dakota and take off for parts unknown, with no plans except to travel.What happens next is the adventure of a lifetime. With the help of Austin's brother Dallas, and Violet as their manager, they form a musical band called the Pearltones, in tribute to their hometown of Pearl, North Dakota. Their lives take on the form of a dream. Kjel becomes an Elvis-like heartthrob, and they help break color barriers with their music. Fans crowd into clubs and bars to hear them perform, with women young and old swooning at their feet. They encounter racism along the way, as well as lasting friendships, loyalty, and not least of all, love.Although the story is difficult to follow at times due to the jumping back and forth between time sequences, OH MY STARS is a wonderful novel. While the story is rooted in history, in particular the segregation of whites and blacks, it also takes on a fantastical dreamy type of fable. The story of Violet's early life is a downer, but this is the type of book that, when the last page is turned, makes you feel good all over, and you will remember the characters for a very long time afterward.The story is told through Violet's eyes as an elderly woman reminiscing about a life that could have ended too soon. The book concludes with Violet's narration, remarking, \\"Who'd have ever thought a shunned, husky-voiced, one armed, big-chinned girl with a hive of bees in her head could live a life so full of miracles?\\" It's nice to know that some books do have happy endings.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"While this book was not bad, it just did not measure up to the first book of Landvik's which I read, \\"Patty Jane's House of Curl\\". I loved that book, but merely liked this latest one. I found parts of it to be verrrrrrry slow and just wanted to get to the end. It took me 10 days to read it, which to me says \\"this is not a book that was compelling\\".The synopsis has already been written several times, so I will not go into that....suffice it to say that the story was \\"just okay\\" in my opinion. I liked Violet and \\"the boys\\" but they were not nearly as fleshed-out as Patty Jane and her family and friends.I also felt that after dragging out the story of the first couple of years, the book/ story was concluded too rapidly."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"OH MY STARS by Lorna LandvikMay 6, 2005I've read only a few books by Lorna Landvik so far, but I already look forward to each new book she writes. Her latest, OH MY STARS, was quite different from PATTY JANE'S HOUSE OF CURL and her more recent ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BON BONS, but I think this latest book is one that I'll remember for a long time.Violet Mathers starts out in life feeling unloved and unwanted. She's too tall, too plain, and then after she loses an arm to a horrific accident in the sewing factory where she works (she is only sixteen years old at the time), she soon feels that her life is not worth living. At the age of 18, she leaves her father (her mother had left them years ago for another man), gets on a bus bound for San Francisco, hoping to be the second person to end their life by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.What can only be fate happens during this bus trip. The bus ends up in an accident, and because they are stranded somewhere in North Dakota, she ends up being rescued by a very handsome young man named Kjel, and his good friend Austin, and they bring her home. This is the turning point of her so far miserable life, and her life is now on the upswing.A good part of this book entails their travels as a musical band they call THE PEARLTONES, and Kjel becomes something of an Elvis-like music idol. The time period is the late 1930's, so rock n' roll has not yet been invented, color lines have not been crossed, and so their musical world is a bit different than what we know today. They encounter racism during their travels, as Austin and his brother Dallas are black, but Kjel doesn't see color, and while Violet was brought up to believe that blacks and whites should be segregated, she learns something new through her friendships with Kjel and Austin.I really loved this book. I do have to admit that there were times when I felt the book could have been edited differently, but by the end of the book, I had a feeling that this was a story I would not forget easily. I am glad I read it and am looking forward to more by Lorna Landvik. This may have been her best book yet. Violet's early life was depressing, however, and some may not enjoy reading about her early years, but I saw this story as an uplifting type of novel, where even the almost impossibly sad lives can turn around if surrounded by people that care about them.Violet narrates: \\"Who'd have ever thought a shunned, husky-voiced, one armed, big-chinned girl with a hive of bees in her head could live a life so full of miracles?\\"I think that summed up the book quite nicely."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"While not roller in the hair funny like her Patty Jane's House of Curl, or as witty as Angry Housewives Eating Bon-bons, still, ja, sure, Minnesota author Lorna Landvik's newest foray into the foibles of the US NorthLand is a fun and graceful frolick. This time, we're in and out of North Dakota and on a road trip with a band in the 1930's. The travelling band features a pre-Elvis, Preslian precursor Norwegian/American Lutheran Boy Named Kjel (pronounced in the Norwegian way as \\"Shell\\" just as their native son Kjierkegaard is pronounce \\"Chicago\\" &lt;-accent on the first syllable)and includes 2 black brothers and a 1 armed girl/manager.Told alternately in the first \\"old ladies are the ghosts-boo!-of American culture;only a few people actually see us\\" and third person, the story wends its way from the old Kentucky home to North Dakota through the segregated South and back to a Garrison Keillor-esque North Dakota. Landvik's latest is a fresh brisk breath of North Dakota air. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"It's the Depression; Violet Mathers is 18 years old, creatively accomplished, a cacophony of ugliness, the product of an absent mother and a cruel father and the casualty of a factory accident that robs her of her talents and sets her on a suicide mission to the Golden Gate Bridge. As chance (or fate, luck or doom?) would have it, the bus she is traveling on crashes in a small North Dakota town. Here Violet meets the men who will change her life, musicians, Kjel Hedstrom and his 'black as night' friend Austin Skyes. In love with Kjel, repulsed by Austin and eventually annoyed by Dallas (Austin's ex-con brother), Violet joins the threesome as they travel across America on a tuneful, almost Elvis-like adventure of self-discovery and social issues.The self-discovery is nicely done. It's quite easy to become drawn into Violet's world thanks to Landvik's brillant humor and empathy.The quartet of characters, though not deep, is fun and pleasing and easy to care about.Landvik ultimately loses her reality when dealing with the social issues of a distinctly black/white 1930s America. They are never fully addressed or even worse, developed into the sticky situations and considerable quandaries they were. An encounter with the KKK is woefully short and flawed with no ensuing aftermath or logical social ramifications for the times. I sensed as if the author was floating through the period and was apprehensive about taking on racial matters and losing the cloudy, lighthearted, atmoshphere on which much of the novel rests.While this is a pleasurable read, nonetheless, historically, it lacks a significant punch to give it the real impact it could so easily have had."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Lorna Landvik excels with this masterful tale of Violet Mathers, an ugly duckling, deserted by her mother, beaten by her father, and just to make sure she has more than her share of misery, a horrible accident that causes the loss of her arm. But an amazing thing happens to Violet on her way to commit suicide. Violet's life has taught her that when things look as bleak as can be, they can still get bleaker. And her bus ride to San Francisco for the express purpose of jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge proves that point. How she winds up on a farm in North Dakota, how she meets the man she will love forever but who can never love her in the way she needs him to, how lemons truly become lemonade is about the most uplifting, heart-wrenching story I've had the pleasure of reading.Her dreams of being a fashion designer may have died with the loss of her arm, but a life she never envisioned rises up to meet her. Through a series of circumstances Violet could never have dreamed, she finds herself traveling through the United States as a band manager during the Great Depression. Twenty years before Elvis, a beautiful and charismatic man named Kjel Hedstrom had young girls swooning and grown men wanting to join the band. His relationship with Violet, the other band members he brings into her life, and the unforgettable adventures of the Pearltones will keep you mesmerized. Be forewarned that this book will not end as you expect, and perhaps not as you would have wished, but end it does and don't be surprised if your tears of sorrow and joy have stained the pages."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I am a big fan or Lorna Landvik, and was not at all dissapointed in this book. There are so many things that I loved in this book. I loved that the characters went from rock bottom, to top of their own worlds and back down again but make it out ok. And I realy liked that the ending wasn't what you thought it would. A great read!The books main character was a lame dog at first, one arm, no self esteem, and her only goal in life is to be the 2nd person to jump of the Golden Gate Bridge. You want to take her in and fix all her woes. But then she meets the two people who will change all that.This is a great story that will stay with you. It is very dramitic with powerfull race issues that remind you how far we have and have not come over the years."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Don't be put off by the corny title of this book (for me, it gives the impression of a sappy romance) - this book is great. I was pulled in right from the beginning and could not put this book down.I loved Violet's character and enjoyed seeing her transformation. I loved the other characters as well - the band members, Elwin, the Clamshells, etc. My only (very slight) criticism is that the book got a tad slow for me at the very end but not enough that I wanted to stop reading it.This is definitely one I will be recommending to my friends and to my reading group."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"In general I liked this book quite a bit. Landvik's books always seem to have that \\"feel good\\" vibe to them. The characters are well written and the story, although at times a little implausible, (I would have thought that Violet and the Pearltones would have encountered a bit more racism and bigotry on their travels,) nicely told. Violet was a great character and I found myself rooting for her throughout the book.There were a few too many \\"around the campfire\\" scenes that really should have been edited better, but on the whole, this was a very enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Oh My Stars opens with Violet describing The Off Ramp Caf&eacute;. It is your regular Anytown, USA diner where truckers are eating burgers, salesmen are reading the papers, and waitresses are writing down orders. Violet soon invites us to sit down for a cup of coffee while she tells us a story about miracles and love.Violet had a hard depressing childhood. Her mother deserted her when she was just a child and her father was physically and verbally abusive. Rebelling against everything her mother told her not to do, Violet went without using soap, bit her fingernails, didn't brush her hair, and slept in her clothes. For those reasons plus many more she was tormented by the town people and other kids.Violet spent much of her time alone reading and learning until one day her father told her to get a job instead of sitting around all day doing nothing. Violet was hired at the thread factory where she finally got to experience something she never had before, friendship. The days spent there were some of the best times but it quickly ended when she was involved in an \\"incedent\\" which caused her to lose an arm. Violet could not take life the way is was any more so she decided to clear out her bank account, take a bus across the country, and jump off the San Francisco bridge. Little did she know at the time that her life was about to radically change.On the way across the United States, Violets bus broke down in North Dakota. She was rescued by two men - Kjel a man who made her feel like no other and his friend Austin. These two men who where stuggling musicians took her in on their journey to fortune and fame and made her a part of their life and the pursuit to make their own special kind of music.Oh My Stars is not a bright and funny kind of story like Lorna Landvik has written in the past but it sure is worth the time it takes to read it. This story deals with some serious issues such as abuse and racism but it also has love and hope and shows that miracles can happen. You can't help cheering on Violet as she makes her way through this book.I'ts about time Lorna Landvik wrote a new book and Oh My Stars will not disappoint you.

You've read the various synopses from the other reviewers, so I need not include them here. What I find most charming about this author's work is the depth and wit she exhibits in exploring the human condition. Her writing style is not simplistic, but is so very easy to read. The story is never rushed, the characters are well drawn, and the philosophical bits of wisdom scattered throughout make a quote collector like me rush to my journal to record her pithy observations.Lorna Landvik just keeps getting better and better, and I would love to see her work gain a wider audience so that others can enjoy the discovery of this incredible storyteller."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I thought this was a great book! I really liked Angry Housewives, first one I read by her. I wasnt sure about this one 'quirky characters'...hadnt i read enough of quirky characters? but the characters really surprised and i loved that each beginning chapter was written in first person by violet and then switched to 3rd. She said things in the first part that related to upcoming parts so you 'knew' something was going to happen but you were never sure. Great book, fun characters that sing in a band you feel like you are one of the Clamshells as well (you have to read the book!) It is fantastic to see how Violet turns out greater and greater as life goes on for her. You definitely root for her :)"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"The story begins with instant tragedy and does not quit. The entire story is riddled with prejudice and tragedy. The only fell good part of the book was the music and you can't hear that. Lots of lyrics, but difficult to appreciate without audio of course.

It was not a page turner and never got any better all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"For me not one of my favorite books by Lorna Landvik.

At one point (those who have read it will probably know when), I just put the book down forever. Later, I picked it up and finished it, just to be finished. I'm very glad I did, as the ending is lovely!Ms. Landvik writes touching stories about people I have not known, but wish I had!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This book is so upbeat and positive as so many books are not.The book begins with elderly Violet Mathers who stops at a diner to get in touch with blue collar, every day Americans; plus she wants to bring back the times when eating at diners was her life style. She wants to remember back when she was the manager of the Pearltones, a music group, and travelling all around the country. She was young, the group was wild, there were groupies following the band around. These were wild times,fun times with many friends, drinking and partying and the joy of being young, enjoying life and meeting different people back during the depression.Born in a Kentucky town,Violet had bad luck with parents. Both despised her; her mother ran off with a man; her father poked fun at her, was constantly calling her ugly and stupid as did relatives and other townspeople. However, she found she loved to sew, work on fabrics and design clothes. She was a genius in this field and excelled at this work. Then working at a factory job in lost one arm on a machine. So she decides to hop a bus,leave town,travel out to San Francisco and jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.Fate steps in. The bus breaks down in a small North Dakota town. She is taken in by the family of Kjel, a very handsome young man, and his black friend Austin. Violet falls in love with Kjel, but is afraid of Austin, she is from the south and Austin is black. Kjel is much like the young boy in Landvik's \\"Welcome to the Great Mystery.\\" He makes good things happen.Kyel is a lover of life, a lover of people, and sees good in everyone and everything. He seems like an angel on earth. Kjel has wonderful parents, his father is a Lutheran pastor, his mother a loving mother, but not so wonderful older brother and sister.Time passes, Violet marries and Leola, Kjel's mother, then a widow, informally adopts Violet, her husband and their daughter. She is not too happy with her son and daughter.The book ends with Violet making peace with Dallas, her brother-in-law, who caused a bad accident and has always regretted it.Good read."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This is a really great read. The story is gripping and original and the characters are ones you don't see in every novel. The story is unique and untold with it's own interpretations of love and hate, excitement and suspense.You fall in love with the main characters, both their positives and negatives, but in the meantime there is a whole array of background characters and events that find their way to the surface with an exciting electricity. If you are a woman you'll find yourself relating to Violet's pining for the bad-boy w/ a good heart character of Kjel (Shell).I also really like the way in which the story is presented. At the beginning of each chapter an elderly Violet (main character) addresses you, the reader, to recap some era or events. Then it moves onto the past where, from a narrative standpoint, Violet's story is told as it occurred.My only fault is that the recaps are entirely in italics, sometimes a page and a half. I personally find italics a little difficult to read in great lengths, but other than that everything was great!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Wonderful book written by a great author!Lorna Landvik is a great storyteller. My biggest problem is putting the book down to get anything else done. I've just ordered another book by her.\\"Oh MY Stars\\" captivated me from the first page. I felt like I had lost a good friend when it ended. Very very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"A woman I worked with lent me this book and I read it in two days ... it was EXCELLENT. My favorite authors are Nora Roberts, Catherine Anderson, Janet Evanovich, Sandra Brown ... I'm now adding Lorna Lanvik to that list!While the book started out somewhat depressing, I think it was overall an uplifting story. Like with Janet Evanovich books, parts of this book actually had me laughing out loud (then laughing until I cried, as my husband looked at me like I was nuts!)"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in a while. Wonderful, richly developed characters take you on an incredible journey from heartbreak to triumph. I read this all in one sitting because I just couldn't put it down.

I was sad when I finished it because I wasn't ready for it to end.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"While I was a huge fan of \\"Patty Jane's House of Curl\\"....this book doesn't quite measure up to it. I did enjoy the plot as far as Violet goes...the rest was just tedious reading and i wanted to be finished quicker than i was."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This book is very slow and depressing. It starts off good in the beginning, but then it slows way down. By the time the accident happened, I was so bored, I had to stop reading."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Every once in awhile, it's fun to read a book that causes you to smile and forget about everything. It doesn't always have to be a profound book that addresses society's biggest issues; sometimes some escapist fun is perfect for that long flight or commute on the train.That tends to sum up my view of Oh My Stars. It was fun, it included a number of great characters, a few plot twists, and a number of important observations about our country during the years just before World War II. The observations include a perspective on racial relations, music and war but isn't overly political or preachy.The central character is Violet Mathers, who looks back on her life's story. She has an unhappy beginning with a mother who abandons the family, a cold and abusive father, and eventually a factory accident that costs her an arm. Ready to kill herself, she instead begins a lifelong odyssey full of music, travel, and love.Although some people often think Landvik is a writer of books that appeal to women, I think her work is transcends that limitation. I enjoyed her previous book, Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons and am interested in reading some of her other work too. What I enjoy is her ability to write about a lifetime in a concise way. Oh My Stars is actually a fictional biography of an entire life; in fact entire lifetimes about a number of characters. She manages to cover decades in time without being shallow, and she does it with a sense of humor that often brings with it a unique Midwestern perspective."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"There were too many dragging parts of the book for me to give it a 5 star read but it was still enjoyable; the characters were well-defined and I warmed up to Violet as the book progressed. There is quite abit of bad luck that plagues Violet from page one but her life, as the story weaves from future to flashbacks, is surely never a dull moment if it is a sad one.Landvik is queen at storytelling and I look forward to more of her books."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Her previous book Angry House wives eating bonbons is one of my favourite books. This doesn't quite come into that league but it is still good. The characters come alive, they are complex and you love most of them and care about what happens to them, it's well woth a read"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Save this book for a rainy day. The main characters - Violet, Kjel, Austin, and Dallas - are all sympathetic, but slightly underwritten. It was a nice story, but nothing to sink your teeth into. I particularly felt that the author was thinking of what a nice Lifetime movie this would make as she got deeper into the book. How else to explain the immediate transference of love and loyalties following a tragedy befalling one of the characters? (When you read it, see what I mean, and try and tell me that I'm wrong.) The author seemed to run out of plot 3/4 of the way into the book, and cobbled together a hasty ending that not only didn't jibe with the rest of the story. It was a good read, but not satisfying, and completely forgettable 24 hours after reading it."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I was hooked on Ms. Landvik after reading Patti Jane's House of Curl. This is another great read from her. The first chapter was a little hard to get into but I was quickly hooked! And very surprised with the turns the book took. I have to agree with the reviewer's remark about the historical information. I read things I had no idea about! The characters are real and unforgettable. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Once again Lorna Landvik presents a novel that is full of unique and endearing characters. How can we not fall in love with Kjel or want Violet to succeed? In a story that deals with both outer and inner beauty, readers are taken on a road trip that is not only memorable, but life-changing for each of the characters. Landvik's storytelling abilities are unsurpassed. I've enjoyed all of her novels and this one was one of her best. I can't wait until her next release."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This book was darker and more serious than the other Lorna Landvik books I've read, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it any less. I felt so sad for Violet, and so hurt for Dallas and the prejudices he faced. Yet the author had a lighthearted way of keeping this from being a depressing book, with an upbeat musical setting and playful interactions between the main characters."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I was looking for a novel that would complement my \\"escapist\\" read set during the 1930s (no easy feat) and came across this one at my local library. I have heard of Lorna Landvik. A friend of mine had been recommending this author for the longest time and told me that I just had to read Angry Housewives Eating Bonbons. Well, it isn't that I haven't wanted to read this author, it's just that I keep forgetting to give her a whirl... until now. This may not be the aforementioned novel, but it is one that to me is an awesome discovery. Oh My Stars is a fun, entertaining novel about an Elvis-like rock band (before Elvis) and the suicidal girl that joins with the leader of the band and two black brothers seeking stardom. The year is 1937. Eighteen-year-old Violet Mathers has had enough. Her mother has left her, her father is unkind, she is tall and plain, and she'd lost one of her arms in an accident at work. The young woman from Kentucky has decided to end her life. But on her way to her final destination -- the Golden Gate Bridge -- the bus she's on has an accident and becomes stranded in North Dakota. There she meets the handsome Kjel and his friend Austin. Then she meets Austin's brother Dallas. Together they travel as The Pearlstones, a band ahead of its time, for its rock and roll, Elvis-like style will revolutionize music as people had known it... or maybe not. There are some fun twists throughout the novel.This is one charming, heartwarming novel! There is humor, poignancy, darkness and a hopeful tone. Violet's home life is told in such a way that you feel as though you are living her experiences with her. The things she goes through are quite sad and you feel compassion for her when she decides to end her life, but things aren't told in a way that makes this novel depressing in the slightest. This is a young woman who has gone through a lot and you cannot feel but understand her. Kjel, Austin and Dallas (I thought their names were funny) are great characters as well. I so loved the whole rock-and-roll-before-its-time thing and the author has done it in quite a convincing, enthralling way. The backdrop of the late 1930s is told in a wonderful manner -- I loved the author's descriptions of the era and the different areas as the band travels and performs. I also thought the author is quite on the mark when she addresses race issues and segregation. You are reminded of all the things African Americans have been through and have overcome over the years with books like this one. The one thing I can say that isn't in favor of this book is that the editing leaves much to be desired. I was confused whenever I read about Violet using her \\"arms\\" as though she hadn't lost one of them. I hope those errors have been fixed for the paperback version. Other than that, Oh My Stars is one wonderful gem! My friend was right in regards of Lorna Landvik. She is a very talented author and I will give her other stuff a whirl. I wonder if her other books are as good as this one. It seems that nothing can outdo such a wonderful and creative story. I cannot recommend this gem enough!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I just now finished this wonderful book. I delayed reading the last few chapters because I didn't want it to end. I love Violet Mathers and the way Lorna Landvik portrayed this girl/woman. The format of the book with Violet speaking and then the rest of the chapter telling her story was brilliant! This story told of the challenges of living in the 30's, 40's and so on, especially regarding racism. It also told the story of courage and staying true to yourself. I can't wait for my daughters to read this book. My grandchildren are of mixed-race and I'm so thankful for all the real Violet's and Austin's who had the courage to love and marry and have children. The world is better suited to accept my grandchildren, but we still have a ways to go. Thank you Lorna Landvik for your brilliance!

The book, organized first by chronology and, in later chapters, by sub-genres, is scholarly in purpose, but it also is an enjoyable read. Practically every page contains substantial excerpts(not just a few lines) of the humorists' work. The thorough index, extensive bibliography, and especially the first and final chapters, are excellent for scholars. Over 150 writers are discussed, though fewer, of course, receive in-depth coverage.The authors have such easy familiarity with their subject that, even if you have not heard of a particular writer, you'll get a feel for her (or his) style. As a writer and a teacher of writing, I find the mixture of social context and generous number of examples to be particularly useful. The book also made a great Mother's Day gift. Mom, of course, recognized many more of the writers than I did.One unfortunate note is the book's cover, a peculiar choice of staged photo that actually seems to work against the contents of the book. It manages to insult both the featured writers AND us readers. What on earth was the publisher thinking!? My advice is to avert your eyes and buy the book anyway."},{"Title":"Deutsch Direkt Beginning (45659)(Wkbk ed.)","review":"I had to buy this book when I was studying German in England.

The entire book is comprised of Cowboys in their own words, almost makes you feel like you lived through it.It's a daunting task as it is a Tome, but if you simply skip Gent's endless complaints, you can cut 100 pages from the book."},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"An excellent book. Golenbock's style of having the players say what happened while he sets the outline is one of the reasons I love this book. The insights the players give about Landry and Schramm are eye-opening. The palyers themselves in the early 1970's didn't want to be called &quot;America's Team&quot;, they thought it was too arrogent (and they were right). Schramm was the one who liked it. That's just one of the many insignts you get from this book along with the aspects of racism, the salary disputes, and how the social evironment changed and the players evovled. The only drawback is if you are a current Cowboys fan and only care about the last few years, you're going to be dissapointed because about 75% of this book deals with the first two decades."},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"Review: Cowboys Have Always Been My HeroesGolenbock, Peter. Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team. NY: Warner Books. 1997 838p, illus. $27.00 ISBN 0-446-51950-2This massive tome (838 pages) is written by a baseball fan from New York now living in Florida! At a recent booksigning, I asked Golenbock why write a history of the Cowboys. He said he had always been a Cowboys fan because they were to pro football what his beloved Yankees were to major league baseball.When asked if he included material on the current Cowboys, he admitted he threw in a few chapters to attract current fans. But make no mistake: this book is about the Landry/Schramm Cowboys. The Jerry Jones, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer chapters read like the after-thoughts they are.The strength of the book is the coverage of the early Cowboys from 1960 to 1979. Golenbock mixes original interviews with quotes from secondary sources to weave an &quot;up-close and personal&quot; look at players such as Don Meredith, Don Perkins and Pete Gent. In fact, Golenbock relies far too much on Gent. E.g., Gent (who was released after the '68 season) opines at length on the troubles between Coach Tom Landry and RB phenom Duane Thomas between during the '70 and '71 seasons. Golenbock never explains just how Gent (three years removed from the team) had any insight into the Thomas fiasco.Meredith did not grant Golenbock an interview, which is unfortunate. Cowboy fans no doubt would have benefited from Meredith's views and insights on the very early Cowboys and his oftentimes rocky relationship with coach and taskmaster Tom Landry. The one impression that stayed with me from this book was how cold and impersonal Landry was with his players. He treated his stars no better than his rookies. For today's fan who views Landry as a kindly saint who led his team of choirboys to two NFL titles, this book is truly an eye-opener.Golenbock speculates that Meredith refuses to grant interviews due to a continued resentment of the Dallas media who blamed him mercilessly for the teams' playoff failures, and of the fans in Dallas who showed him no loyalty in constantly calling for Craig Morton anytime Meredith failed to deliver. In truth, Meredith often followed Landry's play calls even knowing they would fail. When they did, Landry never accepted the blame and instead said publicly his QB failed to execute!The level of detail grows steadily worse as the book progresses through the 80s and into the 90s. It appears Golenbock did not interview any of the current Cowboy players, coaches, staff or ownership. Nonetheless, his writing style makes for an easy read, despite the size of the book (78 chapters). The text consists mostly of player interviews or other quotes. Golenbock intersperses his own limited commentary to set the context. He does not flinch as he explores the racism experienced by black players when trying to find housing in Dallas of in the early 60s.He also explores the drug use that was so prevalent around the team, beginning with Gent, through Thomas and culminating with the flame-out of Thomas &quot;Hollywood&quot; Henderson. Drew Pearson contributed extensive interviews for the book, saving his kindest words for &quot;Captain America&quot; Roger Staubach.The one feature of the book that was most odd was Golenbock's footnote system. Footnotes and references are detailed in an eleven page appendix. Unfortunately, because Golenbock does not identify his footnotes with numbers, it is very difficult (but not impossible) to relate the footnote back to the text to which it refers. Worse yet, the text carries no indication of footnotes or references of any kind, leaving it to the reader's curiosity to look and see if a reference is available for any particular quote. I found usage of his footnote system to be very irritating and distracting to the point that I finally gave up on seeking out his sources.In addition, the book suffers from sloppy editing and many errors of fact. Some of the mistakes are trivial: misspelling Texas State Senator Oscar Mauzy as &quot;Mossi&quot; (p. 348). Some are more significant: saying Jerry Jones has won four Super Bowls (don't we wish) at p. 808; saying Staubach won the Heisman his senior year at Navy (p. 395) when any Cowboy fan worth the Star knows Roger won it his junior year; and at p. 367, he says Perkins played nine seasons, when in fact, Perk played only eight years ('61-'68).I'm sure Tex Schramm would love to read (p. 520) that he was fired in 1988 (while Landry was still there) instead of 1989 when Jerry Jones took over! He also says Danny White was the first Cowboys draft pick lost to a rival league (the WFL) since EJ Holub was lost to the AFL in 1962 (p. 559). In fact, after Holub the Cowboys lost eight other players to the AFL from 1962-66. And in several places, he says the Jimmy Johnson/Jerry Jones Arkansas Razorbacks won an SEC football title, when Arkansas was actually in the SWC at the time.On the whole, however, the book is definitely worthy of a spot on the bookshelf of any Cowboy fan, especially fans wanting to fill-in their knowledge of the early Cowboys.By the way: I asked Golenbock why didn't he title the book &quot;My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys&quot; like the Willie Nelson song? He said he titled it the way he did so Cowboy fans like me would ask him that question! Copyright 1997 by Fred Goodwin"},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"Any one who is a true football fan should read this book. It is realistic, surprising and sometimes shocking in its revelations of the inner feelings of the players during the early years of the Dallas Cowboys. It is written without taking sides; relating the men, their emotions and their relationships with fellow players in factual, graphic terms. You cannot read this and feel the same way you did before about America's Team. The only parts missing are the Cowboys who didn't want to tell their side such as &quot;Dandy Don&quot;. These missing voices create a silence in the telling of the whole story. Still, one can relate to the events and emotions that shaped the Cowboys and that generation of Americans. 4.5 STARS"},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I have been a Cowboys fan since the early 80's and the Danny White era. I was able to read the deep history of the team from the expansion in 1960 to the Superbowl runs of the 90s (although a large portion of the book is dedicated to the 60s and 70s). I am no critic but thought it was a very good long read. Mr. Golenbock explains the much talked about rivalry between the Cowboys and Redskins and why they love each other so much. That in itself was entertaining and surprising. A must read for any Cowboys fan in search of the history of their team."},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"I thought the Landry era was covered very well. But once the author got to the post Landry era, he seemed to wing and rush through it with very few interviews of players from that era. So once he gets to the Jones/Johnson era the detail and players insights plummet and I was left feeling that the last 1/3 of the book was no where as interesting as the part before it. I think I would have been left with a higher impression of this book if the author had ended the book after his great coverage of the Landry era."},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"lifetime cowboy who was impressed by the detailed interviews of the current and former players. some of the guys did not hold back in expressing their negative opinions of landry and especially of tex schramm. i was a little surprised that the author missed an important historical fact....staubach took the pokes to 4 super bowls not 3 as he stated on page 492. (miami win, pittsburgh loss, denver win, pittsburgh loss)"},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"It is clear in this book that Golenbock is not a big fan of Landry and Schramm. There are too many quotes from malcontent ex-players like Pete Gent so the book is way out of balance. The book provides very little insight from Schramm and Landry themselves about many contentious conflicts between the players, management, and the coaching staff. Golenbock is very derogatory towards Landry for being \\"controlling\\" but yet takes quite a positive view towards Jimmy Johnson for doing the exact same thing. Players who were team players, did their jobs, and were respectful are characterized as &#65533;afraid of Landry&#65533;. Those who were disruptive and disrespectful are characterized as &#65533;courageous&#65533;.I bought this book to get an inside view of how the Cowboys became the pre-eminent sports franchise in America. What a I got was a book that spent way too much time exploring every gripe from every drugged out players about Landry and Schramm. There are some really good quotes in this book so it does not deserve the worst rating. The concept of this book is a really good one, but all in all it comes off as a lot griping and moaning rather than objective analysis."},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","review":"This is the real story of North Dallas Forty.

Trans-Mississippi West: ser. C])","review":"When news of the firing upon Ft. Sumter by General P.G.T. Beauregard reached James Bulloch, he offered his services to the Confederate government at once. He was assigned by President Davis to build a navy on government account. This book is Bulloch's narrative of his experiences.The strongest element of this book is that it sheds light on what would otherwise be very little known facts of the war. Bulloch's contacts with Stephen Mallory and other high ranking Confederates give rarely seen insights into the service he and his fellow agents performed. It is important to note that Bulloch's work is not about the sea exploits of the ships he contracted, but about the work that was done in making financial arrangements and fitting the ships for sea. The author goes into a great amount of detail in all the contracts that he undertook while in Europe. He also adds accounts of other agents when needed, but always stresses to the reader that those accounts are second hand.The reviewer's main complaint with this work is that a large section is devoted to the Geneva Arbitration occurring after the war. Bulloch seems to be rather defensive in regard to U.S. complaints made against him. Although fairly readable, this section of the book is not really necessary for understanding Confederate operations and does not advance the narrative. Another small complaint is that Bulloch will sometimes tell the reader of key elements far in advance of the narrative time frame. This can be frustrating, as what would have been an exciting twist in the plot has been alluded to eighty pages beforehand.Only the above mentioned flaws kept this book from a five-star rating. It is a readable account of Confederate operations in Europe and highly recommended for any person who wishes to further their knowledge of the aforementioned."},{"Title":"The secret service of the Confederate States in Europe: Or, How the Confederate cruisers were equipped ([19th century Amer. lit. & hist.

While historians have argued over which great land battle was the so called \\"high water mark of the Confederacy\\", the author makes it obvious that events taking place on the high seas and in the halls of European power had a greater impact on the outcome of America's bloodiest war.The late historian Shelby Foote stated that you can't understand American history without understanding the Civil War. I would add that you can't understand the Civil War without understanding the naval and international aspects of that conflict.

And, leaving aside any bias which the author must have had, it is also a tear-jerking tale of what might so nearly have been for the Confederate States of America but for the perfidy of some Britons and some Americans. U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward comes out of it all with a thoroughly tarnished reputation, as does Britain's Foreign Secretary, Lord John Russell.

Unlike other Judaic historians, Dr. Korn displays no partisan bias, neither &quot;Union&quot; nor &quot;Confederate&quot;, neither &quot;Orthodox&quot; nor &quot;Pluralistic.&quot; His research is impeccable, and his scholarship is objective and pleasing to all.OUTSTANDING!from: &quot;Jewish-American History on the Web&quot;"},{"Title":"American Jewry and the Civil War","review":"First published in 1951, American Jewry And The Civil War by Rabbi Bertram Korn is a striking, comprehensive look at how the 150,000 American Jews were involved on both sides of America's deadliest conflict. Chapters include meticulous discussions on such matters as Rabbinical positions on the issue of slavery; Lincoln and the Jews; and anti-Semitism in both the North and the South. A wealth of references permeate exhaustive study, including transcripts of original correspondence that noteworthy Jewish leaders had with President Lincoln.

Shady characters are present and you don't know who to believe is telling the truth.Among other things, I enjoyed this book because Kelly is strong, independent and thought for herself.

The cops harass her with undeserved tickets and graffiti at her home.Kelly's best friend Victoria Bowman asks her to look into the disappearance of her faithful, adoring spouse Jonathan. Reluctantly, while still recovering, Kelly agrees. She tries to enlist the aid of police detective Nick McBride, but he rips her head off, still blaming her for the death of his partner. As the evidence piles up that Jonathan had a mistress in Miami, Nick sees a strong link to the homicide of his father last year. Nick joins forces with Kelly not knowing where their attraction for one another will go or where the investigation will lead.BLIND FAITH is a powerful suspense thriller. The story line is fast-paced, requiring a one-sitting read, as the audience will want to know what really happened. Kelly is a great heroine who readers will admire. Although Nick's change of heart occurs due to his learning that his partner was dirty, his ease of accepting Kelly seems too simple. Still, as a team, they are dynamic. Christiane Heggan shows why she is so popular with fans with this taut investigative thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blind Faith","review":"Christiane Heggan is one of the best female mystery novelists that there is on this planet. I have read all of her novels and I believe that &quot;Blind Faith&quot; was by far her best. The book is classified as Romantic Suspense, but it is practially all hard core suspense. Kelly Robolo, a Connecticut investigate reporter, is startled to hear the news that her best friend, Victoria Bowman's, husband Jonathan, has been killed in a Miami fire in a drug infested hotel. Kelly and Victoria both know that Jonathan is not that kind of person and think that Jonathan has been set up by his boss and casino owner. Kelly calls upon her only police friend, Nick McBride, to help and solve this puzzling crime. As they investigate they find a link between Jonathan's &quot;death&quot; and Nick's father's death two years ago, who worked for the casino's security company. Non stop suspense, with a little romance thrown in. If you are going to only read one book this year, then definitely read &quot;Blind Faith.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blind Faith","review":"Ms Heggan has done it again.

This is a book you simply can not put down. Every chapter has something happening and not just words to fill in the pages like most novels. Everything ties in together and makes sense. You look back and say &quot;I should have figured that out&quot;. Kelly Robolo is an investigative reporter. Kelly's best friend's husband is missing and asks Kelly to help. Right from the start Kelly knows something fishy is going on. She gets the help from sexy cop Nick McBride who also has a lot of unanswered questions. Together they work great as a team and you can't help but laugh and cheer for them. I can't say too much without giving the plot away.

Ms. Heggan is a very creative/wonderful writer and I've read nearly all of her novels which are each filled with a lot of mystery, suspense and intrigue. Blind Faith was a good reading experience and one I don't think you'd want to miss. There's a lot of action and suspense and you'll be guessing until the end whodunit. The characters are simply excellent. Investigative reporter Kelly Robolo and Detective Nick McBride do set the pages ablaze as the plot untangles. The story is enjoyable and I think you'll catch the feeling of excitement as I did. If you haven't read one of Ms. Heggan's novels, try one - you just might like it."},{"Title":"Blind Faith","review":"I really wish I could endorse this book as heartily as everyone else who reviewed it, but the truth is, I found it difficult to read at times, and midway through, considered just not finishing it at all.I do give the author big points for effort, and for a fairly intricate plot line. It fell short for me in characterization and plausability. I found Nick's remarkable change of heart regarding Kelly jarring, too easy, too quick and just not believable. He literally did a 180 in his attitude about her in less than four pages - maybe if the specific situation that makes him change his mind would have happened later in the book after I got a chance to know him, it would have made more sense. Up until that point, he had only appeared briefly and the only background we got was that Kelly had worked with him before. I was still in the first chapter when I got the distinct impression that there was supposed to have been a book before this one (and maybe there was and I just missed it).Again, my apologies to the readers who really liked this book, but there was just something off about the situations and characters here. When I read the author biography, I thought maybe I had stumbled across what it was - the author is French, although it said she lives in New Jersey now. It seemed to me like many, many passages in the book were similar to bad dubbing - I could see the characters doing something, but the words that were coming off of the page didn't match. Kelly is by far the most interesting character in the book, but the writing seems so self-conscious that it was hard to see her personality come off the page, something that authors like J.D. Robb and Catherine Coulter do remarkably well in the same genre. Nick seems like a caricature, sort of the handsome, funny, sweet cop with a heart of gold - not much of a foil for Kelly, in my opinion.I may be too picky about my authors, but this just wasn't a good read for me, despite the interesting plot (which is what garnered this book a 4-star rating from me).

Glob's BOG PEOPLE is a concise and illuminating study of several exquisitly preserved bodies of Iron Age inhabitant discovered northern Denmark by peat diggers in the early 1950s.Glob, who was on the scene soon after the bodies were discovered, describes the remarkable condition of the bodies, then proceeds to explore the circumstances of their deaths. Glob's exposition gives us a look into the practice of ritual sacrifice in Iron Age northern Europe. Enhancing his discussion with studies of their last meals, the manner of death, the clothes and jewelry they wore as well as other bog artifacts, Glob introduces us to a brutal world where ritual sacrifice played a critical role in the spiritual life of Iron Age residents of modern day Denmark.The photographs and x-rays of the bodies are stunning. In particular, the haunting photos of the serene, delicately preserved Tolland man cast this study in an earthy yet unearthly light."},{"Title":"The bog people: Iron-age man preserved","review":"A beautiful slim volume which should be on everyone's bookshelf. It is a disturbing and yet strangely moving book. However the text is woefully out of date and has a lot of misinformation on the Celts and their relationship with the trading systems of the North. It also lacks the modern theories of how and why these individuals were sacrificed. I highly recommend this book just as long as you don't use it as your only source of information on the Celts."},{"Title":"The bog people: Iron-age man preserved","review":"This is a rather unusual book and well worth reading. Most of the time we read about remains being found in caves,tombs or graves under stone monuments,etc. In this case, there is a real departure in that they are found in wet bogs.Although, at the time these bodies were placed in the bogs,it was probably not known that the acidic properties wound result in their unbelievable preservation.These bodies were most likely \\"buried\\" in the period of 200 B.C until200 A.D. This period was during the early Bronze Age and in the northernand western part of Europe. Civilization was not near as well developed here as in southern Europe when Rome was at its height of development.The author describes a few of the remains and tries to show who these people were and why they were interred in bogs.This occurred over a wide area and at many locations.There seems to be two main reasons why remains were placed in these bogs.Some were obviously murdered,sacrificed,hung or otherwise executed because of crimes,need of a victim for sacrifice, or because they were thought to be possessed,or otherwise evil. Many were staked to the ground to prevent them or their spirits from returning. Others were placed there because of their high ranking in the society.This was determined because those remains showed no evidence of wounds,mutilation or ropes around their necks or limbs.They were also accompanied with artifacts and or treasures.This book would probably not be considered a great or highly learned Archaeological effort. Be that as it may,it is a very interesting read and an insight into life at the time through a very different window.The author has included a large number of excellent photos;though it's a shame they are not in color.It is also of note, that it was first published in 1969 and is still in print."},{"Title":"The bog people: Iron-age man preserved","review":"They are called the Bog People--these remains found in peat bogs in Denmark in the early 1950's. P.V. Glob gives us this story as a direct request of schoolgirls in England in the early 1960's. Asking for more information, the girls wrote: \\"We would like to know where he (the Tollund man) is now because we want to visit him when we are older.\\" After sending some print-outs, Glob received yet another letter: \\"We like hearing about these people because it is amazing how well they have kept.\\" THE BOG PEOPLE is his response to these curious girls.If you are thinking circus at this point, you have captured that trait of man fascinated in the really weird things of life. When I taught \\"Beowulf the Epic,\\" I included stories and photos from this book and displayed them through use of an opaque machine. Some students were so mesmerized they would leave their seats to examine the photos up close.What the reader/viewer finds in these photos is an extremely bizarre preservation of these mummies with such detail, one can see eyelids, fingernails, blood vessels, hair, skin pores, and, yes, finger prints. Even the stomach contents of Tollund Man (shown on the cover) are preserved and include clover, rye, buttercup, yarrow, nightshade--it is believed to be a sort of vegetarian soup.A noose was also found around Tollund Man's neck. Historians believe he was part of a ritual killing for sacrificial purposes. There are other remains, now in museums, that depict other details of life a thousand and more years ago. What preserved these people for so long--unbeknowst to the preservers-- was the peat, whose properties in water prevent normal decay. (The other way is intentional mummification, of course, the method practiced by the Egyptians.)All in all, this book provides fascinating clues to the way of the life of man in prehistoric northern Europe. Plus, you get to gawk in the privacy of your own home."},{"Title":"The bog people: Iron-age man preserved","review":"I'm not generally into archaeology/anthropology, but this intrigued me. These bodies were found in bogs, mostly in Denmark. The acidic water in the bogs preserved the bodies so well that people who found them thought they were recent murder victims and often called the police. Turns out they were 2,000 years old, from the Iron Age.The photos are amazing. Except for the darkened skin from the tannins in the water, some of these people look like they're just sleeping. Even their brains and eyeballs were preserved. From the objects found with the bodies, experts were able to determine that many of these people were ritual human sacrifices to appease the fertility goddess so she would provide an abundant harvest."},{"Title":"The bog people: Iron-age man preserved","review":"I read this book--which is still on my bookshelf--some time ago. It stuck in my memory. The author both describes and explains the bog mummies that have been discovered in various parts of northern and central Europe. These bodies--some of which show striking preservation--are invariably found in peat bogs characterized by high levels of tannic acid.I have some experience with hide tanning by use of plant extracts. Plant material--of which bark is probably the best choice--is steeped in water which leaches out the brown-colored tannins in the plant tissues. The hide, after adequate preparation, is soaked in this tannin-water for six months or more. Done correctly, this technique produces a durable, tanned hide in which the collagen fibers of the dermis have been chemically altered to a stable form. Prior to tanning, hide preparation requires the removal of all soft tissue. In some cases, however, I have left small quantities of muscle and connective tissue adherent to the skin. Not so remarkably, these soft tissue fragments also 'tan' because they also have collagenous matrices.Something like this--probably combined with low temperatures--happened to the bog mummies. Some of the bodies were exposed to tannic acid solutions for over 2,000 years and were preserved almost exactly like a tanned hide. Some of the cutaneous features of these mummies--as in the haunting Tollund Man--show incredible detail down to wrinkles, beard stubble and facial expression. It must be remembered, however, than skin--because of it's high collagen content--tans, and is preserved better than other tissues.In many cases the cause of death has been determined and many of these Iron Age mummies show evidence of ritual human sacrifice. The preservation has been so perfect in some cases that autopsies have been performed, revealing Spring pollens and plant materials in the victims' stomachs. Some of these people may indeed have been victims prepared for the fertility sacrifices of Spring. Causes of death included strangulation, throat cutting and, I think, in some cases, blunt trauma. Murder can't be ruled out in some cases but, in most cases, the bodies seem to have been deliberately staked out in a bog. Why a bog? To hide a body? Maybe. Because bogs are the places of mysterious spirits and gods. Maybe.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels of the Spanish Conquest of Mexico--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'."},{"Title":"The bog people: Iron-age man preserved","review":"Ever since I took my anthro degree upteen years ago.

This book is different from most of the stuttering books that I have found. What is different about this book is that it is not a technical book about the details and mechanics of stuttering, nor is it a book that will necessarily help with treatment. This book opens with 25 stories of stutterers. Kenneth St. Louis made a decision to only tell the stories of people who have had a measure of success and acceptance in how they deal with stuttering. Many of the stories felt familiar to me because I had gone through similar things in my life or their thoughts were those that I have had in the past. What is nice about these stories are that they are from ordinary people (Bruce Willis and James Earl Jones are not included in this collection) who have to deal with stuttering in their daily lives and they let us know how they have dealt with it. Some have not had any treatment and they just accept the fact that they stutter and do not let it bother them or hold them back. Others have had to work at their stuttering. The end point these stories are trying to drive home is that while you may never be completely free from stuttering, it is possible to have success in treating stuttering.The second portion of the book (less than half) deals with stuttering itself. It reveals what stuttering is (and what it is not). It goes through some of the more common treatments, and tells what the benefits of some of the treatments can be. This is not a book that will help you treat yourself, but it can point you in the right direction if you are looking for a place to start. There are also references in the back of the book that someone may find helpful.This is an easy book to read, and if a person is looking for a book on stuttering, this may be a good one to look at as it includes personal testimonies in addition to the details of stuttering. It is a simple book, but it should be a good one to start with on the topic of stuttering."},{"Title":"Living with Stuttering (Triumph Series)","review":"If you stutter or want someone to utterly undestand some of the hardships of stuttering, this book will do. There are many cases with stuttering with \\"bad\\" or \\"good\\" endings. This book only tells the good endings.

It goes like this: How much time would Hungarians need not to stop littering? The answer is, seven centuries and one second. In the first five centuries we get rid of the Turks, the Habsburgs, and the Russians, who - as is well known - mercilessly forced us to litter. Then about one century is absolutely necessary to define the notion of \\"Hungarian rubbish\\" and another one to copy and then to approve the current German law prohibiting littering. And what about that additional second? Ah, that we need to learn how to cheat the new law\\" (from Janos Kovacs, \\"Rival Temptations and Passive Resistance,\\" chapter 6:173).Not all the articles in this compilation contain such amusing and illuminating insights as the above excerpt. Nonetheless, this is a treasure trove of papers that avoids the superficiality of the pop studies on globalization one hand (\\"Belly of the Beast,\\" \\"McWorld\\"); and on the other hand mostly avoids the overly academic studies that lose the reader in a number of word abstractions (\\"time/space compression\\"). As one author, Janos Kovacs, wryly points out, economists may count the growing number of baseball bats in Hungary and incorrectly conclude that mass consumer sports are pushing out traditional sports and even religion in the Third World. The supply and demand calculus of the economist would miss the cultural fact that baseball bats in Hungary are replacing knives and guns for street fighting and protection.The book is the product of a three-year study that was initially framed in a \\"challenge-response\\" thesis of globalization, which ended up failing to reflect the reality of the phenomenon, much like rejecting a null hypothesis in science. As editor Peter Berger puts it: \\"the goal of every scholarly enterprise is to blow someone's theory out of the water. In this instance that someone was me.\\"The field accounts from political scientist Arturo Talavera on Chile, and Janos Kovacs on Hungary are worth the price of the book alone. Ann Bernstein's piece on globalization in South Africa reads a bit like a national chamber of commerce \\"promo\\" that glosses over the very tragic underside of globalization that is occurring in that country.The book punctures the stereotypes of globalization on either side of the political or ideological spectrum. That Latin American women gain most under the influence of evangelical Protestant Christianity runs counter to the notion in America that woman suffer most under the influence of conservative religion. That Coca Cola often serves disaster victims in developing countries faster and better than U.N. aid programs is also likely to be a mind buster. But no matter what world-view (modern or traditional) that one might be seeking to affirm by reading this book, it is more likely than not that it will be disconfirmed (as even the editors preconceptions were not confirmed). As sociologists David Hunter and Joshua Yates aptly state in their concluding paper, the complexity and reality of globalization is likely to \\"burst the mental bubble,\\" or cognitive map, of members of opposing organizations active in globalizing countries, such as Campus Crusade and Opus Dei on one side, or Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace on the other.One minor criticism was the failure of the book to include Peter Berger's seminal article \\"The Four Faces of Global Culture\\" that formed the skeletal framework of the study. I would have also liked to see more emphasis on how globalization, especially immigration, is changing the West as much as the developing world.

Well, let's see what insights he has to offer this time.Lochery examines the need for a separation fence. He explains the immediate reason: suicide bombers were killing Israelis. He should also have discussed the extent to which the suicide bombings had affected day-to-day life in Israel. In addition, I think he should have mentioned the fact that to attack Israel with a fence in place would be more difficult, and might require such sophisticated planning that a major military response by Israel would be appropriate. Without a fence, it's just too easy for an attack to look spontaneous. Lochery ought to have talked a little bit more about what other nations do in such situations.The author talks about possible demographic issues in Israel. However, he never explains why demography ought to be so important. After all, it may be obvious to everyone that if the Arabs do become a majority in Israel, they'll probably vote to get rid of human rights for Jews there. But it is far from obvious that this is a reasonable thing for a majority to do. Nor is it obvious that Israel's Jews ought to tamely submit to a bunch of thugs who demand all this, especially when Israel is already so land-poor. Once again, I think Lochery ought to ask what other nations would do in such a situation.Lochery has a good discussion of the Balfour Declaration. But he fails to point out that it certainly did not promise the Levant to both the Jews and the Arabs. It merely promised to support a Jewish homeland, not a Jewish nation. And it did not support an Arab nation in the Levant either. It promised very little to anyone.The immorality and impact of the 1939 British White Paper is underemphasized in this book. In fact, Lochery is probably right that it was part of an attempt to appease Arabs, although even this may be somewhat misleading. And Lochery does not discuss how perfidious this White Paper was, nor how many hundreds of thousands of deaths it caused. Nor does he mention another direct result of the White Paper, namely the reversal of Zionist policy on the issue of statehood: as I see it, the White Paper caused the establishment of Israel.The author does mention the assassination of Count Bernadotte. I feel that this murder was unjustified. But I recognize that Bernadotte was indeed very dangerous to Israel, and I think that Israel profited from his death, just as the United States almost surely profited from the killing of Yamamoto in World War Two. Lochery does not agree with me at all, saying that Israel was hurt by Bernadotte's death.There is a big discussion of peace efforts. Once again, Lochery and I disagree about most of the fundamentals. I feel that the war is over human rights, and that the main Arab demand is to win the Right to Oppress Jews and other minorities. Land is a very peripheral issue. I think resources aren't much of an issue either: there's probably more than enough water to go around, and the price of desalinated water is getting low enough to make that a possible solution.In addition, I think that too much emphasis is placed on people being willing to say they will agree to what is called peace. This is even called \\"historic.\\" And far too much time is wasted discussing the supposed opportunities Israel may have squandered in search of peace. The Oslo process was a disaster: it surely did not help Jews, Arabs, or anyone else. Lochery was readier to admit this in his previous book than he is in this one.I also feel that some folks may be misled by the propaganda about Levantine Arabs merely wanting some rights and some land. If they truly wanted such things, they would accept them when they were offered them, and they would also ask for land not just from Israel but from other nations as well. That's why I think the \\"peace process\\" was doomed from the start: it did not offer anything either side wanted. The Israelis wanted peace, but the \\"peace process\\" never really offered it that.Lochery says that when the fence comes down, it will be a good sign that true peace is in the works. That's fair. But I think it is a little like cheering when a tourniquet finally can be removed. And if either a tourniquet or a fence is simply removed prematurely, that's not good news at all.I'm giving this book three stars. But I had trouble finding anything interesting in it that I agreed with. Many times, I felt that the topics that were discussed were not very relevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict. I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Scooby-Doo! and the Rowdy Rodeo (Scooby-Doo Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"In this edition of the Scooby-Doo book series, the Mystery Inc. gang visits a rodeo operated by Bucky McCoy, the world-famous yodeling cowboy.

Aside from its being well written and engaging from the very first page, it is an exotic account of a little know piece of world history: the J opium trade in turn-of-the-century India. In addition, its descriptions of the countryside, the mountains, the cities of that place and time make &quot;Flowers in the Blood&quot; an armchair adventure. I was drained by the end of the journey."},{"Title":"Flowers in the Blood: 2","review":"From the moment that I began reading this book, I related to the main character, Dinah Sasson. At 5 years old, she said what was on her mind. And she asked questions that her father became mesmorized by.And as she grew,in every sense of the word, she developed a resolve that became the final word.While this novel is 630 pages, when you read it, you really will feel like you are there, part of each of the families, the business, the culture, and all the drama.There were so many \\"lines,\\" that I have picked up from this author, Gay Courter, in several of her books, that have become part of my life.I especially appreciate a line in this book that says, \\"Advise me well in this matter, but don't advise me against it.\\"The power of that assertion says that we must seek the advise of experts, while we maintain boundaries, and while we make decisions based upon who we are.I also learned from reading this novel how to be political and quick witted, while I remain true to what I believe."},{"Title":"Flowers in the Blood: 2","review":"I read this book almost two years ago. Since then I have read quite a number of novels but Flowers in the Blood still stands out as an all time favorite. I rememeber the characters and the story so vividly. Dinah Sasson's strong character and her ethics. The story was even more appealing to me since my husband is from India and is Jewish. Events and situations in this novel coincided with many of the stories I had heard from him and his family during their period in India. Very good story."},{"Title":"Flowers in the Blood: 2","review":"This book is great as a textbook; I learned a lot about Jews in India and the opium trade. However, the characters leave very, very much to be desired. The way Dinah Sassoon is just thrown from one situation to another without any character development whatsoever is very off-putting. At the end of 627 pages, I asked myself: how can I describe the main characters? And I couldn't. They are cardboard cutouts with no real personalities!Do not waste your time with this one unless you really want to know about Indian Jewry."},{"Title":"Flowers in the Blood: 2","review":"This was an amazing book!!!

However, once 5 or 6 different people suggested this book, I figured there must be something it to it and I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did!What I liked most about Flowers is that this book made me feel like the characters were my best friends. I got to know them intimately and when I had finished reading the book, I grieved that my relationship with them was over.

When I started browsing the shelves, which I love to do, there, on a shelf at my eye level, was Flowers in the Blood, facing me....not the spine showing, but the front of the book. It was one of only a few books on that shelf because they weren't finished stocking the store yet. It was amazing....like it was waiting for me to come in. My book club is reading the book now and so I loaned this used book to a friend in the club, but downloaded it on my kindle. I had to know that it was in my possession in some form.

He was the chief witness in the treason trial of Aaron Burr, where he tried to present fabricated evidence. After Burr was acquitted, Wilkinson was accused of treason himself, but political events always contrived to keep him free of the taint of what he had done, and at the break of War of 1812 and as late as 1813, he was still the American commanding general in Louisiana Territory. He is well known as the general who never won a battle and never lost a court martial.When I saw that his memoirs were available on Amazon, I was curious to see what James Wilkinson had to say in his own defense. Alas, this book is not a memoir; it is primarily a transcript of Wilkinson's 1814 court martial. Apparently, Wilkinson thought that if people read the transcript, they would see that he had been misjudged.To give you the general tenor of this work, I will copy part of Wilkinson's introduction:&#34;This volume will display to the reader, the closing scenes of my persecutions, contrived by a remorseless minister, to prop his sinking popularity, and support his pretensions to the presidential chair; the secretary was hated by the President, yet to cross the vindictive purposes of a man impatient of power would have produced discord in the cabinet, which is to be avoided at any sacrifice of men and principles; this motive concurring with the well known subserviency of president Madison to Secretary Armstrong prevailed over a sense of justice and public duty.... He consented to the destruction of a faithful public officer, grown grey in the service, and permitted the conflagration of the national capitol, without a struggle, finis coronet opus!&#34;He goes on a little more like that, and then the majority of the book is the transcript of the court martial convened at York House, in the village of Utica, New York, Nov. 18, 1814.It's not a memoir. But if you want to read the transcript of a court martial together with accompanying documents, then it's a good buy."},{"Title":"Best Easy Day Hikes Yosemite National Park, 2nd (Best Easy Day Hikes Series)","review":"Visiting Yosemite National Park should top the \\"to do\\" list of any outdoor enthusiast in California. It is famous for its scenic wonders: stunning waterfalls, giant sequoia trees, and imposing walls of granite. Unfortunately, most of us can only spare a few days for a trip to this grand park. Multiple short day hikes therefore offer the best approach to exploring all Yosemite has to offer and Suzanne Swedo's book is an excellent place to start.This book describes some of the classic Yosemite Walks including the trails to Vernal Falls, Glacier Point, Lembert Dome and the Mariposa Grove of Sequoias. These walks are classics because they feature world class scenery, and if you do them on a summer weekend you are likely to share the trail with thousands of tourists from all over the world. Fortunately Swedo also includes hikes to lesser known gems like Chilnualna Falls and the Tuolumne Grove of Sequoias. Still, if you want to avoid the crowds, these trails are best explored mid-week or during the off season. That said, this book, like the trails it describes, provides a lot of bang for the buck. It is well worth the price if you are planning a visit to Yosemite."},{"Title":"Best Easy Day Hikes Yosemite National Park, 2nd (Best Easy Day Hikes Series)","review":"This is a handy little book to carry around Yosemite. It's suggested hikes are great.I did find at least one error. The hike to Sentinel Dome tells you to \\"continue around the base of the dome on your left (west)\\" which is virtually impossible. There is no trail there. I finally gave up and hiked back to the trail head and spend the rest of the time down the road at Glacier Point. I found out later that I should have gone right, not left, around the base of the dome.The hike to Vernal Falls is described well, but the author doesn't mention that from the footbridge at the base of the falls it is 100 yards to the Vernal Falls Viewpoint. I found it out later. If you've gone as far as the footbridge, you might as well enjoy the view slightly further up.In spite of a few problems, I recommend this book for families and causal hikers."},{"Title":"Best Easy Day Hikes Yosemite National Park, 2nd (Best Easy Day Hikes Series)","review":"I did roughly half of the hikes in this book on a 5 day trip.

It follows the lives of 5 \\"freedom fighters\\", George Kimbley, Bill Young, John Howard, Curtis Strong, and Jonathan Comer and what they went through in the early years of the black steelworkers quest for equality. It continues up to the present day and details the struggles we are currently involved in. There were many years of interviews and meetings with these individuals as well as other labor leaders to bring out the facts and the details of every aspect of the labor movement during these history making decades. Lots of historic photographs are added to make you seemingly relive the actual times that these events took place. An excellent job by Ruth Needleman and her staff."},{"Title":"Black Freedom Fighters in Steel: The Struggle for Democratic Unionism (ILR Press books)","review":"This is an exceptional book with information and insight not found anywhere else. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the civil rights movement, especially in the north, and anyone interested in the history of unionism in the steel industry. Not only did Needleman have unparalleled access to her subjects, she was able to use this access to its fullest benefit in her analysis and narrative. Even the notes in this book are fascinating, and the depth of research is evident in the references and bibliography. An incisive scholarly work, the book is also great reading and holds the reader's interest throughout. A terrific addition to the literature on the subject."},{"Title":"Black Freedom Fighters in Steel: The Struggle for Democratic Unionism (ILR Press books)","review":"This is an excellent exploration of the changing worlds and struggles of black steelworkers not just in Northwest Indiana but also nationally through the 20th century. Needleman sensitively deals with the stories of five black union activists, then expands their experiences in tracing issues of power and race in the steelworkers union to the present. Goes well beyond all previous studies in caputuring not only the personal anguish but also the various organizational dilemmas of black steelworkers struggling amidst very difficult and changing racial circumstances. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Black Freedom Fighters in Steel: The Struggle for Democratic Unionism (ILR Press books)","review":"Admirable example of ethnographic methods to reveal the critical participation of African Americans in the labor movement. Needleman provides new evidence that black leaders were instrumental in breaking down barriers of racial discrimination. In this work, Needleman deftly examines how African Americans took on powerful labor leaders and built autonomous African American organizations to encourage desegregation and the development of inter-racial alliances. The writer is clearly among the leading ethnographers in the field, and this book makes a solid contribution to understanding the movement for racial justice in America. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Black Freedom Fighters in Steel: The Struggle for Democratic Unionism (ILR Press books)","review":"Needleman's book is a finely crafted blend of history and human interest. Though it focuses on the lives of five black unionists, there is a message here for everyone, regardless of race. Needleman probes each man's mind, revealing five distinct variations on a central theme. She then relates their experiences to those of other steel workers, putting it all in the context of the evolution of the USWA in a changing industrial climate. Great book. Easy to read. A real lesson in life."},{"Title":"Langenscheidt's Pocket Crossword Puzzle Dictionary","review":"I love Langenscheidt's Pocket Crossword Puzzle Dictionary.

It's amazing to find that after we do an honest assessment of ourselves, we find out we are just like (you fill in the blank, with a person in your family). Even though I did not have the extensive knowledge of my ancestors as did Florence, her many examples help me shed some light on my family's background. Examine the fruit and you will very likely determine what type of tree you have or came from.This book is not about blame and is not a way for you to settle in the &quot;that's just the way I am mode&quot; either. Looking back can help you prevent some tragic mistakes of the past or at least will give you some warning signs about where you may be headed. I also think this book gives very readable clues about what things we are predisposed to and if we are wise will avoid.I highly suggest you read the Personality Plus book first and then read this book. However, you will still get the benefits from reading this one even if you don't read the Personality Plus book.This book is a book of freedom. Free to be you in light of your ancestry."},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"I can not say enough wonderful things about this book. Littauer's Personality Plus, the predecessor to this book was informative, but this one really dives into the personalities in depth as they relate to our tempermental make-up and family history. She also adds a deeper spiritual element to her work, which challenges the reader even further. I can't imagine a better tool for finding out why you are the way you are, who and what influenced your personality, and why we all should accept ourselves and each other the way God created us."},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"This book introduced me to the personalities. The exercises at the ends of the chapters helped me discover my personality type and pinpointed a mask that I had been wearing. It also gave me a new appreciation for my parents and grandparents and the influence they have been on my life. It has really expanded my understanding of others. I've found myself getting along better with people, even those &quot;irregular&quot; people in my life."},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"Your Personality TreeA \\"Deep Review\\" by Lawrence J. ClarkThis month I will continue my series of \\"deep reviews\\" of books on personality and temperament theory. My method is to discuss not only what each book contains, but my personal reaction to the principles it covers and the examples used to illustrate the main points. Previous reviews in this series include Florence Littauer's Personality Plus and Marita Littauer's Wired That Way. You can find them at (...)Since I had read and reviewed Personality Plus and Wired That Way, Part I of Your Personality Tree was mostly review material. After that, the most useful sections for me were chapters 5, \\"What Gets You Depressed?\\" and 6, \\"Are You Wearing a Mask?\\"I wish I had read Chapter 5 eighteen years ago when I was in the midst of divorce. If you haven't read my previous reviews, my personality blend is Powerful Choleric/Popular Sanguine. As a Choleric, I was depressed because my life was out of control. My wife was divorcing me, and I could not understand why she would do such a thing. I had done everything I could to be a good husband and father, I was absolutely faithful, and I was neither verbally nor physically abusive. She said she simply didn't want to be married to me anymore, and that she felt she could have a better life on her own. As a Sanguine, I was depressed because my wife no longer gave me the attention I craved, my jokes were no longer funny to her, and life with her constant criticism and negative attitude was not much fun at all.It took me over a year after the divorce to finally seek therapy, but by that time I was in such bad shape that I was considered clinically depressed and was put on medication. If I had understood more about my own and my ex-wife's temperaments, I might not have spent so much time blaming myself for her choice to initiate the divorce.Chapter 6 helped me to more fully understand the concept of masking. I could see how I had spent several years wearing a Melancholy mask of perfectionism in an attempt to first please my stepfather when I was a child, then my ex-wife when I was an adult. I could really identify with Florence's example of living for fifteen years masking as a Melancholy/Phlegmatic at home while living out her true Sanguine/Choleric in the public eye. Even after my divorce I continued to exhibit this pattern in other relationships. I am thankful to say that I have now overcome this issue, which was the root cause of much of my depression, and have not taken any anti-depressant medication for the past twelve years.Part II of Your Personality Tree was very enlightening. It showed me how my personality has been shaped by the traits I have inherited. In my case, doing the family tree exercise was a little tricky, since I grew up with a stepfather and did not meet my biological father until I was twenty years old. It has been interesting, though, to see how many traits I inherited from his side of the family, even though I wasn't around to experience them during my formative years. Since I was \\"grafted\\" into the Clark family at only 18 months of age, though, I can see many personality traits that I have inherited from that side of the family.This section also helped me to understand each of my parents and their parents better, and looking around at assorted aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, etc., I can see how these personality traits are passed down from generation to generation.Another interesting thing I learned from this section was how the different personalities interact with and react to each other. For example, one of my uncles is a Powerful Choleric, as was his father. When I was a child, I was intimidated and often bullied by this particular family member. Although I am a Choleric/Sanguine, I now intentionally mask a Phlegmatic personality when I am around him so that we can get along better. I understand that there is no way he is going to change his personality, so if I want to have fun (Sanguine need), I am willing to give up control (Choleric need) for a short time whenever we visit.An excellent line that I read in Chapter 7 was, \\"You will then find the reasons for reactions your mate has that have nothing to do with your behavior.\\" Florence was giving advice to someone trying to understand the spouse's family personality tree. Later in the chapter she discusses two main benefits from exploring the personality tree: 1) to see where we've come from and why we are the way we are, and 2) we'll be aware of what we are passing on to our children. These are extremely important concepts that I plan to emphasize when doing seminars for married couples.The two chapters on parenting and discovering the personalities of our children were also helpful. My two older children are now grown, but I can see how they each have their own personality traits. My oldest daughter is a Popular Sanguine/Powerful Choleric; she is a social butterfly but is also internally driven to achieve goals, but often masks Melancholy traits due to the influence of her mother. My son, who is a junior in college, is a Popular Sanguine/Peaceful Phlegmatic who manages to charm his way into getting what he wants and is more than happy to sit back and let others do most of the work. My youngest daughter, who is not quite a teenager, is also a Popular Sanguine/Peaceful Phlegmatic.Part III of this book was the most difficult section for me to read. After I accepted Christ and began attending a Christian college at age twenty, I thought all my problems were solved. I felt that since I was a new creature in Christ, all of the physical and emotional difficulties I faced as a child would disappear. I tried to live my life modeled after the Beatle's lyrics, \\"All you need is love.\\" What I didn't understand until a dozen years later was that my in-born Sanguine/Choleric temperament had been constantly squashed down by those I was close to.Reading this section brought up a lot of difficult memories and people from my past, but it also helped me to understand who these people were and, by exploring their family's personality trees, figure out why they acted the way they did. They were not born with a mission to abuse and destroy Lawrence J. Clark; they just were the way they were (and are). This realization helped me to forgive them for their past actions, and also to understand how I masked my true personality while around them; now, though, thanks to Florence Littauer and her book, Your Personality Tree, I have the knowledge and the freedom to let my true personality shine through!"},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"Excellent book, easy to read, concepts are very enlightening. The four personality groups make more sense to me than any other self-help books I've ever read. Recommended reading!"},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"I first read this book at least 15 years ago at the recommendation of a friend who loaned it to me, and I found it revolutionary. It was out of print then, and I'm glad to see it's back.By identifying four basic personality types, Littauer lays out a very common sense foundation for understanding those around you, why they behave as they do, and why they relate to us the way they do, for good or ill, and vice versa.Far from pigeonholing people, Littauer offers the freedom to be who you truly are, and thus challenges you to offer that same grace to others, as well as to have reasonable and realistic expectations of them. She also shows you how to recognize when someone is wearing a \\"mask\\", i.e., being who they are \\"supposed\\" to be, via peer or family influence, rather than their true self, which pretty much never benefits anyone. And she identifies key strengths and weaknesses borne by each personality type: armed with this knowledge, you can work to build your strengths and minimize your weaknesses, and encourage others to do the same."},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"I read this book 25 years go and used the techniques in it raising my children. later in cam in handing when teaching school.

Littauer is well known for her analysis of personality types using the Greek \\"humors\\" of pleghmatic, sanguine, choloric and melancholy. Her insights into both motivators and stressors are useful for any parent, or anyone struggling with a relationship. The approach she uses is to mix fact with stories and examples. I would have prefered that she tone down the elements related to her own family, but the example itself is valid (if lengthy). Also, Littauer is unabashedly a Christian woman, and her writing strongly reflect this - with numerous Bible quotes and a very strong emphasis on Jesus and Christian principles. Don't let that turn you off from a very useful psychological analysis tool book, but know it's there."},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"I loved it it made me understand the people around me If you read it it will make a huge difference in how you treat other people"},{"Title":"Your Personality Tree: Discover the Real You By Uncovering the Roots of---","review":"I really enjoyed this book and it has been an awesome read.

IT COVERS all the best Caribbean, Bahamas and Bermuda snorkeling sites, the dive shops that will take you on boat tours and resorts that are especially dive-friendly. Great for families, novice and experienced divers."},{"Title":"Best Dives' Snorkeling Adventures (3rd Edition)","review":"I've recently embraced snorkeling, and one of my biggest frustrations is the number of books that combine snorkeling and diving... and then focus almost wholly on the diving. Since many of us cannot get PADI certified (for example, if we've ever had asthma), we're left with only snippets and leftovers of information. But that's NOT the case with \\"Best Dives' Snorkeling Adventures.\\" This book does an excellent job of listing and rating snorkeling sites around the world (though mostly near the USA, Caribbean, and northern South America). It lists recommended dive shops in those areas, and even offers suggestions of where to stay. And best of all? It's for those of us who SNORKEL.I hope that when they put out a 4th edition, Huber, Huber, & Sammartino include a page or so on Florida's Golden Coast (Fort Lauderdale, etc.) or, really, *any* other East Coast US snorkeling sites, assuming any exist (their main focus on the US itself includes the Florida Keys, Florida Springs, and Hawaii). Still, I'm now far better prepared to choose my next snorkeling vacation destination, so I'm rating this 5 stars."},{"Title":"Best Dives' Snorkeling Adventures (3rd Edition)","review":"I love this guide.

Black-and-white illustrations are sparsely included; the text itself is straightforwardly clinical as it describes physical biology and representations of the vagina in art and architecture in-depth. A serious and scholarly treatment of an often-overlooked portion of the human body."},{"Title":"The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality","review":"I'm writing this review in response to Midwest Book Review's summary of the book as \\"A serious and scholarly treatment of an often-overlooked portion of the human body\\". It is an interesting book, but it is definitely not scholarly. The complete lack of referencing or footnotes is instead incredibly frustrating. Combined with Philip W. Bennett's identification of inaccuracies with a single source, this makes me very cautious about trusting the information in this book, let alone citing it.There is a small section of \\"further reading\\" for each chapter, but it is hard to know if it covers all the material included in the book. One small example; on page 182 Blackledge refers to Wallis Simpson's noted control of her vaginal muscles, which she quotes as having \\"the ability to make a matchstick feel like a Havana cigar\\". I've long read coy allusions to the Duke of Windsor's sexual dysfunction, and Wallis Simpson's compensatory sexual skills, but never found any source detailing these. I was interested, therefore, to see where Blackledge found this quote, however no source is given, and the further reading section has no title specifically relating to the Duke and Duchess. Did she simply not list the source she found this quote in, or does it rather come from one of the number of broad-ranging sex advice books included in the list, such as \\"Sexual Secrets: The Alchemy of Ecstasy\\" (1979) or \\"Are We Having Fun Yet: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex' (1997)? I certainly wouldn't assume content of these was well-researched.The lack of references means I feel my time was a bit wasted reading this. However I do like the way Blackledge includes her own subjective opinions and experiences regarding the vagina, orgasms, and sex. For a generalist reader it's a good book on a very interesting topic, just not a scholarly one."},{"Title":"The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality","review":"I bought this book because of a lifelong interest in the subject, but I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I thought it would be full of tiresome feminism like \\"The Vagina Monologues\\" but how wrong I was.The book is fascinating and I defy anyone, male or female, to read it and not learn something, whether it's about the hyena with its enormous clitoris or the human being with her enormous clitoris (it's bigger than you ever thought!)It's sad that I bought this in a remaindered bookshop. I don't remember it being in a real bookshop or pushed on Amazon. I suppose the subject is taboo even today.And don't get confused by the title. It doesn't tell you much about sexuality, just the V, although sometimes she uses a more earthy word."},{"Title":"The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality","review":"Blackledge writes from research and experience, inserting bits of her life in this work. I did the same thing!The Sacred FemaleIt is very comprehensive, covering sexuality in many cultures throughout the ages: comparing and contrasting.It is really humerous to me that only the European edition allows color plates in her book. US and UK have all the plates in B&W;, showing how far we have to go. This book will help us get there."},{"Title":"The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality","review":"The author gathers a lot of interesting material, but what stunned me was her apparent severe hatred for the important and pioneering sexual research findings of Dr. Wilhelm Reich, who in fact was one of the very first of the Freudians to speak favorably about female orgasm. But he also spoke about both male and female sexual impotence, identifying a lot of sexual behavior as rooted in sex-frustration and incapacity to achieve orgasm. This idea is hated by the S&M;, \\"anything goes\\" advocates of \\"multiple sexualities\\". They hate Reich's guts. But instead of the author honestly making a criticism of Reich, citing from his publications that which she disagrees with, she instead quotes from the narrative of a pornographic film by the Yugoslavian director Dusan Makavajev -- \\"WR Mysteries of the Organism\\", which is uniformly rejected and criticized by every authentic clinician and historian as a severe distortion of Reich -- claiming this was some kind of \\"propaganda film\\" MADE BY Reich. There is not a shred of fact in that claim. So are we to assume author Blackledge does her \\"research\\" by watching porno flics? And then mis-attributes what she sees to Reich??!! Merely because the director of the porno flic says so? Sloppy scholarship doesn't get any worse that that, and it may have been a delberate slander for all we know. What other falsehoods are in this book? It never should have gotten past the academic reviewers, but hey, the \\"new sexualities\\" allows anybody to claim anything, without worry of getting tagged by equally uncritical academic reviwers. This book is Not Recommended if you want a scientific discussion on sexuality. See Reich's \\"Function of the Orgasm\\" instead. It is still a light-year ahead of this nonsense.The Function of the Orgasm: Discovery of the Orgone (Discovery of the Orgone, Vol 1)"},{"Title":"Winterkill","review":"Winterkill is a book for your comfy chair by the fire on a quiet evening. A blizzard sets the stage, muffling the background noise as the story unfolds. Indeed, the ever present snow does much to enhance the mood throughout. The heroine, Anna Chen, is unique among mystery leads; vulnerable and real, not cartoonish or superhuman in any way. In fact, all of the characters seem like people you've seen in the next booth of your favorite diner having a morning coffee. Martinsville, PA feels like a hometown to me. Murders don't happen there. Or do they? Mysteries certainly do, more than just the suspected murder.This story lives and breathes, unlike many mysteries that have been pushed out into the market on hype. I note that this is the first in a planned series of Anna Chen novels. I look forward to the next."},{"Title":"Those strange Louisiana names;: A glossary","review":"This is a great book if you are a researcher or just curious about the namesof places and streets in Louisiana.

It vividly describes the burgeoning Edinburgh folk scene of the Scottish revival where Jansch developed his unique guitar style, drawing heavily upon such blues stylists as Big Bill Broonzy and Brownie McGee. London had its own burgeoning folk scene, dominated by larger than life personalities like Ewan McColl, A.L.Loyd, Dominic Behan, and Davy Graham, who was furrowing a similar furrow to Jansch. Jansch drifted down to London where he met the English folk singer, Annie Briggs. They struck up a close relationship. He learnt a large part of his repertoire from her, to which he would apply his own blues oriented stylistic approach. This would bloom with his third album, \\"Jack Orion\\", where he approached traditional English folk songs as if he were a blues artist. For instance, \\"The Gardener\\" is sung in a wordless vocal similar to Blind Willie Johnson's \\"Dark Was The Night-Cold Was The Ground,\\" while on the title track, he extends phrases and repeats them over and over again for a hypnotic and spellbinding 9 minutes. There had been nothing like this in folk music before. With this album, he extended and fully realised the folk-boroque style, which drew upon folk, blues, and jazz, and which was pioneered by Davy Graham.Jansch was not only a unique and masterly guitarist and singer, but an excellent songwriter. Steering clear of politics, to the disgust of McColl, he honed in on the personal. He celebrated personal independence with \\"Strolling Down The Highway\\" and \\"Rambling's Going To Be The Death Of Me.\\" He wrote incredibly moving love songs such as \\"A Dream, A Dream, A Dream\\" and \\"Oh How Your Love Is Strong.\\" His anti-drug song, \\"Needle of Death\\", was greatly admired by Neil Young, and was to influence Young's own collection of anti-drug songs, \\"Tonight's the Night.\\"Jansch met up with John Renbourne and found someone who was not only on the same musical wavelength but who could match him for ability. They recorded \\"Bert & John\\" together, a beautiful album of guitar duets, and then they went on to form Pentangle, which had Bert and John on guitars, backed by a jazz rhythm section, and fronted by a traditional English folk singer. It was here that they hit the big time, touring the world and raking in the money.Jansch is a private man, permanently scruffy and reserved, seemingly unconcerned with the trappings of stardom. However, Colin Harper has successfully brought this man to life, describing Jansch's weakness for alcohol, his failed marriages, and his various friendships, the most important of which seem to be Annie Briggs and John Renbourne. The best part of the book is the first half where he describes Jansch's developing talent and the music scene in which he developed it. The latter part of the book is not so interesting because Jansch is himself less interesting, no longer pioneering, and living off his past reputation.If you love Jansch then you will want to read this book. If you love the British folk and blues revival, then you will also want to read it, because the period and the characters that dominated it are brought vividly to life. Colin Harper deserves credit for that."},{"Title":"Dazzling Stranger: Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival","review":"Anyone with an interest in Scottish born guitarist Bert Jansch will know that author Colin Harper has been collecting material for this biography for some years now. Colin has collected interviews with friends, fans and family and those involved in the &quot;business affairs&quot; of Bert's past and present and has wove them into an in -depth, objective volume on the respected and, to many, awe -inspiring musician. Covering Bert's introduction to folk song and blues as a young man in Glasgow, to the 60s London scene, through difficult &quot;health problems&quot; during the 80s and the Bert &quot;renaissance&quot; of the 90s, Colin treats his subject with objective respect and just a touch of the fan enthusiasm one would hope for to make this a wonderful read. Well done Colin!"},{"Title":"Dazzling Stranger: Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival","review":"Colin Harper is a judgemental librarian and he writes like one. That makes this book very informative but that made it difficult for this reader to read it all the way through. I read it after reading Joe Boyd'sWhite Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s, which is less informative but much better to read. Boyd's book is a fast-paced and clearly subjective account of one man's experience as a music businessman.Harper's book aims to be as comprehensive and \\"objective\\" as a history textbook, which means that it values information more than style. Harper writes in a passive, dry manner that, fortunately, fails to dull its colorful characters.Its interruptions of Bert's life story to provide historical accounts of different folk clubs is sometimes annoying, but I can't really criticize it because, on another hand, if I do want to know about Les Cousins, all I need to do is look it up in the index. It does not make a good novel, but it does make a good encyclopedia, and, when I decided to treat it that way, I really got to like it.So, it's dry, encyclopedic quality is ultimately not a fault, but it is something that a reader should be prepared for.There is, however, one true problem with the book, and that is its criminal downplaying of the originality and influence of the late Davy Graham. A reader who is only slightly familiar with Graham would walk away from this book with the impression that he was merely a spark that appeared before Jansch started a revolution, when the truth - as Jansch himself has said in interviews - is that Graham was an enormous influence on his playing and on all music that followed. Harper plays up Jansch's \\"originality,\\" when the fact is, what is most remarkable about Jansch is not that he sounds like no one else but that he manages to sound so distinct while still sounding so much like Graham. Harper and many of his interviewees don't seem to get it, and, though he goes to great lengths to document the history of the entire folk scene, Harper, like a film critic obsessed by the idea of directors as \\"auteurs,\\" sometimes seems too fixated on the idea that Jansch was the godlike epicenter of the picture, and relegates Davy Graham to the sidelines.But, for all its faults, the book is invaluable for its accounts of Jansch himself. For anyone who has heard, seen, or met the man, the book is still a must-read for its accounts of his childhood in an Edinburgh tenement, his couch-surfing teen years, his mysterious way of learning to play the guitar, his antics in California and around the world in the '70s, and the way women were always drawn to his Celt-fro haircut and his awkward personality. To his credit, Harper never tries too hard to explain Jansch's psychology and lets the man's actions speak for themselves. \\"Dazzling Stranger\\" lets you know what Jansch would be like to hang out with while keeping him at enough of a distance to remain mysterious.Until that Danny Thompson autobiography comes out, this one will have to do as the definitive book on the British folk and blues revival."},{"Title":"Dazzling Stranger: Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival","review":"I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loved it.

This book shows the impact of Likeability and how to increase your \\"likeability score\\".Likeability affects the three ways you can influence others. This influence comes in the form of people (1) listening to you, (2) believing you, and ultimately (3) valuing you. When this third stage happens, your words and actions become far more powerful as people around you respond differently to you.Likeability is comprised of:1) Friendliness, or how approachable you are2) Relevance, or how well you resonate with other's wants and needs3) Empathy, or your ability to feel what others feel (not merely sympathize)4) Realness, or how authentic others find youYour ability to create change hinges largely on other people's reaction to you.

He and I have corresponded a bit since that review, and I can tell you he's every bit as likeable over e-mail as he is within the pages of his book. Tim recently released another book, and even though it's a little bit outside my normal \\"beat\\", I wanted to share my thoughts about it in this space. The book, The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor & Achieve Your Life's Dreams, is not, strictly speaking, a business book. It certainly applies very much to business, and uses many business-world examples--but Tim's central point is that becoming a person that others like helps you succeed in every aspect of life. Business and career, certainly--but also, personal relationships, dealing with product complaints, even getting well after serious injury or illness. In all of these situations and countless others, if you are well-liked, your chances of meeting your goals climb dramatically. This is not just empty \\"feel-good\\" stuff. It's carefully substantiated. Sanders has spent several years immersing himself in social science research in this area, as well as documenting the results of his own seminar attendees. And we're also not talking about \\"likeability\\" as personified by the stereotypical salesman. it's got to be believable, and it's got to be trusted. If your radar goes up and you don't feel you can trust someone, the L-factor goes down, even if on the surface that person seems to be really fun to be around. The book begins by showing how likeable people are better placed to get more out of life, then outlines four key elements of likeability, then devotes the final 70 pages or so to showing, step by step, how to increase your quotient of each of those four qualities.Shel Horowitz's award-winning sixth book, Principled Profit: Marketing That Puts People First, demonstrates how to build a business around ethics, environmental sustainability, and cooperative practices--and how to develop marketing that highlights those advantages."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"Tim Sanders has just released his follow up to his excellent bestseller, \\"Love is the Killer App.\\"He's guaranteed another bestseller with, \\"The Likeability Factor.\\" The book offers four traits that can contribute to a person's likeability.The great thing about the four traits; friendliness, relevance (do you connect on interests or needs?), empathy and \\"realness\\" (genuineness or authenticity), is that they all reside somewhere within us. Even if they aren't quite evident at all times I believe they are the building blocks of who we are and how we were made to relate to each other. Each trait can be nurtured within all of us to raise what Tim calls the 'L-Factor'.If you read it with a marketing eye, I think they also apply to the likeability of your product or service.How is the tone of your marketing communications? Is it friendly? Or is it technical and cold?How does your product or service relate to the people you are attempting to sell to? Does it meet their interests or needs? Or, are you just shotgunning and hoping to hit a few here and there?How does your product or service meet with who your prospects are at their core? Are you tuned into them with a feeling of empathy for what they desire?Click on over and pick up a copy of this book. You'll really like it."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"Sanders' book is short, and interesting - up to a point. He briefly cites evidence that being likeable (having an interest in others, listening to them, etc.) is linked to good health, improved job retention, overall success, better quality time with a physician, greater liklihood of getting elected, and significantly reduced chance of divorce. Also, \\"nice\\" physicians are less likely to be sued, and more likely to win if they are.All useful points. But what about Leo Durocher's \\"Nice guys finish last\\" philosophy? I guess that's another book."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"The first half of the book contains repetitive reasons on why likeability will get you far in all areas of life. All these examples are repeated for the first half of the book.The main point of the book is that to increase likeability, you need to increase 4 things:1. Friendliness2. Relevance3. Empathy4. RealnessAll the content on how to actually increase them sound like common sense, but then again they're not bad. Don't expect a huge miracle pill, but expect to increase your likeability some."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"I was expecting so much more from this book.

The Likeability Factor is another winner from Tim Sanders.The big idea of this book is that being likeable is extremely important because:\\"The choices you make don't shape your life as much as the choices other people make about you.\\"People make choices using the following three steps:1) Listen - people can chose to listen to you2) Believe - people can chose to believe you3) Value - people can chose to value what you offerLikeability affects all three.There are four elements of likeability:1) Friendliness. Friendliness is the threshold of likeability2) Relevance, how you connect with another person's wants or needs3) Empathy (not sympathy)4) Realness or authenticity. Lack of realness, like lying, hypocrisy, or insincerity can suck your L-factor down.The second half of the book covers raising your L-factor. While I will probably not get a leather \\"L-factor Journal\\" and carry it with me at all times, or repeat my \\"friendliness mantras\\" every morning, I found this part of the book the most fascinating. The exercises to raise your L-factor are not simple, and require quite a bit of introspection. I'm not remotely a soft skills touchy feely guy, but I really enjoyed the last part of this book.If this book has a downside, it's that I was already sold on likeability being important. Tim cites many examples and research in the beginning of the book, and it was like preaching to the choir for me.I like it, I'm glad I read it, and I recommend it. I will doubtlessly re-read parts again, and may even do many of the touchy-feely exercises!You can check it put in more detail at Amazon:"},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"On a scale of 1-10, Tim's book is an 11. Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" gave us the macro message: \\"Be Likable\\". Tim Sanders explains the micro details of how to actually \\"BE\\" likeable.As a business consultant, I'd rate myself these days as a 6 moving toward 7. Ronald Reagan was probably a 10 or 11; Merv Griffin is right up there, too.As a young man raised in a toxic environment, I was probably a 4 on the likeability scale. For many years, beginning with \\"How to Win Friends ...\\", I read everything from Freud and Jung to Games People Play and Transactional Analysis. As a loner, I took engineering courses and was \\"respected\\", but not socially successful.After much \\"psychological bootstrapping\\", I got my first sales job at the relatively late age of 33, selling expensive, complex electronic test systems. Looking back on those times where I lost a job, alienated a co-worker or upset my wife, I realize now that I sorely needed a book like Tim's.\\"The Likeability Factor\\" is more than just a book; it is like a Scouting Manual - a handbook for those of us who want to tie more social knots with people far and near, and enjoy the improvement in our lives that its tools make possible. It shows us, step-by-step, exactly how to leave behind the isolative and counter productive emotions of Anger and Apathy and move toward a life of filled with Empathy and Enjoyment.On page: 42, Tim sums the problem of being \\"unliked\\": \\"Being unlikable is like expelling toxic waste into your social life\\". Then, in Chapter 6, he begins our education in \\"Likeability\\".In a perfect world, this handbook would be spiral-bound and handed out as required reading in every school and company. Or perhaps it should be kept in secret vaults and cost $50 on the black market - so that young people would move heaven and earth to get a copy, then read and discuss it into the wee hours in coffee houses and dorm rooms. (;-)John SchulerPortland, OregonJune 28, 2005"},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"This book is divided into two parts; the first half is about why the 'L factor' (likability) is important and the second half is about raising your L factor.The introduction starts off with this radio dude, 'Mikey', who is really miserable about his life, everybody hates him, and he's about to lose his job. Enter the author. He tells Mikey about how likability is important and how he should be less negative. After following the author's advice, his life becomes a halcyon wonderland. OK, kind of a cliche story, but I kept reading anyway.It got worse--the author has a very boring style of writing. This is the format of the book: x study shows likability helps with y trait/ anecdote about sad person who lacked y trait/ sad person learns about the L-factor and then gains y trait/sad person is now happy person.It's hard to avoid this format when giving citations, but I felt like I was reading a English 101 paper where one gives a citation and then expands on it, over and over again. After the first 100 pages, every reader should get the point that being likable will improve your health, marriage, job, kids, oreo addiction, etc. People are reading this book to find out HOW to be more likable; the WHY of it is secondary, and should have been a much smaller section of the book.FINALLY, we get to the second part of the book, which is supposed to be about becoming more likable. But this part is bogged down in so many anecdotes and citations that it is hard to filter through to find meaningful information. The key things which are noted in the last part are that to be more likable, one should be friendly, relevant, empathetic and real. But these points were written in such a convoluted fashion that it was a strain to even enjoy reading it.Likability and attraction are both truly fascinating topics, but the poor presentation of the subject in this book makes this an extremely boring read. Best to read the summary on the back of the book, and find an alternative book."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"The author is absolutely correct. Likability is an essential trait to success.I think most of us would say that good friends are a valuable and cherished part of life. Doesn't our likability determine our ability to make friends? Likeability also determines our marriageability--somebody has to like you for them to have a chance to fall in love with you, and they must fall in love with you, I should think, to want to marry you.On-the-job, likability is also essential. How well we are liked by our coworkers determines how much we enjoy being around each other, and for people we are around for eight hours a day, this is important. Being liked by our boss or supervisor is as important as how well we can do our job. If somebody likes us, they'll tend to overlook the small day-to-day mistakes we make. If they don't like us, we can hit everything right on target and it just won't matter. I have seen employees try to get a new co-worker fired simply because they did not like him or her. I think the author has done a valuable public service in documenting the studies that underscore the importance of being liked.What is likability, though? That is a hard question to answer. Various authors have attempted to do so down through the years from Dale Carnegie onward. Neural Linguistic Programming (NLP) called likability \\"rapport\\" but horribly oversimplified the process of becoming liked by claiming that simply mimicking or \\"mirroring\\" another person's gestures would induce it.Then there is the old poem that goes:\\"I do not like thee, Doctor Fellthe reason why I cannot tell,but this I know and know full wellI do not like thee, Doctor Fell.\\"This poem, while humorous, is also startlingly insightful. People often do not know why they like or dislike somebody. Defining why somebody is liked or disliked is incredibly difficult. I have seen people become disliked in as little as five minutes and after a brief conversation.Of course there is the obvious: insulting people is not likely to make one well liked. Various tips for being well-liked are good listening, smiling, being pleasant, showing interest in what the other person has to say, and being friendly. Ah, but that last point is the rub! How do you define \\"friendly?\\" Being a good raconteur is of course, useful in becoming well-liked. But are good raconteurs born or are they made?Another impediment to being liked is shyness. People who are shy are often misinterpreted as being unfriendly, but there is more to it than that. There are a great many mannerisms that often accompany shyness that can serve as an impediment to being liked. Unfortunately, some of these mannerisms are unconscious; the person exhibiting them may not even be aware of them. For example, eye contact is an important factor in being well-liked. The shy person may not make good eye contact and may not even realize it. Nervous fidgeting, tension in one's jaws, and various vocal traits are all mannerisms that can make other people feel uncomfortable. Just as an angry demeanor will often raise other people's blood pressure, an uncomfortable manner can make other people feel uncomfortable around you.Unfortunately, these unconscious traits are not explored by the author. True, it would be hard to find studies that measure something as elusive as eye contact and its relationship to being well liked, but such subconscious mannerisms are certainly an important factor. Perhaps it will be up to another author at some future date to adequately explore these subconscious factors."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"I loved this book - for one simple reason. Sanders has written a new book that is needed like rain on a dry desert. Good people need to be reminded that being likeable matters and how we treat each other in business is not just good manners and being considerate - it is also GOOD business. We can be happier and healthier by being likeable; and surrounding ourselves with likeable people. Tim Sanders is reminding us that the old ways of respect, caring and being likeable are admirable traits. In the near future - books like this will be remembered as the beginning of a quiet renaissance inside the business world.Why isn't this book and others like it - appearing as a a daily column in a national newspaper? Sort of like \\"good biz news for the day\\" to be posted on the water cooler or the white board....I like the way Sanders outlines these ideas in a clean style with excellent research to support his ideas. The citations and research makes convincing reading. An easy intelligent read. This big world needs more messages such as this 2005 book. A simple message that needs repeating. Keep writing, Tim Sanders!"},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"I bought this book for insight and someone else's well-thought out perspective. What I got was obvious advice, drizzled on at the end of 100 pages of fluff. I say 100 pages, because the first 100 pages are dedicated to explaining why likeability is helpful to you, me, and everyone else in society. If we didn't already know this, we wouldn't be interested in the book, now would we? The next 100 pages essentially says be friendly, revelant, and that brings about 'realness.' The only 'realness' I see here is that there is the lack of intriguing insight.The bottom line is if you're a rude social outkast, then this book might be for you. If you're looking to actually learn something beyond the rudimentary, basic, advice of 'be friendly,' will not find it in 'The Likeability Factor,' which ironically is only mildly likeable as a book."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"C R A C K . . . That's the sound of Tim hitting it out of the park again!I'm a huge fan of Tim's first book, Love is the Killer App, and couldn't wait to get my hands on the Likeability Factor. There aren't many non-fiction business or self-improvement books I haven't read, and I'm always a little skeptical. If I can get one new idea or strategy from a book it's worth it for me to read it. Well, having read the Likeability Factor, I can tell you there are tons of new ideas I'm taking away.The premise is deceptively simple . . . the more people like you the more successful you will be in business and in relationships. The real genius is Tim's thorough breakdown of the different components that make up \\"likeability.\\" Rather than approach it like a textbook, he gives insightful real-world examples and stories.Chapter Six is an absolute goldmine and worth a hundred times the cost of the book.

Otherwise, you'll lack the \\"realness\\" Tim espouses and people will see right through you."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"The Likeability Factor is a great look at likeability's role in business. Tim Sanders does a fine job showing how being a source of joy AND solutions in others lives will enrich them, and you, both personally and professionally. Sanders also takes on the Machiavellian notion of fear as the ideal motivator, and in doing so challenges a lot of management styles I've encountered in my young career.The first few chapters are my favorite part of the book. Sanders offers compelling reasons to become more likeable, including some surprising ones (like better health), and backs them up with references to actual studies and some hard data. This helps to distinguish this book from more self-help oriented titles, and makes it a more legitimate fit in the business section at a bookstore.While I like Sanders book quite a bit, I found myself skimming the latter portions. Once Sanders starts offering ways to be a better listener and such, the book feels like a retread of other books. If you're like most people I know, you've read some self help or communications books that offer similar tips: look for nonverbal signals to reveal a person's true intent, focus on empathetic listening etc. This isn't to say Sanders flounders here (his excersises are very good for those who want to improve in those areas), just that it's been said before in other places.All the same, I would recommend the book, especially if you haven't read something along these lines before. But also get a copy of Carnegie's book, if only for some context."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"I really loved this book!

Now, years later, I'm struggling to make up for all the things that I didn't learn about people during high school, while I was studying science. As Tim states early on in the book, our lives are determined largely by other peoples choices about us, such as who to hire or promote.I was a big fan of his first book. \\"Love is the Killer App\\", so I bought this book as soon as I heard it was out.Like \\"7 habits\\", or \\"How to win friends and influence people\\", this is a book that you have to treat as a workbook and work through it to get real results, so don't expect good results unless you come to the book willing to work.One of the goals that I have set for myself after taking the Dale Carnegie class is to become the kind of person that everybody likes, and Tim has told me what I need to do to get there.

The concept is not new, but I enjoyed some of the statistics anyway. I just think the book was boring.

Every one has a different likeability factor that is influenced by many things but the book provides focus on what works across a wide audience. Even though many of the concepts are 'obvious' sometimes these do need to be focused on.The book provides a good guide to some factors that you can implement to certainly improve you 'likeability' which can generally lead to addition benefits in both personal and business relationships. It is not a way for you to pretend to be something your not, it is information about the other persons perspective in the relationship. If you want to be 'liked' you need to be 'liked' by someone so in that context 'likeability' is all about the other party in a relationship, and sometimes that gets overlooked.There is no doubt that being 'likeable' provides benefits and the book helps you promote and enhance that part of your personality rather than trying to substitute something alien. Like anything that involves the study of human behaviour the answers may seem simple yet they can be some of the hardest to actually live by.If you are prepared to honestly look at how to improve your relationships then this book is a worthwhile investment."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"Tim Sanders is one of my favorite authors.

It's the likeability stuff that sticks with people and leads to repeat business and referrals.

Then, there a bunch of anecdotes from research studies about likeable people getting far (these stories all seem legit, but, you have to take the authors word about them). finally, we get some advice about how to be more likeable.all in all, probably some good advice, that probably didn't need 200 or so pages worth of text. . . and really, its common sense stuff anyway."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"This book should be a must read for everyone. It could be a lifetime study in people, how to read others, get to know them better. An excellent lesson in how to take the focus off of ourselves and how to put it on others. The world would be a better place if this book were read and studied worldwide. Excellent. I highly, highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"What if everyone on the planet practiced \\"likeability\\"? We'd live in a far different world, I'll tell you that. After reading The Likeability Factor by Tim Sanders, I did a little experiment. I tried, for just one day, to implement what Tim outlines in the book. And it turned out to be one of the best days I've had in a long time. Not only did I feel good about nearly every encounter I had, but I believe those I came in contact with felt equally good. That, for me, is revolutionary: Our everyday behavior can change the world! Tim Sanders is suggesting nothing less that a \\"better world\\" revolution, and I for one, am in. The Likeability Factor takes Love Is The Killer App to the next level. And as in that book, Sanders doesn't just propose an idea, he gives step-by-step instructions and real world examples. With the four elements of likeability: Friendliness, Relevance, Empathy, and Realness - and the almost overly simple \\"observe no unfriendliness\\" mandate, it is easy to see that this could actually work. I recommend this book to anyone who yearns for a happier, more purposeful life, and who dreams of living in a world that's a little friendlier, a little nicer, and a little warmer."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"This is the second book I've read from Sanders, I will read everyone he puts out and tell everyone I know to read it too.

Tim Sanders has extensively researched the topic and presents a wide range of examples of how likeability gives a person the edge in life's everyday \\"popularity contests\\".

Of course being friendly makes you likeable. But where I got stuck was in \\"empathy.\\" Empathy is problematic, I've discovered, and I'd have liked to see more on managing or balancing that empathy. Somtimes you have to step back when your empathy results in someone taking problems that really require intensive, long-term professional help and trying to make their problems yours, too - or cling to you to solve them. It's an oppressive, clingy kind of negative result that the book sets you up for but then fails to address."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"I've used my friend Tim Sanders' books in graduate classes I've taught for years. The great thing about Tim's books is that as you sit down to read them, it's like having a conversation with a great friend that you want to spend even more time with. Tim makes my world a better, more positive place to live. He's an integral part of Team Joey. The Likeability Factor prompted me to develop those parts of my personality that are pleasing to others and attracts them to do business with me. This book will help you do the same. Get this book today and enjoy your conversation with Tim."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"It seems the books that sell and make the most sense, are the ones that almost anybody could've written.

He shares ideas that you would think most people would get and do.As an introvert, this book was especially helpful. Introverts tend to be seen as mean and closed off, but all of us can be likeable and friendly. Likeability is also the key to moving ahead in the world, and getting things done.

Tim's on to the biggest and easiest movement in business...be nice and be happy."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"First, no doubt there is a personality style that we all know as easy to like. But, is \\"like-ability\\" sufficient ? As a stand alone character trait is may have a comforting, attractive quality, in life it must be coupled with other traits, such as dynamism, intellectual rigor, mature self awareness for this abilty to be liked quality to have any lasting meaning.As we read with alarming frequency in the current literature, Hare, Stout, et al. , there are plenty of people out there who seem likable enough, who have an excess of charm and a deficiency of ethics. In the worst case these are known as sociopaths, or those with a complex admixture of sociopathic personality traits and acceptable traits.Which ultimately leads us to a fascinating contradiction. We may be drawn to someone on the basis of an emotional attractiveness, and yet repelled when we discover their agenda, and in other cases we may be initially put off by someone's critical stance towards life, demanding proof before emotional investment, and yet unlimately finding the second case far more trustworthy and satisfying.In this sense, there is an intrinsic tension between Charisma, the spirit of the moment, and Character, the unfolding of the true self over time. One may ultimately come to the conclusion that the admirable person may not be as invested in being likable in a glib, two dimensional sense, nonetheless, over time that person's company, advice, and general sense of standards in life may be vastly more impressive than treacle and cardboard of feelgood in the moment glad handing."},{"Title":"The Likeability Factor: How to Boost Your L-Factor and Achieve Your Life's Dreams","review":"The Intro to this book hit the nail on the head for me and I recommend this book to everyone. As an actor, I had unknowingly blended my on-screen bad guys with my off-screen friendly self. When my friends became more distant, I knew it was time to get back on track to being likable again. The 4 stoplights analogy clarified my gameplan to being likable again.

I wasn't wrong since I scored an 8!!! But still looking to improve my L-Factor every day!!!But reading Tim's second book is not only about being LIKEABLE. It provides you with some missing answers on questions you might have had all your life. The most revealing part of my reading was in fact on how \\"important people in your life decide your future for you\\" and \\"how yourself decides for others future\\"!!!Something very important was going on into my business life when reading the book and a \\"negative decision\\" was made for me when I would have done diffently myself, proving that I was knowledgeable, likeable, loveable and having a big network. After reading how the process works, I realized where I had faulted since I gave the \\"deciders\\" every hint they needed to take the \\"negative decision\\" for me!!!! Well, I applied Tim's rules and a \\"very positive decision\\" was made afterwards and I got the promotion I finally was deserving!!!!Thanks Tim for the Knowledge you are sharing in your books, the Love you have for the man kind but also, for sharing your Network with us!!!!

Every poem is a good poem- hmmm, perhaps that is why Keillor calls them... Good Poems? I am a blue collar poem reader. I don't want to understand the free form or debate why the writer used a certain word over another, I like poems that take me away to a familiar memory or experience and most of these poems do just that. It is a book best experienced by candle light with a special someone and/or a great bottle of wine.Thank you Garrison Keillor for another fantastic book of good poems."},{"Title":"Good Poems For Hard Times","review":"Garrison Keillor calls his latest book of verse GOOD POEMS FOR HARD TIMES. He could just as easily have called it MORE GOOD POEMS or FURTHER GOOD POEMS since he has produced another anthology every bit as good or better than his previous GOOD POEMS. These 185 poems from 61 named poets-- there are a couple of anonymous poems and a psalm or two-- were selected from Keillor's \\"Writer's Almanac\\" radio show so they are the kind you listen to and grasp the meaning of while waiting for the light to change. These poems are meant to speak to ordinary people through what Mr. Keillor calls \\"the last presence of honest speech and the outspoken heart.\\"It is worth the price of this book for Mr. Keillor's introduction alone. He opines that America is in \\"hard times\\" now with \\"the levels of power firmly in the hands of a cadre of Christian pirates and bullies whose cynicism is stunning,\\" with the perversion of religion, a tax system that favors the rich, when newspapers decline and the censor abounds. He fears for a future when America has \\"no binding traditions,\\" when the public cannot name senators and gets their political knowledge through television and their \\"only public life at Wal-Mart.\\" He says further about what is already taking place: \\"You lie in a hotel bed at night, remote in hand and surf a hundred channels of television. . . and you can drift for hours among the flotsam and you will never see anything that shows that you're in Knoxville or Seattle or Santa Fe or Chicago and nobody will ever speak to you as straightforwardly and clearly as poetry does.\\" That's pretty scary stuff.Mr. Keillor is totally democratic in his choice of writers. The qualifications for inclusion appear to be that the poet be fairly accessible on a first hearing and not long-winded so you need not look for a Pound or Eliot here. These verses are about the rubber meeting the road. There are some heavy-hitters among the poets included, i.e., the ones we read in the Norton American and English Literature anthologies: Auden, Robert Burns, E. E. Cummings, the beloved Miss Emily, Donne, Frost, Hardy, Keats, Shakespeare, Whitman et al. Also included are important modern names-- Wendell Berry, Charles Bukowski, Raymond Carver, Billy Collins, Rita Dove, Donald Hall, Mary Oliver-- and a host of good poets I had never heard of before. (I found myself often looking up the bio of a previously unknown writer whose poem I had just been taken with.) Although I understand completely that every editor must discriminate and cannot include everybody, I would have liked included maybe a poem by Cavafy or Mark Doty or Paul McCartney.The subject matter of these poems is diverse, from 1977 Toyotas and spiral notebooks to baseball, which is not to say that many of the selections are not profound nor beautiful. One of my favorites is Charles Bukowski's \\"the con job,\\" obviously about the First Gulf War where \\"the U. S. ground troops were largely/made up of Blacks, Mexicans and poor/whites/most of whom had joined/the military/because it was the only job/they could find.\\" Another is the beautiful and sad \\"Affirmation\\" by Donald Hall where the young \\"row for years on the midsummer/pond, ignorant and content.\\" And Lisel Mueller's exquisite poem about snow, \\"Not Only the Eskimos.\\"Finally the biographical sketches of the poets included at the end of this collection usually have a quotation in bold black letters by the writers themselves, often as good as their poems. My favorite is by Lawrence Ferlinghetti: \\"Like a bowl of roses, a poem should not have to be explained.\\"Thank you, Mr. Keillor, for more good poems."},{"Title":"Good Poems For Hard Times","review":"I am so grateful to Garrison Keillor for bringing so many wonderful poems to my awareness that I might not have otherwise known, whether through his \\"A Writer's Almanac\\" on the radio or through his poetry anthologies.

Garrison Keillor is an American treasure (sometimes a Scandinavian treasure?) and I, one among many, treasure him. This new book is a gem. I gave it to my husband for Christmas and since then have been reading aloud from it. So far, I have laughed! and I have cried!

Instead, many are recently inked works by cowboys and others whose abilities and talents rival those of the great 16th or 17th centruy poets -- hence the title.This book moves well, reads easily and provides an anthology which quickly delivers you to well written English language poems.

It will make you feel better, if you are down and out and want to know that you are not crazy, that there is a lot of bad stuff out there, people are in the same boat, it's a big boat, and there are life preservers. Some of these poems are life preservers. Some others may make you want to go overboard. Avoid this urge. Not healthy. \\"These poems describe a common life. It is good to know about this.

I am happy to say not only have I read, and re-read the poems here, but have actually looked up some of the poets I liked best so that I could read more. There is a good variety here, but nothing so thick or abstract that someone like me -- educated but not into poetry -- couldn't enjoy it.

It could have been called 'Poems for Times That May or May Not be Difficult' or 'Poems for When You Really Don't Want To Go to Work But Do' or 'Poems for When the Toothpaste Tube is Empty' or Poems for [insert your Life Situation here].I thought also the introduction was very well written and the book is dedicated to the English teachers of America, who I think we can all agree deserve to have more book dedications (Mr. White, I mean you).So, read, enjoy, and find the words that speak to you about whatever it is you need to hear."},{"Title":"Good Poems For Hard Times","review":"Hats off to Garrison Keillor for promoting poetry with these collections.

The resulting tension throws the heroine's search for love (and our sympathetic hopes) into sharp relief.Reminiscent of Shirley Jackson's short suspense novels, this is a powerfully written and engaging work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dark Interval","review":"\\"Dark Interval\\" is one of Joan Aiken's earlier novels, and is her fourth \\"adult\\" novel. It is a step down from the previous work of hers, \\"Beware of the Bonquet\\". This novel follows a young wife, who is recovering psycologically from her amnesia following the tragic death of her three-year old child. Her family is full of malice, and doesn't wish for her to recover. The woman then finds herself increasly drawn into a plot by a Eastern European emigree to keep his life private at all costs. Aiken does confuse us slightly with his name. Is it Harry Lupac, or Hari Lupac? Anyway, the writing seems to be slowed down by the overall mood of despair and rotting."},{"Title":"The Membership Organization: Achieving Top Performance Through the New Workplace Community","review":"&quot;Working together must indeed become easier.&quot; Jane Galloway Seiling writes, &quot;Leaders now know that the effective organization must create an inclusive, more accepting environment, where everyone has respect and dignity. Leaders have decided it is time to open opportunities to deeper participation and involvement by all so that real innovation is possible. But how can this be done? It is increasingly obvious that it is essential to get top performance from people in all areas of circle. A new workplace scenario reflecting a new mind-set- a community of connected people who care more deeply about their organization- is needed&quot; (pp.1-2).Hence, she defines new workplace as 'the new workplace community'. &quot;Community means connections among groups over time. The term evokes images of belonging and pride, a symbolic home. Transferring those images to a 'workplace community'- a workplace that is moral and respectful, and that treats employees as 'responsible agents' of the organization- is highly desirable.&quot; According to Jane Galloway Seiling the New Workplace Community: (a). is inclusive, integrative, and flexible, (b). sets goals that attract the input of organizational members, (c). encourages collaborative partnerships, (d). communicates effectively, (e). instills pride in organizational memberships, (f). is steadfast in difficult situations, (g). understands that the phrase 'we are the organization' is significant to the success of the workplace community.In this context, throughout this invaluable book, she discusses the seven principles of membership to the workplace community as follows:1. Contribution: All organizational participants are 'members.' All members, wherever they are in the organizational circle, contribute to the well-being of their co-members and the workplace community. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Two)2. Motivation: Members (1) are competent to perform, (2) are challenged to perform, (3) are personally and collectively empowered to take action, and (4) feel they and their work are significant to the overall achievement of the organization. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Three)3. Decisioning: Decisions are made in the organization through consideration of the three bottom lines: human, social, and financial. The identification of potential long-term outcomes for the organization, as well as for the internal and external customers and the community, are central to the decisioning process. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Four)4. Relationship: For all members, the 'relational approach' is basic in working with others. It is the responsibility of every member to establish connecting relationships that work and that add energy to the individual, the group, and the organization. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Five)5. Leadership: Chosen, assigned leader-members still lead. Leadership happens at all levels, and every member has the potential to be a catalyst for achievement and an agent for change. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Six)6. Accountability: Members are willingly and individually responsible and accounable for working toward organizational goals. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Seven)7. Advocacy: Members willingness to promote co-members and the workplace community positively influences the performance of individuals, groups, and the organization. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Eight)She argues that the principles of membership when accepted as the way to work throughout the organization, encourage members to share a common purpose, vision, and goals; stimulate interactive energy; and create the possibility that members can and will accept the urgency of performance as a personal responsibility.I higly recommend."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"I was deeply offended when a friend gave me a copy of this book. How dare she insinuate that i didn't know how to love my children. Nobody loved their children more than I, but out of respect for her effort to help me to find better ways of living with my children as a single parent--I read the book. Just about everything Campbell said , I found contention with. why should I hug them when I didn't get hugs in my own childhood? or get down on their level when I was so busy? or look into their eyes when I was so tired? why? none of it made sense to me &amp; I argued all the way through the book. I am a very stubborn person, so I set out to prove this obviously idiot author WRONG--BY EXPERIMENTING &amp; DOING IT HIS WAY. Well, guess what, folks, I saw such a tremendous change in life with my children that &quot;How to Really Love Your Child&quot; became known as THE BOOK at our house. When life got tough &amp; we'd be in the middle of some big fight...one of them would stop &amp; say &quot;Mom, you better get out THE BOOK&quot;. They knew its value because when I'd refer to THE BOOK &amp; re-read what Campbell said about whatever problem we were having, I'd become more centered &amp; balanced &amp; back in control myself. My kids knew they'd GET IT when i figured out what to do, but they also knew that coming from THE BOOK whatever THEY GOT would be administered with real love. I came from a background devoid of personalized attention &amp; hugs &amp; most of the stuff THE BOOK advocates. I learned real fast that what i got when I hugged a child...was a hug for myself. and when I looked into little eyes, they were looking into mine. I felt that by parenting my children with the skills touted in THE BOOK I was making up for some of the loss of my own childhood. They were like little reflecting mirrors. Today my children are grown &amp; I'm very proud of them &amp; their abilities. This pride wouldn't have happened without the guidance I got from Campbell's &quot;HOW TO REALLY LOVE YOUR CHILD&quot;.! Over the years I've probably given a hundred of these books away as gifts. One lady gave it back saying &quot;i sure wish my kids were like yours, but it's just too much trouble.&quot; Well, I figured I had to live through 20 years anyway, so I might as well make it an investment in their lives rather than have to look back with regrets. My kids are great people...Thanks, Campbell, you did good!"},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"An absolutely wonderful book! Dr. Campbell writes from a Christian perspective on how to REALLY love your child. He asserts that everyday a child is asking his parents, &quot;Do you love me?&quot;, not only through his words, but more importantly through his behavior. It's our answer to this question that will have the biggest impact on his/her life. Loving UNCONDITIONALLY is the answer--this means loving your child no matter what and even when at times you detest his/her behavior.Specifically, Dr. Campbell teaches that in order to love unconditionally, you must do four things: Show love through eye contact, show love through physical attention, show love through focused attention, and finally show love through discipline. He explains how important each of these things are and how big a mistake it is to only focus on discipline. I especially liked his discussion on what he thinks Proverbs 13:24 really means regarding &quot;Not sparing the rod&quot;. &quot;The shepherd's rod referred to in Scripture was used almost exclusively for guiding the sheep, not beating them.&quot; In other words, we need to guide and train our children, not beat them to instill obedience.Can't recommend this book highly enough. It's a very easy read and it really convicted me to be a better parent by loving my kids unconditionally. Read it and see if you're not convinced it will make you a better parent."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"I have two other sisters one younger, one older and we all have at least two children. My mother bought three copies of this book and sent one to each of us at the same time. By some grace I happened to have recieved my copy at a time when I was having horrible problems with my 3 year old son. At three he was on the verge of being expelled from the Christian Daycare he was attending. My husband I were at our wits end so when I got this book I immediately picked it up and read it.(I found out later that of us 3 girls I was the only one who did).I read the whole book in 3 days going over sections several times. My husband and I began putting Dr. Campbell's suggestions into practice right away and within one week it was like living with a completely different child. Once we understood the whole \\"Emotional Gas Tank\\" theory we began to recognize quite easily when our son was getting low. What a difference. We sat down and talked with the director of the school whom also helped us to identify some personalized areas that we were not setting limits for our son thus compounding the discipline problem. The frist week was very tough but it was so worth it. It has been over a year now and we continue to practice the things we have learned in this book. I have recommended it to many friends and encouraged my sisters to read it as they continue to have problems with thier children. It is written from a Christian Standpoint which I personally find a big plus. This book is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"There has been a lot of emphasis recently by &quot;parenting experts&quot; on training and discipline of children. This book was recommended to me by some friends as an alternative resource to some of the popular parenting &quot;programs&quot; out there, especially in the Christian community...we had taken one very popular (and now controversal) course and had serious reservations about it.Campbell's book has a lot of refreshing insights into how to devlop strong parent/child relationships, to help guide and develop your child's character and moral compass and help your chldren WANT to make right choices. While reading it, I became soberly aware of just how far my spouse and I had to go in showing love to our children....that OUR behavior needed changing as well as our children's.A challenging book! I also highly recommend &quot;Children in Danger,&quot; Campbell's book dealing with children and anger (and parents and anger, too!) Another must-read for parents!"},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"I am a family therapist and this is one of the best books I've ever read on parenting, loving your child. Although,I am not a big believer in spanking. But I know many experts would disagree with my views on spanking. Your child is really looking for your love, attention and approval. This is a book for both parents to read! Not just mothers. Dr. Campbell has a great message to fathers. I highly recommend this book to new parents. It's a great book to read when your child is young, as it will help you get off on a strong parenting path."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"Most practical help book for raising children that I have ever seen. You can actually put the principles into practice immediately..and easily."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"... but like many book authors, he takes good points to an extreme, leaving the teaching unbalanced. I totally agree with his basic premise, that today's Christian parenting books are too heavy on discipline and don't teach how to nurture enough. He does a really good job of stating the few basic things every child needs - eye contact, physical touch, focused attention, affirming words. These things fill the child's \\"emotional tank,\\" therefore avoiding many discipline problems before they come up. He also does a great job of explaining why the marital relationship is of vital importance to a happy home.However toward the last 1/3 of the book the good teaching was taken to a not-good extreme. He implies that if the child is being obnoxious or ornery it is always the parent's fault for not filling the little darling's emotional tank. On page 114 he gives an example of a child who has always willingly done a task before, but is unwilling now. To the parent who might enforce the request instead of stop and \\"fill the tank,\\" he states, \\"If the reason for your child's behavior was legitimate, then you would be the one who should be punished for forcing him or her to perform the task.\\"Now, this sounds a bit extreme to me. First, there are times when children behave badly because of something that isn't Dad and Mom's fault. We should most certainly nurture our children emotionally, but not cater to each and every bad mood the child has. As the parent we are in charge and at times have every right to expect cooperation whether the child's tank is \\"full\\" or not. As an adult I have responsibilities to fulfill and people to submit to whether my tank is full or not. Am I really doing my child a favor to expect nothing from him if he is not feeling 100% full and happy? Do I want to teach a 10 or even 5 year old to expect the world to stop right there and fix it every single time he's unhappy? This takes a basically good teaching to an unrealistic extreme.But, get the book for its good points - most Christian parent books don't state the nurture aspect as well."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"This book helps you in a way that doesnt make you feel stupid for not doing all of these things before.

After reading Dr. Campbell's book, I realized that anything else I had read really didn't make sense without the basic foundation offered by Dr. Campbell. Now, having the foundation, I can use the other books (Nelson, Dobson, Sears) more effectively. The impact it has had on my being a parent is priceless.
