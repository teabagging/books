Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \\"acceptable\\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works.Comment"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of Austen's best i read this book for my senior english class it is the only book that i have ever taken to. Hard to understand at first but once you get into it you can't put it down."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although Persuasion was an amazing book, it just did not add up to Jane Austen's other works. While not as silly as EMMA, it did not have the character development or interesting story line(s) of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Still, a good read, if you're an Austen or romance novel fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book might have been a small chapter of a tremendous book. Perhaps it was curtailed by intent. A shallow, somewhat childish plot serves as background for significant character development of Anne Elliot, initially portrayed as a shy retiring late 20s wallflower, but every character, including her Wentworth, view Anne as an intelligent obviously gorgeous woman. What we do have in Persuasion is the admirable psychological manipulation by Anne of her own environment, and though we may be less than entranced by a tale of the English idle rich, we do have a woman of strong mind weaving through a soap opera society of parties, walks by the sea and cards. If able to ignore the vacuous background of the novel, we have good, somewhat humorless auto-pilot type writing showing perhaps more potential than actual accomplishment. I read Pride and Prejudice 30 years ago and remember absolutely nothing about it except that I liked the book. Persuasion very likely will leave a similar impression."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen wrote Persuasion as her last novel. She influenced her characters to be moderate people who lived within the same town as she grew up in. This town is to be called Bath.Anne, the main character of the novel, is the sister of Elizabeth and Mary. The family is well respected in town. They live with their father, Sir Walter Elliot, who without great thinking puts the family into dept. They then move to Bath and leave their house to Admiral and Mrs. Croft. Mrs. Croft is Captain Wentworth's sister, the man Anne had once fallen so deeply in love with. Anne goes and visits the Musgrove family where again she meets Captain Wentworth after not seeing him for so long. The Musgrove family, have two children and Captain Wentworth focuses his attention on one in particular.They travel to see another family in which Mr. Elliot falls in love with Anne. After only knowing her for a short period of time they later find out that they are cousins. Anne forgets about Captain Wentworth for awhile and focuses her attention on Mr. Elliot. They become engaged and Anne finds out Mr. Elliot's motives. Forgiving Mr. Elliot Anne stays with him. As time goes by she hears that Captain Wentworth proclaims that his love for her has never gone away.Jane Austen portrays the story as a love story but with a little twist and turn to it. Where family members fall in love and sides are taken. Based in the pas it has a present kind of love to it. Love triangles, family ties, and friendships that go on and off.Persuasion needs a lot of attention. You have to focus on the little details and be interested in old literature and the time period in which the book was based and written in. There were certain things that become uncertain and unclear to understand.The way Jane writes isn't really as typical as most books teenage children would read. She sets her stories on other books she has written and being sick while writing this book, it could have been a little better. Not to say it was a horrible book, but you really have to have the time and heart to read it.If you are a serious reader and can really get into a book, this is a good choice. It portrays a love story that could happen in today's society but has other aspects that allows you to know that it was set back in a time period when love wasn't the one thing everyone was looking for and willing to talk about."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's last novel, Persuasion, we meet the Elliot family: Sir Walter and his daughters, Elizabeth, Mary and the youngest daughter Anne. Over 8 years ago Anne became engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a man with no one to recommend him. After much persuasion from a family friend, Lady Russell, Anne breaks off the engagement. When the reader meets Anne it is more than 8 years later and circumstances have brought her and the now Captain Frederick Wentworth back into each other's lives. Will they be able to rekindle their relationship or did Anne's initial refusal ruin all hope for them to be together...?Reading Jane Austen is truly refreshing! The subtleness with which Austen delves into the relationship between Anne and Captain Wentworth among other characters is beautifully done. A great read!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A wonderful book. Probably one of Jane Austen's better novels along with Pride and Prejudice. Very moving and delightful. I would recommend this book to any whose a Jane Austen fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is an interrupted love story, not as piquant as Austen's other novels, but stimulating and provocative in more subtle ways. In a way, it is a study of how we are influenced or persuaded to make choices in our lives, both from within and without, and it is also a study of character. Anne is by far the most likable character, and it is her innately good character that is contrasted with all the others, but for me, Anne is far too restrained to be wholly likable. In one scene, Anne translates an Italian libretto, which she does with great skill, but she refuses to go beyond mere translation and discuss the music due to its romantic nature, which would be inappropriate. The overriding concern for all the characters is always to be socially correct. Persuasion lacks any really spritied characters. But then, why should all stories have spirited characters? There's nothing wrong with a story about more ordinary people. And the way Austen has these \\"ordinary\\" people talking, it is pure literary pleasure to read and savor the English language expressed so eloquently."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My sister had been raving about Persuasion, but after reading a few of Austen's books, I was very relunctant to read it. When I had to read something for English class, I chose Persuasion--hoping I wouldn't be bored out of my mind. Shortly, I was drawn into the world of the heroine: Anne Elliot, and could hardly put the book down! Although Persuasion is predictable, it is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In my opinion, Persuasion is probably Heyer's most underrated book. Most people read Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibilty and Emma, but Persuasion doesn't get nearly as much attention, which is very sad as I think it's probably Austen's best-written novel. Perhaps people don't read it because it's about an \\"older\\" hero and heroine, and the heroine is not beautiful, nor is she very spunky or spirited. The story also develops in a much more subtle way than some of Austen's others. Whatever the reason for its lack of popularity, however, it definitely deserves a wider following.Not only is it the most romantic of Austen's books(in my opinion), but it also has the greatest characters! They're funny, silly, stupid, and manipulative- and therefore, completely memorable. And the hero and heroine are just the sort one wants to cheer for, and see settled happily. I admit that P&P;, S&S; and Emma are fun reads, and they'll always have a huge following. Persuasion won't ever reach that level of fandom, but it's definitely on my favorites list and deserves a reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is one of my favourite novels by Jane Austen. Like in all her other novels Jane Austen describes with wit and style the life of a cute heroin. At that point Anne Elliot is slightely different, because she found her real love when she was a young woman, but she had to break her engagement, because the family matters wanted her to. After a few years she still loves the man she broke up with. As she meets him again a couple of years later, he has made a lot of money as Captain . At first they try to keep out of their way, but that seems to be impossible. They meet eachother really often, because the relatives of Anne want him to mary one of their daughters. The love is still there , in both of them, but manners and doubts make it impossible to tell.Like in all Jane Austen's novels there are implications and disaccords that let you always hope for a Happy End .And for my opinion Jane Austen wrote the most romantic loveletter in that book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Musgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Musgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Musgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My husband got me the Kindle for Christmas. I'm an avid reader, and my husband and kids get tired of all the books around the house! I've found it enjoyable for reading many things (can't use it for textbooks where I need the pictures), and it is lightweight which I need for my joint problems.Anyway, I have always loved Jane Austen, but this was one book I hadn't read yet. I had read that this was one of her last books, and that some of the tone of her books changed as she got older. Austen died most probably with breast cancer, so she most probably was dealing with some symptoms at this point in her life. I don't know if she was aware of her situation, that she may die soon, but this book has a certain poignancy in it. It doesn't seem as hopeful or as humorous as her other books that look at life for women in the early 1800's.By this time, she knew she would not have an opportunity to marriage. It's sad that women in England back then, especially those of the trade class/genteel middle class, were so dependent upon men choosing who to marry. They couldn't hold jobs, they had no rights as concerns inheritance, everything in their future depended upon their getting married. But during their lifetime they knew nothing different. Austen dealt with all of these problems, and the very real possibility of injury and disease and death curtailing the lives of women in this novel.She also dealt with snobbishness among the upper classes. That part of the book is hilarious as usual. She really knew how to draw these people, and their attitudes.By the time I got halfway through this book, I had a hard time putting it down. I really wish someone would write of our day and age, in this tone and with this ability to draw people. I haven't ever seen a writer to compare with her...I don't think I ever will."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"At 19-years-old, Anne Elliot was a beauty who fell in love with naval officer Captain Wentworth. The two shared a whirlwind romance; but the fact that Captain Wentworth was lacking in the financial department, caused the two to part ways. It wasn't that Anne wanted to say goodbye to Captain Wentworth; she was more bullied into it by Lady Russell, a friend of her deceased mother. Ten years have passed. Anne is now twenty-nine-years-old. Over the years, she has met no other suitor who tickled her fancy in the way that Captain Wentworth was able to. Thus, she has never gotten married. The fact that her father, Sir Walter Elliot is heavy handed when it comes to spending only makes Anne more convinced that she will never have a significant other; after all, she would not have much in terms of money to bring to a relationship. But then Captain Wentworth comes back.While the ten years which have passed have done little to mar Anne Elliot's beauty, they have done much to decrease the amount of money still left within her family. As a baronet, Sir Walter Elliot is obsessed with keeping up with the times, this means draping himself in all sorts of fashionable garb, and displaying his social rank for the world to see. When not glancing at himself in mirrors, Sir Walter Elliot spends his time with the scheming, husband-hungry, Mrs. Clay. Mrs. Clay, who has befriended Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, would do anything to catch herself a husband. Elizabeth is the same way. Unlike Anne, Elizabeth is just as obsessed with social status as her father; and both Elizabeth and Sir Walter Elliot look down upon Anne. Anne's other sister, Mary, who is married and has children, looks down upon Anne just as her sister and father. Mary expects Anne to wait on her hand and foot at all times - even when she is a guest in her own home. Anne is usually happy to oblige; but when she finds that her home, Kellynch Hall, will be rented out, and that she and her family must take up residence in Bath, she is quite disappointed. That is, until she runs into Captain Wentworth. Captain Wentworth is more dashing than ever before, and Anne can't help but feel the same attraction to him that overwhelmed her ten years ago. But with so much time gone, Anne can't tell if Captain Wentworth still feels the same way about her; and with other women vying for his attentions, she can't help but wonder if the two of them will ever be together again.I will admit that it took me a few chapters to truly become interested in PERSUASION; but once I was introduced to Anne Elliot, there was absolutely no turning back. From the moment Anne Elliot enters the story, you can't help but fall in love with her. She is demure, kind, intelligent, spirited, and debonair, in her own right. She is so willing to please those surrounding her, that, at times, the reader can't help but wish that she would lash out, and speak up for herself. Yet, perhaps, if she did just that, she wouldn't be as much of an appealing, lovable character. Captain Wentworth's quiet, shy, timid persona can be infuriating at times, but he is still a dashing, handsome male lead that you can't help but swoon over. The confusion between Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot, regarding their relationship, can, at times be trying, as the reader wants to see the two of them together; but the mishaps produce a piece of dry humor that is entertaining and adds to the storyline. PERSUASION presents a whirlwind romance that you can't help but get swept up into!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Gillian Beer writes a fascinating Introduction in this Penguin Classic Edition, in which she discusses Miss Austen's portrayal of the double-edged nature of persuasion. This complete and unabridged edition also contains a biography of the author, an Afterword, a new chronology and full textual notes.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.JANA"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time.

Simply put, it is my favorite book. While not everyone holds this novel with the same high esteem that I do, I urge those who have NOT read &quot;Persuasion&quot; to buy it.This book has meant different things to me at different times in my life. I have often reflected why I find the story so fascinating and believe it is because it so accurately portrays the human spirit and exposes our flaws and strengths with such transparency.Jane Austen reveals those who are so superficial that they see no goodness or worth other than beauty and wealth (Anne's father and sister); those who are so dependent that they do not listen to their own heart - but instead leave their most important decisions for others to make (Anne herself); and those whose pride has been wounded.And perhaps what is so captivating, Austen lets the reader vicariously &quot;undo&quot; an error in judgment. This is an excellent and timeless novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This review is for the Norton Critical Edition of Persuasion, and has two parts: a review of Persuasion itself, and a review of Norton Content.No educated person disputes Austen's contribution to the literary world. While her particular craft may not be palatable to all types (whose is?), I maintain that of all Austen's works, Persuasion is the one to hold the most appeal to those unfamiliar with her literature. It could be a \`gateway drug', introducing the reader to Austen, or it could be a delightful \`one-book stand'; whichever way works for the reader.Concealed within Regency trappings is a universal story: there is a \`mythic' quality to it in the sense that C.S. Lewis defines myth. The story reaches through space and time to grab the heart and attention of the reader, compelling her both on and deeper. When the novel opens, Anne Elliot faces the prospect of meeting once again a man with whom she was compelled to break off an engagement nearly eight years prior. While relatively little outward action takes place, Austen builds tension through Anne's inner conflict. Peripheral issues, such as the nature of the change in social systems in this turbulent time in Britain and the place of women in society, serve as complementary fare that highlights the mounting dilemma that Anne faces. In Austen style, the resolution and denouement are highly satisfying and truly ingenious, and the reader is left with meaty material to savor for days to come.The Norton contribution to Persuasion is indispensable. Though I was previously familiar with Persuasion, a favorite professor of mine introduced me to the commentary and contributions within this edition. The preface lays out a road map of sorts for the rest of the book. Included immediately after the conclusion of the novel is the original ending-something that even the non-lit majors in my class found interesting. A fabulous selection of backgrounds and contexts follows, with items such as Henry Austen's \\"Biographical Notice of the Author\\", and a selection from Richard Whateley's \\"Review of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion\\", entitled \\"A New Style of Novel\\".Additionally, modern critical commentary is included from Austen scholars Marilyn Butler, Ann Astell, Claudia Johnson, and others. Appearing at the end are a helpful chronology and selected bibliography. Patricia Meyer Spacks did a fabulous and much appreciated job in editing and pulling the work together. This edition is highly recommended, both within the classroom, and without.--The Medieval Chick"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy.

Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"One of the major sources of contention and strife in my marriage is the disagreement between my wife and me over what is the best Jane Austen novel (yes, we are both more than a bit geekish in our love of words and literature--our second biggest ongoing quarrel is about the merits of the serial comma).For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her \\"best\\":\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (the popular choice, and my wife's)\\"Emma\\" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one)\\"Persuasion\\" (the truly refined choice)Harrold Bloom in \\"The Western Canon\\" calls it perhaps a \\"perfect novel,\\" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment.While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, \\"Persuasion\\" is the most nuanced. It's been described as \\"autumnal\\" and that word suits it. There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work.The novel it comes closest to in terms of character and plot is probably one of her earliest novels \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\" Like Eleanor in that novel, Anne is older and more mature than the typical Austen heroine. In fact, she's dangerously close to being \\"over the hill\\" at the age of 27(!). Love has passed her by, apparently.But unlike Eleanor, who one always feels will muddle through even if she ends up disappointed in affairs of the heart, there's something more dramatically at stake with Anne. She is in great danger of ceasing to exist, not physically, but socially. When we meet her, she's barely there at all. Although a woman of strong feelings, she is ignored and literally overlooked by most of the other characters. In the universe of Austen's novels, the individual doesn't truly exist unless connected with the social world, and while Anne has a stoic strength, we understand that she is in some senses doomed if things don't change for her.This is where we see what the mature Austen can do with a character type that she couldn't when she was younger.This edition also has the original ending of the novel included as an appendix, which gives us a rare and fascinating look in to Austen as a technical artist.I read this novel as an undergraduate, and have reread it several times since. I even took the novel with me to Bath on a trip to England, and spent a wonderful summer evening reading it while sitting in Sidney Gardens, across the street from one of the homes Austen lived in during her time in Bath, listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto #27. It's one of my favorite memories.More than any other of her novels, \\"Persuasion\\" shows how Austen dealt with profound existential questions within the confines of her deceptively limited setting and cast of characters. Those who think Austen is simply a highbrow precursor to contemporary romance novels or social comedies are missing the colossal depth of thought that is beneath the surface of any of her novels, this one most of all.Austen is nearly unique in the history of the novel for the consistency of her excellence. While most novelists have a clear masterpiece that stands out among their work, and usually a fairly sizable number of works that are adequate but not enduring, all of Austen's novels stand up to repeated readings and deserve a wide audience among today's readers.Having said that, \\"Persuasion\\" is simply the best of the best."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Certainly one of the greatest literary minds of all time is that of Jane Austen, an author who has been much-maligned by her unfair modern association with \\"chick-lit\\" (it's nice that \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" was based on \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but that should not reflect unduly on Austen's work). The trick is that while Austen's novels do tend to center on a romantic plot they are imbued with many other facets that make them so much more than trifling entertainments. Sharp social commentary is particularly prevalent in all of her novels, perhaps none more-so than her final work, \\"Persuasion\\" -- with its deft handling of a woman's place in society and of the difficulties imposed by class barriers. Its focus is on Anne Elliot, middle child of the pretentious Sir Walter, who has no use for her in his life -- choosing to favor his eldest daughter Elizabeth (who, truly, takes after her father in all selfish respects) and to offer regard to his youngest, Mary, at least as a woman who has fulfilled her purpose by marrying satisfactorily. Years earlier Lady Russell, a family friend who became a sort of surrogate parent to Anne after her mother's death, persuaded Anne to break her engagement to her beloved Frederick Wentworth, believing him to be an inferior sort of person who would only make Anne miserable in time. Now, eight years later, Wentworth is a successful captain in the British navy who has proven that he would have been a more than worthy match for Anne in situation as well as affection. But when he comes back into her life, Anne must live with the consequences of her earlier decision as Wentworth appears to have moved on -- actively seeking a wife right under Anne's nose. Anne also finds herself being courted by her cousin William, who would be a perfectly sensible match for her, but since her heart still belongs to Captain Wentworth she cannot bear to consider it. The plot conventions will be familiar to fans of Austen, but that does not detract from the sharpness and enjoyability of the tale in the slightest. The keen observations are on target, and \\"Persuasion\\" has the added benefit of having some of the best characters in the Austen canon this side of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Anne proves to be a heroine worthy of Elizabeth Bennet's approval, and Captain Wentworth an amiable counterpoint to the steelier Mr. Darcy. Mary's histrionics are reminiscent of the wailings of Mrs. Bennet, providing blissful comic relief without becoming too overbearing. Best of all, naturally, is the omnipresent Austen wit -- an incomparable achievement in all of her novels, on fine display here in \\"Persuasion\\". Anyone who has not yet experienced Jane Austen is missing out on some enjoyable and delightfully thought-provoking reading, and should get started as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know a lot of teens who, when I tell them I am reading Jane Austen, say, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; because they have read Sense and Sensibility first, before trying any of her easier works. Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's PERSUASION is essentially a comedy of manners--a work in which the characters must negotiate a complex code of conduct in order to survive, much less achieve their ends. And in a certain sense the novel is indicative of Austen's great talent, razor sharp, laced with irony and wit, and remarkably phrased. And yet PERSUASION is quite unlike Austen's other novels in the story it tells.Eight years earlier, Anne Elliot fell in love with a man named Wentworth. Her family and friends disdained the match, arguing that the man was below her in station and lacked any fortune with which to maintain Anne in her accustomed mode of life. Persuaded to reject him against her own will, Anne broke off the engagement--and thereafter found herself unable to love another even as she endured the follies of her father and two sisters. But Wentworth has returned, having made his name and fortune with the British navy, and it is now his turn to reject her.Published in 1816, PERSUASION is the last novel Austen completed before her death a year later, and it is remarkable for a very autumnal tone. Unlike such Austen masterpieces as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and EMMA, the herione is not a spirited, quickwitted young women on the verge of matrimony; the hero is not a dashing gentlemen of great estate; there is no verbal duel between the sexes. It is instead the story of a commonsense and pleasantly ordinary woman who considers herself past the likelihood of marriage--and who now wishes only to escape the emotional pain and humiliation visited upon her by a suitor from long ago.While PERSUASION does not really stand along Austen's greatest works, it is nonetheless a very fine novel, a delicately wrought tale of opportunity lost and the passage of time, told in the uniquely piercing style so typical of the author--and while, of course, all eventually comes right for the romantically downtrodden Anne, it has a touch of melancholy quite unlike the tone of her other novels. Austen readers will find it a delight.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's words come to life like notes on a page played by a musician. That most capable \\"musician\\" is Juliet Stevenson, well-known movie and stage actress with the acting chops of the Royal Shakespeare Company behind her. Her training and experience on the stage really shows as she creates individual and convincing voices for each of the characters and highlights the biting and keen observations of the narrator. I had read the book before listening to this audiorecording, and I was amazed at how much I missed. She really brings out the nuances of each character, fully exploiting every detail of each character (Anne's father's vanity, Elizabeth's self-absorption, Anne's self-consciousness and tiny glimpses of her emerging hope) and triumphs with the climactic passage toward the end where she brings Captain Wentworth's letter to life. You can hear the passion and fear in her voice as if it were Captain Wentworth himself. Treat yourself to a Jane Austen reading that brings the text to life."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The experience of reading _Persuasion_ is closer to that of reading _Jane_Eyre_ than it is to reading _Emma_ or _Pride_and_Prejudice_. Anne, our heroine, is a cut above those around her. She suffers through her social life and keeps her observations to herself. As in Austen's other books, there's plenty of wit to enjoy from the outside. But there's also a deep identification with Anne that brings out the poignancy and suspense of the romance until by the last twenty pages I could hardly stand it. And ahhhh, the payoff. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A wonderfully clever novel. This was my first Jane Austen novel,and I wasn't disappointed - although a bit surprised that it wasn't boring as I feared. This is the story of Anne who loses her chance at first love. When she has a second chance at love with the same man, we fear she will fail again, but Austen keeps the reader on the edge of the chair in suspense and (sometimes frustration). What a master at turning the phrase, of creating so vividly the class conflict, and the tension inherent in Victorian manners. A definitive exploration in the art of persuasion. Now I'll have to read some others, but I chose Persuasion as my first, because it got the best Amazon.com reviews. Sounds like a poor reason I know, but I was afraid that I might find Austen's work too far away from our own times to find compelling. I need not worry."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If you are a Jane Austen fan, as I am, you will surely enjoy Persuasion. The basic premise is about a young woman who was persuaded to let the love of her life get away, but now he has come back and she's wondering if she still has a chance. Books from this era accurately reflect how actions of individuals were always to be moderate and proper. Nowadays there would be no reason for this book because more likely than not the individuals involved would simply confront each other with questions to find out how the other felt. But back then being so forward was unheard of. So what we have here is a book filled with sexual/romantic tensions that makes for a very exciting read. Jane Austen's biggest flaw, in my opinion, is not milking the climax of her stories for all they're worth. When you reach the scenes in her books that everything has been leading up to, they are always brushed over with scant details and little actual dialogue so that you can't really feel what took place. A bonus about the Austen novels is that they are not so long that it is intimidating just to open them. Overall I would rate this as the best Austen book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book that I have read, and I loved it dearly. So much so that I devoured it in two sittings, two days! Seeing the 1995 BBC movie version made me go out and purchase the book. The book and movie are excellent if you are an incurable romantic such as myself. The writing is brilliant, the characters well-crafted. Anne is a heroine of today, thoroughly modern in every way! Amanda Root and Cirian Hinds do a remarkable job in the movie. Please do yourself a favor and read the book though first."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century. Austen was always demure but she had claws and her books are much more about sex than most of her contemporaries' work. (The act itself, of course, is never mentioned).Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance, which burned brightly when the two protagonists were younger, and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but, unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's, these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen, if these people were real, afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice: how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and, in Persuasion: how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own dysfunctional family? No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.)One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique are her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this \\"critique of the family\\" more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines: she is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know, by reading any of Jane Austen's books, of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows:\\"(Anne and Cpt Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\\"That might seem sardonic enough, but here's the clincher!\\"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which... taste cannot tolerate - which ridicule will seize.\\"Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be: intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read: it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not always the most popular of Austen novels but definitely reflective of her older amd more mature style. It is interesting as this is the first time that the Napoleonic Wars are actively referred to, and yet the only novel she completed in peace time.Written at the end of the Napoleonic Wars it is about Anne, daughter of a somewhat snobbish small country gentleman whose idea of himself is far exceeded by his actual worth. She has been persuaded to refuse the only offer for her hand in marriage to a low ranked officer. Now years later through a bad coincidence he has returned to the neighbourhood. He has done well in the wars and is now highly ranked and wealthy from his prize money.Anne must contend with her own feelings even as she sees him happy with the daughters of her neighbour - perhaps ready to chose one of them as his wife.This is very much the conflict of class over substance, of appearance over reality and of the ability to trust one's self over the persuasions of others around.Letters play an enormously important part in Austen's novels, and the use of a letter in this book is wildly romantic and almost dangerous in the context of the situation.I love this novel, it involves an older, more mature heroine, and one who really deserves to be loved. It has much gentler sequences in it than say the rambunciousness of Pride and Prejudice.I may be biased about Austen, but I believe they make some of the best reading about - funny, wildly romantic and deeply satisfying to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If you're interested in reading some Austen and haven't before, I would recommend you read Persuasion first as it is the quickest read and, in some ways, the most fulfilling (I know that's subjective!). But I found this book SO \\"lovely\\" and much more fast-paced and intriguing than some of Austen's others. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite by far, but this is a great second. The characters are fabulously complex with the frustrating exterior of serenity. Also, if you are interested: there are some great commentaries on women's position in society during the 19th century in Britain which I found so interesting. Specifically a conversation toward the end in the final party!If you love this book, or other Austens, READ READ READ Reading Lolita in Tehran. It's fabulous and makes Austen so much more interesting and intellectual!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There is no doubt how I doat upon Jane Austen's novels. Add &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the list. Her last finished novel, published after Austen's death, &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a mature novel in more senses than one. Our heroine, Anne Elliot, is in her late twenties, by far older than say, an Elizabeth Bennet (&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;) or an Emma Woodhouse (&quot;Emma&quot;). In addition, Anne seems to have more freedom to move socially and personally than most of Austen's earlier heroines. Within the restrictive pecking order that governs Austen's ficitional world, this is saying something, since Anne is often presented as limited by family and 'connexions'. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a subtle work, as Anne's actions generally take place outside of, and even in spite of, the fashionable circles her family frequents. All of this combines to form a novel of understated depth and skill.&quot;Persuasion&quot; begins in 1814 - turmoil unsettles the Elliot family of Kellynch-hall - Sir Walter Elliot and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, live beyond their means upholding family and social pride, and are feeling pressure from creditors and friends to reconstitute their lifestyle. Reluctantly renting their estate to an Admiral and Mrs. Croft, Sir Walter and his darling Elizabeth retreat to a smaller situation at the ultra-fashionable resort town of Bath. Sir Walter's middle daughter, Anne, stays behind with an honored family acquaintance, Lady Russell, intending to join the rest of the family shortly.In retirement thus at Uppercross, Anne is shortly confronted by a change of society - including the return of two men of consequence in her past, a cousin and former heir to her father's estate, William Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, with whom she broke a long engagement eight years before. Throughout the novel, Anne finds herself forced to negotiate her way through the flippant vanity of her father and sisters, the reserved judiciousness of her adviser Lady Russell, and her unfortunate friend, Mrs. Smith, while contemplating the possibilities of reestablishing her family's estate with Mr. Elliot or rekindling her affections for Captain Wentworth.Having recently read &quot;The Romance of the New World&quot; by Joan Pong Linton, I found myself drawn in &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the overarching theme of middle class industry and social advancement versus the supposed inherent virtues of landed nobility. With the exception of William Elliot, who only anticipates an inheritance, none of the novel's various suitors, Wentworth, Captain Benwick, Charles Hayter, etc., are directly linked to landed money. Especially in the cases of Wentworth and Benwick, service in the Royal Navy is most often and most convincingly presented as an avenue for monetary, and increasingly, social advancement. A brief scene in which the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple notices Captain Wentworth in a crowd is enough to show us the virtues and attractiveness of a self-made man in Austen's largely aristocratic (if minor aristocracy) fictional universe.There is in &quot;Persuasion,&quot; as in most of Austen, a good deal of time afforded to character development, especially in the context of what I like to call background-checks. In &quot;Persuasion&quot; however, moreso than usual, Anne Elliot is largely left to herself to decide how to proceed in her own most sensitive matters. That she operates outside of her family's regard, and that of her own trusted friend Lady Russell, makes her unique, strong, and more assertive and self-sufficient than many Austen heroines. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is an excellent, intimate novel, with many exquisitely crafted moments of pain, pleasure, and humor. It is one I cannot wait to read again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"For those familiar with Austen's work, Persuasion will be both familiar and somewhat different. All of Austen's works are simple romances, but this one is another unique part of her writing. In most of her novels, Austen had a young heroine, who is blocked from the hero by rivals. In Persuasion, the heroine is Anne Elliot, who is 27 and cannot marry the hero, Captain Wentworth, because of a previous aborted romance. Their history blocks them, but they still manage to overcome it.Austen again manages to create believable characters with sharp wit. However, while good, this book in my opinion isn't in the same great class as Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park or Emma. For me its partially because of its Autumnal air and its rather tiresomely familiar at times. Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot's character is vanity from beginning to end. Why Austen chose to always have a negative father caricature is a mystery to me. The theme of the navy versus the nobility is also very prevalent. Other lesser characters, such as the Admiral and his wife, Lady Russell, William Elliot and Mrs. Smith are truly alive. So despite my misgivings, Austen sharpened her art enough for a book that makes a great read. It is a read that people will continue to experience for years to come."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Loved it, never read it before and was well worth the read, another classic, no wonder but it can stand the test of time"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This has always been one of my favorite jane austen books. I love anne and captain wentworth. They both remain faithful to the each other for eight years.

If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; and &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films. I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint. Well, except that it does, eventually, end. It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There are many reactions that an Austen fan gets when they confess themselves as such. Perhaps a shared fangirl squee. Maybe an \\"of course you are.\\" Plenty of times it's the admission of not getting Austen. Of not enjoying \\"romance novels.\\" Of being confused or bored by her prose.I carefully say that I am a fan, as I haven't yet made my way through all her works. More than anything, I love Pride and Prejudice with a deep, nostalgic, I've-read-it-a-million-times love.A friend of mine recently picked this up for a re-read, and her reading updates inspired me to give Persuasion a try. It took about three or four chapters before I liked Anne Elliot immensely and reading through the rest of the book was surprisingly easy. What Austen writes is more nuanced than just a romance novel. Her books, Persuasion included, are full of humor and smart commentary and little treats throughout the narration.I think it's all the better that my first time reading Persuasion has happened in my mid-twenties. Where while reading Pride and Prejudice I am all giggles and swoons, Persuasion had me relating and nodding sagely. Anne Elliot is the Austen character I've found so far the easiest to relate to. We've all had our opinions persuaded, we've all felt overlooked, we've all questioned the decisions of our family, we've all questioned our own past decisions. There we find Anne as she finds herself once again moving in the same social circle as Captain Wentworth, \\"the one that got away,\\" to put it tritely.Anne is to be appreciated as a more mature Austen character. She has many admirable traits and many quirks that made me like her. I loved that at 27, and sort of lost in the shuffle of her life, losing consequence and being overlooked, her happiest moments are when she feels useful. Yes, girlfriend. I also loved that often times, she had to retreat, and sit in silence and consider her own thoughts.Though I didn't feel the relationship between Wentworth and Anne quite as much as Darcy and Elizabeth, I loved the themes the plot set up let Austen explore. I loved the relationship between Admiral and Mrs. Croft. It is not often that Austen gives us peeks of long lasting, happy marriages, and in the Crofts she comments on what she thought it ought to be. Sharing the reigns while driving sort of thing. A second favorite moment came when Anne was discussing the differences in feeling between women and men. More than agreeing with anything that was said, I loved it in context. And, of course, that conversation led the way for THE romantic moment in the book, Wentworth's letter to Anne.At the end, I can't really compare this to Pride and Prejudice. I loved that one longer and better. That said, I also can't give Persuasion anything less than five stars. For any faults you might find in Austen, she was not a one hit wonder. Here she provides another book to fall in love with, and I have no doubt that I will visit Anne again. And again, and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My favorite Austen book with Pride and Prejudice a very close second. This is a faster read packed with emotional impact and enjoyable characters."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Tantor Media ordinarily produces superb quality audio books -- for example, the Pride and Prejudice recording. However, Tantor's choice of recording artist for Persuasion coupled with overly-long chapters, falls way short of the kind of recording that Jane Austen deserves. This review is not about the novel, which I think is lovely, if not superlative, like Pride and Prejudice or Emma. The recording artist speaks Anne Elliott's parts in an almost-whisper with a slow cadence -- almost like a young schoolgirl's voice. This is not only contrary to the character, who is strong and smart, but is really ridiculous! Anne is an adult and should speak in an adult voice. Also, the artist over-enunciates long and complicated words -- as though she is seeing them for the first time. Therefore, the recording as a whole lacks the smoothness and polish that Austen's writing provides. As for the chapters, Tantor cheapens the MP3 recording by having one track per Austen chapter, which means that some of the climactic chapters are well over 30 minutes long. If one wants to back up and listen to a missed line -- say when driving -- one has to listen to the whole of the chapter (at least that is how my car's MP3 player functions). If Tantor wanted to produce a more user-friendly production, the tracking would be every 5-10 minutes at most. So overall, a disappointing production of a lovely novel. Even so, I have listened to this audio books at least three times so far, and probably will again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been expressed in the earlier 200+ reviews. This romance is delightful and the focus on second chances was especially appreciated. I think if Austen had lived longer, she would have gone over the book more throughly. The end did feel a little rushed. However, it still had wonderfully drawn characters and a completely satisfying romantic ending.Specific to Kindle: Several errors around quotation marks -- blocks of description or narrative were put into quotation marks, making them seem like part of a conversation. While it was easy to tell what was going on after a line or two, it was still annoying."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I found myself completely immersed in Jane Austen's Persuasion. It was a book that I could not put down for I did not want to leave the fascinating world that Ms. Austen has created. Anne and Captain Wentworth were lovely characters and I enjoyed following them throughout their journey. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a beautiful romance novel or a great story in general."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"What is my favorite Jane Austen book? Not that I don't love them all but that honor would have to go to Persuasion. It's more mature in tone than her other works, featuring an older heroine. Anne Elliot is 27 and has lost her bloom after being persuaded to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth 8 years previously. I love Anne Elliot and it's a tough call to choose between her and Elinor Dashwood for a favorite heroine.Unlike some of Austen's other books, my opinion on this one hasn't really changed at all over the years. I've loved it from the first time I read it and my love has only grown with each rereading. I had the impression before reading it that it would be more on the depressing side, like Mansfield Park, but it's really not. It has the usual cast of satirical, amusing side characters, like the vane Sir Walter and snobby Elizabeth, the hypochondriac Mary, etc. I feel like it's the most romantic of Austen's works as well. You can feel the tension of the unspoken feelings between Anne and Wentworth throughout the whole book until it all comes out in Wentworth's beautiful letter. It makes me swoon every time!The only complaint I really have for this book is that it's so short and a bit truncated. I believe Austen's failing health made her rush things a little bit and cut out some originally planned material. IIRC, she had intended to include some more about Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay, but I'm okay with how it ended up."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I purchased this book to read as an assignment for school in my British Literature class and am extremely pleased. I was not sure if I would like Jane Austen but this is an well written love story that kept me wanting to read more with every page I turned. Excluding the first chapter that explains how important family is to Sir Walter Elliott and Elizabeth of course. Although it is important to understand why most actions are done in the book.[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is perhaps my favorite Austen novel. As with all of her others, I have read it many times, and am delighted all over again with each re-reading. Jane Austen's wit and deep understanding of human nature have charmed readers for 200 years."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Many readers who start with Austen's longer, more complex works, quickly get overwhelmed and throw up their hands in frustration. Persuasion is probably the most accessible of all of Austen's novels and has one of the most memorable love stories. I'm actually glad that Austen, like Shakespeare, has had a renaissance of sorts due to some pretty good movie versions (this movie was not the finest, but at least it gives one a flavor). Emma is my personal favorite Austen movie (as well as one of my favorite novels.) Even less skillful readers will be drawn in my the fairly straightforwards plot of Persuasion. As a side benefit, all readers will get a good taste of Austen's wit, humor and at times biting social commentary."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works, namely Pride and Prejudice. Her later books are sometimes passed up, yet they can prove to be quite an enjoyable read.Anne Elliot, a wealthy, yet amazingly kind girl, finds herself in love with a penniless gambler who is making his profession as a sea captain. He proposes. She allows her friends to &quot;persuade&quot; her that this poor captain is not the man for her. He leaves, heartbroken, and over time becomes a wealthy man. He returns eight years later and Anne realizes that she never quite got over the man who stole her heart so many years ago. However, Captain Wentworth seems fairly content without her. Her shyness keeps the debonair captain from ever knowing her true feelings, but like any good Austen novel, the good girl always wins. Anne isn't as impetuous as Elizabeth Bennett, but her sweet nature will keep you rooting for her. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I first read Jane Austen as a freshman in college, reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in one fabulous day, a singular feat for me. I can only add my voice to those praising her works, which are deceptively unpretentious and straighforward. This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at first with a myriad of relatives and relationships. But at its core it is a mature portrait of social pressures on women, focused on an intelligent and wise and loving woman who finds a man equal to her. It is not merely a good story, not merely proto-feminist, not merely a satire... it is all of those, and a lovely read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, like other Jane Austen novels, contains characters who are class conscious to the point of being absolutely ridiculous. Anne is the most sensible one of the bunch. She decided that these class distinctions are less important than helping an old friend. Sir Walter Elliot and his oldest daughter, Elizabeth, are completely willing to associate with those of a higher class than themselves but will avoid people of a lower class. They avoid anything that would ruin their image. Mary, the other Elliot daughter, is just as selfish but in a slightly different way. Jane Austen's dialogue is difficult to follow at times, but worth the extra work it takes to understand the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Every time I finish another Austen novel, it becomes my &quot;favorite,&quot; and Persuasion is no different. Perceptive, emotional, profound and even painful at times, it still sparkles with Austen's humor and flair for turning a clever phrase. Anne Elliot is a heroine's heroine, and one with whom the reader feels an instant sympathy and affection. If only Jane Austen had been given more time on this earth to share her splendid and amazing gift--but in the little time she did have, she has given all of us who love her work a never ending source of pleasure and enjoyment. Persuasion in indeed a rare and priceless gem."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book came into my life at a time I really needed it. Perhaps that makes me partial to it, but I found it compelling, compassionate, and greatly moving. Not a general reader of Austen, but compelled to pick it up after viewing the movie, I was impressed with it's insight and its emotional and social commentary. But more than social commentary it is, though to some it may sound trite, a book of the heart and soul. For me it was spiritually cleansing and emotionally purifying. A book of beauty and love, a work which has become a personal favorite."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning to finish Persuasion, a revelation in itself because the first time I picked up the book during my vacation in Jamaica, I barely comprehended it and couldn't get into it and ended up putting it down in exchange for one of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery. I decide to start it from the very beginning, and after about five hours decided I would risk not being able to get up on time in the morning just to see how it all turns out.Jane Austen's books, I've decided, is a little like watching a Shakesperean play (or any of the other British-made films like Snatch or Trainspotting, it takes a while to fall in with the rhythm of the language. Your brain eventually trains itself to accept some of the archaic English as not being gobblelygook, and you find yourself falling into the plot and caring and even admiring the beautiful if somewhat stilted, language.Now I have to admit that I have come into my admiration for Jane Austen late in life (about two weeks ago and I'm 41), and not for not having had exposure to her, either. I do have a degree in English Literature, and Jane Austen is pretty much part of the standard reading requirement for any college or university. I also seem to own all of the books, and I seem to recall doing a paper on Northanger Abbey, even though I couldn't tell you right now what that was all about. This is, however, my first time reading Persuasion, if you don't count the time I tried to pick it up in Jamaica two weeks ago.As an English major, I know that I was supose to revere Jane Austen, but I never understood why. Earlier readings had left no indelible mark on my soul, but for some reason, this time around, I truly was enchanted. With Persuasion, I believe a lot of it had to do with how Austen carefully shapes her characters. These are true people to me, I fancy myself to be Ann, and her two sisters seem to me be just like my two sisters, without the power of the baronet and servants and estates and all that other good stuff that can only come with being a part of that genteel class. Austen lets me live in a world so different from my own, so fascinating in its examination and yet filled with so much of the problems and realities that we would encounter in our everyday lives.Persuasion is a study in human nature. Some might argue that the characters lack depth, for they are either kind and good, like Ann, or selfish and shallow, like her sister Elizabeth. I think though, the genius is in the presentation of such flawed characters - Austen is biting and unforgiving in her portrayals. She is best when she is exposing some unjustness of social mores or grossness of character. But to be fair, even the good can make mistakes and be misled, and the good themselves are trying to determine what their proper place is in this unjust world. It is their goodness which earns them their well-deserved happiness while the selfish and shallow (no one seems truly evil in this book), like in any good fairytale, get what they deserve."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"And, who doesn't? She's my favorite author and has been for a long time. I first read this book about 7 years ago and of course fell in love with it. I re-read it for a book club next week. I very rarely read books a second time. I think this is only my 3rd time.It is a beautifully-written book, like all her others. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his inferior place in society. Many years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely changed from before.They find each other in the same social circles, but his pride and her uncertainty of his feelings prevents them from reuniting. At some point, it is believed that each of them is attached to another.The novel has its funny assortment of characters just like all of Austen's works. And, Austen saves the wonderful union of Anne and Captain Wentworth for the last pages, as in her other books. But, that makes it sweet as you finally read the happy ending. I actually cried as I read the touching letter he writes to Anne at the end."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was my favorite of all of Jane Austen's novels! I loved it from start to finish! Captain Wentworth is her greatest hero; surpassing even Mr. Darcy. It's wonderful, witty and romantic."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Published a few years after the acclaimed PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this novel paints an intimate portrait of country gentry inearly 19th century England. Describing the social milieus with which she was so familiar, Austen alternates the plot development between modest estates and the seaside resorts of Lyme and Bath. Travel aand communication proved serious obstacles, so letters and notes were the more prized and preserved. Austen weaves a tapestry of strict social customs,explaining the value of keeping up appearances, of keeping one's place--which was clearly deliniated by time-honored class snobbery and ritual. Other themes which are quietly included:be wary of schemers, evaluate the counsel of interfering extended famly, and do not trust superficial impressions.Narrated in the usual third person, ths intense story revolves around Anne Elliot, the middle daughter of vain but impoverished Sir Walter. The author might well have chosen to make this a first person novel, since we always know what the modestprotagonist is doing, feeling and thinking. Austen gently ridicules the struggle between vanity and financial reality, as the family's streightened circumstances obliged them to rent out their beloved Kellynch Hall and take rooms in Bath. But where to find suitable tenants for the ancestral home? Their circle includes the neighboring Musgroves, whose son married the youngest Elliot daughter. Fortunately for the marriageablegirls, their limited horizons are expandaded by the arrival of three young naval captains--one of whom Anne was forced to renounce 7 years before. She represents the first victim ofof the art of familial persuasion. Yet her heart still beats fast at the mention of his name...Austen presents many themes and events which also appear in her signature novel; she deftly reveals a woman's intimate understanding of her heroine's private torment. The social ritual between country gentry is almost ridiculous in their extreme scruples regarding proper behavior--even to their own relatives and in-laws. Austen exposes the time-honored web of duty an public behavior, even on vacation. One wonders if the women of Austen's day were taught--direclty or indirectly--to value their own &quot;nothingness,&quot; as Anne puts it. Is a teachable heart (one that can be persuaded to reason, even in violation of its natural instincts, to be admired in that society? Or in our own time? Were Austen's women true Victorian ladies or more rational creatures thanmale authors of the time generally portrayed them? Anne pounced upon the eternal argument which provoked the denouement: which of the genders is more (or less) &quot;inconstant.&quot; These and many other soul-searching issues are elucidated in this short novel (225 pages) which should be evaluated by the standards of a by-gone era. Thoughtful readers must discern for themselves which truths are valid for all times; if they prove universal, then the work is a true classic. An insightful novel which will appeal to most caring women."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This wasn't my favorite Jane Austen, but I liked the main character better than some of the others I've read, like Emma. The main character, Anne, was sympathetic, and you felt bad for her through much of the book when she was putting up with the other insufferable characters. Jane Austen's books always manage to make me very glad that I didn't live in the Victorian Era. It would have been terrible to not be able to escape the very awful relations always described in her books. The expectations of poor relations seem nearly unbearable. I wouldn't have been able to bear the types of jabs Mary aimed at Anne regularly. It makes me very glad to live in a time when a woman earning her own living is not seen as a disreputable person."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"have to admit, Jane Austen's Persuasion was just . . . pretty boring. The book mainly consists of the main character, Anne Elliot, hanging about until finally realizing that the man she really wants is a sailor whose love she turned away several years ago. Anne herself is not particularly interesting, nor are there the really fun, memorable characters like the father in Emma. The only dramatic incident in the book is one of Anne's acquaintances taking a tumble and bumping her head, but she's not really hurt and the whole incident is designed to help dispose of one of Anne's potential suitors. In six months I'll have completely forgotten what this book is about, but I will say it offers an interesting historical look at what daily life might be like in the lower-echelons of the the English gentry. It also demonstrates the high regard that Englishmen held for the navy as one of the few avenues for citizens of mundane birth to advance themselves into positions of power, wealth, and prestige.For essays, John Wiltshire's \\"Modern Interpretations\\" discusses how, although the slow-moving and even mournful Persuasion was Austen's final published novel, she was working on a \\"high-spirited satire\\" at the time of her death. Wiltshire also talks about a couple of recent filmed versions of the book. Maggie Lane's \\"Regency Life\\" has an interesting discussion on the role of the navy during the period in which Austen was writing, as well as the use of seaside resorts as places visited for both recreation and their supposed medicinal effects. Caroline Sanderson's \\"Geographical Settings\\" focusses primarily on Bath and Lyme Regis, while Josephine Ross' \\"A Modern Perspective\\" offers an interesting portrait of Jane Austen's own failed romantic pursuits and how that may have influenced her writing."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Overall, Persuasion was not bad, but I would have enjoyed it more with some plot adjustments.I felt like I was never well acquainted with the object of Anne Elliot's affection, Captain Wentworth. Although Austen described why Wentworth was such a good man, I did not participate much in Anne's love for him (although I did empathize with her feelings). There were great moments and good characters, but there could have been so much more in the relationship between Anne and Frederick Wentworth.Also, I was disappointed that the the end was summarized in narration. The climax of the story pertaining to the romance and to the foes of the family, though starting out well, ended too soon in narration rather than dramatic action."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne is the middle daughter of a snobbish and foolish lord living in Victorian England. Her mother died when she was a young teenager, and she has very little in common with her older sister or her younger sister. Anne's older sister is a carbon copy of their father, and the two of them managed to spend beyond their means, to the point that they now have to rent out their home and move someplace more affordable. Anne's younger sister has made a decent match in marriage and is now settled into a life that requires near constant attention from others, especially when one of her frequent imaginary illnesses pops up.Anne is mostly ignored by her family, and they don't know that she once had a brief attachment to a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth. A family friend, Anne's surrogate mother figure, thought Anne would be able to find someone better, and advised her to break off her commitment. Anne took the advice, which resulted in devastation both for herself and for the young man.Now, seven years later, Wentworth's sister and her husband are renting Anne's family home. When the now-Captain Wentworth visits, he and Anne find themselves thrown into the same social circle, and spend many months trying to decide if they still have the same feelings for each other that they did so long ago.I liked this story, with its insight into the amount of effort it took for Victorians to make proper matches and ensure their way of life would continue. I liked the social rankings and the elaborate rules of behavior, which must have been absolutely stifling for someone living through this time.However, I didn't identify at all with Anne as a protagonist. I understand that rules of etiquette were different in those days, and it is difficult for me to read this book without looking through a modern-day filter. However, Anne had no sense of self-value, and only seemed to see herself as important when she was being \\"useful\\" to others. It is true that her family treated her as a tool, but I couldn't see how she could see herself that way and still have been attractive to the men who vie for her attention."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm a longtime Persuasion fan, and know the novel well. I bought the Brilliance Audio edition because it's tough to find unabridged versions and I like hearing my favorite old stories aloud.The tapes are certainly sturdy for repeated library lendings, and the narrator is easy to hear and understand, but otherwise Michael Page is the wrong reader for this story! His vocal characterizations are quavery and pinched, and don't usually fit the characters--or degrade them to farce level. The music signalling the end of each cassette is distracting, jarring even.Not a great reading of Persuasion. Not even a good intro to the novel for first timers, and terrible for those of us who know the characters already."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I rate this book three stars. This is the first book from Jane Austen I have read and am not accustomed to her style of writing. I liked this book very much, don't get me wrong, but at times it dragged on, going over tons of social class and position stuff. The end is expected, but suprising at the same time. There is romance in the book, but not enough for my satisfaction. But overall this books is a good one! I would definetly buy it regardless of my personal tastes."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If (like me) you value Austen primarily for her wit, you may pass on Persuasion.Persuasion is a bit tedious. It's all mincing and moralizing, with none of the wit and good humor that make Pride and Prejudice worthwhile. Persuasion's protagonist, the wilting Anne Elliot, is a doormat for her self-involved relations, whom she not only tolerates but also excuses. Anne's blushing weakness may add to the melodrama (maybe the romance), but it also sucks all the satire out of the narrative. As a result, the reader is deprived of a richly deserved laugh at the pompous antagonists' expense. And without a good laugh, the story is hardly worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Let me start off by saying, maybe my review of this book is not fair- I have, so far, only read about 40% of it and was SO disgustingly BORED that I stopped & went on to another book.My first Jane Austen book that I read was Pride & Prejudice- I LOVED that book! I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P...; but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book. After reading so many good reviews on here, I will try to read it again- hopefully the 2nd time will be the charm- ?"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"What a surprise to find a character like Anne Elliot hiding between the pages of Persuasion. If you met Anne Elliot today, chances are you probably wouldn't remember her - but she would remember you -- so unused are we to being observed quietly and subtly. She is not a typical heroine, by modern standards, who speaks her mind freely and is a person of action. Elizabeth Bennet in Pride &amp; Prejudice comes to mind when I think of modern heroines -- outspoken and clever.What makes Anne Elliot a peculiar heroine is her ability to listen and observe -- two qualities most of us would consider rather passive. I find it interesting that at the opening of the book, Anne Elliot is described as a woman who is past the first bloom of youth and you get the sense that life is passing her by. But these qualities give Jane Austen the opportunity to capture the subtle inner workings of Anne Elliot's heart. Anne does not have beauty as a means of getting her way; the idea of having her own way to get would be unthinkable to her. So we are left to focus on her thoughts and feelings.So much in the book is left unsaid which in turn speaks volumes. It is quite delightful to find a character who is defined not only by the things they say but by the things they don't say; by what they do and the things they don't do."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoy all of Jane Austen's novels but find this one to be my favorite. It is the most thoughtful and emotional and relies less on external events than the other novels. Anne Elliot is older than all of Jane Austen's other heroines. Her maturity shows in the way she handles her family's financial problems, her reunion with Wentworth, the events at Lyme, and the final happy moment when they reconcile. The ending was fulfilling and satisfying, and all that I could have hoped for, after, literally, reading Anne's thoughts."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Mrs. Croft's statement &quot;we women don't want to be in calm waters all our lives&quot; Jane Austen and her heroine, Anne Elliott, move beyond the domestic, from the bracing sea air of Lyme, to glimpses into the seafaring adventures of the Navy brethren. This to me is the predominate appeal of Persuasion - Anne, in her approaching maturity, is reunited with her former suitor in what we may expect is a deeper, more heartfelt love, having endured separation for so many years and she has the prospect of joining him at sea. My heart leaps to see her escaping domesticity and the dull social duties as exemplified by Sir Walter and her sister Elizabeth. Of course, Austen's use of language is perfect. My favourite Austen novel. The film adaptation with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds exquisitely captures the mood and characters of this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I've just finished reading 'Persuasion' and I loved it. At first glance Anne Elliot is somewhat of a doormat; then we learn that she is the only unselfish and rational member of her family, who has been putting their needs before hers for the last eight years and is finally sick of it. I was delighted at Jane's - whoops, I mean Anne's - rebellion against her position and her coming into her own as a woman deserving of love."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers of Jane Austen's Persuasion: this has to be one of her best works. The poignancy of the emotions throughout the novel were so present, so real. The writing drew me into the story, and I could hardly put the book down. Was the language too flowery? Not at all. It was beautiful. And I was quite sorry to see the words &quot;The End.&quot;There is something to be said about a book that captures the imagination and piques the curiosity. This book is one of them."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen at her best. The novel is most brilliantly thought out and beautifully presented. With romance at the forefront Austen nevertheless apprehends the task of presenting valuable life lessons. She achieves the intensity of the most gripping works, the light-heartedness of the most comical, and the wonder of the fantastic. This novel challenges whatever good lies dormant and inspires what's honorable in you. It also warms the heart."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I found Persuasion to be the most mature of all Austen's works. The story of Anne Elliot's simple yet poignantly lost love (and final redemption)is heartfelt. The language, I think, is sophisticated and not pretentious. However, I think that most interesting aspect of this is that fact that when I read this book 20 years later, I will be able to feel its profoundity on yet another level."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's &quot;The Ugly Duckling.&quot; How does Anne Elliot deal with her &quot;faded bloom?&quot; Throughout the novel, Austen depicts a most sympathetic character, Anne Elliot, that a woman of the 1990's can readily identify with. Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self. This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots. It is a book about learning to cope and evaluating one's culture."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a fantastic novel by Jane Austen. I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \\"acceptable\\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"After reading Northanger Abbey, I decided to round out my Austen reading with Persuasion. About halfway through this book, I wasn't really thinking that it would be on the same level as the other Austen books (in my mind at least). I didn't feel anything much toward the characters or their situations. But the second half of the book changed my feelings and I grew more agitated reading it - will Anne and Captain Wentworth ever realize that they still love each other? There it was! I felt for the characters and their situations. And the letter Wentworth writes to Anne absolutely melted me. What girl wouldn't want to receive a letter like that!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth were happily in love and ready to be married - until Anne's friend Lady Russel persuades her that Captain Wentworth, a poor man in the army, is not the man for her. Eight years later, however, society brings them together again. Anne still loves him, and she must divulge if he still loves her, a hard task considering all the lovely young women who would do anything to marry the handsome and now wealthy Captain. Persuasion is a story filled with jealousy and uncertainty, as well as passion, simple joy, and a powerful, unconditional love.Persuasion is my third Austen novel (the first being Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility); I loved it. It kept me up late at night - midnight and later. I finished it in four days, which is a record for me as I do not read classics very quickly.In one word, I would say this is a simple book, in the best sense. It is written well and the way the events of the story are played out build the characters' personalities, their way of living. The story progresses in just a way that mirrors Anne's feelings for Wentworth... In the beginning, there is no word of a Captain Wentworth, and Anne's life is happy. At least, on the outside. As everything falls into place, however, Anne becomes more and more unnerved and unable to conceal her love, the love she's had all along. The tension between the Captain and Anne Elliot was substantial and realistic. I was very impressed and am every excited to read and re-read all of Austen's wonderful novels. They're sitting on my shelf...waiting!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Ms. Austen writes a fantastic story for the most part. The gossip was a little much at times. And the stereotypical situations and feelings were accurate even if a little annoying. The story flowed fairly well. I was impressed with keeping all the different characters and traits separate. Just a lot going on and different story lines. I was impressed with how much was in the book and everything was wrapped up neatly. Some things hadn't happened yet but you knew what was going to happen.I truly felt for Anne. She was trying to follow the influence of a friend since her mother was dead. I understand but she finally had to figure out for herself what was right and stick to it. Things seemed to go better now that she was older. Family and friends didn't fight things for her so much. Of her family members I loved her older sister Mary the best. She had her moments where she would get \\"sick\\" or get frustrated with her husband for making plans when plans were already made. But she had to learn to speak up as well. The women just kind of sat back and did nothing sometimes.All in all, I enjoyed the book. The drama was a little bit overwhelming but I had to find out how it ended. I wanted to know if Anne and Fredrick would end up together. I could see how things would all play out or at least how I hoped it would end up. Ms. Austen is an amazing author and I cannot wait to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the story of second chances. After eight years, Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot find each other after a forced separation. The illustrations are beautiful, but not all of them were included in this particular edition, which is why this is four-star and not five."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As with the other books from Jane Austen I find them to be charming and witty. Again, I found nothing wrong with the format of this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved.

The title for this review comes from the letter that was written out by the hero. I LOVED THE LETTER, the most sensual love letter that I have ever read.Not even one kiss in this book, but while reading it, it is like you would take a deep breath and hold it until the end. Beautiful choice of words keeps your mind of state mesmerized. I loved the way that author wrote about every feeling or thought the heroine had in a presence of a man that she loved for so many years. Also, how she was in apprehension of an every meeting with him and weighting every word that he has said. The climax in the book was when he handed her the letter to pour his feelings buried inside for her. What a beautiful letter! The writer also has a great way to describe human nature. The writer grabs you with rich words.But the book is full of making acquaintances which was a bit too much for me in this book.

Austen does meander through relationships well in order to sustain the reader's interest."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I confess: I was expecting a lot more from Persuasion. The premise of the book is interesting: it is the story of twenty-seven year old Anne Elliot. Eight years earlier, she rejected Frederick Wentworth, choosing her duty to her family over her love for him. Now, he's back again as a successful navy officer, and Anne thinks this might be their second chance. But he's courting the Musgrove sisters, and seems determined to ignore her.It all sounds very interesting, and Persuasion is definitely one of Jane Austen's more serious works, but the writing lacked something. It wasn't that witty or that interesting in the end. Maybe if I reread it a little later, I'll like it better, but it just didn't draw me in like Pride and Prejudice, and eventually, Emma. I couldn't really relate to Anne like I did to Elizabeth Bennet or Catherine Morland from Northanger Abbey. There wasn't enough of Wentworth. The background history was kind of vague. I'm sorry to be critical of anything of Jane Austen's, but this one just didn't work for me.Becky loved it, so I have to come a to a reluctant conclusion: We really don't have similar opinions on books. Books that I love she doesn't review, books that she loves I don't enjoy as much (generally.) Books that she reviews unfavorably I like. It's kind of sad.Back to Persuasion. As I said, it's a much more serious work; it's not necessarily about young love and flirtation. Anne is still fairly pretty, but she has to face the fact that if she doesn't marry soon, she'll be an old maid. There was a lot less snappy dialogue, and overall, I think it's just an inferior book. I do look forward to reading For Darkness Shows the Stars, a science fiction retelling of it (review coming soon.)All of my reviews can be read at my blog [...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Love the story and the writer. A must read for Austen fans and all lovers of good love stories and classics."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know why this is considered a classic. The language used. Contemporary novels will never be written like this. It is like reading from an artists eyes. The way sentences are written is very different to the way they are written now. A lot of thought went into each [sentence] or rather Jane Austin is so gifted it comes second nature.Now for the book summary and highlights. It was tough to get into. About the sixth chapter is starts getting interesting. Often you put down a book if the first chapter fails to capture the imagination, but with a 'classic' you need a little patience and endurance. It is worth the wait.This review is after reading the classics of War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, the Art of War, Moby Dick, Andre Norton's Saragasso Series, Charles Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie, Confucius' Sayings, Common Sense by Thmas Paine, and Treasure Island (to give this context). You see I did not enjoy reading when I was young, but now older and with a 1.25 hour commute on the train (to Brisbane from Gold Coast) and back, I have time !Compared to Charles Dickens, it is an easier read. Charles' book was a tougher read and more complex but it did go into Persuasion but moreso into the realm of manipulation. If you enjopy Persuasion, you should read Dickens' book. Mind you Dickens' book is an even tougher read - I re-read the first seven chapters 3 times ! but it is definitely worth it. Like digging for gold - you struggle a lot, but when you find the gold it is like WOW !Anne Elliott is somewhat ignored by her family (Father Sir Walter and Sister Elizabeth). Her mother passes and their finances are in disarray. Miss Russell a confidant of Sir Walter contrives a scheme to boost their cashflow while moving them elsewhere with little impact to their social-life. Anne who is steadfast and reasonable and even tempered throughout the story demonstrates that not everyone can be manipulated and if you are even-tempered and reasonable, nothing will escape your obsveration.She comes across Mr Worthington (admiral) and initially she hopes to marry him, then the persuausive schemes start and you know throughout the whole book, I'm looking for acts of Persuasion to give this book meaning and the answer is found in the last chapter and Jane Austin neatly ties the story into a happy ending. Through acts behind the seen a third party is after Anne's affections and this person works in concert with other key characters until Anne bumps into an old friend Mrs Smith and the whole scheme is turned on its head !In truth, the major drama surrounds louisa who falls while being silly and nearly kills herself, but the way it is written that part seems trivial and it is used to free certain people and allow certain things to swing in motion. If only Mr Elliot was there sooner and saved Louisa.... There's a thought, then this story may have gone a differnet direction. Read this and see if this review makes any sense at all !?!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is the book a lot of people can relate to, including myself. A story of letting \\"The One\\" get away and the miracle of second chances. The title may not have been her choice (brother Henry named the book after her death), but this is all Austen. It shows how both society and greed for money can be very persuasive.The father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a selfish man who falls prey to extravagants. The widow with three daughters becomes indebted. He is influenced to rent out their home and stay at Bath. He is influenced by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay (a greedy widow of slight lower class to the Elliots). Lady Russell is a friend of the Elliots and godmother to Ann. The Lady is the cause to the way Anne Eliot (at age 18) loses her true love, Frederick Wentworth. Lady Russell finds this was erroneous for persuading Anne's decision.At the age of 27, Anne Elliot is classified as spinster. Her two very selfish and arrogant sisters have both been indifferent towards their middle sister Anne. Anne has let everyone control her in every way. In my opinion, I can understand Frederick's hesitation towards rekindling his love to Anne.The novel is a favorite of mine. It is shorter than all of Jane's novels and the storyline more simple, but it's still a great love story. I agree that it is like a Cinderella story. I sincerely recommend this."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"So happy to have this on my Kindle!! Would recommend it to all Jane Austen lovers.

Persuasion was the only work of Jane Austen's that I had not read in high school. I don't know why it took me until 32 years of age to decide to read it, but I finally did, and loved it so much! It is immediately familiar in the sense that you can sense it as a work of Austen's, but has some slight differences. Anne is less spunky & for some a less immediate heroine. There is certainly less dialogue between characters as compared to Austen's other works. I feel that these things represent maturity & sophistication in her writing that add much depth.

I have read most of Jane Austen's book and this one certainly did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It feels a bit silly to write a review of one of Jane Austen's last published and perhaps lesser known novels. Anyone looking at Persuasion has certainly read Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, and has a good idea what to expect. But I'd like to get a few impressions down.Persuasion focuses on Anne Elliot, middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot and the only person in her family who isn't completely proud and self absorbed. In her youth, Anne was persuaded to break off a relationship with a naval officer that her family felt was beneath her station. Eight years later her former beau, Captain Wentworth, is thrown back into her life, much to her discomfort. She is forced to navigate a passel of family issues and potential suitors in order to find a happy match.There are all the usual elements you can expect in an Austen novel. It is a wry, incisive look at the foibles of human nature; in this case, a contrast between those who value a person purely on their birth or station, versus those who look to personality and character. It has various changes of scenery, from the Elliots' traditional home of Kellynch, to the seaside town of Lyme, to Bath, and draws in a host of well drawn characters. The plot is relationship centered, with one good crisis to drive things forward, and, as I've come to expect, much of it hinges on misunderstanding or deception by characters that aren't all they appear to be on the surface.I liked the book, but I can't say I liked it as much as Austen's more popular novels. Elsewhere she seems to have written even her foolish characters with a sympathetic hand; we laugh at them, perhaps we pity them, but nowhere else to they come off as so one-sidedly unpleasant as in Anne's father and sisters. And, by contrast, Anne is almost the perfect heroine from the start, with little room to grow and few mistakes to learn from. I'm happy I finally read Persuasion--it was the one Austen novel I hadn't read--but it's not the first one I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is about second chances.

Great casting throughout."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion , . . . . Jane AustenA number of reviewers complained of serious issues with the printing of this book. Fortunately for me, I experienced no such problems.Jane Austen was an excellent author and Persuasion is a superb example of her work. It is a classic novel of England at that time period (1818). It is a complicated story of romance greatly affected by the class system. There is a bit of good ol' dry English humor as a member of the upper class is forced to take a step down and still manages to keep his nose in the air. Then there's a love tale of the past that just might flame up again. Of course there has to be a villain in such novels and the one here does a fairly good job of being secretly nasty."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels.

The story took place in the 19th century in Kellynch hall. Anne and Captain Wentworth was in love. Anne's father didn't wanted Anne to married to Captain Wentworth because of the social class. Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returned having made his name and fortune with the British Navy, and its now his turn to reject her. Anne still love Captain Wentworth but her father persuaded her not to married the man of not having good money. The three main characters of Persuasion is Anne Elliot, Captain Wentworth, and Sir Walter Elliot. The theme was Social mobility. Sir Walter objects to letting the house to an admiral because the navy offends his two most valued traits.Persuasion is for teenagers to adults type of audience. The romance go toward older people. This is a type of book for people who are mature. People who are older would love this book more than a younger person because the book is a classical book. Persuasion was a very appealing book. The was very awkward. They should change the ending because it sound crazy. They should made it sound like they got married instead of them engaged. It was a good book because it show how someone was persuaded to not married someone. Anne was in the world because the person she love , she couldn't get married to him. The story shows how much trails they had to go through to get together. Persuasion is considered to be a classic because it show how people got married in the 19th Century. The 19th Century romance was beautiful. It is also considered a classic because they married their cousins a lot in this story, they didn't mind if they married their cousin. Now these days, that crazy to married your cousin. I really recommend this book to people who like to read literature. So I believed that adults should read this more because they would be interested in it. I also recommend for people who love to read books. I rate this book \\"Persuasion\\" a three star becuause the ending was not good, they should change the ending. Everything else was about the book was good."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award. Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19. Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I found the book to be a slow read primarily because the use of the English language is so different."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When I saw Masterpiece Theater was doing a series on Jane Austen and her novels, I decided to read them in the order the shows would air--starting with Persuasion. It was the first and last of Austen's that I will read. She may well have captured the mores and social rules of the time, but she didn't create characters I could really care about. I stuck with it to the end and found the revelations about Mr. Elliot to come out of nowhere and the ending romance to be something we could see coming from the very start. I'll take Edith Wharton over Austen any day."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a fan of Jane Austen's work, but this is definitely not her best novel.

Henry Link, a New York City psychologist, presents Jesus Christ as the perfectly adjusted extrovert personality. Although originally an agnostic, Henry Link found himself more and more using the teachings and example of Jesus in his psychological counseling.

Job burnout rates in professional sales is very high, as a result, the loss of employee talent, experience, and the consequent expenditures for rehiring and re-training replacements is a corrosively expensive drain on the corporate bottom line -- not to mention the emotional toll burnout represents in devastating so many men and women in their careers as sales professionals.

Gardening is a perfect example of planning, preparation, nurturing, maintaining and reaping rewards that can be directly applied to so many aspects of life from personal growth, parenting, starting a business, customer service & relationships and so much more. So when I ran across this book that was actually printed several years ago (2004), I just had to see what it was all about. SPROUT!: Everything I Need to Know About Sales I learned From My Garden, by Alan Vengel and Greg Wright use the gardening metaphor once again in how it can be applied to sales success.The book is presented as an allegory. Marsha Malloy is a medical supply sales rep that has had several successful years only to reach a stage of burnout in her career. Just when she needed it most, she happened into her favorite garden center to find it under new management. Upon meeting the new manager, she learns the new proprietor, Bob Rawlins, known to his friends as \\"Gardener\\", is also a retired medical sales rep. She also learns that each Saturday morning, Gardener holds an impromptu sales training meeting with several of his friends and customers.In these sales meetings, Gardener teaches his gardening metaphor of sales and mentors his subjects in how to apply their gardening knowledge into their sales careers. In short order, Marsha applies the gardening principles to her work and soon turns her stagnant career around.The book is a very pleasant read. I think the authors could have more deeply developed the gardening metaphor, but there is still good information here, and the premise opens up the mind to how to apply the gardening metaphor to other aspects of life and business. Every few pages you will find a pull quotes referred to as \\"sales seeds\\".I recommend this book to anyone as the gardening metaphor can be applied to so many things, but if you have a love for and understanding of growing a garden, this is a \\"must read\\".

It will go into good depth in most areas. If you're in Vision Research, it is not enough, you will need more specialized books and journals (i.e. Machine Vision, Vision Research, Eye Movements). The format reminds me of the journal format for Nature Reviews Neuroscience. You better believe I am going to keep it in my library. The weakness of this set of books is that it does not cover Machine Vision, robotics, electronics, new technologies in vision, and it does not have an experimental methods section.

At least one should meet the needs of the discriminating shopper. With so many consumers selecting the standard vanilla or chocolate fare, some of the more esoteric flavours fade from view. Ehrman seeks to bring some of the unusual or even obsolete versions of Christianity back into view. From the \\"orthodox\\" perspective , of course, many of these will seem distasteful, even bizarre. As he notes, from the now-available sources, the other \\"versions\\" should be granted equal weight with what has become \\"traditional\\". Certainly, the other writings on Jesus' teachings are no less plausible than what is currently believed by many.In relating this captivating account of \\"lost\\" Christianities, Ehrman stacks a variety of writings against those he deems \\"proto-orthodox\\". The proto-orthodox are those who laid down a foundation later adopted by the Roman Empire as \\"official\\". Among the proto-orthodox writings is condemnation of the alternative \\"Christianities\\". These include the Gnostics, made more recently famous by the books found at Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945, and the \\"Gospels\\" of such figures as Peter, Thecla and a reputed twin brother of Jesus himself. The greatest departure from today's \\"orthodox\\" [if anything as diverse as modern Christianity can have such] are the docetists, who deny that Jesus had a corporeal state. As he concedes, the docetists in effect, thereby refute the notion of Jesus dying for the benefit of the rest of us.Ehrman's running theme is that Christianity, indeed the history of the entire planet, might have taken a drastically different tack had one or more of these Christianities been granted greater impact on what people believed. The issue of \\"anti-semitism\\", which initiated Christianity, might have been vastly reduced down one path, or even more horribly intense on another. As the author notes, \\"Christianity\\" itself might have devolved into merely another Jewish sect had the voices he presents not been quelled by the victory of the proto-orthodox. He reminds us, also, that even when the proto-orthodox came to dominate, early writers attacking \\"heretics\\" were themselves condemned as inadequately focussed on which Christianity was the \\"correct\\" one.The author uses the term \\"forgery\\" in a heavy-handed manner, even while acknowledging in theological writings that the term isn't absolute. A \\"forgery\\" can be anything from a document intended to deceive to a writer adopting a name as a means of veneration for a particular scholarly position. A plethora of \\"Peters\\", \\"Pauls\\" and \\"Johns\\" must be sorted out over time and place to derive which is the \\"original\\". None are, of course, since even the earliest writings known are copies of copies of copies . . . Ehrman is at some pains to show how errors creep in even with the most dedicated scribe doing the work. The passage of time makes things yet more confusing for modern students. With the history and interpretations of nearly four dozen \\"gospels\\" covered in this volume, it's clear that Ehrman has undertaken an immense task. This book is a companion volume to his \\"Lost Scriptures\\", which provides the foundation for this undertaking.\\"Orthodox\\" Christians [whoever those might be] in the Western world have relied on the \\"Synoptic Gospels\\" - although even these are presented in the wrong order - given in the King James Version. How did these, and the remaining books in the New Testament, come to be chosen as the foundation for Roman Christianity? In part, says Ehrman, because of the wide range of beliefs allowed by other Authorities. Gnosticism, which has gained some active adherents - \\"in California\\" says Ehrman pointedly - lacked \\"definition\\" due to its wide diversity. Part of that diversity was resistance to a hierarchical church structure. Gnosticism, an early form of religious egalitarianism, was suspect in the view of imperial government. Although Athanasius had decreed the present Synoptic Gospels were the \\"official\\" texts of Christianity, this declaration wasn't given church sanction for another seventy years.Ehrman has provided us with one of the most comprehensive views of early Christianity available. It is a strongly researched effort and presented in easy, conversational style. He poses questions any follower of one of the many Christianities should ask themselves. Read it in confidence that your outlook, even if non-theist, will be challenged.

Not necessarily a bad thing, depending on your taste and/or mood, I suppose. I thought I would love it overall, being a huge fan of classic rock, and of reading... But for the most part, it seemed the stories were just too \\"out there\\"! The one I found most entertaining and interesting was Pearlywhite (about some street kids and their spirit--or perhaps imaginary--guides), by Mark Laidlaw and John Shirley. But this also became increasingly weird, even freaky, as it progressed. The excerpt from Liverpool Fantasy, by Larry Kirwan, was also pretty interesting. It makes one wonder how any given decision can change life's (or lives') course(s).

I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Carved in Rock: Short Stories by Musicians","review":"A collection of short stories written by musicians seems like a great idea in concept, but things haven't turned out so well after the words hit the page. The best submissions here are, unsurprisingly, from those musicians who also have distinguished and credible writing careers&#8211; most notably Jim Carroll, Greg Kihn (also the editor here), Richard Hell, and Mick Farren. There are also a few other rockers here who can really write and may have an acclaimed side career in the making, including Wayne Kramer, Pete Townshend, and Steve Earle. But otherwise, the majority of the stories here feel like indulgences from bored musicians experimenting with a writing hobby, and who should probably stick to the music. None of the stories are especially unlikable (except maybe the dippy pseudo-religious yawner from Ray Manzarek), but you won&#8217;t exactly find any of them mindblowing either, and that gives this book a pretty indifferent impression overall. But there are still a couple of pleasant surprises from the hobbyists &#8211; my favorite being the fun and unselfconscious little story from Joan Jett, who assures us that not even vampires can defeat the spirit of rock n' roll. More tales like that would have made this book a more enjoyable collection of rockin' literature.

Lucado and Thielicke are completely different. Here's a typical excerpt from Thielicke, on the parable in Luke 18:9-14:\\"Many of us are less like the Pharisee, with his uplifted head and his solid moral character, than we are like the publican--but a somewhat different publican from the one described in the parable. Perhaps like a publican who says, \\"I thank Thee, God, that I am not so proud as this Pharisee; I am an extortioner, unjust, and an adulterer. That's the way human beings are, and that's what I am, but at least I admit it, and therefore I am a little bit better than the rest of the breed. I commit fornication twice a week, and at most ten percent of what I own comes from honest work. I am an honest man, O God, because I don't kid myself, I don't have any illusions about myself.

Jason falls from space in to Veronica Lake, right next to the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant. Some of the nanos from Jason X that helped rebuild him are stuck in his remains, namely his mask, and using the nuclear material being dripped off from the power plant, they rebuild him. He then goes on to slaughter a good portion of the Three Mile Island staff, and a few protesters leaving Lynn and Rena Sofira, are two most interesting characters, alive. Then Jason is frozen and shipped off to an underground lab, and the real story starts... kind of.Let's start with this books strengths. It is very well written, with some very witty and fun humor. There are scenes where characters end up naked, when they shouldn't be, but it works in the context of the story, and brings in a bit of the camp from the movie series that normally would have been lost otherwise. One such scene is early on in the book where Rena, to get Jason's attention, removes her shirt, and ends up being chased down by the enraged monster. Stuff like that helps the book from sinking away to far from the series. Also, some of the characters are interesting, most notably Lynn and Rena. There are also some decent gory killings early on, but sadly those are abandoned for the second half (the main part) of the novel.Now for the weaker parts. I won't say bad, because they work, but not in a series that is connected with Friday the 13th. For starters, there are WAY to many characters. This would be okay if they were equally focused on, but the sheer number of them make it impossible, and instead we are left with a lot of loose ends that never get tied up, and if the ending tells me anything, they never will be. Also, the slasher element is absent after the first hundred or so pages, and doesn't show up again until, maybe, page 390. When it does show up, it has almost no effect on the actual story, and really just works to help tie up the ending. Also, the interesting characters, such as the two mentioned before, as well as a few other characters that come in later, are ignored for the most part, with the attention given to characters who really hold no real significance to the story. This book is not short, clocking in at 410 pages, and could easily have been chopped down a good deal. Hopefully Black Flame gets a better editor for the next book.The writing itself is very well done. The characters are interesting for the most part, and the book is never really slow, but it never really has a point. It also feels like the first half (the first hundred pages) is horribly short changed. The massacre at Three Mile Island should have been a book itself, with more attention payed to suspense, but instead the interesting part, the actual massacre, is rushed through. The author does this again with the lab segment once the action starts. It's disappointing to a degree because the set ups are actually interesting, and could have worked very well in a slasher medium. Instead she opted for big action, lots of guns, and mass death. It really ends up hurting the book in the long run, because the tension, and the action never build up to much. Hopefully she gets a better hang on this in the third book (Jason X being the first). But only time will tell. Still, I will continue to read the series, mainly because it is just that, readable, but still a bit raw."},{"Title":"Jason X #2: The Experiment","review":"A Jason X book series. That sounded a little edgy at first, but I guess New Line Cinema will do just about anything they can to make money. Despite myself and the fact that I thought turning the concept into a book series was completely stupid, I bought the book at it took me about five days to read all the way through. I was mildly surprised, but I came to find that the whole thing was just like reading a long, weird science fiction soap opera, with a little military action, some gunfire, and guest starring our own anti-life anti-hero, Jason Voorhees. I won't ruin anything about the book for you, but I will tell you that way too much time is spent describing some characters that are completely ignored throughout throughout the rest of the novel, which was an example of either bad story construction or just bad editing. All in all, \\"Jason X: The Experiment\\" was a good read, but nothing to get excited about, and it made the author look a little bit like a Stephen King wannabe. Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Jason X #2: The Experiment","review":"Well, to start off, I thought this was a good sequel to Jason X, with the rebuilt Uberjason being captured by scientists in the future and experimented on by a government wanting a supersoldier, until Jason gets loose and all hell starts breaking loose again. The potential for a good old-fashioned slasher was quite present, though the sci-fi angle was interesting too, as the scientists tried to understand the merging of machine and flesh now present in Jason, which is apparently supposed to be impossible. But then, Jason's always had a knack for pulling off the impossible, hasn't he?Unfortunately, the part that made it hard for me to make it through this book was the rather excessive amount of detail of each and every character and object in the background, which is why I'm only giving it four stars, because the sheer amount of detail sometimes made it hard to continue.This is something I've come to expect with certain authors, but when the action finally begins, and the blood-bath begins, I found myself making the same surprised noises as when I watch Jason's movies, so while slow at times, I did enjoy the book. If you're a Jason fan, and you enjoyed Jason X, as I did, then by all means, read this sequel."},{"Title":"Jason X #2: The Experiment","review":"When I first found this novel in a local bookstore, I was pretty excited. I'm a fan of horror movies, and I took a particular shine to the movie Jason X (being a sci-fi fan as well). I knew that Jason X was a critical failure, however, and had little hope of the story going any farther than the one movie. Needless to say, the discovery of the book was a pleasant surprise; I bought it immediately and read it within two weeks.I think it only fair to point out that \\"The Experiment\\" is almost nothing like the movie it continues off of. Whereas Jason X was filled with plenty of interesting science fiction bits, \\"The Experiment\\" features almost nothing until the end, and at times I felt that it could just as easily taken place in the present. Though this isn't a major gripe, it still took something away from the book.My bigger complaint, however, is the sheer excess of the book. \\"The Experiment\\" is over 400 pages, and yet the majority of this is focussed on introducing characters that were either inconsequential or, at worst, extremely boring, and then forcing us to wade through their personal stories until, at the end, they are either killed (which I was immensely glad about, at times) or left dangling, their fates left up in the air. Sure, another book is forthcoming, but the ending still seems too sudden, and the epilogue makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.All in all, I'd say that \\"The Experiment\\" is a decent book, but too little Jason and too many other people puts a damper on a good concept. 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Jason X #2: The Experiment","review":"I loved this new adventure about Uber-jason (the new jason Voorhees from Jason X movie). It's very well written and the story is interesting. I liked the cooperation between Jason and the nano-ants. If u loved the movie u'll love this one too, if not it's a good opportunity to re-considering the Jason x Franchise ( at least on novel)."},{"Title":"Jason X #2: The Experiment","review":"JASON X 2: THIS TIME IT'S PERSONAL. This is the best book of our generation. If you thought that seeing Jason hack and slash his way through some zero gravity jackasses in the movie was awesome (and if you didn't then you're more than likely a huge pussy) then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!!!!! This book is best read on the toilet because it will LITERALLY SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU. Jason is a grade A murderer with no remorse for his victims. Uber Jason however is a ruthless slaughtering machine who destroys every single thing that could possibly give anyone pleasure. The only downside to this book was that since there were no pictures it was very hard to masturbate to, but I made it work. Also I never received my copy of this book in the mail."},{"Title":"Jason X #2: The Experiment","review":"Being a bit of a fanboy when it comes to Friday the 13th and Jason Voorhees, I pick up this book along with the novelization of \\"Jason X\\". I liked Jason X as it stuck to the movie and then added plausible backgrounds to the characters. \\"Jason X: The Experiment\\" falls far short of being a good addition to the franchise.The author spends the majority of the book introducing characters with backgrounds and lagging on and on with nothing very interesting happening. Sure there's a nutjob that is trying to clone Jason for a super-soldier program in the future setting on Earth II, but the characters are more annoying than anything. Now I will admit that there stands to be no chance of a plot in a series about Jason Voorhees, I'll also admit that I picked these up because every once in a while I need to read a mindless brain jelly book. I did expect more than this though.I feel the biggest problem in the book is that it's part of the new Jason X series but Jason is barely even in the book. His regeneration is dealt with in the beginning, he whacks a couple eco-terrorists, and then he's a statue for the majority of the book, barely getting any mention throughout the body of the book. He then finally gets some action in the last 75 pages, if that. Here we have a case of someone wanting to write a sci-fi story and is authorized to use an established copyrighted character and then the franchise player is barely used in the book.Plain and simple, if you're going to write a book about Jason Voorhees, you need to use him throughout the book, not as an intro piece and a poor conclusion wrap up. It's not a bad story, mind you, just a bad use of the character. To be honest, people will buy this book because we want to see Jason in slaughter mode, high body count, and inventive ways he offs his victims. I appreciate the effort, but if writing about Jason, then write about Jason not a pile of characters that serve little purpose."},{"Title":"Nonmonotonic Reasoning","review":"The book covers all aspects of default reasoning, nonmonotonic reasoning , autoepistemic logic and circumscription in sufficient details. A little background of first order predicate logic is adequate to read this rich and valuable text.I offer it to our graduate program on nonmonotonic reasoning at ETCE department, Jadavpur University, Calcutta.

The photographs in this book are sharper, more luminous and of a better variety than any other Kertesz book I've seen. The text blurbs that accompany each photograph (in addition to the excellent bio at the front) are informative and sophistocated, going well beyond the usual spartan location/date/f-stop infomation that many other monographs offer.

I especially like his street scenes, which capture everyday people. His many photos of Paris life in the 1920s and 30s remind me of the writings of Henry Miller (see, for example, Miller's \\"Tropic of Cancer\\").Some memorable images: a young boy in Paris holding a delicate-looking puppy; a wandering violinist on a street in Hungary; a snowy view of Washington Square; a grubby old man urinating on a street in Paris; a portrait of an imperious Colette. There are some witty captures, particularly one delightful shot of umbrella-wielding pedestrians on a Tokyo street.

His father raised his hand. The knife came down. John rolled away, down the white, descending street, screaming: 'Father! Father!'\\"The father seems to symbolize both John's father and God who is invoked by each character as an overpowering presence who must by appeased, despite uncertainty as to what his wishes are. John's vision seems to be a way of reaching an understanding of his father and his relationship with him.[...]"},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Like others have mentioned, this book was over-written and the prose was too lyrical. Some of the descriptive passages and religious mumbo-jumbo were very tiring to get through, and it stalled the little action the novel did have. And in the end, there was a lot Baldwin set up in terms of plot that was left wide open. Especially The Letter (when you read this you'll know what I mean). Why did Baldwin dedicate so much character dialogue to the letter, leading readers to believe the revelation of it would resolve the story, then end things before it was revealed??? WAS it even revealed?This could've easily been a novella, and a good one, if he had revised the manuscript better."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"James Baldwin's &quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot; depicts the story of a young preacher's son who struggles with religious meaning in his life. Discerning between his own beliefs and what everyone around him expects becomes an internal battle for him. Interpreted through a rather slower plot-with several series of abrupt flashbacks and drawn-out paragraphs-you often find the story hard to follow. For example, in the period of time the book covers, which elapses in a single day, you get in-depth looks into the complete life-stories of three individual characters. Moreover, Baldwin's descriptive writing tends to inform you of more details than you want or need to know. However, in the midst of such confusion you are able to hear Baldwin's voice protrude. He clearly understands the people he portrays, and I'll give him that. So, if you are searching for a book with a confusing plot, little action or dialogue, and abrupt scene changes, you've got it. But to the rest of the readers in this world, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I find it humorous to read all of these reviews and decided to add my tid bit of info. I find Baldwins work in Go Tell It on the Mountain totally directed toward the Christian. Unless you have a superior understanding of his literature, this book is frankly boring."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I wanted to dislike this book. James Baldwin is anathema to me--but this book--as a work of art, as an example of human effort--is outstanding.Not at first, though. The exordium is tedious and boring, and I was flipping pages with alacrity, saying to myself: \\"AHA! Overrated! And I know why.\\" But once the narrative sea-legs get set with the history of Gabriel Grimes, the novel becomes special. You can tell Baldwin read almost every book in his local library, and that he had uncommon talent at organizing words, piecing sentences together, and constructing something greater than the sum of its parts.The heavy emphasis on religion would normally be an impediment to my enjoyment of any work, but here, though it did get old, it did not vitiate the flow. God played an important role in young Baldwin's life, and the book reflects those years.The MLA has decreed to the unwashed masses that Go Tell It On The Mountain is the thirty-ninth best novel of the 20th century. That places it ahead of superior works such as Pale Fire, Of Human Bondage, and Lord of the Flies (to name only three), but also behind inferior works such as To The Lighthouse and the Studs Lonigan Trilogy.No matter the placement, this is a significant book that deserves to be read on its own merits."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Go Tell it on the MountainIf you would like a book to read that really, hit the topics on family relationships, deals with prejudices and leadership. The book Got Tell it on the Mountain can be the book for you. This book hits these matters perfect. Lexon, the main character, is an African American that is very strong with his family, by stepping in and taking care of his younger siblings and watching over his parents. With the racism going on in the book, it seems like most people in this situation that Lexon was in will just take the misbehaving actions, but he stepped up and took a stand. This surprised me being the reader because Lexon seemed like he was a shy person in the beginning of the text. By him taking a stand, change his whole outlook of the character that I though was before as I was reading.Go Tell it on the Mountain , if truth be told is a excellent paperback because I bet everyone at one point in there life had deal with a least one of theses issues in there life at one moment at another as there journey of growing up as a child to a teen. The great thing about this book is that it is not a black only or white only book; this book has no gender or race with it, just because it the topics of going against African Americans. I enjoyed the book because I noticed this about on how open it was and emotional.This text touched me in a special way because I was going through similar responsibilities as Lexon.

The book revolves around several different individual plots that are hard to follow. The characters are confusing, and there is no division between the present and the past. The whole time, I felt a negativity towards Christianity (even though I am a Christian). Also, I was shocked by the amount of sexual material in a book focused on Christianity in the African American Church. It is weird to be reading about breasts in the same book where a lot of the plot takes place in a church.Hypocrisy is a major theme. John, the main character, sees this hypocrisy in the church and has a very negative view of the church. Suddenly, all his hesitancy towards the faith is wiped clean during his conversion. I have a hard time understanding how he could change, even though everyone around him is still the same (except his \\"father\\", who seems to get worse).

This book is divided into three parts instead of chapters. In the three sections, there are 221 pages. It has small font but it isn't too small to the point where you can't read it. It has a reasonable amount of words per page and a reasonable amount of pages per section. The book is about a fourteen-year-old boy who is trying to figure out what he wants to be when he becomes an adult. In general, it talks a lot about what teenagers think about and what goes on in some people's lives. I personally think that this is a good book. It has all the qualities of a masterpiece. There are some parts where it might get a little confusing because of the way they go back and forth. There are many flashbacks throughout the book. The flashbacks are the parts you really want to pay attention to. They might confuse you at first but sooner or later you start to understand what is going on as long as you pay attention. The only way you will understand is if you stay focused on the book. If you don't then you will be really confused and then will get frustrated along with the confusion you already have. This is why it is crucial for you to stay focused the whole time while reading.

I become less interested when the point of view shifts. An interesting bridge between the Modernist tradition and the African-American style of story-telling (montage of multi-generational, tangentally-related voices and plots) that Morrison embodies. The spiritual crisis that is so important to Baldwin does not capture me."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"When this book was published I was early in my career as a Pentecostal preacher. Baldwin's desctiption of the religious fervor, the \\"tarrying\\" meetings was sensitive and clear. It took such a person to reveal so much about himself and the selt-deprecation (or self-flagellation). This was a significant part of the lives of those--both black and white--who were taught to despise self to gain the greater approval and glory of God.This book, especially, was a major turning point in the attitude of those who did not know or care about the \\"holiness people,\\" the pentecostal, the poor black, or even the acceptance of one whose gender choice was of the same sex.I would recommend that everyone find a copy before they become out-of-date printings.

I don't remember what I thought about it then, though I remember it leaving an impression. The writing then and moreso now is writing at its best from a master in my opinion. Yes it is complex, convoluted, disturbing at times but for me it flowed. Not everyone can write fire and brimstone, sin and redemption in literary terms. I am in awe of his genius.During one night at a prayer service, four individuals stories are told. John, on this day has just turned fourteen years old and is trying to make sense of his life. Gentle, intelligent, he wanted so much to please the man who he thought of as his father. He had potential to expand his life beyond the limitations in front of him. Gabriel, wretched, tortured soul, a man who refused to take responsibility for his actions. Saved, sanctified and fill with the Holy Ghost, his mistreatment of his first wife, Deborah, his discard lover, Esther, his present wife Elizabeth and his son John is what kept him from being the minister that he was in his youth before he fell from grace. Elizabeth, proud and determined, she wanted John to have the same love from Gabriel that he gave to his other \\"natural\\" sons. A woman who accepted her circumstances; she has lost her first true love, Richard and was resigned to accepting Gabriel's hand in marriage to redeem her sin. Florence, too proud for her own good Bitter, resentful of her brother Gabriel and now perhaps facing death, she has lived a live of unfulfilled dreams.Where we they all stand after they haved poured their hearts and souls on the alter? Secrets, dreams, hopes are revealed. Told in a language of complexity full of allegories, symbolism, Bible similies, it is no wonder it is taught in universities around the country.

I found it one of the strongest and most powerful books I have read it a long time, with language that was exalted, and often hymn-like in its quality.Concerning the book, then, I would like to suggest a couple of things to readers and to those who suggest books for others to read:1)Don't read this book unless you know your Bible well, particularly the King James version. Without this as your base, I would guess that you'd find the language incredibly dense, and most of Baldwin's allusive power will blow past you.2)Don't read this book unless you have some experience in life. Again, I would think that the way Baldwin is able to put deep inner struggles and the feelings that rise from hard experience into words will remain lost to you unless you've had some hard experience of your own.3) If you're not African American, a little pre-reading into the Black experience in America might be helpful first, looking into particularly the Great Migration, the Azusa street revival, and the rise of the storefront church.4) Practice reading the book out loud!!

Except for John's mother Elizabeth, the adult Grimeses have no idea that love, familial love, is supposed to include favor (not favoritism like the father Gabriel's), the idea of blessing each other with good words, good will, and heartfelt affection. Unfortunately, the novel's Black Christians' idea of goodness and holiness is colored by the master's idea of a good slave: docile, acquiescent, submissive, silent in the face of abuse, always needing to prove your worth. \\"Blessed Assurance\\" isn't one of their songs.\\"Go Tell\\" presents not only the story of John's 14th birthday, but the past stories of Elizabeth, Gabriel, and Aunt Florence. Whereas Gabriel's spiritual journey--if you can call it that--at about age 21 is born of desperation and remorse after much self-abuse and self-indulgence, John's spiritual journey on his 14th birthday is one of insight and refuge after much abuse and neglect. Gabriel indulges and denies his dark side, projecting his evil onto others. John wonders over his own evil thoughts, seeking to reconcile his light and dark sides.John's family and people have been cursed by the white-oriented world, and by a false interpretation of the scripture, namely the curse of Noah upon Canaan. Believing this curse, Gabriel in turn, without meaning to, curses his children. Will any of the Grimes family truly experience being, like Israel, heirs to the promises of God, as well as heirs to the world's persecution and heartache?John perceives that Gabriel, or some unacknowledged dark part of Gabriel, would rather see him damned than saved, would rather keep John as a bastard child, \\"son of the slave woman\\", as someone to look down upon--similar to the cutting attitude that Gabriel and his sister Florence have toward each other. However, John, born in New York City, a generation removed from Jim Crow, just might become the first person in his family to start to throw off the reproach of Egypt (see Joshua 5:9)--that is, of slavery. That is, if his anger and hatred don't overtake him first.\\"Go Tell\\" is an excellent exploration of how the \\"Black church\\" has both upheld and held back African-Americans through slavery, Jim Crow, the Northern migration, and racism."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"First I want to say. I really don't understand how anyone with enough intelligence to load this site and write a review (and it doesn't take much) could speak so critically about such a powerful book. I can't even dismiss two of the reviews as complaints of illiterate teenagers. How can anyone ignore the universal theme of the book, the human condition. The entrapment of an individual inside personal, ethnic, religious, racial, and/or ancestral bonds. As for the &quot;boringness&quot; of the book, it seems to me that any one could appreciate this book, it is jsut as captivating as any thriller. John's struggle with his own identity as a person, a &quot;saint&quot;, and African-American, is captivating. Yes we all go through the same type of self-discovery, but no one captures, in such eloquent wording, the angst of such a revelation. In response to the critique of Baldwin's writing style. I can see how some people might not be able to have patience for his elongated sentences, and biblical references. And if you are too frustrated to make it through the entire book, I think I might understand...but please don't downgrade what you have read.

John Grimes has just turned fourteen and his family expects him to become a preacher like his father Gabriel. However, John realizes that he has reservations about this profession, partially due to a mutual lack of respect and love for his father. After a turbulent scene in which his younger brother Roy (the name is significant, referring to a ghost in Gabriel's past) has been brutally injured in a knife fight, John and his family attend a Saturday night service at the storefront church where his father is a deacon.The night's passionate prayers evoke flashbacks to the personal histories of the adults in John's family, depicting the events that brought them to Harlem from their respective towns in the South and the development of their attitudes towards religion and love. John's Aunt Florence, Gabriel's older sister, fled from her ailing mother and drunken, disorderly brother and came North to seek better opportunities, only to end up in an unhappy marriage with a man who turned out to be not much different from her brother. Gabriel cleaned up his life after his mother died, became a preacher, and married an older woman who was sympathetic and supportive to him during his troubled times, although he strayed in one fateful instance, for which Florence still harbors resentment towards him. John's mother Elizabeth originally came to Harlem with her boyfriend in a doomed affair, and later she and Gabriel got married after he became a widower.Although John is the central character, the novel focuses more on the lives of Gabriel, Elizabeth, and Florence, and how their respective backgrounds shaped John's physical upbringing and spiritual development. Generally, it is a statement on religion as an important influence on the American black experience. And it is a brilliant example of style: The structure is unique and effective, the prose is beautifully eloquent in its symbolism and imagery, and the dialogue is sharply realistic and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"In many ways, \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" is an act of exorcism, wrestling with the demons of an adolescent past. Baldwin's first novel examines his love-hate relationship with the religious traditions from his youth, tackles (albeit indirectly) his conflicted and nascent homosexuality, and (above all) struggles with his ambiguous feelings about his true-life stepfather, whom he detested while he was an adolescent and whom he tried to understand when he was an adult.The narrative unfolds in a single 24-hour period (sunrise to sunrise), although flashbacks are scattered throughout to explore the backgrounds of the characters and, in particular, to describe their past wrongdoings. The opening and closing sections describe 14-year-old John Grimes and follow his family as they prepare for and then depart from a religious service. The middle core of the novel, consisting of three chapters, takes place in the neighborhood storefront church on Saturday night, a spiritual oasis in a cesspool of back-alley crime and lowlife iniquity.These three chapters are the prayerful meditations of, respectively, John's no-nonsense aunt Florence, whose act of liberation from unappreciated familial duties early in life led her to the \\"freedom\\" of Harlem; his abusive father Gabriel, who lived a life of easy debauchery until he converted and became a Baptist minister; and John's mother Elizabeth, who is quiet and forbearing and who is beginning to comprehend the extent to which Gabriel has not lived up to the bargain of their marriage. Hovering in the background of this quarrelsome family is Elisha, a young leader at the church, to whom John is attracted both spiritually and, to John's vexation, physically (\\"in his heart, yearning tenderness for holy Elisha; desire, sharp and awful as a knife, to usurp the body of Elisha\\").There's always the temptation to read too much biography in an autobiographical novel. Although the characters and events in \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" are surely shrouded in a mask of fiction (for example, it does not appear that Baldwin ever knew learned the identity of his biological father), there are just as surely parallels with Baldwin's own life and family. His stepfather was also a Baptist minister whose animosity towards the young Baldwin was especially pronounced. As a teenager, Baldwin also underwent an intense religious awakening and became a minister for a Pentecostal assembly in Harlem. And, of course, Baldwin rather famously wrestled with his own sexuality. When the novel was initially published, he tried to downplay its autobiographical elements, but, reflecting on the novel three decades later, Baldwin admitted that it \\"comes out of the tension between a particular father and a particular son. No matter that he was not my biological father.\\"The only passages I thought cumbersome were those that detailed the sermons preached by Gabriel as he began his ministry as a young man. (The problem with such literary representations is that the best evangelical sermons depend largely on performance, delivery, and audience response--largely to mask the fact that they are inherently formulaic and often studded with cliches, repetition, and all-too-familiar biblical allusions.) Otherwise, the novel is very tightly written and emotionally raw, and it dynamically presents the paradox of human transgressions and moral rectitude, the complexity of a genuine conversion experience, and the ambiguity that remains in its immediate aftermath."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"James Baldwin created a masterful first novel in Go Tell It On The Mountain. I loved his smooth flow from character to character, era to era, place to place. We are given young John's story through his family, one person at a time, and it is through them that we understand the complexity of where he is. Physically, it's Harlem, as the son of Southern parents who have seen only hard times in both the South and the North. Emotionally, John is bouncing back and forth between a life of religious fanaticism and a life of unbound freedom.Religion is a central force in the book, especially the disappointment and shame of sin. The hypocrite stepfather Gabriel is the darkest force, and the author's knack for showing the complexity of this character and the harm he exacts on so many other lives is perhaps the crowning achievement of the novel. Gabriel's may not be the ugliest or rarest of sins, but they completely devastate his life and the lives of those around him. Gabriel doesn't learn though and he might be regressing all the way back to the debauchery of his own youth. In hints throughout the story and at the end especially, we see John discovering the courage to escape the hypocracy and injustice of his upbringing, and to create for himself a new life of opportunity and promise. It isn't a long book, and I think it was meant to leave you wanting more. But in it's structure and incredible language, this is a very unique and powerful novel that deserves more recognition."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I am truly apalled at some of the reviews and interpretations of what Baldwin was trying to convey in this book. Honestly, and truthfully, this has to be one of the best books ever written by anyone of any race in any country. I've read Dostoevsky (whom I love), Tolstoy, Dickens, Hughes, Walker and many other writers of different nationalities and talents and Baldwin ranks among the most important writers of this century. One of the things that I think people fail to realize (it took some time for me, too), is the purpose of a book. In my opinion, books are not only meant to entertain (some are, but most important books are not), but to give the person reading the book a perspective of someone else's life and experience, and also to allow the reader the opportunity (the responsibility) to apply or interpret what they've read to some how apply to their own lives. We must be always introspective when we are reading something and think of our lives and society and how and people do the things that they do. Any good book will reflect that and ultimately make some things clearer to us and make us have to think that much more about other things that are not.Baldwin gives an excellent (I cannot think of another superlative)insight into the lives of these people. Not just their lives, though, but how they think and why they think the things they do, how their thoughts give way to their actions and how their actions give way to the consequences that made (make) their lives what they were. I am inspired by that.If you are a shallow thinker and only want to be entertained, and can only see that what is only in front of you, then I can imagine you would find Baldwin (or any other) great, thought-provoking writer boring (it almost hurt my hand to type that word in the same sentence as Baldwin). So, we must move ourselves outside our boxes, and see more than just what we know of ourselves.I'm also sorry to say, O. Wilder, you have it all mixed up, you need to read this story again, to see what it's really saying. I'm not even going to address some of the other ridiculous reviews of this book.I read this book a long time ago (I was 16) and thought it great, but without quite knowing why. I'm 27 now and I realize it for the great work that it is because of what it made me feel inside."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"For me, the central problem of James Baldwin's beautiful and poetic account of growing up in a religious, African American family is the ending. The question is this: does Baldwin take this ending to be merely a description of what sometimes happens or is he implying this is what should happen?Throughout the novel, religion is seen as a force that stagnates, lies to and weakens the characters. However, by the end, it has become a force that the main character thinks will help him get through all the trials he still must face. It hasn't solved anything. In fact, nothing has been solved at all. We've been merely given a view of all that's come before and how those past events will probably shape the future. For example, John still has to face his unloving step-father - even though he is still unaware that the man isn't his biological father. How knowing he was \\"saved\\" will help him is hard to imagine.The most heart-breaking incident in the book is what happens to John's real father. Though pathos abounds in this book, that is the incident that truly hurts the most.Throughout, the writing is poetic and precise. Baldwin certainly matured in works like \\"Giovanni's Room\\" and developed his themes of homosexuality - a thread hinted at here but left unresolved like all the book's themes.The problem is just that we're left with so much unfinished. It's almost like Baldwin stopped writing the book in the middle. It seems he wants the import of John's religious experience to make everything else at least bearable. However, how this is to be accomplished in light of such darkness is hard to imagine or even if something else might be more desirable. Moreover, is Baldwin suggesting that all the negatives of religion he has been cataloguing throughout the book are somehow justified?In any case, \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" is a gorgeous book about very ugly things. Good luck sorting out that ending."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I stumbled upon this book a few years ago and was amazed at how great it was. While Richard Wright's &quot;Native Son&quot; and Ralph Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man&quot; appear to receive most of the attention as the best novels by black authors during the mid-twentieth century, I still think Baldwin's achievement in &quot;Go Tell It On the Mountain&quot; was a lot more important and long-lasting. I think this is chiefly because his aims appeared to be different, focusing more on the less dramatic ways that blacks have attempted to cope with the frustrations arising out of American Racism as well as the limitations it placed on their prospects for a fulfilling life. It is far more difficult it seems to me, to convey how the vast majority of blacks in those days sublimated their rage and pain through a more acceptable venue like the Black church, rather than illustrate how that very same rage and pain explodes in acts of violence (Native Son) or political agitation (Invisible Man). Perhaps Baldwin's novel receives less acclaim than these other two because it's more of a challenge to read, more difficult to connect with on a visceral level, because it aims at bottom not so much to entertain as to enlighten. I thought it was an absolutely first-rate piece of fiction, and it's method of flowing back and forth in time between one generation and another give it a certain unconventional, experimental quality that was rare for it's era."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"James Baldwin's first novel, \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\" (1953) is set primarily in a storefront African American Pentecostal church in Harlem in 1935. While the book explores the role of religion in African American life, its portrayal of religion is broader. The book also offers a portrayal of race relations in the United States, both North and South, through the first half of the 20th Century. The novel has an autobiographical component and is in part a coming of age story.The book focuses on young John Grimes. who has just turned 14 when the story begins, and on his family. Besides John, the primary characters are Gabriel, a deacon at the Temple of Fire Baptized and formerly a fiery southern preacher, Elizabeth, John's mother, and Florence, Gabriel's sister and thus John's aunt. Each of these three people spent their early years in the South and ultimately found themselves in Harlem as part of the Great Migration. There are a host of other important characters in the book, including several other children of Gabriel and Elizabeth and Elisha, 17, a preacher at the Temple of Fire Baptized and John's friend, to whom John appears to have an attraction.The book is in three parts. The first part \\"The Seventh Day\\" critically sets the stage for the book. It takes place in the Grimes' poor apartment on John's birthday as his younger brother, Roy, comes home with a stab wound. As the story unfolds, it develops that Gabriel had an earlier son, Royal, who died young from a stabbing in the throat. The family life is harsh and tense and filled with seething. After a scene of violence in which Gabriel strikes his wife, the scene shifts to the Temple of Fire Baptized for the Saturday evening service. It is the expressed wish of the family that John, a quiet, small, intelligent boy will find God and be saved.Part two of the book, \\"The Prayers of the Saints\\" is the heart of the novel. The \\"Saints\\" are Gabriel, Florence, and Elizabeth. As they pray that Saturday evening, their minds are filled with flashbacks of their earlier lives and relationships to each other. They grew up against a backdrop of racism, but there is much more to each of their stories.Each of the three carry heavy burdens, and none more so that the preacher, Gabriel. Their stories are vividly told and poignant.In the final part of the book, \\"The Threshing Floor\\", John has his epiphany and salvation experience. This experience is ambiguous in character and the reader is left in skepticism about whether one would wish for such an experience or rely upon it if it happened. Baldwin describes it vividly. In a sleeting March early morning following John's conversion experience, family tensions again rise to the fore, especially in the continued angry and hateful relationship between John and Gabriel.Baldwin writes with great detail in examining places, North and South, and character. The sentences are long and filled with extensive adjectives, repetition, and force. The book is replete with Biblical allusions. The narrative voice is in formal, correct American English. In the passages of dialogue, Baldwin captures the rhythmic, colloquial capture of African American speech of his time.The novel takes a complicated view of religion. As a young man, Baldwin himself left the church where he had been an adolescent minister and never again professed adherence to any organized religion. Much the book portrays religion as sexually repressive, superstitious, and hypocritical. There is a suggestion as well that the African American churches discouraged their adherents from addressing the woeful discrimination against them. Yet there is a sense of mysticism and wonder in this book and of piety beyond the formalities.I read this novel in a book group that focuses on works written by black people, in the United States and throughout the world. It took a long time for me to find this book. \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\" is widely regarded as an American classic, and so it is. It deserves the accolades it has received and more.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"When first reading \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\", the names places and time element where somewhat perplexing, but once the characters were identified the book was hard to put down.

Dell Publishing.ISBN: 0-440-33007-6James Baldwin's, Go Tell It On The Mountain, tells the story of two generations of an African-American family who began their migration from the south to the northern city of Harlem beginning in 1900. John, the 14-year old stepson of Gabriel Grimes, begins our journey as an up and coming preacher on his 14th birthday, March of 1935. Walking that night with his family to the storefront church in Harlem, the story jogs backward to the previous generation's struggles migrating north to escape the oppressions both outside and inside the family--finding its way back to the storefront church to witness John's cathartic awakening. Each family member has his or her own riveting story of the past, yet each is interdependent and leads back to young John's awakening. John, a young black man in 1930's Harlem must deal with a religious zealot of a step-father, a community of poverty and violence; yet he finds hope in this insular black community in America which preached the self-worth and intelligence of the black for the first time.

There are hidden parts of ourselves that are never revealed, even to those closest to us. Many of the characters in Baldwin's \\"Go tell it on the mountain\\" have similar secrets that are revealed only to the readers, as we gain insight into their innermost thoughts.The setting is Harlem, New York. The story opens with John, a young boy of fourteen who is at that age of great confusion in his life. He has a wild brother Roy, who is always getting in trouble, and eventually ends up getting stabbed. He has an abusive, self righteous father, Gabriel, a kind mother, Elizabeth, a boisterous aunt, Florence, and a spiritual role model named Elisha.John wanders the city in the first part of the novel, trying to come to grips with what he wants in life and who he wants to be. His family is very religious, and soon after his brother Roy is stabbed, they end up at their church one night. John, his mother, his father, Elisha, his aunt and two other sisters join together in prayer and worship. During this praising the book shifts focus first to Florence, who is deep in prayer and meditation, and we are carried back into her past. We learn of her failed marriage, her rocky relationship with her mother, and her inside hatred of her brother, which is John' father Gabriel. After we hear her thoughts and her story, the direction shifts focus to John's father, Gabriel. Gabriel ponders on his destructive life. In the early stages of his life Gabriel was deeply involved in sin until one day he is \\"born again\\" and becomes a preacher. We learn about how he marries a woman he does not love, commits adultery, and eventually remarries John's mother. All through this process of his flashbacks we learn the cruel hypocrite that he really is. The focus next shifts to John's mother, Elizabeth. We learn of her sorrow and heartbreak in dealing with the murder of John's real father. We learn of the struggle of her to live with her husband Gabriel, and his rejection of John. Gabriel gives John the title \\"bastard son\\", and cannot accept him.The story ends with a climax just as it began, as we are inside the head of John. As the praying and singing is going on, he is overtaken with emotion. He battles his inclination towards evil, and good tries desperately to enter into his hard heart. The final sequence is a poetic, magical scene of words. John conquers the battle inside of him in a desperate attempt to become \\"born again.\\"I love this book; it is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. The language is beautiful, Baldwin has masterful storytelling prose; he has great influence and power as an American writer. I never read a book that can deal with so many issues like slaver, racism, and abuse without being heavy handed, or ever staying from the powerful theme of the novel.I can't say enough about \\"Go tell it on the mountain.\\" It does everything right, and it does everything well. It is a flawless novel in every single aspect. Emotional, poetic, breathtaking, heartbreaking, vivid use of metaphors and language. The most powerful element in this novel is the human element. We care about the characters struggles, their victories, and their character. It is about real life, and the time period is described perfectly. I was never bored, always moved, and constantly in awe during the entire reading experience. Colossal in its vision, yet simple and unflinching in it's message. Brutally honest and never contrived into doing anything that deviates from the central core of the novel.

Published in 1953, it tells the story of a fourteen year old boy, John Grimes. Part One, &quot;The Seventh Day&quot;, makes it known how John fights to bring into existence his self-identity while facing many obstacles. Keeping with societal times, one of the obstacles that Baldwin has John face is that of racism. It is the racism that John feels is keeping him from gaining all that society has to offer. In addition to facing obstacles outside of his home, he also is faced with familial problems. John is the son of Elizabeth and stepson of Gabriel. His biological father, Richard, committed suicide due to ridicule by white policemen. After Richard's death, Elizabeth slowly fell in love with Gabriel, a superficial, religious man, and the two of them parented three children. As an outsider of the &quot;family&quot;, John must try harder to fight the isolation he's feeling to become a part of the family. Because of Gabriel's beliefs, he felt that John was doomed or cursed and would not accept John for who he was.&quot;The Prayer of The Saints&quot;, Part Two of the novel, tells the stories of Florence, Gabriel, and Elizabeth; people all significant in John's life. Interspersed with stories of their pasts, each of these three are vital to John's development as they pray for his salvation. Florence's prayer centers around the anger she feels being a woman in a family dominated by men as well as the anger associated with racism. Although Florence became a very religious women deep in prayer, initially, she could not find any comfort in religion. Gabriel, a man anointed by God to preach first married Deborah, a young woman who was barren, was overtaken by the flesh while talking to a co-worker, Esther. Although he felt guilty and tried to repent for his sin, the conceived child died. After becoming a widower, Gabriel married Elizabeth and promised to provide a good family atmosphere for her and John. As time went by, Gabriel fell short of his promise, and although he and John attempted to work through their differences, they were both overcome by feelings of unworthiness. Although, long Part Two is well written and creative in the sense that the other saints are mentioned in someone else's prayer.Part Three, &quot;The Threshing Room Floor&quot; tells us how John receives the Holy Ghost, something he has been searching for, and is found in the middle of the &quot;threshing&quot; floor surrounded by saints. The reader is left wonder if, now saved, will John be accepted by Gabriel. Also, Baldwin used an excellent play on words by naming the church &quot;Temple of Fire Baptized&quot; because it is water or the blood of the lamb that baptizes and saves people from sin, not the fires often seen in hell.Although the book well-written, it was at times difficult to focus. This book is recommended to an avid reader, but not to one who is looking for &quot;a first novel to read&quot;.

This book really shows the irony in how when people try to live right, there always will be that person to throw all the wrong you ever done in your face. Read this intriging page turning book to really understand what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this. The deeper I got the more repugnant was the religiosity to me. I sent it back to the library and got another book. I was turned off by the fundamtalist's belief system. Which is the base for this and something that I find completely wrong headed and evil. Misses the whole point of Jesus' ministry."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Have you ever read a book you know would be great, if the sentences weren't so long and drawn-out? And you try to read it, but it is just too descriptive? Go Tell It On the Mountain, by James Baldwin, is exactly that book for me.The story is about a young boy, John, and his family growing up in Harlem. Or at least that is supposed to be the plot. But in reality, not even half of the book takes place in Harlem. Each person in Go Tell It On the Mountain had their own mini-plot. Usually, mini-plots are a useful tool for writing a book. But to be useful, the plots must first, all fit together.When reading this book I was continually confused by the way the author jumped in and out of flashbacks. Characters during these flashbacks are not explained the way they should be. Baldwin takes a little too much time using big words, and not enough time introducing new characters.If you are interested in reading this book, I would suggest to do so. While reading this novel, you may learn how not to use flashbacks, how to make sentences as long as a paragraph, and how to over-use large words. I warn you, have your dictionary ready."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Many students might or might not enjoy this text. I personally did not enjoy reading this book as much as I would have had wanted to. Go Tell It on a Mountain is a book that allows us to know how a person grew up spiritually with the Christian God. If as a reader, you enjoy reading about coming of age in a Christian home this may be an appropriate book for you. This book allows you to be exposed to God in a Christian manner and the people who praise him. Having the opportunity to read this novel will be fun and exciting for you. Therefore, your experience while reading this book will be exciting and interesting. The main foundation of this book is spirituality, \\"... lay his life in the altar and rise up, praising God,\\" is one of the many examples of God being mentioned. In this societies' point of view God is real and he is the higher law. What we see is on of the members of this society not sharing the same opinion. Many people like my self might not enjoy religion for religion to be part of their educational enrichment in school. If you as an individual become distracted, dull, or simply uninterested in literature with the religion topic addressed please do not consider this book as part of your summer reading choices. You will end up hurting yourself because on e of the goals for summer reading is to enjoy yourself with educated reading. I for the most part did not feel excited while reading and writing responses for this book. In addition, if you have problems with reading elevated books Go Tell It on a Mountain may be suitable for you. It is not a difficult book to read, because the vocabulary is not elevated. As a reader, I prefer books with a high vocabulary. When I was reading I was not challenged and that added to my discontent with this novel. One thing that might help with reading if having problems with understanding the text is to write notes to the side or on post it notes. I myself wrote notes when it came to a point that I had to create reading responses. Writing notes helped me, because when I needed to write the reading responses I could simply refer to my notes and not be confused about how I concluded or were I obtained some observations or information. If reading this book I recommend discussing it with a friend of someone else to make stronger connections to the text. Go Tell It on a Mountain is an interesting book in its own way. There\`s a picture in the cover that shows an event in the book. I is nice to have a picture to look back at when trying to imagine one of the scenes described in the book It may be even of great help to read the critics reviews on the back to have an idea of what kind of book it is and how it may be to your help or interest."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Go Tell It On The Mountain is a very bold book. In an era when \\"Ebonics\\" had not been coined yet, when being black was not every white kids style, James Baldwin stayed so true to the African-American colloquialism. James Baldwin has written with complete truthfulness and self-questioning this parable of finding yourself, finding your belief, finding your God. Are these even different things, or is it one? It is this honesty which keeps you engrossed. Whether you'll end up loving this book or not probably depends on your personal equation with the Supreme Being, but what you will definitely admire and carry forward is his honesty, honesty about the lives of African-Americans, honesty which is also echoed in the language.Go Tell It On the Mountain is a biblical story of a youth dealing with his personal demons with regards to religion at an age where sin has not manifested itself in any form whatsoever in him. John finds himself in the difficult position of questioning his faith. John's mental turmoil in separating the men of god from god itself and paving a religious path for himself is very touching. This mirroring of thoughts which are timeless in nature, pulls you into the story. You find yourself questioning along with John, praying along with his mother Elizabeth and feeling betrayed by his father Gabriel.James Baldwin delves into each characters personal quest to achieve a place next to God. He frankly describes the African-American homes, the depth to which they are influenced by Christianity. So much so that at times you find it disconcerting. The two-facedness, the fake righteousness of the sanctified men makes you cringe with discomfort, followed by skepticism. Which is why, when John ends up being saved, I felt deceived. What brings about John's confirmation to the faith? Is it the hope to be freed from suffering that is passed on to him from generations? Is it to assuage the curiously skirted guilt of homosexuality? Could it have to do with the evangelist nature of African-American church services, where the charged up atmosphere, the childhood influences, the trance-like energy which may make one forget all inhibitions, insecurities and embrace that which is core to one and all, an eagerness to believe.That this is a story of a different era is not to be forgotten. The depth to which James Baldwin writes about the African-American psyche, their hope in being freed from their suffering, their expectant belief in their faith, gives you reason to half-heartedly agree to the biblical end to the story.This book, makes me curious of the role that guilt, fear and a hope for change, plays in bringing people closer to their god. Yes, signs of a true skeptic, but maybe in one of my trance-like states caused by certain unmentionable substances that might change and make me a believer.[...]."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I am a 10th grader and was required to read this story for English. Although Mr. Baldwin used vivid imigery, it was extremely hard to follow, and seemed to skip around in time a lot. Also, this book was centered to much on Religion, nad not the characters. For anybody who is looking for a easy read this book is not a very good choice. To understand this book, it would be helpful to take your time while reading it and take notes on what you have read."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"One of the side events of the 2008 American presidential elections, the one that resulted in the election of the first black president, was the widespread exposure of the role of the black church as a central social, political and religious institution in the black community, for good or evil. That centrality, the subject matter of black writer James Baldwin's first novel back in the early 1950s and from there carried back by him to his youth in the 1930s, is longstanding. Moreover, the black church and its activist clergy, despite it long role as adhesive, healer, protector and face of the black community is not an unambiguous legacy as Baldwin, very wickedly, and profoundly demonstrates here.Baldwin uses the old tried and true novelistic devise of using a two-tier plot structure to delve into the lives, the loves, the likes and lies of two generations of a black family, a family that although it found itself in the North, in the black metropolis of Harlem, had deep and continuing roots in the old worn-out land of the South that most of the characters fled, willingly or unwillingly, at some point. The first tier discusses the present status of most of the main figures, including the transparently autobiographical John and his \\"father\\", Gabriel, a born-again Christian preacher, a character not unknown in the black community. The second takes place through personal recollections in a store front, primitive Christian church, also not an unknown phenomenon in the black community, or the white one for that matter.The details of the various relationships of the very mixed clan can best be appreciated by the reader. What I would note here, as I have noted elsewhere when discussing James Baldwin's work, is his ear for the various voices of the black community even though he himself seemed, by the facts of his biography to have been fairly removed from the mainstream of the black community. He clearly knows \\"religion\\" and the role it plays in the community. Also of the teutonic struggle between the old ways of the de jure segregated South and the de facto segregated North. While I am more devoted to the works of Langston Hughes as an exemplar of black literary blues, James too knows that condition. James can sing those chords. And the late Norman Mailer was not wrong when he noted that his contemporary, Baldwin, in 1950s America was \\"one of our few writers\\". I will say amen to that."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Sometimes, when you finish a book, you look up and take a deep breath and say, \\"Wow.\\" This is one such novel.The descriptive and intricate prose is woven so tightly and consciously that Baldwin amazingly delivers prose masterfully without having to use complex language - this book will never send you to the dictionary. Some courtier designers need fine fabric to make quality attire. This designer can take rags and sew them into gowns with only his sewing skills - Baldwin is an artist of words.Overlapping the life stories of John's mother (Elizabeth) and stepfather (Gabriel), together with Gabriel's alienated sister (Florence) against the backdrop of John's 14th birthday, reveals to us the soul and character of the individuals and how their torments and incredible journeys affect and play upon John's coming-of-age manhood rite - which in this case is an out-of-body experience/revelation to the Lord before the congregation at Gabriel's church.John's 14th birthday will and should never be forgotten by he or the congregation. And, we readers, who are delivered into the secret realms of the tortured pasts of Elizabeth, Gabriel and Florence, can better appreciate and, in turn, should better remember the moment the young John emerges as a man.In the end, as a less-than-religious person, I asked myself whether Baldwin's constant references to the Bible (the story of Noah and Ham plays a large part in the end in contrast to the tortured relationship between Gabriel and John) and religious revival experience of John are meant to employ others to follow their lead, or to dispel their self-proclaimed truths because of the contradictions between religion and the religious which we have been permitted to learn about in Gabriel and others. But, I would have to conclude that Baldwin leaves that decision to you - but allows you to make the decision knowingly or after having learned about how what Gabriel preaches is not synonymous with what Gabriel lives.I would give this 6 stars if I could. Few books have touched me as much as this book has."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"It definitly helps to do some bible pre-reading before reading this book. I was assigned to it for class and never would have read it otherwise. However, the ending made the rest of the book worthwhile. The main character, John, finds God. I did some research on James Baldwin and found that this book is largely autobiographical. I think the author may have actually experienced a &quot;calling to God&quot; as John did, because it was wrote so incredibly well that you could imagine and feel John's feelings as if you were feeling them yourself. Many parts were religious tangents that didn't grab my attention, but for the most part, the book gave me an incredible inspirational feeling."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I recently had to read this book for my college African-American lit. class. I didn't think at first that I would be able to relate to the work (being a white boy from the rural South), but I found a wonderful truth in this novel. The overall message about religion and hypocricy was universal. Baldwin is a wonderful author and now I can't wait to read some of his other works."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Go Tell it on the Mountain is a wonderful book about self-discovery and familial &amp; religious duty. The characters in this novel are wonderfully full: flawed, but hopeful. I disagree with anyone who feels that an extensive knowledge of the Bible is required to appreciate or enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Identity and societal roles are integral to &quot;Go Tell it on the Mountain&quot; - and interpreting it is certainly an uphill struggle.... John's quest for identity pervades this Baldwin novel, as he is faced with the dichotomy of choosing the evangelistic religion of his despised father or the street vice of his brother Roy. Baldwin explores his own biographical experience in the notion of the illegitimate child, a feature that pervades the text and many characters (his father abandons his child, Royal, and John himself is without a father). The absence of paternal love reflects Baldwin's own life and illustrates an isolation within John which can only be resolved on the threshing floor. Contrary to many opinions on this novel, it does not condemn religion, but endorse a deep, personal religious conviction that soars above the harsh evangelism of &quot;The saints&quot;. John is able to find his identity through a final resolution with and conversion to religion, which exorcises his fear of his father and enables him to discover a future in the church. The roles for women must also be considered. Baldwin places them in certain roles - first seen in Harlem as whores or &quot;Saints&quot;. This polarisation blurs however, upon meeting Deborah and Elizabeth, who experience isolation because of their sexual condition: Deborah is raped and left barren by whites, and Elizabeth is left pregnant as her true love, Richard, dies from the scars of white abuse. As such, we can see that these womens' intended roles, as a mother and wife respectively, are scuppered by white attack. Similar to this is the abuse of black women in the pseudo slave narrative of Janie's grandmother in &quot;Their Eyes were Watching God&quot;, and the narrative of Baby Suggs in Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot;. Not to ignore his own race's deficiencies, Baldwin also shows a repression of women within the black community, as Deborah is shunned by blacks, and the women are segregated in church. Baldwin's novel is certainly not easy reading - it conveys the ultimate struggle: that of the search for one's own self."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"This was my second reading of James Baldwin's initial novel, first read 40 some years ago, and it rang even more powerful the second time around. Baldwin is the essential chronicler of the Black American experience, in all its anguish. The novel was first published in 1953, and was primarily set in mid-Depression Harlem, with flashbacks to the rural southern antecedents of the main characters, reaching all the way back to the days of slavery. It was Florence, who must have been approaching 60, whose mother was a slave and who \\"lost two children to the auction block.\\" Baldwin only briefly sketches Florence's mother, but this slender fact seemed to explain so much of the tragic and often dysfunctional family life of the descendents of those families which had been forcibly broken up.Religion is a major theme in the novel; that particular raucous, tambourine shaking, speaking-in-tongues spirituality espoused in store-front churches that set out the folding chairs before the service. It sure does help to know the Bible to understand many of the references. If I found any weakness in the novel, and perhaps it is a personal weakness instead, it was the lengthy passages of pure \\"preachin'\\", but I persevered, knowing that it really did give the flavor of an authentic experience. Baldwin depicts a world of good and evil, with the church as the vehicle to salvation, but he is also relentless in describing the hypocritical lives of the preachers, especially Gabriel, who \\"falls\\" and falls again. Although the church is featured as the one solid bedrock that can help anchor family life, I agree with another reviewer who points out that the anchor impeded Black economic development by promising the otherworldliness of \\"pie in the sky,\\" which distracted the believers from taking actions that would remedy the injustices that society imposed, as the legacy of slavery lingered.The novel unfolds around John, the 14 year old son of Elizabeth, who is married to Gabriel. Florence is Gabriel's older sister. In part I of the book, the stage is set; all the characters are introduced, and the drama centers around the knifing of John's younger brother, Roy. In this section we learn that John is illegitimate, and that Gabriel loves his own son, Roy, more, and has pinned his hopes of salvation on him. Yet it is Roy that seems to have the \\"mark of the devil\\" on him, no doubt reflecting the same mark on his father. It is in the second part, by far the largest portion of the book, that Baldwin tells the story, each in a separate chapter, of the three principal adults: Gabriel, Florence, and Elizabeth. These portraits are dazzling, and Baldwin has immense narrative power, revealing one aspect of their lives in a sentence or two, and then several pages later explaining how this occurred. The women \\"who have born the weight of men,\\" no doubt literally and metaphorically, come off the better, and the stronger. Gabriel's hypocrisy is not as all-encompassing as, say, Elmer Gantry, for he does truly struggle with the demons within. All the characters did indeed have the steep side of the mountain to climb.There are many scenes whose depiction can take your breath away. One that I found particularly strong was a down south revival, with 20 or more preachers. The night is when the young Gabriel makes his mark as a preacher. Afterwards, the preachers partake of a banquet. They are seated separately, upstairs, the women serve them. They tell ribald jokes, and even ridicule one of their servers who had been gang-raped by whites. That woman would become Gabriel's first wife, but the insights he might have gathered from his fellow preacher's conduct did not endure.For those who have a copy of the collection of photographs entitled \\"The Family of Man,\\" it is impossible for me to look at the picture on page 129, the black woman laying on the bedcovers, the black man sitting on the edge, each in deep middle age, obviously talking about \\"their troubles,\\" without thinking that this is a picture of Gabriel and Elizabeth Grimes.Finally, in terms of foreshadowing, one wonders when Baldwin wrote this book if he anticipated his own fate. Florence's husband dies, and is buried in France, during what was once called \\"The Great War.\\". Baldwin could no longer stomach the anguish that he depicted, eventually seeking solace in France. He is buried high on the hill, at St. Paul de Vance, overlooking the Mediterranean. A wonderful 5-star plus read, especially again."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"The first time I encountered this book was on a summer reading list in middle school. The title alone was so appealing I spend the rest of English class daydreaming what it was about. I didn't get around to actually reading it for nearly 30 years. Now I wish I had read it much sooner.Not then, at the tender age of 13. The rude realities of Harlem life circa 1930 come at you right away. Never mind that the protagonist, John, is 14; I probably wouldn't have gotten very far given the novel's unsentimental look at the hard realities of life, the baseness of sex, and the shortcomings of religion.Yes, \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" is a tough book, but it's brilliant, too. Baldwin gives us the story of John, who in the course of a single day wavers between faith and doubt, love and hate, community and isolation, culminating at a \\"tarry service\\" at a Harlem storefront church where the man he calls father, Gabriel, is deacon. Gabriel is not, however, John's real father, nor is he that great an exemplar of faith, something we learn as Baldwin's narrative effortlessly takes us across time and space into the heads of John, Gabriel, and others at the tarry service, where extraordinary events are about to take place.I wasn't expecting \\"Go Tell\\" to be so good, but it is, not because Baldwin draws on big themes so much as the visceral way he presents them, every emotion raw. John's enormous self-doubt is the fulcrum upon which the rest of the novel turns; looking at himself in the mirror, he wants to know \\"whether his face was ugly or not\\".It's a story about growing up black and poor in a racist society, but it's more about the stuff of life, a universal tale about growing up. Gabriel is a tough man, but when we get inside his head we discover a more complicated story, about a man who tries to stand up for his faith but keeps being undone by his baser passions. His religiosity, an easy target for many readers, only serves to cloak his essential stubbornness.For a first novel, \\"Go Tell\\" is amazingly accomplished. Baldwin moves effortlessly back and forth in time, like Faulkner, yet you feel completely connected to reality throughout. His narrative has the moment-by-moment feeling of Joyce, but without the ephemera. He finds the core of every character he lights upon, which he reveals with such studied gradualness he sweeps you along with every soap-opera-ish development.Baldwin's 1953 novel seems a proclamation of his life's calling. John is not presented as a fledging writer, but his truth-seeking, and truth-finding, is one any committed person of letters can relate to. At the end of the book, when the sun lights upon John's forehead and affixes a \\"seal ineffaceable forever\\", it is the writer's call he is discovering.Baldwin says this was the book that made his career possible; I sense many others could say the same. It's a book with a lot of gas in the tank. Like I said, I only wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"If you are a reader of fluff literature only, then GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN will not appeal to you at all. This book marks a journey, and not just a journey for its main character, 14-year-old John Grimes. It is also a journey for the author. Baldwin said before he could write anything else, he had to write GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN. The Odyssey that John Grimes embarks on towards manhood, towards his religious development, and yes, towards his own sexuality, is mirrored very succinctly within the life of Baldwin. Anyone who reads this as purely a religious conversion is missing the point. In my opinion, this novel is less about John's discovery of God, and more about his discovery of himself."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"My mother and I read this book together. It was very hard for us to read because it was so tedious. The characters in the book seemed to seek a relationship with God. However, their relationships with God were not joyous, but more almost painful. I think that religion oppressed them. They also had many tensions: -black man versus black man -black man versus white man -man versus woman -sinner versus the saved -inner-self tensionThey sought a relationship with God to relieve themselves of this oppression and tension. Songs, which played a major part of the worship service, gave them temporary relief from oppression, but it was nothing more than temporary. John was almost relieved of oppresion when he went to hell and back in the end. However, just walks right back into his house, a harbor for oppression.One of the reasons it was so frustrating to read was because, like the characters, you became oppressed with all that emotional buildup. There were little bits of relief for the reader, but then it just all started over again. It was like a Greek tragedy- with catharsis, except the final huge emotional release never happened. John was like the hero with a fatal flaw and the tragic fate. Also, the book was filled with intense run on sentences full of modifiers that made it hard to read. Then it skipped back and forth vey unevenly from generation to generation.You should read it just for the experience. Some of the characters are very interesting.I have heard that Giovanni's Room is much better."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"First of all, after reading the other reviews I was surprised to find a touch of ignorance in namely peter32574 from Nevada and Drofwarc Mail from Washington. It seems that ole Peter likes to use big words, mainly to seem 'intelligent', implying that Baldwin's writing is not. While Mail likes to assume that the book was terrible. I doubt that Mr. Mail has ever read anything of importance, and if you think that Baldwin is hard to read, pick up some Nietzche and then we'll talk. To the point, Baldwin uses his choice of words in this book ever so effectively. He brings about his own spiritual experience in an interesting light, fusing the racial problem of the time, to the spiritual problem in his soul. It is Baldwins poetical writing that seems to warrant my interest though. His unnforced skill is a testament to his genius, and many seem to agree. All in all, the book is a good one to read for a poets view of a racial and spiritual quest to rise above the transitory stage so often dealt by Wright and Hughes. A great book, and even greater writer."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"This is a well written story of the lives those working out their salvation amid poverty, hardship and seeking a strong spirituality."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"The great truth of the Christian faith is that you are accepted just as you are... flaws and all.Many of the great narratives in the bible include flawed but teachable people. From: Adam to Abraham to Jacob to King David, God inspired the writing of these accounts to show us he uses people just as they are and he does the work not us.This is just the case in James Baldwin's story, Go Tell it on the Mountain.The main character is John, a young boy just turned 14 struggling to develop his identity and to get to know God.During the course of the story we see his family history revealed and get to know the truth that his mother and step father are very imperfect people but redeemed nonetheless.That is what John must come to terms with. Baldwin's rendering of this internal spiritual stuggle is masterful.The way that Baldwin reveals the truth of the family little by little is extremely well done. This story is short and packed with punch. It is a moving and thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Religion and Race are the two themes of this novel, with religion being the more dominant.

He wants to go outside and play with his friends and do what any normal kids his age do. His father is a very strict man; he doesn't want any of his children to go out a play. So they stay inside.James Baldwin uses setting to describe the time and the place in the book. His doesn't put in the year, but he describes the time period very well. For example when John kind of sneaks out of the house to go see a movie, as he is walking down the streets he hears noises and when he comes to the theater, he sees and reads a sign that said white only and black only, then you automatically know what time period it was."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I admire Baldwin's writing but this story had a bit less interest for me personally as it's about the hold of the black church on its people and being &#34;saved&#34;.

Perhaps one must be somewhat further along in life to appreciate the beauty, wisdom and empathy packed into this book. Baldwin wraps his pen around the poetry and majesty of the King James Bible and, through the mechanism of a family praying at a Saturday evening tarry service at a black Pentecostal storefront church, transforms it into a searing portrait of the suffering, survival and faith of an oppressed people in the Deep South and the slums of Harlem during the first third of the 20th century.This is not an easy book or a quick read. If your taste is limited to thrillers or murder mysteries or romances, stay away. Had I encountered it as a high school reading assignment, I would have thrown it against the wall in frustration. Today, I found myself stopping to catch my breath after almost every sentence, to take it in, to think about what it had to say, to marvel at the writer's artistry. At the same time, I was completely absorbed in the characters and their stories and could hardly bear to put the book down.I used to think \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was the finest American novel of the 20th century. \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" catches up in a photo finish and joins it on my very small shelf of books so well-wrought that I wish I'd written them."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"James Baldwin often said that for his first novel he had to grapple with his childhood in Harlem and his memory of his abusive stepfather if he were ever to write anything else; the novel that appeared in 1953 was so stellar and accomplished that critics expected to get more of the same from him (and were stunned when his next effort, GIOVANNI'S ROOM, instead was about gay white men in Europe). There are few major debut novels that are grimmer, but that are also more resonant and more powerful.GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN forms itself around young John Grimes's ability to come into his own voice (a Pentecostalist's speaking in tongues on the \\"threshing floor\\" of his family's church), and how that moment was preceded by the tremendous and shattering efforts of his adopted father and aunt to come Northwards, where their lives were not much better than in the South, but which had more promise, and of his mother to form a home for herself. The structure of the novel (which breaks down in the middle into \\"prayers,\\" or narratives, of his parents and aunt) owes much to Faulkner, but Baldwin's voice is like no one else before him; this is one of the greatest of all novels of the Black Northern migration of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"What a great way to buy books.

The protagonist simply goes into fits of self-loathing and predictable &quot;White man oppresive, Black oppressed, so let's sink down to their level.&quot; But I just can't get over the prose.

These people just go through the motions of a faithful life and therefore, the character descriptions are incorrect."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Have you ever read a book you know would be great, if the sentences weren't so long and drawn-out? And you try to read it, but it is just too descriptive? Go Tell It On the Mountain, by James Baldwin, is exactly that book for me.The story is about a young boy, John, and his family growing up in Harlem. Or at least that is supposed to be the plot. But in reality, not even half of the book takes place in Harlem. Each person in Go Tell It On the Mountain had their own mini-plot. Usually, mini-plots are a useful tool for writing a book. But to be useful, the plots must first, all fit together.When reading this book I was continually confused by the way the author jumped in and out of flashbacks. Characters during these flashbacks are not explained the way they should be. Baldwin takes a little too much time using big words, and not enough time introducing new characters.If you are interested in reading this book, I would suggest to do so. While reading this novel, you may learn how not to use flashbacks, how to make sentences as long as a paragraph, and how to over-use large words. I warn you, have your dictionary ready."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Drawn-out, overly descriptive, and at times hard to follow. Go Tell It On The Mountain by James Baldwin tells the story of the deep spiritual struggle of a fourteen year old black boy growing up in a Harlem community in the 1930's. At times, the book sounds almost poetic until an abrupt, and occasionally disturbing, flash back jumps at you from out of nowhere. Eventually, the story turns into somewhat of a bad soap opera with adultery, gangs, attempted murder, child abuse, suicide, and rape. Baldwin has shown through this book his mastery of fitting someone's life story into a single sentence as he attempted to do several times, losing the reader mid sentence. Baldwin also went on for pages describing dust in a house and adulterous moments-a euphemism of course. I cancertainly agree with New York Times' review, \\" with vivid imagery and lavish attention to details.\\" But I never imagined it to be this bad. Where details lacked in some areas, theygrew like weeds in others. Attention to details many people do not want to hear about proliferated, distracting from the supposed focus of the book, the spiritual struggles of teenage boy.In five words or less: sick, twisted and way to long. So, if you are looking for a soap opera-like book which could have easily been 200 pages shorter go to your nearestbookstore and purchase Go Tell It On The Mountain by James Baldwin."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Is religion important to you? If so, this book I read over the summer called Go Tell It on the Mountain by James Baldwin will be good for you to read. I am in the middle so I rather know how both people feel about the autobiography. Meaning how a person could like it and why a person would not like it. I liked this autobiography but then again I do not so that id why I know how both kinds of people would feel. So, if you really like and support your religion then I would recommend this book. However, if you really do not care about it then I would not recommend this story to you.This book is an autobiography of James Baldwin. He wrote of how his life was supposed to end up just like his fathers without question. His father was a pastor (father). He also never really paid attention to that because he was so use to hearing that he would become just like his father. He never mined about it until he turned 14 year old. Tough he was nothing like his younger brother. His younger brother knew so much more than he did about what was going on around them. I would really recommend this autobiography to those who want to know what his life was like and what happened to him."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"This book was horrible!!!!"},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Go Tell it on the Mountain was a powerful book, but it was extremely confusing with the different characters and setting. Its switching from past and future tense did not flow and the characters all got twisted together. There is no way to read the book only one time through and understand it all. New characters popped out of no where and left me completely confused about who was who. Maybe this book just was not right for me, but I really would not recommend this to anyone who has a cheerful personality. The reader has to enjoy thinking about and pondering ideas in a book and be okay with reading depressing books. Be prepared to read this book several times through to fully comprehend the true meaning and plot of this book. Overall, I was disappointed with this book because I had heard very good things about this book, but I found it too confusing to really enjoy."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Go tell it on the mountain was an extremely frustrating book. While the themes and some of the events were good (i.e. racism, abuse, religion), the way it was written made the book unenjoyable for me.

If the book was written differently I probably would have found it enjoyable."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I first read Go Tell It On The Mountain when I was in junior high and found myself bored, annoyed, and on the verge on giving it back to the library without finishing it (which I never do). I slogged through endless pages of \\"lordy lordy help me stand\\" \\"hallelujah\\" and othersuch near-maniacal religious zealot ramblings that had nothing to do with anything.The story is about a boy who is growing up, and his family has problems. It's not a huge book, but without all the frenzied Jesus-babbling, it could have been edited into a decent short story. It literally got to the point where I could skim through entire pages of nonsense to find any actual action, which was usually just \\"he shut the door and sat down in a chair\\" and then back to the crazy.I read it again in near the end of high school and hated it even more. Won't be picking this up ever again and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"My first thought when I saw this book I thought it was going to be good. Then I was assigned to read it for class and I hated it. This book was so boring and had absolutely no point to it. It was really repetitive and blah. The author is a good author, but I'd have to say this wasn't one of his best pieces. I would never force anyone to read this book, nor would I ever recommend it. I absolutely hate reading, but when I've found a good book I like reading. The most boring parts were when everyone was praying and reminiscing their childhoods. I disliked the majority of the book, but the very beginning was iffy. The author could've used a little bit more detail in certain places and less in others. By him using too much detail he made the book really boring. On the other hand, I did actually enjoy reading it a tad bit. This book kept me occupied yet bored. I hope I never have to read this book again. I think if I did I'd probably pass. I don't think any teacher or professor should ever give this book for their pupils to read. If someone asked me if I liked this book and should they read it I would say no. This book is more for an African-American church-going crowd. It really isn't for children because they wouldn't really understand what was going on, because there are words that they wouldn't be able to understand."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I was told by my English 1(S) teacher to read the book and I didn't even finish it. I couldn't get into it and what I read of it was stereotypical. Maybe there was something that made the book good at the end. All of my friends will agree that the books wasn't very good!! Who really cares about a preacher that sleeps around? Not me. All of the characters are introduced at the worst times and one can't even remember who the characters are... I just didn't like it (or the first 127 pages I read)."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"James Baldwin's novel is very interesting and unique. The main character, John Grimes, lives in Harlem New York with his mother, father, brother, and sisters. Gabriel, John's father, is a preacher at the family's church, and religion comes up various times through out the novel. The focus is on problems brought up between John and who he thought was his father. Elizabeth, John's mother, became pregnant with John before she met Gabriel, and her lover died before she had time to tell him her condition. When Gabriel and Elizabeth got married, Gabriel promised that he would treat John as if he were his own son. Sadly enough, Gabriel did not keep his word and treated John harshly. Gabriel tended to favor his biological son Roy throughout the novel and this brought up issues as well. The novel journeys thorough the sinful pasts of the characters and John deals with his stepfather as best as he can trying to make the best of life. Above all, the novel was very interesting to read and I would recommend it for any readers looking for a book based on family, religious, and racist dilemmas."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"In my mind, as I was reading this, I could not chase away the comparison to Richard Wright'sNative Son (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations). A simple gloss on the plots of both would tell you the same thing. A young African-American man grows up in a northern city during the early part of the twentieth century.The cultural conditions are different for Wright's proxy character and Baldwin's. Bigger's cultural antagonist is white culture, while John's is the religious inheritance of his people. While the world of _Go Tell it on the Mountain_ makes me feel less guilty and indignant than the milieu of Bigger Thomas's Chicago, the world is more alienating because so unfamiliar.The unfamiliarity carries over to the structure of the book. While it ends and begins in the same place, the bulk of the text is discursive and showing the back-story behind John's life. I kept finding myself on my toes tracing where I was. While this can be an effective technique to really think about what is going on, it does take the reader away from the story.For me, this is a narrative with some momentum, so it is troubling that Baldwin uses the structure to slow the reader down. The book is powerful and well-written, but it is lacking a certain something that you can find inThe Fire Next Time (HRW Library)that I cannot fully place but is not here."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"It's funny, the reviewer below me also first read this back in the 70's - as did I.

I love finishing a book that really leaves you saying \\"wow.\\""},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Reality can be a difficult thing to bear. Even those of us that can afford to sit in our plushy chairs and scratch our proverbial backs of creativity by means of writing reviews that ultimately wind up doing nothing more than contributing to this capitalist system and simultaneously stroking our puny egos can admit that there are some--and by some I mean countless--things in life that can bring us grief and send us spiraling down into the pits of depression and madness. Of course, this is all limited to our own specific systematic frameworks. Imagine how it must be for someone that doesn't have a warm home to live in or even a family to support them. Indeed, I've never heard of any third-world teenagers cut their wrists because their significant other of two and a half weeks decided to cut things off. Concepts of \\"problems\\" and strife are indeed very malleable according to what is or isn't available to us.Baldwin, in what is widely considered his best work, presents us (and more specifically his audience of the time) with the problems of a people who in the time in which the novel takes place had a systematic framework of trouble that was far \\"below\\" the standards of the referential framework of concern of the average American at the time. And what's more, he presented the public with these images in a time when these people (these people being poor African-Americans) didn't have a distinctive voice to elucidate the tears and pain of their world. Indeed, Baldwin managed to take what many readers of this book would look at today as caricatures and carve them into catalysts of understanding and sometimes even tears.This novel is split into three sections. The first section is told through the eyes of a child who has unfortunately fallen victim to fate and was born as a poor, gay black male in America. In addition, place him into the most dysfunctional family this side of the Mississippi (or so the reader would think; I'm sure many black families were the same way but only by necessity) and you have an amazingly sympathetic character. It doesn't take long for any reader with half of a heart want to take this poor boy into their arms and hold him tightly while showering him with tears. You also grow to despise the characters--most notably the father figure--that bring such anguish upon such an innocent soul.However, we are then presented with the second section: The Prayer of the Saints. In this section, we get background information on three of the principal adult characters in the aforementioned section and we soon learn: these people were unfortunate victims of circumstance as well. Like our protagonist, these characters were born into less than ideal family circumstances. However, they share our protagonist's racial and social burden that he has yet to confront personally. All three of these characters face these things and have their ups and downs which ultimately wind up forging them into the figures that you meet in the first chapter. When these prayers have been completed, you are simply unable to look at the characters in the same manner again. See what wonders a little dialogue and honesty can bring to you? However, the average American instead opts to stay detached from these figures and forever shove them into the position of caricature, which ultimately winds up leading vulnerable figures like our protagonist down a road of anger and hatred.The final section, however, shows some hope of salvation. Though, it is a very ambiguous conclusion. I won't tell you what happens but it spirals into a realm of mysticism and surrealism that this reviewer personally found surprising. However, this is where this strong novel becomes a little weaker. While I can see it working within the context of the story, this surrealism isn't as stimulating as what one could find in say, the stream-of-consciousness exhibited by Faulkner, Pound or any of their perspective contemporaries. However, it is not Baldwin's prerogative to challenge the traditional notions of art. Instead, he simply opts to present us with a world that few ever get to see and great job."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I was required to read this book for an English class and I thought that this book was great but the transitions from past to present were not handled well and I would often have to go and re-read the text again to help comprehend the situation. Go Tell it on the Mountain is a wonderful book about self-discovery and familial &amp; religious duty. The characters in this novel are wonderfully full: imperfect, but hopeful. I do disagree with anyone who feels that an extensive knowledge of the Bible is required to appreciate or enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"The members of the family in James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain suffer because of their color, their poverty, and the conflicts and disappointments that are part of any life. Most of all they suffer because of the demands that their intense, dogmatic religion places on them. While they love and fear God, they have little appreciation for God's creation. For them, everyone and everything in this world is carnal and corrupt. They aspire to an otherworldly existence but their nature leads them to defy God and suffer terrible guilt. They think and speak in the language of fundamentalist Christian religion: \\"witness,\\" \\"wandering,\\" \\"wilderness,\\" \\"wickedness.\\" In James Baldwin's hands, this language is beautiful but it's disturbing, too, and this short novel will not be forgotten easily."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I liked this book much more than anticipated. My initial expectation was a nicely written and overly poetic jumble about religion and identity crisis, probably a little too sentimental.Half right--Go Tell It On the Mountain is a powerful study of boyhood and parental expectation as well as the glories and the horror of religious conviction. It's more of a song, really, with dense, rhythmic prose that sings its song in a ramble that comes across almost like preaching. The effect is intended I would imagine, and produces results that are frequently stirring.This book transcends any mundane consideration of justice or political justification and breathes out a far more individualistically human story. A very quick read--"},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I enjoyed this book. Being a Christian, I could relate to John's journey as he turned to Christ. The style of the book was a little confussing. It was hard to know if Baldwin, as the narrator was simply narrating so we as an audience could know what the characters had been through, or if he was telling the character's thoughts. The characters, each with their own struggles, add variety. I liked how everything in the end doesn't just work out wonderful, and that we don't know if John changes his ways. Only knowing his heart has changed, we can imagine anything, good or bad for the rest of his life's journey."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"I was first turned on to James Baldwin when I read the book &quot;Black Girl In Paris.&quot; Afterwards, I began reading other works from Jame Bladwin.This book was so well written and so realistic in nature.

It's a story of a young man's plight into manhood which made me wish I had read this book when I was a teenager.This and many of James Baldwin's works are an excellent addition to any literary collection."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"What a joy it was to have James Baldwin's first novel as my first taste of his literature. I already am looking for &quot;Giovanni's Room&quot;. This story provides an in-depth look into the biblical Christianity of African-Americans. African-American Christianity can resonate with what St. Jerome said: &quot;To be ignorant of the Scriptures is to be ignorant of Jesus&quot;. But it is also a story of Black history in America. From the dangerous South to the disheartening North, we trace the journey of the Grimes family. Most notable is Baldwin's delineation of conversion: how Gabriel seems to dodge it, and how his stepson, John, wrestles with it. The characters of the story are real! You may know people just like them! Baldwin is keen on the role of one's honesty, and gift of self in the process of coming to Christ. He delineates well the ethos of Black Christianity in this work, which I recommend highly."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Ok, I'll quickly comment on some previous reviewer's comments in order to frame my view of this book. First of all, I agree with some of the others that if you have little faith, then this book may not be for you. However, if you have read Malcolm X's autobiography or any other african-american novels than you will absolutely love this one. Being fond of poetry will also help. So much of this book could be considered great poetry even outside of it's story-context. This is the &quot;door&quot; to Baldwin for me, and I have read &quot;Blues For Mister Charlie&quot; and will be reading the rest of his books soon, I have already purchased a few of them. If I had to make a &quot;level-comparison&quot; of how high I would rate him I would say he is similar to Jack Kerouac in how he makes you truly &quot;FEEL&quot; the character's emotions and really draws you into the story. Try not to mis-read this review. I am not saying that Jack and James write similar novels...I am just saying that I rank them both at the top.

The rough lifestyle, domestic drama, and racial clash of his childhood unfold over the course of this book. The autobiography is written in the third person, so as to interpolate black history rather than his life facts. The book is not so much about his life but rather the essence of his lifetime. His story is told through dialogue and the stories of others. He places the reader in his shoes as a witness. This is an incredibly interesting choice of the writer. Religion is also a both negative and positive influence in his family life. He faces much domestic pressure in an unaccommodating country. This is a worthwhile read and is significant to life. His view is intriguing. Life is like a mountain."},{"Title":"Go tell it on the mountain (A Dell contemporary classic)","review":"Why?? Because they're written by either pseudo-erudites whose biggest complaint is that the vocabulary is not challenging enough or a 10th grade student who finds non-linear writing \\"too confusing\\". Wow. If that's the major complaint of Baldwin's style, don't even attempt to read Joyce, Faulkner, Hesse, or any other great author for that matter. Stick to Rolling Stone articles and F.Scott Fitzgerald. Regardless, here's my review of Baldwin's classic.Baldwin's prose is truly a gift of American English. The language is very fluid and while it does flashback numerous times, keeping track of the story in not overly difficult. His interpretation of familial conflict merges with racial inequity in a salient and thought provoking manner. The real beauty of Baldwin's work, however, is that the author does not coerce the reader into feeling guilty about the subject matter; rather, he presents the social status quo and challenges the reader to grasp it's power. In all, the book sparks conversation about the African-American experience, albeit many of the themes transcend more than just that.

Since the beginning of the Jewish War, his excursions have been more perilous and on his most recent return trip, he has brought back a man left to die by the Romans--a man who has no memory of what happened to him or even his own name. \\"Xenos\\", as he is called, is befriended by Apollodorus's young son, Philo--one of three, the others being Conan and Nicanor.On his next caravan, however, Apollodorus is killed and his sons are forced by financial concerns to lease their property to the Roman garrison. Conan decides to join the Roman federated troops to earn his living while Nicanor steals off to join the Jewish resistance. Philo remains at home to serve the Roman garrison and care for Xenos, who soon recalls his past--a past which goes back to a previous book in this series,The Ides of April (Ray, Mary, Roman Empire Sequence.). Events will bring the three brothers back together as each tries to make sense of the war and the suffering of the Jewish people.In terms of historical research, Beyond the Desert Gate recreates life in Roman Palestine very well. My major gripes with the book are the ponderous plot and insufficient character development. The book is the fourth part of a series of five books and has trouble standing on its own. The description of the siege of Macherus was well done, particularly the climax which was very affecting, and the Christian elements were also appreciated. But over all, I think this book will have trouble holding the attention of the audience it's intended for--older kids ages 14 and up.

I read this aloud to my children (ages 14, 12, and 8) to go along with our study of the the first century. The book really gave us a good idea on how it was to be Roman, Jewish, or one of those stuck in between during the time when Rome finally put Judea down once and for all. In that way it enhanced our understanding of the history; yet, it is not a book that you finish and feel good about. How can it be when it is set in Palestine in 70 A.D., the year Jerusalem burned? Even the victors, the Romans, had to exert so many men and so much time for such little benefit. The story is good, compelling, and draws you in, but leaves you feeling sad at the loss and the uncertain and possibly bleak future awaiting the characters.

They're being chased by many people with a single mission... they want the map of the interplanetary Skyway he's supposedly carrying. The Skyway is the superhighway linking dozens, possibly hundreds of planets across the galaxy. Much of it is unexplored, and the fabled Roadmap becomes the desire of several large interests, including an alien race called the Reticulans, the human government known as the Colonial Assembly, and nasty villain Corey Wilkes, head of the wildcat trucker union TATOO. Every time Jake turns a corner someone, or something, is on his tail. The Starrigger Trilogy is probably the most entertaining sci-fi story I've ever read, (including works by the biggest writers), and it remains my favorite to this day. It's a balance of classic sci-fi's dream technology and fantastic alien worlds, blended with good humor and Jake McGraw's everyman view of his life, his bizarre situation, and his attempts to unravel himself from the whole mess. Find out what awaits him &quot;at the legendary end of the universe&quot;. I suggest this series to anyone who can get their hands on it.

Can't find a book or series worth reading these days? (I know for me its getting to be a rare thing) pick up this series. DeChancie handles time travel and paradox with masterful flare. The charaters are complete and well rounded. The style of writing reminds me of H Beam Pipers &quot;The Fuzzys&quot;. I would love to see a movie made of this story. Heck! I've read the series three times so I would most likley see that movie that many times."},{"Title":"Starrigger","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend back in the mid-80's in the midst of my strictly Sci-Fi period. I have since found other genre's I prefer but I recently picked this up again and re-read it. It has a decidedly Heinlein feel (ala Farnham's Freehold) but is different enough to warrant its own special caste. If you read this book, the next two in the series are a must and I highly recommend them to put the story to rest properly. Take a trip down memory lane and pick up a copy of this most excellent read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Starrigger","review":"One of my favorite sci-fi novels since I first read it back in high school, '86. Well-written, no-holds barred and realistic, one of DeChancie's more &quot;alive&quot; stories. Easily read, but has plot twists within plot twists. Good first book for that young, budding sci-fi reader you buy books for, mature but not over the top science is understandable, not childish and stupid. Recommended for a good, hard to put down read. First of three-part series. Can easily be a stand-alone adventure, if other two novels are unavailable."},{"Title":"Starrigger","review":"In some distant future, this wonderful trilogy will be reprinted, and recognized as DeChancie's masterpiece. Original ideas, marvelous, awesome alien technology, well-developed characters in a strong, well paced plot and delightful wordplay make this series re-readable, and well deserving of the term =Classic=.Find these books. They are worth the effort of tracking down."},{"Title":"Starrigger","review":"Book 1 of 3 - (Star Rigger , Red Limit Highway & Paradox Alley) I finally have all 3 I finally tracked down all 3 - Wonderful"},{"Title":"Starrigger","review":"Why this series of three books has never been made into a blockbuster movie I'll never know, but you're missing out on a great saga if you don't sit down and read this and the other two books in the series. Pure sci-fi at its best!"},{"Title":"Starrigger","review":"Starrigger by John De Chancie, written in the 80's is fun. Kept in that light the whole series is entertaining. It is the first in a 3 series set. Don't look for any hard science, just fun running a truck that seems to be a cross of the Millennium Falcon and Kit from Nightrider, through space and time on a highway to somtime, somewhere."},{"Title":"A History of the Amish, Revised and Updated!","review":"Timely shipment and in great condition. I was very pleased with order."},{"Title":"A History of the Amish, Revised and Updated!","review":"to a topic that would not be considered terribly exciting by most people. Here in plain English, with no bias whatsoever, is the history of one of the most unfamiliar peoples residing in the United States. You have here a detailed but fast-paced account not only of the Amish's origin in Switzerland, Saxony, and the Netherlands in the 16th century, but also of their trials and tribulations in their eventual settling in the New World. Of particular interest to me personally was the historical origins of, and divergence between the Amish and the Mennonites with regard to the question of technology. This book has clarified for me the historical and religious reasons why the Amish have come to choose the way of life they have. I came away from reading this book not only with a deeper understanding of how and why of the Amish (and the Mennonites), but also with a much deeper respect for the genuine humility and modesty the Amish practice in their everyday lives through their work, emphasis on community, and manner of dwelling in harmony with nature. Having lived in Pennsylvania and Ohio for many years, I always believed the Amish to be the only realistic model of a non-monastic community that could convincingly claim to strictly follow the Christian ethos of non-violence and neighborly love. Happily, this book has done much to substantiate much of my own observations about the Amish. But this book is not just about the Amish's past-- in allowing us to to know more about the way the Amish live, and their reasons for it, this short history may give us pause and allow us to re-examine the empty rhetoric of \\"community\\" and \\"empowerment\\" that fills the double-speak of modern politics and many a special-interest group's battle cries. Definitely recommended to anyone interested in a highly successful form of communal living -- one that is not based on a childish rebellion against the modern world, but one based on a childlike acceptance of man's fundamentally naked condition regardless of his technological progress."},{"Title":"A History of the Amish, Revised and Updated!","review":"I read this book prior to a long weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country. The book is very clearly written (I almost finished it on a flight from Amsterdam to New York) but it presents all the key facts and concepts - in a sympathetic but unbiased way. Having read this book prior to my visit, I could have conversations with locals and feel closer to them thanks to the information and concepts picked up from this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who plans to visit the Amish part of the country and look a little deeper than horse-driven carts and beards without moustaches."},{"Title":"A History of the Amish, Revised and Updated!","review":"From their beginnings in Europe to the Modern day this book gives a great overall history into what and who of the Amish people. Good read for the curious, history minded or those planning a visit to Amish country."},{"Title":"A History of the Amish, Revised and Updated!","review":"Nolt does an excellent job of opening up the early beginnings of the Amish to their present day frozen in time establishment. He follows many unique families as they struggle for survival, and a home. My only wish would be is additional focus on doctrines and beliefs; and the problems that are created. I realize though, that that was not the objective of the book. There is a large bibliography, end-notes, and it is fully illustrated.We begin in 17th century Europe with the founder, a man named Jakob Ammann. Knowledge on Ammann is obscure. After struggles with doctrines, the Amish, along with the Mennonites branched off from the Anabaptists. After this schism occurred over doctrines, many petty, the Amish found themselves looking for a new homestead. They spread over Europe; many were persecuted, some left freely from Switzerland and eventually found themselves settling in Pennsylvania.Small settlements can be found all over the eastern half of the United States to this day. It is a testament to their resolve that they survived at all. In time, decreased numbers would force mergers. They still live on the \\"edges of American society\\" with their close knit structure. The encroaching world continues to challenge their Christian faith. Though, through all this they are still growing and expanding.My thoughts, well, I think they are an example for all: their faith in the inerrancy of the Bible, moderation, love, kindness, and forgiveness. But, they have allowed old customs to stand in the way of growth. They have taken certain scripture as literal when it is meant to be taken figuratively. Where does it say that we should live in the 17th century? Sharing of their faith is greatly needed in this broken world, but they choose to isolate themselves.BlessingsScott"},{"Title":"A History of the Amish, Revised and Updated!","review":"A HISTORY OF THE AMISH will absorb you into the Amish world.

Nevertheless, most of what I have heard people say about the Amish has proven to be wrong. I was listening to a radio show the other day and, despite the fact that the Amish were the topic of the radio show, the host didn't bother to learn the first thing about them, nor did anyone who called in to the show in order to give their erroneous interpretation of a group of people they knew nothing about.There's nothing surprising about that, I suppose. It's not as if the Amish put out regular press releases. They don't have Facebook pages or Twitter accounts. As should be obvious, I am not Amish. But I am Mennonite, and I have visited with the Amish colony not far from me. Still, I am not an expert on the Amish, but neither would I choose the Amish as a topic for a radio show without bothering to learn something about who they are. Nor, for that matter, would I offer opinions in conversation that are based on nothing other than my own lack of knowledge. Many do, though.\\"A History of the Amish\\", as its name implies, is focused on the history of the Amish, rather than an interpretation of their beliefs and customs, but there is much of that there, as well. Steven M. Nolt, the author, does a splendid job of it, looking at the Amish objectively, rather than as a freak show.There are other books on the subject that are more in depth, the best of which are authored by Donald B. Kraybill, and many others, but \\"A History of the Amish\\" is a good start. Those who desire to develop an understanding of the Amish won't be led astray.

Think why they're there. The best way to set up fire observation towers would be to make them gloriously high, with a grand view - better yet if they're somehow accessible from civilization down below. That's what we get with the towers and their mountain hosts described in Paul Laskey's \\"Survivors That Still Stand Guard.\\" There's the history and the lore, and the fascination with a peculiar kind of structure erected far away from any road. Too bad the guys hauling up all that the steel, snapping together these erector-set steel towers way up on New York's out-of-the-way faraway mountain tops, didn't figure they'd be soon be rendered obsolete by planes years later. Ah! -- but they're a great excuse for a little exercise, to find that perfect charming picnic spot with a beautiful view, helped along by a high silvery metal tower ... and maybe to reminisce a little about the stories of New York's mountains as they were long ago.

Detective Joe Sandilands, decent, smart, human and intuitive finds himself drawn into solving a mysterious set of murders right before his scheduled return to Blighty.. His disappointment is mitigated by the appearance of a deeply attractive woman who is there to inform and guide him through exquisite British social mazes which envelop the crimes.A very cool and compelling adventure."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"In this pleasantly restrained murder mystery, a Scotland Yard detective comes to a British Army post in India to look into a series of deaths among officers' wives. The story conveys the inbred atmosphere of the time (the 1920's) and the place. Adventures and romances illuminate personal histories and reveal tensions under the surface of polite discourse.

Apparently the officers of the Bengal Greys have been experiencing some rather rotten luck: over the years, the wives of at least five officers have died of accidents. And now with the suicide of Peggy Somersham, rumours are flying about the ill fated unit. Especially as someone keeps putting roses on the graves of the dead women on the anniversary of their deaths. Nancy Drummond, Sir George's married niece, and a good friend of Peggy Somersham's however believes that Peggy was murdered. And she wants someone to reinvestigate all the deaths of the officers' wives. And while Sandilands agrees that there is something very fishy about all these deaths, he is not too sanguine about getting any kind of result. A look at the files reveals that the previous police investigation into the past deaths was shoddy at best, and he knows the futility of trying to look into a cold case. But, ably assisted by a young Indian police officer, Naurung Singh, and the delectable but very married Nancy Drummond, Sandilands is determined to discover who may be killing off the wives of the Bengal Greys and why.The mystery turned out to be an interesting and engrossing one; it also unfolded at a smooth and brisk pace. There were even a few plot twists and some red herring suspects. So that, on the whole, I should have been over the moon with this book. But I wasn't. And that was mainly because the principal characters (Sandilands and Nancy) really failed to capture my interest and concern. They seemed a little dated (esp their conversations). I'm big on historical accuracy, but I'll admit this was one instance when I'd been really happy if Nancy hadn't sounded as if she stepped out of a school girls' annual. Another thing I found disappointing was that the authour had not gone very much into the social history of 1920s India. I rather think that if she had, the novel would have been slightly more evocative and atmospheric. Sometimes I felt (while I read this book) as if all the Indians had been shipped off to Jupiter, while the English cavorted about the country side to their heart's content.I suppose that part of the reason why \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose\\" failed totally to satisfy was that I had just finished (re)watching a couple of episodes of that excellent PBS' mystery series, \\"Heat of the Sun.\\" And compared to that (even though \\"Heat of the Sun\\" takes place in 1920s Kenya), \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose\\" lacks a certain depth, as well as a charismatic and engaging detecting duo. All in all, I'd say that \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose\\" deserves a 3 1/2 star rating for possessing a really good mystery plot."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"In a book world with serial killings based on maniacs and pyscho killers in abundance, this book stands out by the unique motive behind the murders of a bunch of 'memsahibs' -- English men's wives, killed over a period of 12 years happening in the pre-independence period in India. Cleverly plotted the death of the ladies cause chillness to the spine, yet deceiving to the eyes of the common folk as mere accidents or the work of 'churel' -- An evil spirit, until the shrewd Nancy Drummond, the collector's wife suspects an underhand in the last death that happens when Peggy, her friend gets murdered in the most alarming way - the most dreadful way she could have fathomed - In a bathtub with blood-mixed water, with her wrists cut so deep to reveal her bones. Along with Joe Sandilands, a detective from the renowned Scotland yard , Nancy sets out to seek answers to the mysterious deaths along with Naurang, a young ambitious Indian policeman. Barbara Cleverly takes the reader on a thrilling ride through the pre-independence era in India, and brings the Anglo-Indian community life in front of the eyes. Each chapter builds the suspense and even after the suspense is revealed, there is yet another piece of unexpected suspense - The reason for the murders is in variance with Joe's concluded theory for motive. A delight for anyone interested in suspense books and/ or books with historical annotations."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"An evocative tale from a time long gone, although the places still remain.

The murders are firmly of the \\"cozy\\" variety ala Agatha Christie; so don't look for a great deal of grit or realism. But the book does have charm. The stalwart hero and the plucky heroine may seem a bit stock, but when the author gets them talking they come pretty vividly to life, so do the rest of the regiment. There's a good resonant reveal at the end, as well. The whole thing has more of the feel of a good period melodrama like The Letter or Conduct Unbecoming than it does a really rich historical novel that transports you back to its setting."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Liked it alot, just ordered the next 2 from amazon, hope they are as good. Is joe sandylands straight? wish there was guys like that here"},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I always hate Barbara Cleverley's books to end. THis was no exception."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I was looking forward to this one, being a sucker for books (especially mysteries) set in and giving the flavor of exotic locales or times. I've read Kipling's 'Kim' numerous times over the decades. So I was prepared to like, even love, this one and really wanted to, since it seems the start of a new series. Now I'm glad I didn't waste money actually purchasing 'Kashmiri Rose', but borrowed instead. I'm only sad for the time lost plowing on, waiting for it to get better. My two * rating is based on three *'s being neutral.To start with, I find it impossible to get past the awkward prose and stilted dialogue. Everyone, including the author, sounds vaguely pompous, speaking in schoolbook phrases. (The characters who are, I presume, actually supposed to be pompous sound like comic caricatures, Nigel Bruce as Watson.)And I honestly don't see a lot to justify the effort of slogging along, either plotwise or in the setting. The author mistakes ritually invoking period detail-words (jargon/slang, brand names, etc.) for evocation of period and place. Simply censing the reader with a haze of 'syces' and 'punkhas' does not paint a picture (at least for those of us young enough not to have been there).The natural history does seem accurate, though it could have been mentioned that the 'rare' Camberwell Beauty butterfly which played such a role is actually quite common, but England and India are on the fringes of it's range, so rare in those two countries. But for all the attention to some details there is inattention to the details of exposition. For instance, the letter Sandilands finds which one victim was writing to her parents is referred to as 'half-finished', but later in the same paragraph, we are told that she 'had saved her real news for the end of the letter' ... yet she actually did write it down (p. 43 of the pb edition). Now, if the letter was unfinished, how can the end containing the real news have been written? A trivial rewrite (whatever became of editors?) could fix this, but it's careless writing and it grates.[This review is based on the first 150 pages; I simply cannot bring myself to waste more time by reading further. As to the \\"brilliant plotting\\" mentioned by another reviewer, quite a few pages ago I had a hunch as to the villain, but thought it was maybe too obvious ... so just for fun, this very moment, I skipped to the penultimate chapter, and lo and behold, this obvious suspect was indeed the fiend. Not that I look for mysteries plotted so as to mislead me , but this was pathetic, not brilliant.]And as to finding Sandilands \\"charming and principled\\", as one reviewer did -- well, charming is in the eye of the beholder (I found him quite the opposite), but principled?? His first thought on meeting one of the principals in the case was how he could score with this married woman. Even if one neglects the 'principled adultery', surely messing around with the suspects is against most principles of detection.Interestingly enough, relating to the comment of a previous reviewer who recommended the 'Mamur Zapt' series instead, one of that series is in my short bedside stack for future reading. Given their opinion of \\"Kashmiri Rose\\", I hope I'm in for a treat. Jolly, what?Added note: I did read Michael Pearce's 'The Mamur Zapt & The Return of the Carpet'. It was as day and night compared to 'Kashmiri Rose.' Literate, engaging, well plotted -- do yourself a favor and check out this series instead!"},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"This book was not perfect, though I found it a great effort from a first-time novelist. I love mysteries, and I have always been fascinated by India, so this was a great combination. I didn't feel that the main character, Joe Sandilands, was as well-developed as I would like, and at the end of the book I still felt I didn't know him well, and didn't know what motivated him. I also felt his relationship with Nancy was a bit shallowly developed and not quite convincing.However I thought the mystery part was very well-developed and interesting, and while the identity of the killer became obvious about 3/4 of the way through the book I was stumped as to motive, and the motive as revealed at the end was a complete surprise to me. I do wish I knew what a previous reviewer considered to be a physical impossibility in the solution. If so I sure didn't spot it. :-)Anyway, never having been to India I guess I can be less critical of the less-than-authentic aspects mentioned. But I have recently read the 3-volume autobiography of author MM Kaye who was born and raised in India and spent much of her young adult life there as well. She was born in 1908 so her life coincided with the era of this novel. She frequently spoke of and referred to speaking Hindustani and said it was a shame no one seemed to speak in anymore as they had in her youth. According to her book Hindustani is NOT Hindi, but a language that combined elements of Hindi and Urdu, so I admit I just took that reference in the book for granted.Anyway, I still look forward to additional novels by Cleverly, and can't wait for the second to come out in paperback. I hope that we will learn more about Joe as the series progresses."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I loved this book for a lot of reasons.

The setting of this mystery is in India during the 1920s during British rule. There is this terrible death of a young wife of one of the military officers and Joe is asked to investigate. As he proceeds he finds out that there were other unexplained deaths of wives of officers in the same regiment and they all occurred in March over several years about ten years earlier. What I found fascinating about this book is the vivid descriptions of the land and all it's beauty as well as dangers. Joe seeks the help of an Indian policeman named Naurung who can go into places and seek information that Joe is unable to do because of his language deficiencies and his lack of knowledge about the culture. There is also a romantic interest, a woman named Nancy Drummond, also an officer's wife who first alerts authorities to the suspicions of the murdered wife and of course, becomes involved as a helper and then lover to Joe. There is a lot of political ramifications in seeking out the murderer because no one knows whether this person is Indian or British. There is also speculation that these murders go deeper and may bring on another mutiny and bloodbath like in 1858. The author brings history and background to this book which really adds to the enjoyment of the story. I look forward to reading more of her books."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Five women have died in unusual circumstances over the past twelve years, each the wife of a British Army officer and living with her husband in the remote Indian outpost station of Panikhat, and all having died in the month of March. Tragic coincidence or is each death a thread woven into a fiendish plot? The dashing and resourceful Commander Joe Sandilands of Scotland Yard must unravel this colorful and complex tapestry of death and intrigue.The year is 1922. All over the world the sun is setting on the British Empire and yet English life at this small outpost clings with desperate resolve to their dying traditions. Afternoon tea is still served on verandahs as servants waft fans, officers and their ladies dress for dinner and sip champagne by candlelight, and little notice is taken of their Indian servants or the undercurrents of change that are building across the land.Commander Sandilands has a formidable ally in the person of Nancy Drummond, a good friend of the most recent woman to die and an army nurse in the recent war in Europe. Nancy is smart, beautiful, flirtatious, and the wife of the judicial administrator for the district. Nancy's help in solving the mystery comes with complications. In the sultry and steamy tropic atmosphere that pervades the days and nights of Panikhat, Joe finds himself increasingly attracted to Nancy and perceives that the feeling is mutual.Also of invaluable help to Joe is Sergeant Naurung Singh, twenty-five years old, following in his father's footsteps in police work and assigned to work on the case by District Police Superintendent Bulstrode, a man who is not above suspicion himself.Death by cobra bite, by fire, by drowning; there are many ways to die in Panikhat and for every method there is a motive and for every motive there is a suspect. Joe, Nancy, and Naurung find themselves in a race against time to discover the killer before another victim is claimed.Reviewed by Andrew MacRae for Suspense Magazine"},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Barbara Cleverly takes us to post-World War I British-ruled India and introduces us to Scotland Yard's Joe Sandilands, on assignment in the seething subcontinent. Massive changes are coming to India but the British rulers are trying to hang on to their way of life. Into this comes Sandilands, who has a strange murder investigation thrust on him. Author Cleverly cleverly (sorry) shapes a dazzling plot involving the colonial British way of life as it bumps up against the exotic culture of India. To say more might spoil things, so I will only say that this is a police procedural like few others. A most satisfying book that the reader will find worthwhile. A novel that intensely conveys the sights and smells or an India that no longer exists. A most enjoyable book!"},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"A beautiful, absorbing period piece with a couple of unexpected twists - a perfect jumping-off point for this new series.

In him, Cleverly has established an intelligent but also quite human protagonist who I will enjoy following through many more adventures."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Historical mysteries can be a bit of a lottery. The authors are usually very versed in the historical period they write about, but the trouble sometime starts when the characters or the puzzle are obviously not their forte. Barbara Cleverly doesn't have that problem. The days of Colonial India are brought to us vividly in bright colors of sun and folliage, and the characters are lively if a bit predictable.The puzzle itself, the crucial part of any good mystery, is original, but just a touch forced. Some of this little imperfections can be easily fixed in her future novels. I'll be willing to give them a good try."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I liked this book, and I am generally pretty picky. Granted, I don't know much about the country or the time period, so historical mistakes went right over my head.

I am definitely reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"From the opening where little Midge Prentice, awakes under her mosquito net to the ending of the story, I was engaged with the flavor, scents, sounds and sights of India at a particular time in history. I read fiction for pleasure, as entertainment and I was thoroughly entertained with the beautiful descriptive voice of Barbara Cleverly in her debut mystery novel, \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose.\\" The romantic part was expected but not necessarily as believable as I would imagined, still the main character, Detective Joe Sandiland, was strong enough to keep me with it. All in all, I say for a good entertaining mystery with very delightful style writing, this book meets all my reading enjoyment needs."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Barbara Cleverly's first novel is a highly enjoyable murder-mystery set in 1920s India, drawing on the culture and history of that land as a backdrop to a series of gruesome murders among the British elite. Every year in March, a wife of one of the British officers dies a terrible death - seemingly accidental, not to mention unrelated - save for the Kashmiri roses that appear on their graves each year by persons unknown.After the latest victim is found dead in her bathtub with her wrists slashed, not everyone is convinced at the suicide verdict. A Scotland Yard detective named Joe Sandilands is called in, who is eager to try out the new technique of psychological profiling in this case. Flirting with his associate Nancy Drummond, the young wife of an officer who insisted on the investigation, Joe begins to learn about the country of India and its people. As he investigates, he becomes immersed in Indian culture, discovering that the clues to the murders are held within the culture of the people itself. In looking into the pasts of the five dead women, Joe begins to realize that there is an indeed a connection between all the deaths - a truly horrific connection.Cleverly writes a compelling story, with clear prose and a few great little twists. Throw in an ethical dilemma, a rich portrayal of India, a harrowing conclusion and you have a great read. I read it in just three sittings, and ended with the satisfaction of a reader finishing a story-well-told. As it turns out, the murderer is revealed long before his/her rather obscure motivations are, making \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose\\" less of a whodunit and a more unique type of mystery-story.On the downside, her two protagonists (Joe and Nancy) aren't entirely three-dimensional characters. A \\"romance\\" buds between the two of them, but they never really came to life for me. In fact, much of their behaviour is eyebrow-raising considering the context of the time and place - and despite a surprising twist toward the end of the story regarding Nancy's interest in him, I had a hard time believing that *anyone*, in *anyplace* would act the way these two do around each other.My knowledge of India extends to readingThe Far Pavilionsby M.M. Kaye and watching the occasional episode of \\"The Amazing Race\\", so I have no idea how much of this book is accurate - however, I can attest that the background is colourful, vivid and fascinating (though it does dwell more on the English upper-class than the Indian people themselves). However, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who loves a good, exotic mystery - and I'll definitely be on the lookout for the rest of Cleverly's novels."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I love stories of the British Empire, like Rudyard Kipling's SOLDIERS THREE. And I love stories about rebellious Twenties youth (especially female youth,) like LOVE FOR LYDIA. So when I heard about this Indian mystery set in the 1920's, it seemed like a perfect fit.To be sure, I liked these characters. I liked plain old Joe, the London detective pressured to find a killer in hot, sweaty India. I liked Nancy, the trim, efficient, sexy young officer's wife who helps Joe crack the case. I liked Naurung, the loyal Sikh officer who works with the sexy man and woman team, and looks the other way during the love scenes. I even liked Midge, the flighty little thing who just might be the killer's final victim.The thing I didn't like, is that we got lots of British India, but not enough of the Twenties mood. We know that the British Empire is on its last legs, and that things are changing in India. We know that the young have seen horrible casualties in the Great War, a war that did nothing to make England or the Empire stronger. Just the opposite in fact.What we don't see, however, is how this changed the characters. All of the officers (and their wives) are just as \\"sold\\" on the idea of England and empire as they were before the war. There's not a hint of rebellion, boredom, or discontent among the ladies. Everyone's drinking, yes, and enjoying the regimental festivities, but there's no real sense of reckless or feverish abandon -- no sense of burning rebellion or passions under the surface. All the characters, good and bad, are too noble and self-sacrificing. Nancy cheats on her husband, but only for the highest motives. Midge the little flirt is spoiled and reckless, but she never really challenges authority in any way. There's no sense that her life will be any different than her mother's -- just with a happier ending. Joe is a lower class man, who has been allowed to rise, but he never challenges the class system directly. Even the killer seems to be totally commmitted to the codes of his birth.Is there a rebel in the house?"},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"There wasn't excessive violence, and it was far more entertaining than the Winter Olympics. A book that can be passed on to elder relatives without terrifying them (my great aunt's criteria, although she did like Edward Gory). Plot and characters were entertaining, and sufficient people were done in, British fashion, early on (uncle's criteria). The author could learn a lot from Tony Hillerman about time, place, and religion and conveying that to the reader. I'm still wondering about the genus and appearance of the Kashmiri Rose. The ending was ok, a bit contrived -- she was a smart woman, how could they think a man would be the next target? I'll read more of her books, but will look in the library first. Alexander McCall Smith was far more compelling with his woman/detective character, but he's older and more experienced. We're hoping this author is better with age and time. Still, a good read."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"My copy of \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose\\" stated that the author won a prize for the story outline and then went on to write it up as a novel. Unfortunately, I don't think it has progressed beyond the story outline stage. Cleverly's writing is flat. She has all the right words for India, but I didn't feel myself there. Her characters talk, but they don't come alive and have no real personality. The ending should have been dramatic and shocking, but instead was tedious and even faintly silly. Certainly the plot was intriguing, but without the writing skill to bring it alive it just didn't have the interest or impact it should have had as a story. In addition, some of the motivations of the main characters when it came to personal matters (Joe, Nancy, Andrew, Uncle George) struck me as very strange, whereas a better writer might have made it believable. Joe Sandilands, the hero of the tale, himself is little more than a cipher to move the plot along. The two flashes of personality he has are that he is uncomfortable with British treatment of Indians and that he won't hesitate for as much as a second when it comes to an affair that, for all he knows, has the potential to ruin his investigation of a deadly serious matter.Despite the gentle mockery of Agatha Christie found in this book, Cleverly has the same tendency towards old lady wish-fulfillment romance (also a failing of Ellis Peters) - but unfortunately not the same degree of writing skill.My review sounds pretty negative, doesn't it? But it all comes down to what you want from a book. I personally prefer really good writing from authors, even for crime novels; something more than clever ideas. But if you just want clever ideas and an easy read, you may enjoy \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose\\" a lot. This is Cleverley's first book, I understand. I hope her writing skills evolve to match her plotting abilities."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I lived in the state of Bihar in India from 1956 to 1959, when I was a child. Bihar is the state immediately to the west of Bengal, where The Last Kashmiri Rose is set, so I was interested to see how Barbara Cleverly handled her story. On the positve side she gets a lot of the factual stuff right, Bengali is the major language in Bengal, although Hindi (which she invariably calls Hindustani) is spoken by many. The plot is interesting, and the solution to the mystery is quite inventive; however, I ended up having a lot of problems with both the plot and the handling of India as a backdrop to the story. No one living in India would refer to Hindi as Hindustani repeatedly, 2 syllables are always better than 4; the younger Englishwomen's hair and dress lengths in 1922 are about 3 to 5 years ahead of what they would have been, but these are small things. I felt there was way too much of the happy darky syndrome, a la old Hollywood and the plantation slaves. India became independent in 1947, the book is advertised as the final days of the Raj, which is also not accurate, but not Cleverly's fault; however, even in 1922 all Indians across the board would not have been so happy to be servants, or villagers, or field workers, and not so deferential, or even submissive as they are pictured, particularly the Sikhs. One important plot twist centers around our hero, an interesting guy and a supposed English gentleman and his interest in one of the women in the story - his reactions to her are out of character, or, perhaps shallowly portrayed. The most important plot twist centers around the appearance of the killer, and Cleverly's solution, while interesting, is also physically impossible. Which gave me a lot of problems. Ultimately, if you're someone who knows India at all, this is probably not the book for you, but if you don't, it is, if you remain pretty uncritical, not a bad read."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Barbara Cleverly has done her research, all right; this mystery is chockfull of brand names, fashion details, and exotic flavors straight out of 1920s India. Her plot is solid, her setting is a winner, and her characters are only sometimes ripped off from Kipling. It's just too bad that Cleverly didn't bother to research the actual speech and behavior of the English in 1920s India, while she was at it. If you like to think of the past as being just like today, only in fancy dress, you'll love this book (and the clunky writing probably won't faze you, either). If anachronism grates on you, but you're still in the mood for plotty mysteries with a British-Empire setting, read Michael Pearce's Mamur Zapt series instead. *Please.*"},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Good characters, good plot, interesting setting.

She starts with a lot of action once again, but this time has a story that hangs together and moves along, as well as including more detail about life in India at the time. A mystery is necessarily plot driven, and she has it center on a group of serial murders in a community over a period of years, always a good device. The situation in fact gets downright scary and I had trouble putting it down near the end. The story is definitely told from the British point of view more than the Indian, but there is nothing wrong with this. A novel doesnt have to be 100% politically correct to everyone or present all possible points of view to be effective as long as the author keeps his own views out of it. I did learn more about Joe's character, including that he is less upstanding than portrayed in the second book, jumping into an affair with a married woman. The sex scene out in the wilderness made me wonder, however, weren't they worried that a 12-foot king cobra might shoot out of the bush and take a bite of them (it would have put a damper on my enthusiasm) and how was Nancy going to explain to her husband how she got tanned all over?Also, some reviewers were obsessing about the Mourning Cloak butterfly that figures in one of the deaths. I don't think it is rare today, not in North America or in the Eastern Hemisphere, but I have to say it is really cool looking and well worth checking out its color photos on the web. While you hear that butterflies only live a day or so, this one lives for 10-11 months. One thing I like in a book is a piece of information that leads me to something else that is interesting.This book was much more enjoyable than Ragtime in Simla. The only thing is that I wish the publishers would quit referring to this as the final days of the Raj. This is so misleading that Daedalus Books actually put in their catalog that this book takes place in the 1940s after the end of World War II. I couldn't understand why the second book took place 20 years earlier, which is why I bought that one."},{"Title":"The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I enjoyed this book and the detective.

The problem? He uses the exact same examples over and over again. The language that he uses is very colloquial and the laid back tone is quite surprising, considering it is a &quot;scholarly&quot; work.The biggest problem I have with the book is this. How is it possible for an author that is clearly not a best-selling author know what exactly the best-selling process is like?

As a youth leader, counselor, and as a father of 2 teens himself, Townsend addresses some basic underlying concepts for parenting teens. The first three sections of the book are entitled: \\"Be a Parent with Boundaries,\\" \\"Understand the Teenage World,\\" and \\"Set Boundaries with Your Teen.\\" The focus here is equipping parents to build better relationships with their teens.By far the largest fourth section of the book deals with specific issues involved in parenting adolescents: academics, agression, substance abuse, argumentativeness, breaking agreements, chores, clothing, curfews, self-mutilation, deception, defiance, family detachment, disrepect, driving, spirituality, ignoring parents, impulsive behaviors, the internet, handling money, moodiness, parties, peer relationships, phone usage, runaways, sexuality, and the silent treatment.Townsend balances comforting parents in the difficult situations they find themselves in with teens, practical suggestions for working with teens on their own, and highlighting red flag behaviors that need professional intervention. The book is very readable and easily completed over a weekend. Following through on the suggestions will take longer, but Townsend helps encourage parents to hang in there!"},{"Title":"Boundaries with Teens: When to Say Yes, How to Say No","review":"This book is quick and easy to read due to its methodical layout. The first three parts of the book set the stage for helping parents understand the teenage mind and the general concepts of setting boundaries. Part four lists specific issues most parents of teens will deal with. In each specific issue, the author defines the problem and then describes how to handle the problem. I recommend parents read the book from beginning to end to get the entire picture and benefit of the author's advice. What's nice about the fourth part of the book is that parents can time and time again flip to the specific behavior they are dealing with and review the advice. So far, Dr. Townsend's advice is working wonderfully in our household. I wish this book had been around years ago when my oldest became a teenager! I plan to buy copies of the book for my friends with teenagers."},{"Title":"Boundaries with Teens: When to Say Yes, How to Say No","review":"The problem with most self-help books is that we turn to them when all else has failed, and often it is too late to deal effectively with the current crisis. Not that they can't help to point us in the right direction, but the advice would have been a lot more helpful if we had sought it before we got into the problem. Unfortunately, human nature seems to adhere to the \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" philosophy. So we fail to anticipate future problems and find ourselves scrambling for help when \\"it (inevitably) breaks.\\"Fortunately, for parents today, there are some excellent books available that can help them prepare for their child's stages of development. These books, written by people who have worked through many of parenting's pitfalls, can make the journey so much smoother and more enjoyable. Dr. John Townsend, who often co-authors with Dr. Henry Cloud, has written a series of books dealing with parenting and relationships that definitely falls into this category. These titles include RAISING GREAT KIDS, HOW PEOPLE GROW, BOUNDARIES WITH KIDS and BOUNDARIES IN MARRIAGE, plus others.We have heard that a child's personality and tendencies are formed by the time he or she is eight years old. So what hope do parents have when their 14-year-old becomes rude and disrespectful, refusing to follow even the simplest of family rules? According to BOUNDARIES WITH TEENS, help is available, and while the child's personality and tendencies will not be changed, his or her behavior will. This allows the family to function and mom and dad to have a measure of serenity.Dr. Townsend says, \\"I have seen many teens become more responsible, happier, and better prepared for adult life after their parents began to apply the principles and techniques discussed in this book. Many of these teens not only made positive changes in their lives, they also reconnected emotionally with their parents at levels that the parents thought they would never experience again.\\" Using biblical principles as his guide, Dr. Townsend has put together a book that gives parents uncomplicated strategies for dealing with the most common and disturbing problems they are apt to face with their teenagers. Not only is there a chapter outline, there is also a detailed index to help find answers that focus on specific needs.In addition to the practical advice, BOUNDARIES WITH TEENS offers encouragement to parents on every page. It reminds them of their own spiritual needs and commitments and gives them hope for success. Raising children is more challenging than ever, and people like Dr. Townsend provide welcome assistance.--- Reviewed by Maggie Harding"},{"Title":"Boundaries with Teens: When to Say Yes, How to Say No","review":"The book arrived yesterday (well ahead of the initial shipping schedule) and I started reading it right away (I have 3 teenaged boys). After only being about 40 pages in, I'm wondering why I didn't buy this book long ago. It probably could have saved our family some conflict and frustration. As the book says, it's never too late so I don't lose hope."},{"Title":"Boundaries with Teens: When to Say Yes, How to Say No","review":"This is the most insighful book I've read yet on raising a teen. I found myself encouraged and underlining passages on almost every page. Most of this review is simply excerpts of what I have found the most informative. Freedom for teens is earned by demonstrating responsibility and parents need to find the right balance between being too controlling and when they are being healthy and appropriate about saying \\"no\\". When parents set limits they're helping teens learn to develop a healthy structure and gain self-control and ownership over their life. We need to be active, be loving, be present, be truthful, be consistent; in other words, be the parent. Teenagers act like they don't care what their parents think and say but in reality it matters a lot to them. It is easy to forget how difficult the teenage years can be, and parents sometimes judge teens too harshly for behaving like a teenager. Your teen needs a parent who will connect with her and show her empathy, who can identify with what she is going through and understand the struggle of adolescence. She needs to know that she is not alone in her fight. What if every time you screwed up all you heard was \\"what in the world were you thinking\\". Your teen, whose brain is less developed than yours, is even less resilient in the face of criticism. Teens don't like conflict with their parents anymore than parents do. Aim to know your teen rather than change them. Learn to listen to your teen more - draw her out, so you can see what she is thinking about and struggling with. Refrain from moralizing about every wrong thing you hear.Ask questions that require more than a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". Begin with questions about facts, move to thoughts, and then to emotions. Your teen needs to know you know her on a heart level. Teens will develop self-control and responsibility to the extent parents have healthy boundaries. The more teens experience negative consequences of their poor choices, the more internal structure and self-control they will have.Parents need to develop separateness. Parents with separateness can stand apart from their teen's anger, demands and behavior and are able to respond appropriately without getting caught up in the drama. Parents should give up the fantasy that they can make their teens happy. Being honest means directly confronting your teen when they have crossed a line. Parents should stick with rules and consequences, as long as they are reasonable, and say \\"no\\" to attempts to manipulate, wear down, or even intimidate them. God made parents to be guardrails on the twisting road of life. You need to be strong enough for kids to crash into over and over again. Guardrails get dinged up, but they work well, they preserve the young lives that run up against them.Your teen needs you to be connected to other adults in meaningful relationships. Don't let guilt stop you from doing something right that will make your teen mad, disappointed or frustrated. You need to be free to set and keep limits so your teen can benefit from experiencing structure, clarity and consequences which will increase your teen's self-control and sense of ownership over her life. Some parents fear that if they set limits, their teens will distance themselves, detach and withdraw their love. But this would only teach teens that they get their way by cutting off their love which create difficulty in their future adult relationships. When a teen does disconnect, the parent should take the initiative to reconnect since teens don't have these skills they need their parents help. It is normal for teens to respond in anger when parents hold to limits. However if parents can love and still hold the limit the teen will learn to let go of that anger which is a major step toward maturity. When parents consistently provide their teens with warmth and structure, teens become less extreme, impulsive and moody. Not allowing your teen to fail can be one of the biggest mistakes you make.To a teen, being understood is everything. Your teen has a lot to manage considering she is going through lots of changes all at once: neurological, hormonal, emotional, social and spiritual therefore be understanding. Your teen is disoriented inside, and with good reason. It is normal, in fact is good and necessary for your teen to go through adolescence. It enables the teen to transition from parental dependence to adult independence. She needs to be safe in your care while she tries out her identity, role, power and skills. Teens are divided people. They need parents but desire freedom from them, they struggle between being perfect and having a dark side, they can use thought and judgment then switch to feelings and impulsiveness. But your love and consistent structure help your teen integrate these conflicting parts and find healthy balance. Teens often don't know what they think or feel because they are constantly evolving into different people. Do not try to fight your teen's desire for separation, because you will surely lose, as you should. Don't put your teen in a no-win situation when she must keep herself and lose her parents or lose herself and keep her parents. Be a supporter of your kid's extra family world, as long as that world is reasonable, safe and supports your own values and beliefs. Let your teen know that it is okay to have interests outside yourself. Stay connected, even in differences. Don't let conflicts and differences alienate you.The teen years are a valid spiritual passage that she must go through in order to own her own faith. It's a time of challenging and questioning in all areas. Your teen needs to wrestle with God. But the struggle needs to be between your teen and God, not between your teen and you. Keep your head out of the sand when it comes to knowing the cultural influences on your teen. Take wise and deliberate action to help them keep these in right perspective. When your teen talks about the culture listen without moralizing. Talk to your teen about these cultural messages. Bring up sex, drugs, violence and ethics. She may resist but remember she is trying to sort it out. Your teen needs you to be clear, explicit and direct about your views. Teens need love, self-control, values, restraint and a sense of responsibility for their lives. They don't come by these without the hard work of their parents. Teens become disconnected from their parents when they believe neither knew or cared about what they felt. Parents should learn to listen without preaching. They should provide love and support and empathize with their teen's struggle. When your teen is underachieving, being disrespectful, or acting out there is always an underlying reason. It is the parent's job to sift and dig below the surface to address the root cause. Problems caused by irresponsibility, immaturity, defiance, self-centeredness and impulsiveness can often be addressed by enforcing consequences. However the problem can be caused by emotional detachment, hurt or discouragement and no amount of bounders setting will work with someone who is down. When you set boundaries on a discouraged teen it only increases their discouragement. This type of teen needs to be lifted up and give grace. Begin with love so that the teen will see that her behavior is the problem and not an out of control angry parent. Love helps the teen point to herself as the problem. Love opens the door to change and truth provides the guidance in the form of rules, requirements and expectations.Teens need to know what the line is so they can decide whether or not to cross it. Appropriate rules help your teen to see that structure and responsibility are normal and expected in life. Then give your teen freedom to accept or reject the rules and the reality of the consequences. They need to face consequences to experience that good behavior brings good results and bad behavior brings bad results. Accept that it is normal for your teens to resist the limits parents set. So love your teen, stay connected to her, and support that wrestling process.Let your teen participate in the process of setting house rules. Be willing to compromise on matters of preference and style but not on matters of principle. Teens often lash out in anger when they are given boundaries. In these cases you need to contain your teen's feelings. Containing is something you do inside yourself, in \\"being with\\" your teen. It is not what you say as much as how present you are. You are allowing yourself to experience your teen's wrath, fury and disappointment with you. This is no small task. It takes work. Containing involves maintaining eye contact, being warm, and not being overwhelmed, defensive, or disrupted by your teen's emotion. It tells your teen \\"Your anger and frustration are real, but our relationship is larger than those feelings. They don't scare me away, and they don't need to scare you either.\\" This helps the teen feel more stable inside and more receptive to you later.Listen empathically is the ability to hear and understand what your teen is saying from her perspective. Empathy allows you to join in and connect and let your teen know she is understood. To do this you need to put your own experience on a backburner. Before you reach a decision about the rightness or wrongness, be understanding and compassionate. Look for feelings of sadness, hurt, rejection or frustration below the facts. The real work is to have empathy when your teen has rage toward you. Let your teen have her anger but don't personalize it. Teens need to have their own feelings and to know what acceptable anger feels like. When your teen disagrees, say, \\"Interesting thought. Why do you think that\\"? This approach disarms much of the challenge and provocation. As a parent you are your teen's primary teacher for learning how to disagree and have respect."},{"Title":"Boundaries with Teens: When to Say Yes, How to Say No","review":"When I read this book, it was like someone peeking into our lives.

Having raised 7 children 2 generations ago we thought we could handle this assignment. Today's children are another issue.In reading Dr Townsend's book we found grandpa, grandma, and the teen described exactly in the book. Unfortunately under the title \\"This is what not to do\\".

Teenagers do make sense and there is a clear and reasonable way to help them navigate their way through the culture and their emotions.The book first underlines the importance of boundaries. It then goes on to explain that parents need to have healthy boundaries in order to pass on boundaries to their teens. It ends with specific ways of enforcing boundaries with your teens. The emphasis of the book is to use love and limits to create an internally-integrated adult out of a teen; in other words, the teens internally adopt the boundaries you show them so they have their own independent structure.I am currently going back through the book to take notes. The book has a lot of information to digest and since the information is so practical I want to make sure I won't forget it when I have the opportunity to apply it.

Dr. Townsend struck gold in both areas.This book read like an organized set of shared thoughts and lessons from an experienced dad, who is also a good friend. Dr. Townsend's descriptions of teen behaviors and situations were realistic, and his approaches to resolving conflicts and helping teens develop the life skills they need were logical and full of common sense. I really liked his repeated focus on preparing teens for their future as mature, independent adults living in the real world. A strong, but not dominating religious [Christian] overtone helped keep things in perspective for me, and nicely complemented the main points and focus of the book.The book is organized into four parts: 1 - Be a Parent with Boundaries; 2 - Understand the Teenage World; 3 - Set Boundaries with Your Teen; and 4 - Address Common Problems. Although the chapters in Part Four are what I imagine most parents will want to immediately skip to, I found the introspective value of the first three parts equally important, and they deepened my understanding and appreciation for the wisdom contained in the Part Four chapters -Academic Problems; Aggressive Behavior; Alcohol, Drugs, and Dependencies; Argumentativeness; Breaking Agreements; Chores; Clothing; Curfew Violations; Cutting and Self-Mutilation; Deception and Lying; Defiance; Detaching from the Family in Unhealthy Ways; Disrespect; Driving and Cars; God and Spirituality; Ignoring Parents; Impulsive Behaviors; Internet; Money; Moodiness; Parties; Peers; Phone; Runaways; Sexual Involvement; Silence.The below quotes/excerpts from the book are just a small sample of the many \`nuggets of wisdom' that lead me to recommend this book to anyone involved in any way with teenagers.\\"...the purpose of this book, to show you how to help your adolescent shoulder responsibility for her actions, attitudes, and speech so that she learns the gift of self-control and ownership over her life. The whole process starts with you, the parent...All teens want the freedom to do what they want when they want. They need to learn that freedom is earned and that they can gain freedom by demonstrating responsibility. Adolescence is the time in life when kids are supposed to learn this lesson...boundaries are one's personal property line. They are how you define yourself, say who you are and who you are not, set limits, and establish consequences if people are attempting to control you. When you say \\"no\\" to someone's bad behavior, you are setting a boundary. Boundaries are good for you and good for the other person, for boundaries help people clarify what they are and are not responsible for in life...Boundaries function somewhat like the trunk of a tree. The trunk holds the leaves, fruit, and roots together. However, all trees with strong trunks started out as weak saplings. They needed to be tied to a stake because they couldn't yet handle their own weight. They needed to lean on and be supported by something outside themselves. Then, in time, the trees matured and took over that job for themselves...Parents are the stake for their teens...If all goes well, teens will ultimately and safely discard their parents' structure and, using their own structure, be able to meet the demands of adult life and responsibility...teens...live in the present; it's all about what they are doing this second. Teenagers have little interest in, awareness of, or concern about the future. They live their lives pushing the 'Urgent' button. That's why parents need to create an 'Important' button for themselves and their teen. They need to guide their children in the right direction...So keep in mind that the future preparation is, in the final analysis, ultimately more important than the present difficulty.\\""},{"Title":"Boundaries with Teens: When to Say Yes, How to Say No","review":"Dr. John Townsend has done parents everywhere a favor. Taking principles straight from Scripture, Dr. Townsend explores the necessity of boundaries in the lives of parents while also showing them how to set loving but firm boundaries in the lives of their teens. The result is a Scripturally guided handbook for dealing with various problems that teens might be facing as well as firm but loving guidelines to help ensure that issues don't come up in the first place. Whether your children's issues are more complicated or are rather simple, by using the guidelines laid out in this book, you will have the understanding and the tools necessary to resolve them. Through the pages of this book, parents will be equipped with tools for learning methods of communication that foster openness between parents and teens. You will also receive guidance to help your see who they are becoming and help them to plan and accomplish goals for the future.Boundaries With Teens is also very user friendly. The easy to use index aids in quickly finding the information you need at any given moment.When used for the purposes that it is meant for, that is as a guidance manual, Boundaries with Teens is a very useful tool to put into the hands of struggling parents.DISCLOSURE: I received a free copy of this book from Zondervan for purposes of review.

Having now read the book I agree with those that rate it highly and totally disagree with the guy who gave it one star. I mean, he didn't even read it and seemed to be talking about an entirely different book. A book called 'Good Golf Made Easy'is obviously about instruction and not the rules of the game which he seemed to think. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and found the concepts pretty easy to grasp.

The source of the world's meditative practices are the Pyramid Texts themselves. Called \\"The Book of Coming into Light\\" these writings show how, through correct meditation, one can open the Third Eye and achieve Enlightenment. The Short Path tells how C. H.

Because he is a physics professor from a big university, Harvey writes in a very no nonsense, no mystic metaphors type style. He's not trying to be spiritually \\"deep\\" with you.

He's good at his job, but he has developed the ambition of becoming an officer, if only so he can go back home someday and swagger into his old haunts with a sash and sword. Meanwhile, though, he's sent off with Col. McCandless, General Wellesley's head of intelligence, to locate and drag back a traitorous lieutenant from the East India Company who has changed sides and is now fighting as a major with the army of an enemy rajah. Wellesley is seeking battle with yet another traitorous Company man who commands the rajah's huge army, and Sharpe, McCandless, and the general will all reconverge at the Battle of Assaye -- which, even after Waterloo, Wellesley (now Duke of Wellington) still considered his own greatest victory. As always, the plot is complex, with numerous subplots, the action is meticulously and accurately described, the characters are entirely believable, and the narrative will carry you right along. Sharpe continues on his way up the ladder of promotion and the reader will be following right behind him."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I typically don't like books that depicts battles since I find them hard to follow, but this one I liked.

While not comparable to O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels, the Sharpe novels are solid historical novels, focussing on the British Army's battles in India and then in the Iberian Peninsula during the Napoleonic Wars, and on the military genius of Wellington (acting through Sharpe and his stalwart sergeant Harper) and they're thumping good reads."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"On a Richard Sharpe timeline this is the second volume in the series , but not in the order of publication. This is also the second of the novels to take place in India.The year is 1803 and Sergeant Richard Sharpe is an assistant in the armory at Seringapatam ; his malevolent mortal enemy Obadiah Hakeswill is plotting his revenge ; Arthur Wellesley's army is preparing to move against the armies of the Mahratta confederation. All of the elements are in place for a great tale from Bernard Cornwell , and the reader is not to be disappointed!The tale's start has Sergeant Sharpe lying wounded at a East India company outpost which has been treacherously attacked by a renegade officer , Lieutenant Dodd , leading a company of sepoy deserters. Sharpe manages to survive the massacre and reports the events to the kindly Scottish Colonel McCandless , the chief of Wellesley's intelligence service. McCandless , accompanied by Sharpe , sets after Dodd ,now a Major in Colonel Anthony Pohlmann's compoo ( an Indian version of a regiment) , a component of the Mahratta leader Scindia's army. Meanwhile Obadiah Hakeswill has schemed against Sharpe and has obtained an arrest warrant to aid in his plot to destroy and rob our hero of his riches obtained in &quot;Sharpe's Tiger&quot;.All of these elements come together at the obscure Indian village of Assaye--the scene of Arthur Wellesley's greatest military triumph. In the course of the battle , Sharpe is commissioned an Ensign by Wellesley , and the career of Richard Sharpe set in motion. This is one of the very best battles in all of the Sharpe novels I have read so far (I am up to eleven to date); probably the best of the three &quot;Indian Chronicles&quot; .Highly recommended , and very entertaining. Five stars."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"With the possible exceptions of Edgar Ride Burroughs (Tarzan or his Mars series) and Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes) I cannot think of another writer who has written a series of books with the same hero so very well; maintaining the reader's interest, a high level of historic research, interesting characters, and intriguing plots. This book is one of that series and I have read them all and loved every one. Author Bernard Cornwell has not been able to maintain the same level in his non-Sharpe novels but the Sharpes are cracking good."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"The Sharpe novels may not be great literature, but you know what you're getting and all the new &quot;India&quot; novels maintain the level of quality and entertainment value Sharpe fans have come to expect.

This book tells the story well, with fewer trumpets and pennants than choking dust and stifling Indian heat."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I enjoy researching Battles and Cornwell does a great job of describing how this Battle was fought while at the same time giving us the story of Richard Sharpe. The map at the front of the edition I have showing the deployment and subsequent tactical redeployment of the opposing forces makes a nice accompaniament to Cornwell's depiction of how Wellington deployed his forces."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Readers of Cornwell's Sharpe series have long been tantalized by references to infantry Sergeant Sharpe being raised (promoted) from the ranks of the enlisted men to the gentleman's officer corps by Lord Wellington in gratitude for having saved his life on the battlefield at Assaye in India, back in 1803. In this volume, we finally get the full story behind that seminal event in Sharpe's career, one that is mentioned in every volume in the series. At the time, a number of Indian princes (the Mahratta confederation) had banded together to resist further British incursion into their territory, and assembled a massive army of European-led units along with local and Arab mercenaries. As in many of the other books, Sharpe is sent on a small mission and ends up meeting the main villain of the piece, here a renegade English officer who is part of the Mahratta forces. Sharpe is later detailed to help capture the rogue officer, leading him to Wellington's first major set piece battle, at Assaye. And while the book is ostensibly a Sharpe book, it is this battle which Cornwell is clearly most interested in, and with good reason. In defeating an army some 10-20 times its number and equal equipment, Wellington's victory is one the great feats of military history (one which he ranked above his more famous win at Waterloo). Cornwell's recreation of the battle makes it eminently clear that two Scottish Highlander regiments (the 74th and 78th won the day for the British.Many of the usual Sharpe elements are there, bloody fighting, foul villains (including the odious Sgt. Hakeswill), treachery, and climactic massive battle. What's more interesting about this book, however, is how different this younger Sharpe is from the scarred veteran we meet in the Peninsular Wars. He has yet to be in a real battle, and is clearly tentative and bewildered by the fog of battle. He's on his own, with no men of his own to command, and without a sidekick to add any dram of levity to the tale (although the dour, Bible-thumping, vegetarian, Scottish Colonel he's attached to is a somewhat comic figure at times). There is a woman he beds, but she&#65533;s much more peripheral to the plot compared with the ladies of Spain and Portugal Sharpe later encounters. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is when he is tempted by the offer to become an officer in the Mahratta army, with men to command, and riches to follow. He is clearly wavering but his true dream is to be able to return to his gutter origins wearing a British officer's uniform, the only one that counts."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Cornwell takes us back to India in this book and the action is as intense as the novels set in Spain and France. These novels focusing on Sharpe's early career are especially interesting because the show him without the support of his Riflemen and without the officer's rank that is the source of much of his pride and many of his problems.But this is the novel where Sergeant Sharpe suddenly realizes that his ambitions go far beyond his non-commissioned rank. And in making the decision to try to rise to officer he knows that he is consigning himself to an almost certain death, because his only chance to become an officer is through an act of suicidal bravery on the battlefield that is noticed by a senior officer.The decision to attack at Assaye by Sir Arthur Wellesley gives Sharpe his opportunity. Longtime readers of the Sharpe novels know what he did to get himself promoted at Assaye, and Cornwell does his usual masterful job in describing this horrific, heroic deed.This book has everything Sharpe fans have come to love, and anyone who has never read this series should gather up their pennies and carve out a few weekends to devour them all. You'll find yourself addicted."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"This is the second novel of Sgt. Sharpe's early service (following TIGER), set in exotic India with places, battles, and currents of empire-building of which most American's haven't the faintiest idea. Here we finally see the enigmatic event (long alluded to in the original Sharpe series set later in Spain) that forever indebts the future Duke of Wellington to Sharpe; that icy young general in not one but two brilliant actions; Sharpe at his most ferocious ever; Sgt. Hakesbill at his absolute evil worst, consumed with jealousy and private revenge; and Sharpe receiving his first promotion to officer. After a meandering buildup, which includes a convincing Temptation of Sharpe by private pay, the climactic battle scene is horrendous, a vast set piece in front of Assaye where we witness the extreme heroism of the steadfast Scottish 78th under shot, shell, and shrapnel, 600 men (at the start) who rout 100,000. Just incredible. The battle that made the reputation of imperturbable Wellington. As usual, Cornwell brings the era alive through his details of everyday life, without the excessive technical fascination of techno-novels."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Cornwell does it again with another installment in this highly readable series. This novel deals with probably the most amazing battle of the entire series, Wellington's early &quot;Triumph&quot; at Assaye. Cornwell's writing overall has gotten progressively better as the series has progressed. Here his prose crackles with energy in the battle scenes (especially Sharpe's long fabled and finally recreated rescue of Wellington) and gives us some of Sharpe's best personal moments when he is offered a position as a mercenary. Will he leave the British enlisted ranks to seek his fortune as a soldier for hire? Long time readers know the answer but it still makes for good reading. Of course I would be remiss not to mention the appearance of Obidiah Hakeswill. Cornwell knows he has a classic villian on his hands and he plays it to the hilt making his evil Sergeant worse than ever. This is a must read for fans of the series and an interesting historical novel about Wellington's most amazing military feat."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"This is the second of the Sharpe books I have read and the second in the series chronologically even though they were not published in this order. Already I am picking up on what I suspect may be a recurring formula for these books: an amicable working relationship with a somewhat disinterested senior officer, another senior officer who acts as a mentor, an ephemeral love interest, the sub-plot of the antagonist character (Hakeswill) dogging Sharpe's every step, the obscure battle (Ahmednugger) that acts as a precursor for the main conflict, the climactic battle in which Sharpe proves himself to his superiors, and the temporary resolution of tension while leaving enough loose ends for the next novel. This is exactly what I usually dislike about serialized novels.However, Cornwell does such an excellent job of creating realistic characters as Sharpe, McCandless, Hakeswill, as well as putting a human face on the true life characters of Wellington, Wallace, Pohlman, etc., that this novel stands far above the usual formulaic novels of the genre. Sharpe is not a monofaceted hero without flaws and, like most of us, experiences conflicting emotions and motivations. The malignant Hakeswill, a coward at heart, is obsessed with Sharpe's demise even to the detriment of his own career.But what truly makes this a first rate novel (and series for that matter) is historical accuracy. While concurrently reading Jac Weller's &quot;Wellington in India&quot;, one can trace every detail of the battles of Ahmednugger and Assaye in Sharpe's Triumph. Indeed, Cornwell himself praises Weller's trilogy on Wellington and uses it as his primary historical reference. So even though plot development may be a bit predictable on the fictional side, the historical aspects of this novel are so solid and absorbing that the result is a perfect piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"In this latest chapter in the life of Richard Sharpe, Bernard Cornwell takes us back to 1803 and Sharpe's life as a seargent in Wellsley's army. In Triumph, Cornwell gives readers more of the great historical fiction they have come to expect, while showing them a different side of Richard Sharpe. Having already written the end of the series, chronologically, Cornwell does a masterful job of showing us the young Richard Sharpe and relating experiences that help shape this character into the bold rifleman we know him to be. As always, the battle descriptions are excellent, and the attention to detail, within the fictional context, makes it all the more fascinating. Sharpe readers may find this book a little different than the others in the series in that a good portion of the book does not specifically involve Sharpe. I would recommend this book to any Shape reader and I would also suggest ordering Sharpe's Fortress, currently out in Britain, from Amazon.comUK. Once i found out these books were available in England I just couldn't wait to get them."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Sharpe\`s Triumph is set in India around 1803. Richard Sharpe is a Sargent in one of the latest of the series by Bernard Cornwell. In this book he meets his ruthless enemy again, Sargent Oberdiah Hakeswill, who is intent on ruining Sharpe\`s career and life, but Sharpe has other amitions and fulfills them in an act of suicidal bravery at the battle of Assaye, where he saves the life of the then Major-General Authur Wellesley, who was soon to become the famous Duke of Wellinton. I really enjoyed this book because it is of the usual high standard that Bernard Cornwell insists on working in, and that is a good thing. I think that people who enjoy Bernard Cornwell\`s books would definately enjoy this book, the only regrets that I have about this book are that there was no cheerful, grinning Sargent Harper (see Sharpe\`s Rifles), and that, as allways, the books never seem to go on long enough."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Richard Sharpe is the definitive Bernard Cornwell hero -- poor, uneducated, intelligent, strong, witty, and ruthless. \\"Sharpe's Triumph\\" is the second book in Cornwell's \\"India Trilogy,\\" which kicks off Cornwell's epic Richard Sharpe series that clocks in at well over 10 books. Fans of Cornwell's other books will see nothing to surprise them here, and that's a compliment. If you haven't read any of Cornwell's books, you should start with \\"Sharpe's Tiger,\\" the first novel in the India Trilogy.Four years have passed since Sharpe first won his sergeant's stripes in \\"Sharpe's Tiger.\\" Rationing the wealth he took off the dead Indian warlord, the Tippoo, Sharpe is living a pretty darn good life. All that is shattered by two events. The first occurs when Sharpe runs afoul of William Dodd, a British turncoat who now fights for profit for the Mahratta warlords. Dodd slaughters a British post and nearly does in Sharpe in the process. Soon, Sharpe is riding alongside the Scottish intelligence legend Colonel McCandless to track Dodd down and bring him to justice.The second event is largely unknown to Sharpe, and that is the hatching of a revenge plot by Sharpe's nemesis, Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill. Sharpe left Hakeswill to die with the tigers in the last novel, but like so many fictional heroes he didn't stay around to witness Hakeswill's demise. So Hakeswill escapes, and has concocted a scheme wherein he will use the draconian system of British military law to lay Sharpe low.All this boils in the seething cauldron of General Wellesley's 1803 Indian Campaign that sees Wellesley lead the Brits in two of the Empires most famous battles - one a lightning attack on a walled city, and another a field battle while vastly outnumbered at the village of Assaye. These real-world events helped the young General grow into Lord Wellington, future foe of Napoleon, and in the hands of Cornwell, it's easy to see why they made the young man's reputation.As Cornwell's fans will attest, the man has no equal when it comes to describing a battlefield in understandable, riveting prose. He never loses control of the battlefield, tactics and strategy are clear, the carnage is undeniable, and he even injects a classic British sense of pageantry and honor into the maelstrom. In \\"Sharpe's Triumph,\\" not only do we get to see Sharpe dealing death the way only Sharpe can, we also get treated to extended passages focusing on how the dreaded Scottish infantry marches into, and through, certain death to win the battle. Cornwell never loses control or perspective, yet it is clear that the British army had more than its share of supermen in its anonymous infantry ranks.Clocking in at under 300 pages, \\"Sharpe's Triumph\\" is a concise, lean tome, even by Cornwell's standards. For thrills, for laughs, and for a sense of place and time, you must read the Sharpe Series, and \\"Sharpe's Triumph\\" is a fine entry into that saga."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"This is number two in the series and is typical of Bernard Cornwell with detailed accounts of historical events that support the storyline of his work. Action packed throughout. Easy reading but hard to put down."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Sharpe's triumph tracks the adventures of Richard Sharpe during the Mahratta campaign, which had its climax at the battle of Assaye.In later years The Iron Duke, Lord Wellington, was to say that this was his favorite battle. And no wonder. In those days he was simply Arthur Wellesley and yet had to make himself a reputation.He began to do so with the siege of Ahmednuggur, where he ordered a rapid esclalade of the walls with ladders instead of a protracted siege of the city. This was to become a trademark move for Wellington. He has often been criticised for the waste of life of his troops at sieges such as Badajoz and Salamanca. But such critics seem to forget that Wellington did not have the luxury of the time needed for protracted sieges during the peninsular campaign. He needed to strike fast and win fast before the French could concentrate against him.He may have learned from Ahmednuggur that a brash opportunist can quickly seize a city through sheer surprise, when the enemy expects a cautious siege.But Ahmednuggur was only the prelude to Assaye, where Wellington faced a combined Mahratta force outnumbering his army many times. With an eye to the lay of the land that was to become another of his trademarks, Wellington realised that he could outflank the Mahratta army if he could cross the river in front of their position. Locals assured him that there was no ford of the river, but Wellesley reasoned that two Indian villages would not be sited just across the river from each other if they could not communicate. He personally led the reconnaissance and found the ford he needed.However, the Mahratta army, well led by European Officers, performed a smart turning manoeuvre and managed to counter Wellingtons master stroke. But in the process they lost any room for their huge cavalry force to operate.In narrow confines the superior fighting qualities of the british infantry proved too much for the Indians, who fell back. Wellington also made brilliant use of his own small cavalry force to smash his enemies, to win a battle that immediately catapulted him to the forefront of the military.Sharpe fans will love how our old friend Richard (now a mere Sergeant) is able to see both sides of the conflict. The senior Mahratta European officer, Anthony Pohlman, offers him a life of wealth and luxury for his services when he visits the enemy camp on a spying mission with Colonel McCandless. But Sharpe resists and finds himself holding spare horses for Wellesley at Assaye.With a vengeful Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill on his tale Sharpe knows that only a promotion to officer will save his bacon, and the only sure route to promotion is bravery on the field. The rest is history (or at least it seems so at this stage)A great and exciting read and another wonderful Sharpe adventure."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"An historically well researched tale wherein our intrepid hero manages to cover himself in glory, again, while simultaneously evading his usual band of sworn enemies.Entertaining and fast moving as always.

The Sharpe series looks like a more \\"grown-up\\" Flashman. The books appear to be just as accurately researched and the writing is very good.This story starts with a massacre which Sharpe miraculously survives, goes on to the siege of the city of Ahmednuggur where Wellesley first demonstrates his military audacity, and ends in the hard-fought (and well-described) battle of Assaye. Throughout this overall arc there is an understory involving a hated pursuit of Sharpe by Sergeant Hawkswill (who first appeared in \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\") and Sharpe's own pursuit (aided by Colonel McCandless, whom Sharpe had befriended in the earlier novel) of the instigator of the massacre that opened up the tale.This is an exciting and engrossing read. The characters are perhaps a little cliche but keep the story flowing and the entertainment on the go. The battles are really very well described incorporating that \\"fog of war\\" one so often hears about. I finished this book wondering how men could endure such violent brutality - but evidently they did. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I have read all of the Sharpe's novels and have seen the TV shows and movies.

I highly recommend his books, especially Richard Sharpe."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Sharpe's Triumph is a worthy if less entertaining and surprising successor to Sharpe's Tiger. Indeed, there is not much wrong with the ST except the onset of a formulaic pattern. Richard Sharpe is, apparently a killing machine--a 19th century James Bond, without polish and without maritinis (cheap arrack will suffice nicely).The officer rescued in installment #1, who helped our hero earn his sergeant stripes becomes mentor and father figure in #2 and enlists Sharpe to help him track down a rogue officer who has gone native, literally helping the Redcoats' enemies. Surprisingly Sharpe's nemesis in Tiger survives into Triumph--always remember to be sure the tigers are hungry before you throw your enemy to them, folks.What keeps this seeming as silly as its bare bones description is Cornwell's skill as a narrator and the still interesting exotic environs of India. This could however wear thin if each subsequent edition becomes just more of the same, with Sharpe moving relentlessly, ever-upward. One Fire and Ice fantasy is more than enough for my taste. We shall see...."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I love the RIchard Sharpe books.

These novels follow the career of Sergeant Richard Sharpe in the British army. Sharpe's Triumph is the second novel of the series.In this novel Sharpe is the only survivor of a massacre. The attack is lead by the ruthless Major Dodd. Dodd is a traitorous British officer who has sold his services to a local Indian prince.Sharpe teams with Colonel McCandless to pursue Dodd. In the pursuit of Dodd, Sharpe and McCandless join the army of Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. (Wellington will be the victorious general at the Battle of Waterloo.)Sharpe himself is pursued by the evil Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill. Hakeswill hates Sharpe because of the events in the first novel. Hakeswill has falsely obtained a warrant for the arrest of Sharpe. His plan is to arrest Sharpe and then kill him.Sharpe is not a perfect hero. He can be gallant and heroic. But he can also be ruthless and cruel. Although he is only a sergeant, Sharpe dreams of returning to England as an officer - an impossible dream in British army of the early 1800s.The British army in the early nineteenth century was a hard, cruel, deadly experience. Cornwell's novel gives us a glimpse into the gritty reality of that era."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"My second read in the series.

Still, all in all a good read."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"The Richard Sharpe novels of Bernard Cornwell rank among the great works of military fiction and are all wonderful adventure stories, but 'Sharpe's Triumph' doesn't quite have the same punch as those earlier works. Richard Sharpe, a Sergeant in the King's Army for four years, is sent on a dangerous mission to capture a former East India Company Lieutenant who is now a Major in the forces of an Indian prince. Sharpe, resolute as always, determines to find the traitor and bring him to justice in the hopes that this success will reward him with an officer's commission. But hot on his tail is Sharpe's old enemy Obidiah Hakeswill, a man so vile that he will stop at nothing to get his revenge. While it was fun to see characters like Hakeswill and Colonel McCandless again, the story boggs down at times. Missing is the humor that Sharpe's future Sergeant Harper brought to the series and the tense drama of fighting the armies of Napoleon. The view Cornwell gives us of the battle of Assaye, however, is stunning. Only Cornwell could make batttlefield action come alive in such a brilliant and unmistakable way. Fans of the series should check this one out but if you're new to the world of Richard Sharpe may I recommend starting with either 'Sharpe's Tiger,' or 'Sharpe's Rifles.'"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Most of the Sharpe books I had read over a very short interval and the Cornwell formula started to get too dreary and predictable.

Just great!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Up front, I'll tell everyone that I haven't had the pleasure of reading this book yet. However, I've read 12 of the Sharpe's books, and have 2 yet more to read and am looking forward to them with relish.Aside from the great stories, Cornwell deserves praise on two counts.First, the Historical Notes at the end of each book. Cornwell makes sure to point out what little bits of history he had to change to tell Sharpe's story. I admire his honesty.Second, I don't know how Cornwell did it, but he had Sharpe's entire backstory written before he wrote the first book. I love that now he's going back and writing the story of each of these little tidbits that are distributed so well through the entire series.The second greatest joy with these books is getting someone else to read them, and talking to them after each book. I've had the pleasure of addicting my father on these books. Now I have to get them back from him.If you haven't read these books, grab a copy of Sharpe's Tiger and start in!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I recommend this to all shapre fans. However, I would not recommend it to people who are virgins to the Sharpe series. I would tell them to start out with Sharpe's Rifles.

Like the book before its building on the Sharpe character by showing how he became to be an officer. We also see the younger version of Sharpe, the Sharpe who has not yet commanded troops, the Sharpe who has only ever received orders opposed to giving them. It's different to the future books in that respect and if your a fan of the Sharpe series you see it gives Sharpe's Character alot more Depth. On top of that we get a great action book and an in-depth history lesson.The date is 1803, Muslim armies supported by Arab and European mercenaries are planning an invasion of India. McCandless drafts Sharpe from his quiet post, where he has spent the last 4 years, to hunt down a renegade English soldier. During his time behind enemy lines Sharpe is faced with great temptations and its down to him to decide his allegiance. To the British army, or to the Mahratta army. His choice is an obvious one and as the story progresses, by doing what he does best, being a soldier, Sharpe finds himself in a situation where the outcome will change his life forever.It's a great story and a great lesson in history. A tiny British army is faced by a huge Mahratta army, the British are vastly outnumbered and outgunned but with true British determination they go forward and fight. The rest is history, enjoy the book, I did.4 Stars"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Sharpe's Triumph describes the seminal event that gave birth to what is the dominant theme of the 19-book Sharpe series. By rescuing his commanding officer and then being rewarded with a commission, our \\"son of a common whore\\" begins his rise into the officer ranks, where he has to deal with the disdain of the aristocrats and the distrust of the soldiers.Cornwell has created a deeply complex character in Sharpe. He's caught between the rock of his ambition to be more than a foot soldier and the hard place of an officer corps that is less than welcoming to someone from the gutter. Before Assaye, Sharpe was never totally happy, but after his triumph, readers will see surliness become his dominant mood. He's growing into the scarred, mean-tempered officer of the Peninsula campaign.A final note about Cornwell's description of the Battle of Assaye, which Wellington called his greatest victory. There's almost a surreal quality to it. Whereas Wellington was always outnumbered when fighting the French later, here there are suicidal odds against him, 20 to 1 by some reckonings. I kept expecting him to break off the engagement, but he never did until he'd won the field. It feels like three or four of your buddies and you are taking on the college football team. As a result, there's an intimate quality to the undertaking. With so few troops under his command, you understand how Wellington could control the battle as well as he did. And the fact that he would personally lead a charge against a battery makes sense. It's like seeing a great band at a small college hangout years before they are doing stadium tours.In some Sharpe stories, he's the center of the action; in others, he's just one exciting part of a larger story. Sharpe's Triumph belongs to the latter category. It's a tribute to Cornwell that he can write both types so well. This is the book where we see that Cornwell's inspiration for writing about the Napoleonic Wars was at least partially the fascinating figure of the Duke of Wellington."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"The adventure continues, along with some old characters, and some new.

Still hooked."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I read somewhere that SHARPE'S EAGLE was the first book written in the series by Bernard Cornwell and then he wrote SHARPE'S TIGER, which, chronologically, is set in 1799, four years before SHARPE'S TRIUMPH. That didn't keep me from beginning the series with this book, which is a rousing adventure story full of derring-do, knick-of-time escapes, and terrific battle scenes. Sgt. Richard Sharpe is a real \\"man's man\\" and comes across as being both noble, human, and rough around the edges at the same time. He's neither a saint, nor is he a sinner. Like most of us, he's a combination of both, but knows when it is time to do the right thing simply because that's what he must do...though he does struggle with his conscience now and then wondering if he really should stick his neck out. Fortunately, for all, especially Sir Arthur Wellesley, Sgt. Sharpe is close at hand when desperately needed and more than earns the promotion from ranker to gentleman (Though Sir Arthur, while grateful, does harbor upperclass beliefs about common men rising above their station). That said, I'm looking forward to reading all of the Sharpe books in chronological order.

After the introduction of Sharpe's early years fighting for King George in &quot;Tiger&quot;, we now are given the understanding of his ever burning passion for advancement - his field promotion by Wellesley from Sergeant to Ensign was presaged by an offer of a lieutenancy in the Mahratta army. Cornwell again gives a detailed and bloody account of this &quot;against the odds&quot; battle by Wellesley versus an army 20 times his size. It's a lovely story, and I can't wait until the next book (already available in the UK) is published here.I'm addicted to Sharpe."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"If you haven't yet read Sharpe's Tiger, I recommend that you begin your reading of this exciting series with that book. The characters and story in Sharpe's Triumph will make more sense that way.If you liked Sharpe's Tiger, you will probably enjoy Sharpe's Triumph even more. The story here is more historically accurate, the various battles are brilliantly described, and readers will find it easier to identify with Sharpe as the hero of the story.As the book opens, Sergeant Sharpe has been sent to pick up some ammunition . . . a seemingly dull assignment that soon becomes quite meaningful. There's a rogue lieutenant from the British East India Company who has a bounty on his head, and Sharpe is soon drawn into the search for Lieutenant Dodd and the sepoys he took with him.In the background, Sharpe has been enjoying a leisurely four years since he earned his sergeant's stripes in Sharpe's Tiger. The cushion that his wealth has brought is about to become a curse, however.In the search for Dodd, Sharpe is presented with the opportunity to better his station in life, meets a new love interest, and has some hard choices to make.The high point of the story comes in the detailed recounting of the Battle of Assaye which was important to defeating the Indian forces and helped establish the reputation of Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington).Those who don't want to read about the bloody side of war would do well to avoid this book."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"This is a fine book about a forgotten but important battle in a long-gone empire. The battle of Assaye, won against far superior numbers of natives and European mercenaries by a great general who made his reputation there, quelled native revolt and let the British push north into previously unoccupied parts of India.Richard Sharpe is a sergeant here, longing for promotion to officer but with scant chance of it in the class-constrained British army. He is detached to hunt a deserter who has gone over to the other side, to become a coldblooded but effective officer. Sharpe is the sole survivor of a massacre by Major William Dodd's troops, and wants him taken down.Dodd serves Colonel Anthony Pohlmann, also a defector from the East India Company. Now army commander of the Mahratta Confederation, he has become in the process a fabulously rich, elephant-riding, harem-keeping nabob. Sharpe must weigh Pohlmann's atractive offer to change sides himself, and meanwhile dodge a trumped-up criminal charge levied by an enemy suspecting Sharpe's deepest secret.The period and place detail are excellent. The descriptions of India under the British Raj reminded me of Fraser's \\"Flashman in the Great Game\\", although the Flashman black comedies are quite different in tone.Bernard Cornwell writes Sharpe with some subtlety. His overall detail compares with Patrick O'Brian's, although not his tale's charm. Cornwell's battlefield descriptions of Assaye - not only of the battle itself but of its preliminary maneuvers - are exemplary. Readers of military fiction know how hard it can be for authors to describe multiple units maneuvering over complicated terrain, responding to each other simultaneously and in the smoke of chaos, and for readers to keep it all straight. Cornwell makes it all crystal clear despite the passage's length and the battle's complexity. And Cornwell plausibly fits the fictional Sharpe into a key moment of the historical general's career.I do have a few problems with Sharpe's character development. In opening chapters he is portrayed as scheming to embezzle part of an ammunition shipment. Petty graft like this may have been common among noncoms in India (and a lot of wars) but it's an odd way to depict someone intended to be developed as the hero of twenty or so historical novels. Perhaps Cornwell does it to dramatize the grim life and outlook of the enlisted ranks,and of someone from Sharpe's low birth, but it didn't work for me.A flaw, but not enough to compromise an otherwise excellent story."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"In this earlier installment of the Richard Sharpe series, we find Sgt. Sharpe performing his duties with the Royal Army in India. He is assigned to commissary duties and likes his CO and likes even more his newly received stripes. When he leads a group on a mission to pick up some ammunition recovered by the local garrison, though, things change. He is the sole survivor when a turncoat British officer conducts a massacre while attempting to retrieve the same ammunition. It is only dumb luck and a need to relieve himself that spares him.Since he is the only person who has actually seen the officer in question, he is assigned to help the intelligence officer tasked to bring him in. In doing so, the mercenary leader to whom the turncoat defected offers Sharpe a commission and gets him to thinking. He would like to be an officer. He is not, however, willing to betray the trust of those he likes. Still, the seed of the idea is planted.Those tasked with taking the defector are attached to Wellington's army. It is his first big campaign. Sharpe has come to Wellington's notice before but, in this installment, we finally get to read the story in which he saves Wellington's life during the climactic battle. The result is a commission for Sharpe and the expectation by everyone is that he will fail. You only have to read the original series to know how wrong that expectation is.This is neither Cornwell's best nor his worst. It does fill in a big piece of the Sharpe story and is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"After his Richard Sharpe series set in the Napoleonic Wars was an established success, Bernard Cornwall went back to write several prequels, including a trllogy set in 1803 India, of which this is the middle volume. This is the first Sharpe book I've read, although I have seen several of the BBC adaptations.This is a successful story, with adventures, interesting characters, and what definitely seems to be a thoroughly researched historical setting. A major character is the young Arthur Wellesley, eventually to be known to history as the Duke of Wellington. Several other characters are real historic figures, far less well-known.The villains in this book are not especially successful. Obadiah Hakeswill, in particular, is completely uninteresting, given little motivation and a series of repetitive conversational tics instead of a personality. He seems like a bad imitation of a Dickens villain.What is strong, along with the main character, is the adventure and the local color.The obvious comparison would be to the naval fiction of Patrick O'Brian. O'Brian has, on the whole, more interesting and fully realized characters. But Cornwall is definitely more successful in writing battles. Part of this is that Cornwall actually explains what is going on; he doesn't share O'Brian's infuriating habit of assuming that the reader shares his own encyclopedic knowledge of contemporary naval tactics, construction, and jargon, and therefore wil never need an explanation."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Two weeks ago I bought this book on a whim. I'd never heard of the author or the series, but I was in the mood for some European historical fiction with a military theme. Little did I anticipate the addiction to which I would immediately succumb. At this point I've read four and I've ordered 5 more of the 13 remaining. I'm guessing I'll consume them all before September.The central character, Richard Sharpe, works his way through most of the major battles of the British military from India in 1803 to Waterloo, interacting with real figures of that time, the most notable of which is the Duke of Wellington. The series tracks Sharpe's struggle to overcome his humble beginnings and to discover in himself strengths and qualities he never realized existed. Each book traces Sharpe's extraordinary acts of bravery and leadership and chronicles his progress towards respect and self-actualization. And there's always a romance -- maybe even a wife eventually.The hero is significant and human. The villains are evil and powerful. The events are momentous. And there's a rags to riches thread that builds as each book sees Sharpe's reputation grow among those who would otherwise despise and demean him.There's truly never a dull moment.It's good reading, great fun and excellent escape."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"This is a sublime piece of historical fiction. We are taken back to the early days of Sharpe's adventursom career, when he was a lowly Sarjeant in the 33rd Foot (West Riddings) Aspiring to higher spheres of endeavor, Sharpe as usual must confront head-on the aristocratic and stilted system of promotion then existant in the British army. That system is personified in the character of Sir Arthur Wellsley. Cornwall's depiction of Sir Arthur, seems an astonishingly accurate one. Wellsley was cold, arrogant, and extremly compitent. The battle of Assaye (1803) which smashed the Mahratta confederation and paved the way for ultimate British conquest of India, was one of the Duke's most inspired and risky battles. He even rated it higher than Waterloo, and one is apt to almost agree with his opinion. As usual, Cornwall's depiction of napoleanic fighting is flawless. His description of Assaye is unsurpassed. Here sir Arthur confidantly lead his small army of 5,000 British and Seapoy troops against the Mahratta mass of over 40,000 and 100 guns. The advance of the 78th Highlanders, and their endurment of the horrific Mahratta bombardment must stand as one of the great epic infantry assults of the entire period. The two Scottish regiments in Sir Arthur's command, the 74th and 78th Highlanders, won the campaign for him, and Cornwall does not fail to do them justice in this long forgotton saga. Sir Arthur's victory at Assaye should dispel the notion that European armies defeated their colonial opponets by means soley of superior technology. Sheer determination, tactical brilliance, and iron discipline won the day for the British against an Indian opponet who was as well equipped as they, and far more numerous. Cornwall brilliantly depicts all these elements while giving us a colorful collection of characters, including a youthful Sharpe who must prove himself to become what he is later in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I have read all the Sharpe books and bought this particular chapter in England on a visit. At the time, the next in the series, Sharpe's Trafalgar was soon to come out, so I purchased it over amazon.co.uk and it too is wonderful.

This book, at last, tells the tale, and an exciting one it is! Cornwell is an excellent writer, with an eye for even the smallest detail. His description of the battle of Assaye is, in my mind, the finest portrayal of any Napoleonic-era fight that I have ever read.

Horrible Obadiah Hakewell appears in his usual role of villanous sargeant at a time when Sharpe was vulnerable to his particular brand of sadism.

The normally excellent Bernard Cornwell has written a story that, whilst undeniably of the same stable as the other Sharpe novels, differs sufficiently from his normal route as to lessen the impact the story would and should have had.Instead of our intrepid hero going off on his own to be the saviour of the day and the scurge of all evil, Sharpe spends most of his time as right hand man to the then Sir Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington.This book is largely speaking a filler between the excellent Sharpe's Tiger and the hopefully excellent Sharpe's Fortress and provides a weak second installment of the India years trilogy. Sharpe should have been in the middle of the battle of Assaye that this book depicts, and not way behind the lines watching with the commander of the British forces, making sure that his superior always has a horse.Coupled with this, the awful Obadiah Hakeswill makes an unnecessary appearance as he tries to frame Sharpe for assaulting a British officer and the bad guy is overplayed with repeated use of the word \\"Monsewer\\" when describing his French second-in-command. In fact, the main redeeming factor in this book is the interest that Cornwell raises in his ever-present Historical Note at the end which mentions the true story of this book's arch villain, Lieutenant William Dodd. It is always these historical notes that provide Cornwell books with that little extra spice, of knowing exactly what did and did not happen, and bringing closer the reader to the action.It is, however, with heavy heart that I have to say this particular Sharpe is unusual in its mediocrity. A tale that may have merited being told, but perhaps not one that required an entire book; at least, not one told in this way."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I have read all the Sharpe books and this one will not dissapoint, a historical masterpiece, fictional historic, or is it?"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"The second Cornwell novel I have read, and I thought it was spectacular!

Highly recommended for anyone who likes history or adventure."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"The Indian Mahratta Confederation is doing everything it can to drive the British from India, including hiring European officers to train and command its forces on the battlefield. Against them stands General Sir Arthur Wellesley and his forces, a mixture of English Redcoats, Scottish Highlanders and native troops. Richard Sharpe is sent into the storm to hunt down a britter English officer who has joined the forces of the Confederation. Toss in the colorful language, the vivid details of army live, the politics and the twirling chaos of combat and the result is a bloody story of adventure and greed (for gold and rank). Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"You save a whole 8 cents buying the Kindle version instead of the paper version.

I saw this book in a store and paid retail price rather than wait for the better deal from Amazon.com. That's because I have every one of Cornwell's books (including three contemporary thrillers) and I KNEW what was between the covers: a page turning yarn with vividly wrought characters, combined with impeccable historical accuracy. OK-- almost impeccable, but only to further the plot. I am so happy that Cornwell didn't stop the Sharpe series with Waterloo, and you will be too. One caution: if this is your first Bernard Cornwell book, your savings account balance is about to decrease. Bravo Mr. Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT! Cornwell is extremely descriptive in his writing and his ability to convey characters as real people. Richard Sharpe, a rake, but an honorable rake! I'm already on the next book in the series and loving it, as well."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"This is another entry on the Sharpe series. It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Now a Sergeant, Richard Sharpe finds himself feeling something like ambition to rise in the British Army. Despite his excellent fighting abilities, Sharpe is destined to languish in the British ranks. Despite this, he is happy, his job is easy and his hidden fortune makes him able to live better than some officers. However, it is almost impossible for a British soldier to become an officer unless he performes an act of suicidal bravery in front of an influential officer. As an aide to a member of the East India Company military, Sharpe seems unlikely to ever have his chance. But fate intervenes and just as the battle of Assaye begins Sergeant Sharpe finds himself as an aide to Arthur Wellesley, commander of the British forces at Assaye. When Wellesley is unhorsed and surrounded it is up to Sharpe to save him and claim his destiny. Cornwell continues to explore the background of his classic character. Readers of the initial Sharpe series have heard about Assaye, but here it finally is in all its bloody glory. Corwell is among the most realistic of combat novelists and his battle descriptions are as good as any history book. Well done Mr. Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"This was my first Sharpe's book, but it sure won't be my last. On the strength of Sharpe's Triumph, I will read all the Sharpe's books in chronological order. I have already begun Sharpe's Tiger, and it is a captivating as Triumph.Like all the Sharpe books, this one follows the adventures of infantryman, Richard Sharpe, a lowly born Englishman serving and making his way in Her Majesty's Army around the turn of the 19th Century. This puts him in the midst of the great Napoleonic Era of war making. A fascinating time for Military buffs. This particular novel is set in India and revolves around the battle of Assaye.The strengths of this books are these:First, this is an excellent historical novel. The firearms used, the methods of combat, the Indian political settings, and the settings are very accurate and transporting. But please don't get the idea the book is a dry history lesson. Cornwall wraps the history within a great, old fashioned tale of revenge and blood.Secondly, the characters in this book, both real and imagined, are carefully drawn and utterly convincing. My favorite was the author's portrayal of General Arthur Wellesley (before he became the Duke of Wellington). The reader really gets a good sense of what made Wellesley such a great commander of men. The great General and future Duke is completely brought to life.Finally, the battle writing is superb. Cornwall supplies you with a map of the battleground, and his writing is so clear and concise that you can actually see in your mind's eye the movement of men and the progress of the battle. It all makes sense! Battle during this time period was especially horrific with cannons pounding into the infantry to soften them up and cavalry sweeping down on rows of men the heavy blades. Cornwall has a knack for making the reader smell the spent black powder and feel the splashing of warm blood.The fascinating aspect of this series is that Richard Sharpe is a war crazed soldier, seeking battle with joy in his heart. He really loves to fight and make war with no apologies and no analysis. This is the characteristic that makes the character so refreshing and exciting."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I read this book out of sequence, after starting my 'Sharpe Experience' with 'Sharpe's Rifles.'I think I might have enjoyed it more if I'd read the chronologically earlier book in the series, 'Sharpe's Tiger'. I found myself trying to adjust to Sharpe with a lower rank and in a different setting. I was so used to Sharpe the officer gaining the confidence of his men, that 'sergeant Sharpe' seemed a very differeent character to me.In fact, I think 'Sharpe's Triumph' is hurt by its title character playing more of a supporting role. Sharpe is almost overshadowed by his superiors, and even by the story's villain!Also, the inclusion of a real renegade officer as the 'bad guy' makes for something of anticlimactic ending...though it at least offers a satisfying conclusion to one of the book's subplots, and a hint of the respect Sharpe will gain in the future.I would caution new readers not to start with this volume. Those who are interested in the 'India trilogy' should read them in the correct order. Personally, I'll go back to the 'Napoleonic War' stories."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"Considering events after September 11, 2001, it is perhaps appropriate to read the novel. The setting is in India in 1803 and it covers a relatively short time period ending with the Battle of Assaye on September 23, 1803. The Muslim armies from the northwest, reinforced by Arab mercenaries, have swept onto the plains of India with the intention of conquering the country. The Muslims have hired European mercenaries including British renegades. The are opposed by the British Army and the East India Company sepoys under the combined command of Major General Wellesley.The novel has considerable action including Muslim fanatics and British soldiers trained to march into enemy fire. This was a time period when little quarter was given and wounded enemy were commonly bayoneted. Victorious armies commonly plundered captured cities, robbed the enemy dead, and raped any women they found - the few perqs of a common soldier. The population suffers as armies concerned with loot, personal advancement, feeding themselves, and more loot, roam the countryside like plagues of locusts.Copyrighted in 1998, chronologically this novel is book 2 of the Richard Sharpe series. Cornwell, like Forester, reached the end of the Napoleonic wars, then stepped back in time to cover the early career of his main character. The novel starts with Richard Sharpe as a sergeant, being thrust back into action after spending the four years following the end of the previous novel (\\"Sharpe's Tiger\\") in a relatively quiet assignment. Colonel McCandless, his acquaintance from previous action, drafts Sharpe's services for a special assignment. Events lead Sharpe into making decisions about his future. He must contend again with Sergeant Hakeswill, and a new woman enters Sharpe's life. This is the novel where Sharpe steps up from the ranks."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe Adventure Series)(Library Binding)","review":"I would recommend this book and this series thus far.

Simple rhymes are also used in some of the puzzles; something that always attracts the attention of the young reader.The level is roughly that of the second or third grade reader, each of the puzzles requires some basic logical thinking and arithmetic and the involvement of animals is another point of attraction for children.

Very good book. Can't wait for number three. Despite the need for feeding, for blood, a true rivalry and believable relationships ring true."},{"Title":"The Soul of an Angel (Sisters of the Night)","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, having enjoyed &quot;The Angry Angel&quot; quite a bit. However, this second volume in the series defintely lags behind Yarbo's initial offering.She spends the first several chapters telling us in many different ways what we already know: that the heroine, Fenice, is bored and frustrated with her life of Venetian privilege and yearning for adventure on the high seas and elsewhere. Enough, already! Let's cut to the chase! But no - these points are belaboured for a while longer; her disapproving family, her boring fiance, her desire to postpone marriage for as long as possible, etc. etc. etc.In contrast to &quot;The Angry Angel,&quot; for most of this book Dracula is basically absent. There seems to be little real connection between him and Fenice, and little reason for one. Unlike Kelene who was trapped in a situation of dire poverty and physical danger, Fenice is in the lap of luxury. How many people in real life are desperate to flee lives of privilege for the squalor and &quot;adventure&quot; of street-life? This motivation is not realistic.Finally over halfway through the book things begin to pick up, but by this time finishing the book is an act of will. My ennui was completed by the discovery that Kelene, the heroine of the first novel, has somehow morphed from a wise-beyond-her-years, interesting teenager to a spoiled, petulant brat. What?!Let's hope the heroine of book 3, whoever she might be, realizes there's more than enough of Dracula to go around."},{"Title":"The Soul of an Angel (Sisters of the Night)","review":"The second one in the trilogy.

She yearns for excitement and will do anything to escape the ennui of her existence. Fenice stows on board a ship, but is soon caught. The noblewoman is ignominiously dumped in Varna.The residents of Varna trust no one, especially strangers. Rumors abound that a demon has surfaced, drinking the blood of his victims every night. Dracula sees Fenice as his latest concubine. He seduces her with a chance for the unfettered freedom she covets. Unable to resist his call, Fenice follows Varna back to his castle. However, already residing there is a dangerous female, who could be Fenice's sister of the night or her killer.THE SOUL OF AN ANGEL, the second novel in Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's trilogy on Count Dracula's three brides, is a superb look into the secondary characters from Stoker's classic. The story line is weird, but intriguing as Fenice fights for more than just survival. She battles to gain a place in Dracula's heart. The relationships between the three protagonists who make up this supernatural triangle seem so real that readers will feel it must be a genuine account in spite of the blood-sucking regimen. After this tasty morsel and the previous tale (THE ANGRY ANGEL), readers will impatiently wait for the release of the third bride's tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Soul of an Angel (Sisters of the Night)","review":"i loved the first novel in this series when i was seventeen...i loved this one almost as much when i was 19, now i'm 25 and dying to read the third and final novel in this series which she seems to have choosen not to write, which is a shame, beacause these novels are fluid and beautiful...."},{"Title":"The Soul of an Angel (Sisters of the Night)","review":"Another great read from the author of the Saint Germain vampire series.

Many of us are apprehensive about aging, and Cirillo does a great job dispelling some of the myths of aging in America and what it's like living in an assisted care facility. In addition to being a healthcare professional, Cirillo entertains in diverse assisted living facilities, more than 300 shows a year on the east coast. Thus, he writes from an insider's view, and he has a unique perspective gained from experience at many different institutions. The myths Cirillo addresses in each chapter are the questions many of us with little experience have about such institutions; e.g., are they places to die vs. a temporary home to enjoy life, what types of activities can you do there, friendships, romance, visitors. The biggest take away for me was the information presented about long-term care insurance. The costs associated with assisted living, as with other health care costs, are very high in America. An unplanned extended stay in such a facility can severely impact the financial resources of families without some type of insurance protection. I recommend this short book (163 pages) as a good initial resource for someone considering assisted living."},{"Title":"Who Moved My Dentures? 13 False (Teeth) Truths About Long-Term Care and Aging in America","review":"This book gives a comprehensive view of the realities of making decisions when it comes to placing loved ones into nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

You can tell that Cirillo speaks from experience and with a passion for his commitment to long term care.

My wife and I have been anxious and sad at the thought of moving her mother to a long-term care facility. After reading \\"Who Moved My Dentures\\" we have a much better insight into the matter and feel more informed and less worried. As difficult as it is still going to be, just because of what it means to leave a house that has been your home for virtually your entire life, Anthony takes much of the edge off of the situation. His encouraging and warm first-person account of his experiences provides a balance to the negative press that long-term care facilities sometimes receive. He not only gives encouragement and support but also is humorous and enlightening, giving the reader a truly personal glimpse into the day-to-day lives of the wonderful people that live here and the dedicated people that care for them, including Anthony himself.

Also, the second half of the book that describes the 2nd murder trail, starts to go back over some of the ground already covered in the first trial - kind of like a TV show coming back from commercial. But overall I think it tells a good story and gives you enough info into both the suspect and the victims to get a good feel for those involved."},{"Title":"The Torso Killer","review":"For sure not worth reading,for one who likes true gore and to be right there in a sense,to feel the reality of it all to be in the story this book did nothing but put me to sleep.

We used it to sharpen our intuition about probability. Feller was a master at explaining difficult things in simple ways. This includes the waiting time paradox and Benford's laws. For structure and rigor we looked elsewhere, Chung and/or Neveu. But Feller's books brought a joy and love for the subject.

Please refer there to see it (click \\"See All My Reviews\\" to avoid having to search it out)."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"Publisher's Weekly indicates that readers may be disappointed by the far-fetched solution, and that's a kind way to put the ending -- tying the Savoy Hotel desk clerk who only happened to witness the first death, back into the heart of the whole murderous mechanism -- that yanks the long arm of coincidence right out of its socket. In a mystery, I like at least a sporting chance to spot the murderer and the mechanism; here, no such luck. What happened to the fabled British sense of fair play?"},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"In 1973 at London's Savoy Hotel elderly lawyer Maximillian Jacob apparently fell asleep in the lobby; desk clerk Jerry Gates goes to wake him, but instead Maximillian is choking and soon dies. The coroner reports that the deceased most likely died from a snake bite.Police detectives Arthur Bryant and John May investigate Jacob's death to ascertain whether it was an accident or a homicide, but soon other strange deaths occur that leave no doubt that a murderer is on the loose. The next victims die from toxin mixed into makeup and a tiger. Besides the odd murder weapons and no clear motive or any obvious opportunities, the two cops link the victims to the Whitstable family and that brood's ties to the Alliance of Eternal Light, but who is doing the killing remains a mystery.The third Bryant-May police procedural is a long way from its predecessors (see FULL DARK HOUSE and THE WATER ROOM) as this time a biographer asking how they joined the New Scotland Yard's Peculiar Crimes Unit leads to a look back at the case. The action-packed story line is filled with red herrings and several intriguing twists pulled off by key secondary characters like the hotel desk clerk that keep readers' attention throughout the thriller. Though the resolution seems too much of a stretch, fans of the series will appreciate this fine entry from the salad days of a strong eccentric sleuthing partnership.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"The book itself was in like new condition, clean and apparently unread. The story was excellent, taking one back to London right after World War II. The characters were well drawn and interesting, primarily Bryant and May, but also some of their fellow investigators. A five star mystery, most enjoyable."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"I absolutely loved the first two books of this series. The writing was such that I'd read passages aloud to others. This didn't have that same cache'. There didn't seem to be as much interaction between the two protagonists until well into the book. Fowler loves introducing twists to the plot which is fun, but the solution to the mystery really strains credibility. There is a secondary protagonist in Sam Gates, a receptionist at the Savoy, but the outcome of her fear of the dark really bothered me. I enjoyed the story, but didn't feel it was nearly as good as the first two books."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"It would have been nice if somewhere, anywhere, in this book -- the copyright date, the title page, a note to the reader, anything -- it might have been mentioned that this is little more than a reworking of an early Bryant/May mystery, \\"Darkest Day\\". I always enjoy Fowler's books, but not so much that I need to buy them twice over."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"Arthur Bryant and John May are the odd and perfectly mismatched detectives of London's peculiar crimes unit. A lawyer dies of a snake bite in the Savoy lobby, an eccentric aristocrat blows up on the tube, a starved tiger eats a family in their own home. Methodical May and Unconventional Bryant must track down a mystery rooted in Victorian superstition and class distinctions that are causing bizarre deaths in the present.

Some fine characterisations, scenery, and 1970's culture, and classy writing throughout! Not to mention the intriguing interaction between the 2 eccentirc detectives in a new Crimes Unit. There is the by-now customary lack of fear among those linked with the victims,which seems very unrealistic, plus family squabbling that gets to be irritating. My main complaint is the solution,though interesting, seems somewhat over-inventive. Nonetheless, a very pleasant,interesting , and unique whodunnit that aproaches five-stars, but does not quite succeed"},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"I love these old school detectives- no fingerprints, no fiber evidence here, just two cops bouncing ideas off of each other as they interview witnesses and suspects. Each book is set in London, and the city's rich history and geography play a part in each book.However, this book is not the strongest in the series. There are a couple of coincidences that don't work for me, and the plot is just so complicated that it strains belief.Read them in order, starting with Full Dark House. By the time you get to Seventy Seven Clocks, you'll forgive the author of any mistakes he has made."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"\\"Seventy-Seven Clocks\\" has its fine moments as all of the Bryant and May mysteries do. Set in 1973 London, this is the story of the serial murders of members of a large, wealthy British mercantile family who are singularly unlikable, unproductive and disagreeable down the last young child. And here is one of the problems with this book, the reader cannot care a whit about the victims, let alone the killer(s).In any event, author Christopher Fowler, has crafted an intricate plot that has its roots in the Victorian hay days of the British Empire and offers little clue before the last 100 pages (of nearly 500) as to how the tale will sort out. The route to the final solution is littered with many, many bodies, killed off in some pretty ingenious ways. Along the way, Fowler has much to say (through his two detective protagonists) about the rottenness of the British class system--particularly the upper middle class--which he effectively portrays asdestroying the country.I did enjoy most of this book, mainly because Fowler has such a large bag of tricks that he has dragged out here. But I agree with another reviewer, who advised that this was not the best Bryant & May Mystery to start with. The series is grand and has several other gems that shine brighter."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"Although the book is a recent release (relatively), the plot takes place in 1973, which Fowler uses to good effect in creating atmosphere. Bryant & May, the main characters, are old-school English detectives in charge of the Peculiar Crimes Unit - in other words, crimes that are odd or unusual. I enjoyed the book and enjoyed following them as they trailed their criminal and tried to figure out how and why the murders were occurring. A great find for people fond of old-school mysteries and good atmospheric reading."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"As with Fowler's earlier Bryant & May novels, SEVENTY-SEVEN CLOCKS manages to perfectly balance complexity and suspense. The result is an enjoyable thriller that is both dark and charming. It's an unusual combination and one I find hard to resist.I discovered Fowler through his work in the horror genre - which I recommend heartily - and only found out about this series later. I was skeptical at first, but willing to give them a try because of Fowler's amazing ability to capture the feel of an environment with a minimum of words. At the very least I thought I might learn something I could apply to my own attempts at fiction.All pretence to analysis went out the window after the first few pages. A gripping mystery, well drawn characters, and an impressive sense of environment. Fowler just sucks you into the story and keeps it all moving until the very end.As with FULL DARK HOUSE and THE WATER ROOM, SEVENTY SEVEN CLOCKS relies a great deal on the history of London. That history is an important part of the investigation as Bryant & May look into a series of deaths in an odd family. Fowler expertly weaves a lot of background detail into the narrative as his elderly heroes dig ever deeper into the family's past.And the heroes themselves are delightful to follow. No pretense of hard-boiled toughness or superhuman intellect. Just two elderly men doing what they do in their own unique way. They're old. They're grouchy. And ultimately, more interesting. I've gotten tired of psychologically damaged detectives hunting down pyschologically damaged serial killers. What Fowler has to offer us is much more subtle, complex, and entertaining.I highly recommend the Bryant & May books for anyone interested in well crafted mysteries with a lot of character. SEVENTY SEVEN CLOCKS lived up to the promise of the others in the series and I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"This book offers fascinating detail about WWII London (a particular interest of mine) as members of a \\"Peculiar Case\\" squad tries to figure out who killed their elderly founding member and why in present day London. The man's friend and colleague, thinks it may be connected to a series of murders at the Palace Theatre all those years ago. The tension could be stronger, the language could be more streamlined, but it is still a good read. The first in the series, I look forward to seeing how the next few books pan out."},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","review":"Classic Christopher Fowler...always a great read - the bumbling Arthur with his sophisticated sidekick John are always entertaining. Fowler has a way of writing that allows you to picture his main characters and their situations vividly. The 'supporting cast' also come to life and add a welcome dimension to the tale. There is always a twist and you won't be disappointed with 77 Clocks. Do yourself a favour and check out some of his earlier novels - Disturbia and Spanky are two of his best - totally different to this series but you won't want to put them down!"},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"I work at a Career Center in the Mid-Atlantic and we have an active internship program that is run through our office. Jamie Fedorko's book would be a great resource for any of our students who were willing to take the time to read it--I managed to breeze through most of it in just under two hours, even though (fossil that I am) I had to ask a younger colleague to \\"translate\\" some of the slang used.I thoroughly enjoyed the irreverent tone & hip writing, though possibly some would be offended by the occasional profanity used. The advice offered was solid and right on target, though it would have been better had more of the examples of \\"real interns\\" been drawn from varied fields (many of them, probably Fedorko's college friends, were based in media/music/arts). Perhaps this will be changed with a future edition!I also enjoyed Fedorko's final \\"real intern\\" story--his own--and am quite impressed to see a recent grad ('04) realizing his dream--to be a writer. Good going, Jamie, and keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"From my perspective as an employer, any individual who follows the wise and entertaining guidance in this book will be an irresistable choice for any internship or paid position. I only wish I had this book when I was starting my own career. Brilliant, funny, and vital if you want a career...any career.--Michael Levin"},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"It is rare you get to meet the man behind the mask. I was so fortunate, however, that I did get to meet Jamie Fedorko. Jamie has done a fantastic job with this book by doing one simple thing, he shares with you the wisdom he gained from being an typical everday Joe Average intern. Jamie genuinely wants students to learn the simple principles in his book so they don't have to hit the pot-holes he got stuck in.Overall the book covers the basics on how to get, keep and excel in your internships. It is a guidebook and has what you would expect--dress codes, where to look for internships, how to handle office politics, leaving a lasting impression, etc. Because it is well written and has great stories it is able to hold a 20-year-olds attention for over 100 pages--not an easy task by any means. The best points are reflected on what he says about attitude and how to maintain a positive attitude in the midst of sometimes non-exciting internships and the second point is about relationships. If there is one takeaway from this book it would be that you need to build excellent relationships with those in your office (boss included) whether you hate the job, want a full time position or are like most students and have no clue.We talk about how you have to do at least a few internships to make the most of your college investment in my book The Power of Focus for College Students. If you are smart enough to see the value in doing an internship, then you are likely smart enough to invest a few dollars and learn from Jamie how to do it right.Happy interning!"},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"This was an enjoyable read, well written - but really lacking substance. If I wanted a good read I'd pickup some fiction or a memoir, I bought this book looking for solid advice on how to gain an internship and sadlly found the book lacking in this department.About a quater of the book is dedicated to getting an internship, arguarblly the most vital part and the advice given is to me seemed very ho-hum, like it just came out of my teachers mouth.Where the book is at its best is preparing nervous interns, common sense answers mixed in with some entertaining disaster stories of what not to do.Overal it was high on style, low on substance. The book cites the dummies guide as a refernce, I cant help but feel it would be more informative."},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"As a college student who will be in my first internship at this time next year, I really enjoyed this book. Jamie Fedoroko uses humor and his knowledge of internships to really tell you what to expect. Sure he used some advice that you could find in other job search/life on the job books, but some of his material, such as the stories from real life interns and how to find work to do when you have too much downtime, is fresh advice I have not seen anywhere else.If you are currently an intern or are planning to intern in the near future, don't waste anymore time! Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"SO entertaining while also informative. Jamie Fedorko does a terrific job giving us all the dirt on the ins and outs of an internship. Also, LOVED the interview chapter with Alexis Feldman. Helpful, witty and cleaver. Highly recommend it to all!"},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"Student-friendly books are not easily found, but the Intern Files by Jamie Fedorko really fits the bill. Fedorko writes in such a way that you can picture yourself sitting down with him, having a beer, and learning about internships from him and his friends, who share their often tragic yet comical tales of the lessons learned the hard way.While I differ on how you should spend your time when bored at work, wish he could have beefed up his networking section, and covered a few other topics, I still find the Intern Files an excellent resource for students new to the workforce.I wholeheartedly agree with at least a dozen points...1. Optimism, enthusiasm, and hard work payoff.2. The philosophy that work can be good and even fun.3. Confidence is important.4. Don't limit job search options to only what you find in school.5. Internships are an opportunity for career clarification and are never time wasted.6. Interns have the power to make the most of an experience.7. Networking is important.8. Fitting in with what you're wearing is important.9. Work comes first, and balancing socializing can be a tricky matter.10. Companies may be a little clueless about what to do with you and often fail to tell you the back-story of an assignment.11. Chances are you will feel bored at sometime, but you can find things to do.12. Never burn bridges and always leave on a positive note.Having experienced some not-so-good experiences, I especially appreciated this quote: \\"Consider the fact that things aren't always what they seem, and your bosses are all human too. And remember, you're an intern. Be patient--if nothing else, you'll learn how to handle your interns when you're the boss.\\" It's a great reminder for when things are not going as well as hoped!Review by Jengyee Liang, author of HELLO REAL WORLD!

It's great and makes a great gift as well!"},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"Clocking in at fewer than 200 pages, The Intern Files seems like a cheap ($15) helpful guide to those who have yet to enter the work force as interns. However, this couldn't be farther from the truth. After reading The Intern Files I had a sudden feeling of dread wash over me, much like how health specialists define a heart attack. I wasn't having a heart attack, I was in shock--shock that I spent a grand total of fifteen dollars and two days reading from cover to cover and I hadn't learned a single thing. The book is definitely a crash course book, and belongs somewhere between \\"for dummies\\" and \\"for padding your bird cage.\\"The book's chapters progress with a typical intern's process of selecting a job, going to the job, and moving on from the job. Unfortunately, author Jamie Fedorko leaves these first couple chapters with nothing but rambling, because a book can't really tell you how to apply for internships. Next, Jamie switches his role as a helpful narrator to a sinister villain whose only goal is to instill fear in your young teenaged heart. He begins padding his chapters of long tirades with stories that students have sent in to him. It feels less like an actual book and more like a segment of The Onion. These stories range from the pitiful to the comedic. Almost all of them end poorly for someone, but the lesson is always the same--be afraid, be very afraid. Regardless of what kind of story it is, it usually involves a girl who tried to sleep her way to the top, or an intern who manipulated other interns, or how a lack of communication can (obviously) ruin a business deal.Many of these stories point out facts that teens should be able to distinguish--talk to your boss, be professional, don't tramp around your office, and don't be lazy. The only good section of the book is the part where Jamie points out that it's easy as an intern to want to take on too much. It's also easy as a boss to abuse your intern's willingness to help. It's a great section that isn't talked about enough. Intern abuse (in the form of workload, not sexual harassment) is an issue that's often overlooked regarding internships. Depending on where you get your internship, this could be a legitimate issue if you don't take note of the warning signs.Jamie Fedorko should feel bad about this book. Its quality is flimsy--the kind of writing that anyone could churn out in under a month. Even less when you consider that half of his material was taken from other people's life experiences (notably awful experiences, for that matter). The subject matter is so poorly conceived that Fedorko actually has the room to prattle on about sex in the work place, yet he still doesn't make the topic interesting to a teenaged boy. The book has neither substance nor any clear understanding of what the author is trying to connect. He gives the reader common-sense knowledge that should already be logical to someone applying for a college level internship, yet gathered all of his data from the socio-economic Darwin reject pool. I think the book could have been made much more interesting had it featured some more hard statistics (with citation, since most of this book is all just personal experiences anyway) and gratuitous use of a reality check. It feels rushed and Jamie Fedorko should feel ashamed."},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"This book was a requirement for my internship practicum class at Sonoma State and it is so helpful!

It helps anyone new to a field & starting an internship for the 1st time know everything they need to know but no one's gonna tell them. It helps stop a lot of \\"learning the hard way\\". I wish I would have read this before my first internship. I would have started with knowledge it took me 7 months to figure out on my own."},{"Title":"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship","review":"Have you ever read something that caused you to say \\"exactly!\\"? I had such an experience last week reading a book called \\"The Intern Files\\" by a fellow who interned for a talk show in New York. His name is Jamie Fedorko. Being a native New Yorker, he does have a bit of an edge to his writing style, and he does have a tendency to work in some pretty in-your-face humor in kind of a hip, waste-no-words writing style.Fedorko very thoroughly covers the process: Getting the Internship (Part I), The First Day (Part II), How to be the Perfect Intern (Part III), Social Etiquette at the Office (Part IV) and The Beginning of the End (Part V)- sounds kind of boring, right? It's anything but. Fedorko shares an uncommon knowledge of the secrets to successful interning. And he seems to have a lot of articulate friends who share their stories as vignettes with each chapter. In a way this book choreographs a whole panel of internship experts.You may be surprised by his candor. Interns can get abused if they're not careful. Being the low person on the totem pole has some uncomfortable moments. He addresses topics that do happen to interns, like getting invited to an after-hours party, and being expected to drink with the boss, or getting hit on by another intern. How do you handle roommates who like to party when you need to be to work in the morning? He'll cover it and offer some experts' first-hand stories as well.I'm a fan of this book. The message is so dead on that you should not consider interning without reading it. You will learn more in the first chapter than you may glean from a whole class on the topic from a lesser source - it's that clear and readable and detailed in it's description of what successful interning is all about.Dan Toussant[...]"},{"Title":"Format C:","review":"Someone loaned me this book and I am certainly glad I didn't buy it.

Edwin Black creates a frightening believable world that employes the likes of a megalomaniacle software mongel, an Indiana Jones style reporter, and the apparent end of the world as we know it on 12/31/99. As I journeyed thought this maze of monopolistic software developers, human oppression, and ancient biblical prophecies, I had to remind myself that this is NOT real. It's only a very well written journey into the guts of human nature. However, Black also navigates the reader though an intrigingly wonderful canvas of Chicago, Jerusalem, and The Dead Sea with impressive knowledge, insight, and emotion. Add in the over all mystery of how the Y2K bug and Armeggedon converge and you have in the palm of your hands a real thriller that assists you in turning pages."},{"Title":"Format C:","review":"I am a 15 year old girl, and my dad knows the writer of this book. I read a pre-publication galley of &gt;Format C:. I liked this book very much. It is written very good, with a lot of connection to reality, the Y2K bug and the way everyone are trying to find a solution to it. A part of this book took place where I live, in Jerusalem. When I read the book, I always wanted to keep on going because I had to know what will happen next. I also like computers, and because I like computers, I connected to this book. In the book, you can read about the fight between good and evil, and in a way, there is a fight between good and evil everywhere in the world, not just the computing industry. Once you read this book you realize you dont have to do what others do because you don't wanna be different, and that you should do what you think is best for you."},{"Title":"Format C:","review":"I first read a review about this book in early 1999 through a computer magazine I subscribe to. I rushed out and bought it.I thought it was a great work of fiction based around our Y2K fears, as well as the whole Microsoft/ everyone else in the computer world issue. It greatly parrelleled all of the current fears at the time, with believable characters.I read this book twice in '99, and it was a great read both times. Although Y2K had come and gone with few reported problems, I think it does characterize our society's fears at the time. Bill Gates and Microsoft were monoplolizing the computer world, and the character Edwin Black wrote about seemed to catch our fears about what could happen. Though Bill and his company haven't turned out to be the devil, I still thought it was a great read.If you're a computer geek, pretend it's 1999 all over again and give it a read.I'm updating this review. Since reading the book, I have become a Christian and grown more knowledgeable about Biblical things. I have a personal interest in end times prophesy and Biblical history. This book was written from a Jewish perspective. The main character is a Jewish reporter who went to freelance work after a career with a large Chicago newspaper. He meets up with a woman and her teenage son. At the time of their meeting, she had just left the large, monopolistic software company which paralelled accounts of Microsoft at the time with some embellishments. As they approach Y2K they are attempting to prevent some problems that the monopoly's operating system will wreak on mankind. As they go along, they end up in Israel where prophesy starts to unravel from a Jewish perspective. Looking back, I find the book fascinating in helping me understand the Old Testament and Jewish customs, although I'm sure that may not have been the author's intent.It's a great technological and prophetic fiction thriller."},{"Title":"Format C:","review":"Interesting?

Black's story moves to Jerusalem with the Dead Sea Scrolls involved in the story. I went to several web sites including the Qumran and Jerusalem which enhanced the story for me.

If they ever make this book into a movie, John Malkovich would be perfect to play role of Ben; you can see and hear him with every word. (Think &quot;In the Line of Fire.&quot;) The pure evil is ever-present, and nobody can play pure concentrated evil better than Malkovich.For the role of Dan Levin (the main &quot;good guy&quot;), I see Michael Keaton.

It then takes a turn into murder, mysticism and Biblical prophecy coming to pass.I was hooked at the beginning of the book and thought the main character, Dan Levin to be a very complex and interesting study. As the book progresses Dan is extremely reckless (he likes to drive fast the wrong way down streets) and resourceful. We find that his wife and child were killed in a plane crash and his parents were survivors of Nazi controlled Poland.The major computer company (Hinnom Computing) controls the computer software market and their software is in virtually anything computerized. The software has backdoors that allow Hinnom to get into any computer and make it do whatever the company wants. The head of Hinnom wants to download to the world a supposed fix to the Y2K problem that in actuality will implant a program that can control the user's mind. This will allow Hinnom to virtually rule the world.What killed this book for me was the author's style. A lot of events happen for no apparent reason. In one case Levin and his girlfriend's son (Sal) are at the site where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found. Sal just happens to find one scroll, then another within something like five minutes. Many things seem to happen out of context in the middle of other events and it is difficult to tell if they are flashbacks or juxtaimposed events.I would have liked the book a lot more had it stayed with the \\"cutthroat\\" computer business and stayed away from the battle of Armageddon angle."},{"Title":"Format C:","review":"The Y2K crisis nears with fear that many of our systems will not only fail, but dangerously so. What will happen to the overseas missiles if that occurs? John Hector, CEO of Bluestar, enters the mess when he offers a viable money-making solution with Zoom software. However, the world's most powerful individual, Ben Hinnom, expects to have an information technology monopoly. Zoom stands in his way. He meets with John, who tells him what he can do with his deal. However, Ben controls medical software. He uses a by-pass code to over-stimulate John's pacemaker. Ben's only rival dies of a heart attack.Former investigative reporter Dan Levin meets and falls in love with software expert Park McGuire. As their relationship quickly grows, she tells him about her suspicions on the sudden death of John and a previous employee of Ben. They combine their skills and begin to investigate the individual who appears on the edge of controlling information in the next millennium. As the 31st of December 1999, looms closer, world-wide disaster seems imminent as Ben wants to own the world. Park and Dan want to save it, but Ben seems too powerful of a foe even as the doomsday clock keeps ticking.FORMAT C is a brilliant allegorical thriller that takes the reader on a realistic path in which the Bible meets the information technology age. The story line is non-stop action that ultimately takes the reader from Chicago to the Armageddon climax. The lead protagonists are a wonderful team, who will gain much audience support. Ben is the modern villain, using technology to destroy his opponents.

The characters and politics of the computer industry are portrayed as very flimsy charicatures of the real people and events. The main characters of the story are one-dimensional and uninteresting.While I can appreciate the irony in Black's making a plainly Gates-like character and Microsoft-like company into the evil-of-evils, it turns out to be distracting from the story to be constantly trying to figure out which story characters map to which real-world counterparts. Thankfully, after about halfway through the book, the characters diverge enough from their real-life analogues to make it not matter anymore.That said, the last half of the book is hard to put down, even as the story gets more and more outlandish and inconsistencies creep in.It's an OK quick, entertaining read...similar to most Michael Crichton novels -- reasonably good stories if you can suspend your disbelief, and mediocre writing."},{"Title":"Format C:","review":"I bought &quot;Format C:&quot; at about the same time I purchased a hardback first edition of &quot;Digital Fortress,&quot; Dan Brown's first novel.

Also, the few jabs at Bill Gates always make for an interesting piece of humor. The Biblical and historical references are well founded and, while far fetched, based on fact.While Edwin did his homework, purists may not enjoy his work. He strays from normalcy about as often and he betrays the laws of what is possible. If you are looking for a realistic book, check the begining of the review: this is very surreal.Last, the book is incredibly fast paced. It had me sweating until the last page. However, despite the pace, Blacks novel comes to a moral-bearing and unfulfilling end. Almost like a cheesy sitcom, the novel ends on a life lesson that doesn't seem to match the plot.While I enjoyed this book, the pitfall at the end and the slight bit of realist in me prevents anything above a 3-star rating.

I am looking for a hard copy of this work because I believe that the general theme of the mega-hit Strategy software game, &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; is inspired by some of the vicious alien creatures described in Herbert's story of the adaptation of humanity to a brutal alien world. Characterization is a lot deeper than most sci-fi, and the &quot;run around the fortress&quot; scene is something I've remembered for more than two decades since I last read the book. In our world of animated feature films, this would make an incredible movie."},{"Title":"Ascension Factor","review":"Unlike Dune, this series has been out of print for some time. Shame! No one does it better than Herbert but Dune-Mania has left too much of his best work unread and unknown. Dune was a masterpiece, no question. But the series devolved into action novels - the work of creating his universe did not have to be re-done so the rest was just what happens next (and as Brian continues the series, what happened before). The Voidship series is different. Beginning with Destination: Void, which establishes the premise, each novel must reestablish the world in which it is set. Each set of characters has very new hurdles and new forms of intelligent life(? at least self-awareness) to deal with, each with their own world view. A good marketing bet would be to reintroduce these novels in paperback, capitalizing on the popularity of the Dune series. Let the new generation of sf readers discover the other worlds of Frank Herbert.

The entire Voidship series is one of the most provocative and deeply moving works of science fiction that I have ever read. I actually found this series far more provocative than the Dune series.

I have always suspected this book was written by Bill Ransom alone with edited out pages from \\"Lazarus Effect\\" and has little to do with the great Frank Herbert. I suspect that Frank Herbert never started a fourth book in this series. Where \\"Destination: Void,\\" \\"Jesus Incident\\", and \\"Lazarus Effect\\" are 3 separate and distinct, must read, science fiction master pieces--each with its own unique world and plot-- \\"Ascension Factor\\" is clearly a sequel to the \\"Lazarus Effect.\\" There is no new world, just the one in the last book with a plot to match a bad sequel: The book negates the end of the last book, extends the pre established plot lines of the last book and tacks on a new ending. This is the only Frank Herbert book with zero new ideas and zero pushing the Sci-Fi envelope. Where are you Frank? Bill Ransom's Sci-Fi career went nowhere after his collaboration with Herbert ended, for lack of ideas. This book lacks new ideas. This book is a stinker and is not worthy of Frank Herbert's name. This book is Fake Frank."},{"Title":"The Messiah Of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidism Past And Present","review":"To be honest, this book fell short of my expectations for a book which professes to be an honest criticism of one of the most influential religious leaders of his century.Ehrlich is satisfied with \\"why not?\\" observations. The fact that there are no documents which say the Rebbe did not have a child is used as a proof that the Rebbe did have a child!(?)He deduces from the fact that in the later years of the Rebbes leadership he didn't grant private audiences to most of his Chassidim that the Rebbe was loosing his mind and was scared to expose himself to the Chassidim in an intimate setting. This is one of the falsest presumptions I have encountered in the many pages of critical biographies I have read. The fact that in the early years of the Rebbes leadership his following consisted of a couple of hundred people and in the latter years there were tens of thousands of people lining up to see the Rebbe, is a more than ample explanation. In fact, the opposite of his theory is true. Every Sunday thousands of people came to the Rebbe for his blessings and the Rebbe remembered their names and their issues and was able to inspire them in those few seconds that the encounter allowed for. That is a true leader.It is a superficial encounter with a dynamic movement and as he himself admits, Ehrlich isn't quite able to penetrate Chassidic society and get a true glimpse of the relationship between the Rebbe and his followers."},{"Title":"The Messiah Of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidism Past And Present","review":"This book was a disappointment. M. Avrum Ehrlich substitutes his opinions for substantive research, and does so rather transparently. Additionally, it seems some of his more fantastic claims are the result of an active imagination, and deliberate distortion. Just one example of this is when he quotes David Olidort as saying that \\"most of Schneerson's aides and editors adored him and saw him as virtually infallible, despite their numerous corrections of his failing scholarship.\\" Yet Olidort never made such a statement, and in fact was never even formally interviewed by Ehrlich! Ehrlich's 'source' for this fabricated quote was his memory of a conversation he had with Olidort during a holiday meal in Olidort's home. Additionally, while this supposed 'failing scholarship' began in 1977 (according to Ehrlich), Schneerson continued to lecture publicly and uniquely, from memory, for the next fifteen years. Upon being confronted with this information, Ehrlich's response was to admit the fabrication, and agree to remove this lie from future editions. Similar 'research' fills much of the book, and the reader is left wondering how one mans musings and opinions were re-packaged as a work of scholarship.Don't waste your money - there are many better books available about both Hasidism and Lubavitch."},{"Title":"The Messiah Of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidism Past And Present","review":"Mr Erlich's evaluation of Rabbi Schneerson's personality and influence is not very dissimiliar to the typical Hassidic biography of their Rebbe (spiritual leader) as found in the Hassidic popular readers, which Mr Ehrlich so abhors.Hassidic literature is often subjective, written from the viewpoint of the Hassid who can't see any flaws in the Rebbe. As such, it relies heavily on anecdotal evidence such as rumours whispered around in the Hassidic community more than on objective, documented historical information. In a critical evaluation, assumptions, speculations and theories have no place unless heavily substantiated by independent objective sources of information.\\"The Messiah of Brooklyn\\" is full of inaccuracies, gross errors and wild speculations, way beyond that expected from an objective critical author. 'Finding flwas' is not one of the hallmarks of professional literature; it is the ability to evaluate objectively and truthfully without exaggeration in either direction - positive or negative.I fear that Mr Erlich's personal dislike for Habad and it's followers had stronger influence upon him than the search for the objective truth. In this, \\"The Messiah of brooklyn\\" is a natural progression from his \\"Ledership in the Habad Movement\\", another rant and rave against Habad leaders, with no or little basis in reality. Mr Ehrlich's negative experiences during his study at Kfar Habad, Israel, their refusal to grant him rabbinical ordination as well as the lack of recognition from Habad in his hometown, Sydney, might have been the barometers of truth in many sections of his book.I await the day when a true, scholarly evaluation of Habad will appear in print.

His love of working cowboys, his respect for horses, and his devotion to the fraternity of men who worked cattle and horses on the open range give his stories an easy warmth - like a comfortable old boot. This book is a collection of his early stories first published in national magazines as his writing career suddenly took off in the 1920s. They are fictionalized autobiography, told in the first person by the drifting cowboy of the title, a young man named Bill, who is an accomplished bronc rider.The stories are told in a leisurely fashion, in the unpolished, ungrammatical jargon of someone sitting around a cow camp swapping yarns with the other boys. The pace seems very slow until you realize that James is trying to capture not the drama but the everydayness of cowboy life. Even while he idealizes his subject, he wants us to feel what it is really like - the grueling, dangerous work of herding cattle that are likely to stampede without warning; the fruitless search for work in lean times; the struggle to keep cattle fed and watered in the desert.Competing in a local rodeo, Bill and his friend Tommy have to outwit the promoters, who rig the results with unfair judges and by manipulating the draw, but what is interesting about this story is the actual experience of being a rodeo cowboy. Our heroes participate in several events (unlike today), and James conveys the mixture of excitement, nerves, disappointment, and triumph that his heroes feel.Most striking about the stories is James' capturing of the spirit of fraternity among cowboys, their generosity, and their gallantry. For all their toughness and fierce disregard for personal injury, there is a gentleness in them that makes these stories almost endearing. And in their tendency to \\"drift,\\" there's a dedicated individualism that is tempered by loneliness and melancholy. Reading James, it's easy to see how he helped to create the myth of the cowboy in the American imagination.I'm happy to recommend this book. There are seven wonderful stories and 44 of his carefully detailed illustrations, most of them featuring horses with hooves flying and lean cowboys with big hats, who look a lot like James himself in his photographs."},{"Title":"The drifting cowboy","review":"I ordered this book for a friend who loves cowboys. He said it was fabulous plus Will James (the author) illustrates all of his books."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Georgette Heyer, best known for her formulaic Regency and Georgian romances, strayed from her usual path long enough to turn out this excellent, entertaining novel. The narrative follows the life and achievements of William, duke of Normandy--better known as William the Conqueror--through the eyes of one of his young knights, the fictional Raoul de Harcourt. Major events of William's life, from his illegitimate birth to his coronation as king of England in 1066, are described with fine period detail. Heyer's rousing treatment of the Battle of Hastings is particularly good, and for the most part, she sticks to the facts. Of course there are a few inaccuracies--credit for the creation of the Bayeux Tapestry, for example, is given to William's wife Matilda of Flanders, although it is known to have been made by the English not long after the Conquest. And did William really beat Matilda in her father's house?! That legendary event probably never took place, but here it makes for a lively episode in the account of William's courtship.All things considered, lovers of medieval history should find this book, with its colorful descriptions of eleventh-century France and its well-drawn characters, a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This story is a refreshing change to the usual Heyer formula; if you are tired of buckskin breeches and oriental neckcloths, dive into The Conqueror for an entertaining glimpse of the Norman Conquest seen through the eyes of a fictional knight in William of Normandy's retinue.Written in 1931, the narrative takes William, the title character, from his birth and cradle, through his constant struggles to retain hold on the Duchy of Normandy against rival dukes and the French King himself (her depiction of the defeat of King Henry at the ford of Varaville is particularly well written) to the infamous wrangle over the English crown between himself, Harold Godwineson and Edgar Aetheling and the eventual battle of Hastings.Like her narrative of the events at Waterloo in An Infamous Army, Heyer is masterly in her battle descriptions; she never shies away from the brutality of war which is quite graphically depicted, and can switch easily from broad sweeping action scenes to intimate close-ups of battle from a individual viewpoint.William comes across as ruthless and single-minded, which he must have been, but his motivations are understandable due to the circumstances of his illegitimate birth (a sore point with him, evidently) - even though you may despise his cruelty you cannot help but admire his courage and generalship.The romance between him and Matilda of Flanders shows two equally fierce lovers, and according to historical accounts their devotion and fidelity is accurately written by Heyer, which would have been unusual at a time when heroic love, not courtly love, prevailed. Marriages were arranged to unite kingdoms and cement political alliances. It is an interesting romance of equals which could have been further developed, but unlike most of Heyer's other books, it takes up only a small portion of the story.The fictitious Raoul de Harcourt, who takes allegiance with William when both are nineteen, is the Conqueror's most devoted knight and becomes his closest friend. Heyer seems to be ambivalent about her title character, as if unsure how the Duke's occasionally unpalatable character will be received: Raoul's observations and feelings are distinctly modern, and he becomes the mediator between the Duke and us, the modern audience. Heyer endows Raoul with a lot of modern sensitivities as a result, to the point where Raoul becomes almost an anachronism in the brutal times in which he lived. Unfortunately Raoul as a device does not let us see more deeply into the mind or heart of the Duke: we end up knowing more about Raoul than his lord, who remains a mystery up to his coronation at the end of the book.Raoul may be tied to William by both loyalty and true friendship, but he is not slavish - some of William's cruelties sorely try his devotion, and one wonders what he would have made of the Harrying of the North which followed the Conquest a few years later. This is a compliment to Heyer's skill, though; if characters can inspire speculation over fates NOT in the book, then they are well-written.My other criticism of Raoul is his somewhat formulaic romance with a Saxon lady Elfrida, sister of his friend Edgar, a follower of Harold. It never comes across as convincing, and some of the plot devices to bring them together are too forced to make me care much about their fates.The problem is that Heyer has made a much warmer and engaging tale of love (in the heroic sense) between her hero and his boss; but then felt it necessary to balance this with a female love interest to woo Raoul away from William's side. Unfortunately Elfrida is so shallowly-drawn you end up wondering if she would have been able to keep him for long anyway.Her brother Edgar, who is sent as hostage to Normandy and becomes a member of the Norman court, is a far more likeable character, and he brings the necessary Saxon perspective to the tale without being purely a plot device. His inevitable meeting with Raoul on the battlefield at Hastings is sad and quite poignant.I think Heyer enjoyed writing this book - the pace is excellent and her paintings of the main characters assured. She balances her historical narrative with individual stories and romances, weaving them in and out of each other, so you get a good feel for not only the events surrounding the Norman conquest, but how it affected the lives of both Normans and Saxons and their families.Occasionally the language comes across as stilted: one can only take so many \\"by the Rood of God!\\"s but this is a difficult problem to overcome in any true historical novel and it doesn't threaten the enjoyment of the story. The religious aspect of Norman and Saxon society is handled very well in general, it's there but it doesn't overwhelm.Overall, an excellent read if you are interested in this part of English history, and want a reasonably true depiction of the Conqueror's life and the times in which he lived, and the events leading up to the Norman Conquest. If you are after a pure romance, though, you may be disappointed.

But all in all, a very good read that gives a good sense of 11th century Normandy and England."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"The Conqueror is one of six historical novels written by Georgette Heyer, who is best known for her Regency Romances, and if this is an indication of the other five - then sign me up!Heyer brings us back to 11th Century Normandy and introduces us to William, Duke of Normandy, (a.k.a. William the Bastard) through the eyes of Raoul de Harcourt - a knight in Duke William's retinue.Raoul began his service to the Duke as a young knight and he quickly rose to be one of William's most trusted friends. Loyalty is a running theme throughout the novel - loyalty from a knight to his lord. Raoul may not have agreed with a lot of the tactics used by William, but he trusted and respected his lord enough to comply. Don't get me wrong, Raoul was no pushover - he voiced his opinions when it was warranted, but in the end he knew his role and played the part.Duke William was a very intriguing man - ambitious would be putting it lightly. He valued brain over braun and cunning over might. Once he saw something he wanted, he got it. Doesn't matter how, but he got it. Which leads me into a great scene with William and his future wife, Mathilda....but I'll leave that for you to read! Let's just say it's not a good idea to call William a bastard!One aspect of why I love historical fiction is the educational factor. I know I'm a total dork, but it's true - I've learned so much history through all the historical fiction novels I have read. I take some of it with a grain of salt cause it's historical fiction after all, but for the most part I know a lot more than I did a few years ago. While reading The Conqueror I learned a great deal more about the difference between an Englishman (or Saxon) and a Norman and the Battle of Hastings scene was not put-down-able!I enthusiastically recommend this novel! Heyer's writing is impeccable and her research is without a doubt one of the best. Character development is awesome and dialogue excellent. The Conqueror keeps you enthralled during and wanting more when you're done...which is how every good book should be!Amy says: 5 / 5Soundtrack: Conquest by Whitestripes"},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This books is basically a bio about William the Conqueror. If I recall correctly, I believe that a lot of research went into this so there is also a lot of fact mixed in with the fiction.While I love European history, the bulk of this was just a little too much factual illustration of the life and times to keep my interest as a novel, let alone a romance.I will say, however, that there is one unforgettable point in this story where William answers Matilda's (Williams's wife) rejection of his suit. I'm not sure exactly of the historical accuracy but it surely made this story memorable for me."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Georgette Heyer may be best known for her Regency romances (which I have yet to read), but The Conqueror proves that she is a master of the art of non-romantic historical fiction, as well. She covers 19 years of William the Conqueror's life; from the age of 19 when he truly begins to take control of the Duchy of Normandy he inherited as a child, to his victory at the Battle of Hastings and subsequent crowning as King of England at age 38.Heyer's style embodies what I consider the very best historical fiction; it is obviously well-researched, well-written, and told in a fine, slightly old-fashioned style. Although the heart of the story is naturally William, Heyer cleverly works in other characters through which she is able to tell many more angles of the history. For instance their is Raoul (arguably the main character of the book), a young Norman contemporary of William's. At age 19 he swears loyalty to his Duke, whom he hopes will restore order and civility to lawless Normandy. Although he does ultimately follow William all the way, it is not without inner struggle. He respects, honors and loves William but does not always agree with him. I'm not sure if Raoul de Harcourt was an actual historical person or a creation of Heyer's imagination, but through him she is able to show the more compassionate and human side of the Normans than can be illustrated solely through the ambitious, driven, often ruthless Duke William.Other characters that Heyer skillfully uses are Edgar and Galet. Edgar (again I'm not sure if he was an actual person or a figment of Heyer's imagionation) was a Saxon hostage of William's. After years living in Normandy he develops an admiration for the Norman and especially for Raoul, with whom he has a strong bond of friendship. When he is reunited with his Saxon earl Harold, these feelings are challenged; through the character of Edgar Heyer illustrates the complicated relationships that no doubt existed between many Saxons and Normans. Through Edgar she is also able to present the differences between the Norman and Saxon cultures, and this she does skillfully. She manages to present both cultures, and to compare and contrast them in a way that shows their differences without making either seem better or superior than the other.Lastly, the character of Galet was an especially clever invention of Heyer. He is William's court jester (or \\"fool\\" as they were more typically called then), and he seems to be everywhere observing everything. Heyer has him appear at many crucial moments and, though his words are usually discounted and he is berated, he always ends up being correct.Heyer's style is timeless and eminently readable. Just as she does in her Regency romances, she uses the language of the period to help create a sense of time and place. Her descriptions of the people and places are vivid and, at times, even lyrical. Georgette Heyer's style is a bit old-fashioned, which may not appeal to everyone; if, for example, you're looking for violence in battles scenes or graphic and passionate sex scenes then you won't find them here (although, some of her battles scenes are vivid and somewhat gruesome). While this may turn some modern readers off, this is exactly what I love about Heyer's writing; she is able to transport the reader to another time and place and still keep it clean and free of sex, profanity and violence.After this book, I am definitely sold on Georgette Heyer! I have already bought up the rest of her historical novels and several of her Regencies, as well. I am pleased that she was so prolific, as I can look forward to many, many hours of enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Heyer is of course best known for her Regency romances such as Frederica, Cotillion, The Grand Sophy and more. However, as well as writing several detective stories set in the early 20th century she also wrote some historicals away from the Regency and Georgian periods that she made her own. 'The Conqueror' is one of these, the story of William the Conqueror who became the King of England after the Battle of Hastings in 1066.It's interesting reading the story with a positive view of the Norman Conquest when most latent English opinion is possibly rather more on the side of King Harold who was defeated at Hastings. It's part of Heyer's writing skill that enables her to paint a picture of an honourable and fearless man who was able to raise himself up from being an illegitimate nobody to a man worthy of the hand of Matilda, a high-born noblewoman. Heyer adds a fictional character, Raoul de Harcourt, to narrate to us much of the action, which does leave the reader somewhat distanced from William at times. However her mastery of battle scenes, the fact that she usually stays close to historical events in this story, add a great deal to the reader's enjoyment.Heyer's research into the periods in which she sets her books is well-known and in 'The Conqueror', alongside her other books, it shows. The eleventh century was of course a long time ago and certain aspects of the book, for example its language, mean it's not always an easy read. The pacing is good, however, and although the romance is a relatively minor part of the overall story, it is still well-handled, showing how two fiery and strong people can produce a genuine and deep affection.'The Conqueror', along with the other historicals such as 'My Lord John', 'Royal Escape', 'Simon The Coldheart' and others, are harder work for the reader than the lighter more popular romances. However their insight into life in some of the dangerous and fierce times in history are well worth experiencing.Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book Helen Hancox 2008"},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"William the Conqueror is an extremely interesting character, and Heyer succeeds in bringing him to life: along with all of his complexities. Her book is a fascinating account of the life of William and I especially found it interesting to learn about his military stratergies. He seemed to be very ahead of his time in military tactics. Heyer's account of the Battle of Hastings, 1066, is very good.However, I gave this book 3 stars as opposed for 4 because I am reviewing it as a novel, and not as a textbook. The narrative structure is a little bit non-sensical and the plot has sometimes not been developed properly as Heyer no doubt was concerned instead with the accuracy and broad spectrum of historical fact.Nevertheless, this is a good book to pick up if you care to be whisked off to the time of Saxons vs. Normams."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This novel is set in the time of William the Conqueror. In the beginning he struggles just to stay alive, betrayal and death lurk in every corner and he never knows who to trust. However, he manages to stay alive and because of this his determination to rule over a peaceful duchy and later England drives him. Some of his decisions shock even his most faithful servant and friend, Raoul de Harcourt. Raoul known as \\"The Watcher\\" because he sleeps outside William's door at night to protect him, really does save his life more than once.More than once I found myself admiring William for he was a complex ruler and not always ruthless. However, in the end, I still felt for Harold who briefly became King Harold I of England because no matter what novel I have read about the \\"Oath\\" made to William by Harold, it always seemed forced.Once you get past the flowery chivalry-type language you find a worthwhile page turning novel! This book was much better than The Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz (which was forgetable!) and was more insightful of William's personality during his eventful life and leadership. It is out-of-print but well worth the time to locate and read!This review refers to the Harcover edition."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"\\"The Conqueror\\" reflects the true genius of this talented historical author. I have read nearly all of Georgette Heyer's books, and was particularly drawn to her Regency era novels, but I believe this historical depiction of William the Conqueror is her greatest masterpiece!Let me re-phrase ... I was never interested in Medieval historicals, and never particularly drawn to that era in history either. Heyer's novels, however, drew me steadily back in time, century by century, until she involved me and gripped me through all periods of British history. Here was I, a lover of historical fiction, who detested warfare and violence, but who became ever so unexpectedly engaged in love of battle. She brought William, Duke of Normandy, to vivid life. She molded him skilfully into this engaging, though fearsome, character with whom any person across the centuries could identify. She then created the perfect foil in Raoul de Harcourt, the endearing, sensitive contrast to his master, the fighting Duke. Her skilful use of period language is unparallelled. This biographical novel is, all told, a magnificent tapestry woven with immense skill. I could not put the book down and I could not have enough of it!\\"Simon the Coldheart\\" was the first of Heyer's Medieval novels to clinch my interest. Anyone who fell in love with \\"The Conqueror\\" would also swoon over \\"Simon the Coldheart\\". I do not hesitate to recommend it.This author deserves the highest accolades that no words of mine can hope to express. I wish she were still alive so I could have conveyed my tribute to her in person. But since I cannot, I hope instead to entice others to appreciate the true genius of this writer. She has the power to teach love of history as no other author I've read. It is a great pity that Georgette Heyer does not receive the same kind of adulation as a period author as, for instance, Jane Austen does. In my view, she is not only in her league, but actually better. Jane Austen wrote from personal knowledge of a life she knew intimately. Georgette Heyer writes with better wit and skill from posterity. And in her writing goes a depth of research that not even Austen would have matched."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Once I got past the first several pages the book came alive to me and was wonderful from there to the end. Very interesting historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This novel was difficult to get through because of the names of the numerous characters and the style of writing. This book was published in 1931 so maybe this was why it was unsmooth reading and storytelling. Although slow going, I did finish the book and I am definitely much more versed on the life of William the Conqueror. I am hoping to find more enjoyable historical fiction about William the Bastard by some more modern authors."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"I bought this based on the great reviews, which is how I buy a lot of books I read. This wasn't one of my better choices. I know the story of William, his wife Matilda, their sons, Battle of Hastings, etc. I just found this book boring. I skipped through much of it. It never got or held my attention."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This was a well written book .I really enjoyed it.Anyone that loves French and English history this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"\\"All through his life men were to fear him and find it hard to meet the direct stare he bent upon them. Thus early the French were made aware of the ruthless strength of his will. The truth was he never swerved from his purpose, and would go to any lengths to achieve it.\\"History tells us that William of Normandy was born a bastard, held off multiple assassination attempts, became Duke of Normandy, repelled the French and invaded England to become it's King.This is the same story that Georgette Heyer tells here only it is told very thrillingly indeed.She begins her story with the birth of William and a prophetic dream of his mother who foresees him as a great tree spreading it's branches over both England and Normandy. As others whisper that he is bastard, she calls him king. The story ends with his coronation in London, Christmas 1066 after the bloody, hard fought battle of Hastings.In between these two milestones is a wonderful story of a charismatic, often enigmatic, man of towering self confidence and will. It is told mainly through the eyes of one his closest knights, Raoul de Harcourt. Because of his birth William had to pretty much subdue Normandy to accept his rule. Raoul is an idealistic youth who is sure that William will bring peace and prosperity to Normandy. Because of this he runs away to court to swear service to William. While there he manages to help thwart an assassination plot and is at William's side from that point on.Although I was very familiar with Heyer's writing through her Regency romances and her modern mysteries, this book was a complete revelation. I had always loved her stuff and had always held her as an example of a very elegant and witty writer. But reading this, my respect for her abilities has ratched way up.First the storytelling was excellent. What could have been a dry or even overly romantic catalog of events of a real person's life, instead was an exciting story that sucked me in and never once let me go. This was more a character study than anything. Sure the events were there, but each assassination attempt, each usurpation attempt, each war was a set piece to draw a picture of a superb war strategist, a merciful and very wise ruler, a shrewd judge of character and a person who inspired men to follow him.Second was the language. It was simply luxurious. Heyer used french derivations, archaic words and even the archaic meanings of common words to really create a sense of time and place. Her descriptions of places, people, clothing and food were rich and involved. One passage for a banquet reads:\\"Gisela began to eat of a Lombardy leach, flourished and served with a sober-sauce, but she did not eat much of it because her quick eye had observed all manner of delicate dishes on the board, and she meant to taste as many as she was able. She glanced around her and wondered aloud whether the Lady Adeline would instruct her in the way to make appulmoy, and whether it were well to put a dash of cubebs in a blank desire. One of the scullions had just brought in a dish of curlews. Gisela finished up what was left on her platter in a hurry. The curlews were served with chaldron, and Gisela was occupied for some time in trying to make up her mind whether this was flavoured with canelle or powder-douce.\\"Third were the scenes of battles. I admit I am not a keen reader of battle descriptions and probably would have tended to skim or skip them. But each battled was prefaced by a strategy session. Invariably William would think of some new, unorthodox strategy that flew in the face of conventional thinking and his advisors and vassals would strongly argue against it.\\"Warfare, as the barons understood it was a matter of chivalry charging to sound of tucket and drum; strategy was of the roughest order: one chose one's ground, one laid ambushes, or made surprise attacks, but while the battle raged there could be nothing to it than hand-to-hand fighting in a tight pack. But the Duke bent over his miniature battlefields, and moved his pawns this way and that, slowly evolving a more intricate way of war than his captains could understand.\\"William is credited with introducing archers as part of war rather than just for sport. And during his first battle with Henry of France, where he allows the French to advance deep into Norman territory, on unfamiliar ground, to a place of swamp land and uncertain footing so that the poachers and farmers could pick off the unwary, speaks of nascent guerrilla warfare. To read these scenes and see his strategy come alive and prove its merit to his naysayers is fun and thrilling stuff.And finally, it isn't all war and mayhem. History has by all accounts noted that the marriage of Williams and his wife Matilda was a strong, fruitful and loving one. Indeed, their courtship in this book is quite a stormy and passionate one. And in her way, Matilda is just as implacable and fierce as her husband.Loved this book and am now looking to read more Heyer historicals"},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Although Heyer is best known as the Queen of Regency romance, relatively few people know that her passion was historical fiction. \\"An Infamous Army\\" was used as a textbook in military academies because of her incredibly detailed information on the Battle of Waterloo. In \\"The Conqueror\\", she turns her attention to William, the Norman Duke who conquered England in 1066. It's a fascinating look at a man who beat the odds - and too many enemies to count - and wound up with a crown. There is some romance, but based on fact. Spurned by a well-born woman who scorned his base blood, he went right into her castle and beat her. After that, he married her and it appears to have been a very successful union, resulting in eight children. William had tremendous vision and this novel brings a terrific sense of a man who is driven on many levels. Wisely, Heyer is restrained in the use of medieval language, so the reader navigates smoothly through the book. A host of secondary characters are well-rounded, and the plight of people caught underfoot in the constant warfare is also depicted. I've read this book at least six times over the years and it holds up perfectly, which is why I give it five stars. Anyone who has read Heyer's other historical fiction will enjoy it, but I think anyone who likes historical fiction and has avoided Heyer because they thought it was romance should give this a try as well."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Written with an emphasis on the personal, dramatic narrative of Duke William of Normandy. Accurate historically, Heyer adds life and detail to the motivations and challenges that provoke William to lay claim to the title of King of England. Essentially a life history from his illegitimate birth through the Battle of Hastings with a hard fought victory against Harold the saxon. Not just ahistory book, but a tale told through mainly his personal body guard and best friend. Mature, not overly romantic, and just the right emphasis on politics, personal struggles and battlefields."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Despite it's subtitle (\\"A Novel of William the Conqueror The Bastard Son Who Overpowered a Kingdom and the Woman who Melted His Heart\\"), there is very little in this novel that relates to the relationship between William and his wife Matilda. Though there is a chapter devoted to his determined \\"conquering\\" of her (including his beating of her when at first she refused to marry him), it's not a love story nor a romance. The story begins in 1028 with William's birth and continues to his coronation Christmas Day 1066, though most of the book is taken up with the battles for and around Normandy.William is portrayed as a hard man molded by his dubious beginnings, his relentless determination to have his will carried out and his ambition for the crown of England (ostensibly to secure Normandy's future). He was a brilliant strategist in war, which he was about most of his days, and he could be exceedingly cruel when it served his purposes. He valued courage and loyalty. In this story he says that Harold Godwinson is the only man he (William) respects. But that didn't stop William from using Harold, forcing him to give an oath of fealty (or face a gilded imprisonment in Normandy), the breaking of which he used against Harold to secure the Pope's backing for the planned invasion of England. The author does a good job of showing how William always served his own needs and any good he did for others was motivated by what it could gain him. Perhaps that is what it took to gain a country like England but the author suggests there was something lost in the man for the effort as echoed in the reservations uttered by the men who served him. For that, Heyer deserves full marks at bringing the real man to life.The history presented here is interesting and entertaining, though I felt like I needed a dictionary, a map of France in the 1050s and 60s and a notepad for all the names and places thrown at me, particularly when so many men around William had the same first name. Such things also slowed down the reading of the tale in places and made it difficult at times to understand just what was going on or who the men were behind all those names.In large part (perhaps the best part), this is the story of a friendship between one of William's closest knights, Raoul de Harcourt, and a Saxon, Edgar, who held lands under Harold Godwinson and who was the hostage of the Duke of Normandy. And, if there is a romance here, it's the love story between Raoul and Edgar's sister, Elfrida."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Most readers know of Georgette Heyer as the person who quite literally created the genre of the \\"Regency Romance\\", that is, books set in the period of time when King George III was insane and for many years his eldest son, \\"the regent\\" ruled England....it is the same time period, in general, as that of Jane Austen and the dry humor in Heyer's books often reminds me of Austen's.However, Heyer also wrote several historical novels set in the Middle Ages, as well as her very good book on the Battle of Waterloo. It is part of her series about two of her Regency families, and while it has many fictional characters, and fictional dialog, Heyer describes the times, the place and the battle very realistically.An Infamous Army: A Novel of Wellington, Waterloo, Love and War. She made a point of having the Duke of Wellington \\"say\\" nothing in her book that he did not actually say in reality.She also wrote a good book, in my opinion, on the escape of 21 yr old King Charles II from England and Cromwell's dictatorship during the English Civil War in :Royal Escape: In which a dare-devil King with a price on his head fools his enemies and terrifies his friends.In her telling of the life of William the Conquerer (The Conqueror: A Novel of William the Conqueror, the Bastard Son Who Overpowered a Kingdom and the Woman Who Melted His Heart) Heyer begins with his birth to the unwed mistress of the then Duke of Normandy; and takes it on through the conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Of course, almost all the dialogue is fictionalized as are many of the characters, but others are based on actual people, and there are quotes from both William, his wife Matilda of Flanders, and others. (I should add that despite the title, there is not too much \\"historical romance\\" regarding William and Matilda, his wife. She remains a prescence but this is NOT a historical romance, which I appreciate.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPOILER ALERT:As a bastard child, to use the terminology of that time; William had a truly horrible childhood. His father died young, on Crusade, and while he intended to leave the Duchy of Normandy to his only child, William, the adult relatives of the late Duke, as well as other Nobles, did all in their power to circumvent this. In the point of view of their time, a bastard child could be acknowledged, given education, lands, money, but NOT inherit a title.William was eight or so years old when his father died and he lost that protection. The rest of his childhood was spent in hiding, in being moved from place to place and in vicious attacks on the people trying to protect him, ending with the deaths of most of them; and yet finally at age 19 or so, William was able to ascend to the throne of Normandy, though rebellions against him went on for many years.... By all accounts, and Heyer makes this clear, he was ruthless as he had to be in his era; and yet fair when ruling as Duke of Normandy.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- END SPOILER ALERT:Having read the non-fiction book1066: The Year of the Conquestby David Howarth ( a clear, short readable book not written for professional historians only: a plus!) I would say that Heyer certainly got the last half of the book \\"right\\", that is, that is, the period leading up to William's decision to conquer England, and why, as well as the battle itself with its' world changing effects...England ceased being a small unimportant island, and became a Norman outpost of culture and part of the bigger world of Catholic Western Europe, from that time on.Heyer is very sympathetic to the Saxons, whom we know will be conquered: especially Earl Harold, who is the man that the Saxons of England wanted as King, and who fought William at Hastings.Another reviewer mentioned the Bayeaux Tapestry which \\"tells\\" the story of the conquest of England in art, and was probably created not long after the events.....specialists, art historians and historians are still not completely sure WHO created this masterpiece. Heyer goes with the older belief it was William's wife Matilda and her ladies; but that is not known, and can't be proven or disproven.The Bayeux Tapestryedited by David Wilson: I was lucky enough to find this (originally $200. book for about $20., on Amazon of course) book on the Bayeaux tapestry, which is new, up to date, and shows in beautiful oversize print each panel of the tapestry, as well as in the back of the book, a brief description of what each panel shows. The foreward also goes into the history of tapestry, as it is known, and verifies we cannot know who created it. If you are interested in the Conquest of England, the Battle of Hastings, etc, I'd suggest also getting this beautiful coffee table sized book.It is interesting, to me, to learn that the Bayeaux Tapestry remains our BEST historical source for the Battle of Hastings and conquest of England in 1066.Overall I'd recommend Heyer's view of Duke William the Bastard....later known as William the Conqueror....She describes life in Normandy with great detail, the feudal lifestyle, the life of the commoners as well as the nobility, and the description of the Battle of Hastings is vivid and intense and hard to forget.

While I normally love historical fiction (unable to put a book down), this novel had a hard time keeping me interested. There were sections that did have me wanting to shut out the world and keep reading, but there were just as many boring storylines that had me looking at my bookshelf longingly.Well-researched and portrayed for the time period, I have no complaints in that department. Heyer used great descriptive detail to portray the culture and history. The war-torn battlefields especially were very in-depth.However, Heyer's writing style thoroughly annoyed me. As an editor, I wanted to go through the book and correct the punctuation with a big, red pen. Written in 1931, perhaps this is just a style of the times, or the style of some genre I've never read before, but I found the break in my reading flow quite distracting.Another letdown for me was that the book was told from the viewpoint of Raoul, William's right-hand man. Not quite biography, not quite historical fiction, I was disappointed that the novel didn't let me inside William's head. Personally, if I can't be inside the historical character's head, then I'd rather read a biography of the person than fiction.Lastly, William's relationship with Matilda was so talked up on the book cover and everywhere else, but in truth, it was just a small piece of the novel and seemed to be missing too much of the real storyline to make sense. In contrast, the relationship between Raoul and his friend, Edgar, had much more romance and love portrayed. I kept wondering when the two of them would become more than friends, but then Raoul fell in love with Edgar's sister, Elfrida, putting that pondering to rest.In closing, it wasn't an altogether bad book.

One of these, Andy O'Meara has courageously told his story in this moving, informative, and historically appropriate book. His story needs to be read so that our people can understand the brave men and women who did their duty faithfully and honorably, then were treated so badly. Here in stark detail is the other side of the story."},{"Title":"Accidental Warrior: The Forging Of An American Soldier","review":"This is the story of Andy O'Meara, who never intended to be a soldier. His plans were quashed by an overbearing father, who had his own notions of a career for his son. As a result of parental pressure, he went through West Point, but admits he didn't have his heart in it, and didn't do as well academically as he should have done.Once in the Army, he managed to get a bad reputation at the outset, one that dogged him (literally -- read the book) throughout the rest of his career. Nevertheless, he &quot;soldiered on.&quot; The book describes his Vietnam tour up to his being evacuated as wounded, his tour of duty in Germany and then the U.S., both with an armored division and later the Army Staff.Much of his story deals with the way the Army was mismanaged throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and how this affected the troops. The reader gets to see the peronsal effects of the mismanagement on the troops themselves, through the author's eyes. In particular, he condemns Defense Secretary Robert McNamara for robbing forces elsewhere to fund the war in Vietnam. (I spent much of my 25-year military career as an operations analyst. I share his opinion of McNamara.)He doesn't spare himself either in the telling. He describes the breakup of his marriage, placing much of the blame on himself. No harsh words about his &quot;ex,&quot; just straightforward description.Overall it's the story of a man who went through some trials that would have broken a lesser man. He's honest about how much of his problems were his own fault.For those who were in Vietnam or who served in a Cold War assignment, it will ring true. For those who want to understand what those years did to the men who lived through them, it will give the unvarnished story. I highly recommend it.One thing should be kept in mind.

There is a quality of Kafka more than Tolstoy. The power is so distant. But then Solzhenitsyn takes himself and us into the mind of Stalin himself. This is the weakest part of the book. He makes sounds which he imagines to be Stalin's, as having Stalin think of going to Church- like Christians everywhere. One never feels inside Stalin. It seems almost a childlike view of the dictator. In many ways it is as one-sided, though not as propagandistic or overtly phony as the many \\"studies\\" of Hitler. \\"Ten years! That's no sentence. Thirty years.\\"One can see the horror of arbitrary power, but not look into the soul of its possessor. There is an immense suffering implied by the men driven away on the meat truck- the one who says they are leaving Hell and the other who says No! We are going there now. There is more reality in the suffering of a man who cares only for family. It is tempting to compare this book with \\"Les Miserables\\" by Victor Hugo. I think Hugo's picture of victimhood is less realistic, more Romantic than Solzhenitsyn's. \\"The First Circle\\" is a book that ought to be read- that much I can honestly say--though I feel Solzhenitsyn bit off more than he could chew.

I probably will not finish it."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"Maybe the fault is with the translator, or maybe it is because the author is really a mathematician, but i found this book leaden and uninspiring. The prose are workmanlike to say the least. The dialogue is stilted and would sound at home in mouths of Dostoyevsky's or Turgenev's creatures.Aside from the hero, the characters --and their voices-- are undifferentiated. The women are two dimensional like figures constructed from formulas of femininity rather than real women drawn from life.The same is true of Solzhenitsyn's play of ideas. One theory trotted out after another. The characters who orate them as simply mouthpieces for the author's erudition. As didactic as a textbook. All that's missing is footnotes. Of course it was not possible for the publisher to refine and polish the text in collaboration with the author as all the great novels of the 20th C were, so we really can't expect it to live on the page as do the great novels of the 20th C. Still, I can't help but think Solzhenitsyn's Nobel was for his politics than his prose. Is he really the equal of his contemporary honorees Kawabata, Beckett, Boll or Neruda?The great power of The First Circle is its insight into Stalin's terror. But there are many other books on this theme, many of them much better. Koestler'sDarkness at Noonsprings first to mind. Nadezhda Mandelstam'sHope Against Hope: A Memoiris the undisputed masterpiece of the genre--and the has the benefit of being all true. Every page of that wrenching memoir is as soul searing as... as... as a poem byAkhmatova, another victim and survivor of the terror. There are even academic books written with more style and feeling than The First Circle.Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsarfor instance. And the works of Bruce Lincoln (Sunlight at Midnight: St. Petersburg and the Rise of Modern Russia) who was a superb writer as well as historian.I know that Russian is near impossible to translate, yet there are so many works of grace and power available to us in English. With so many great and truly moving books about the horrors of the Soviet Revolution, Stalin's reign and life in the camps and asylums, I cannot recommend this lumpen tome."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"The theme of this book is not prison camps: it is nothing more narrow than life itself. And it is almost as rich in characters and stories within stories (here Solzhenitsyn is very like Tolstoy) as life: constancy in love, artistic integrity, the whimspy of fate, literacy in Medieval Novgorod, the prison in the Count of Monte Cristo, snow, how to sew, the law of unintended consequences.A few major abiding themes run like threads throughout the book, providing unity: First, the life of the &quot;zek,&quot; the prisoner in Stalin's camps. Second, loneliness: not just of prisoners longing for a woman or lost loved ones, or of persecuted wives trying to make lives for themselves, but ultimately of each person. Every conversation carries a different meaning for the people involved. The author &quot;gets inside of peoples heads&quot; in an amazing way -- from the janitor Spiridon to the &quot;Best Friend of Counter-Intelligence Operatives,&quot; Joseph Stalin himself. Third, and on a deeper level, integrity, both artistic and moral.Fourth, and I don't know if this was the conscious intent of the author or not, the book reminds us of the unity of Western civilization. Aside from mentions of Tolstoy, Dostoevski, Pushkin, and Lermontov, (which, I might add, also describes the company Solzhenitsyn belongs in, with honor), the book is honeycombed with references to the great thinkers and artists of European civilization -- from the ancient Greeks and the Gospels, to Dante, the Holy Grail, Bach and Beethoven. The Marxist Rubin even quotes Luther. Primarily, no doubt this is a reflection of the fact that the prisoners in the &quot;sharashkas,&quot; the top-secret scientific work camps, were educated men, unlike, say, the hero of his shorter novel, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. (The contrast Solzhenitsyn draws to their well-paid Neanderthal captors is just one form of the irony that is his most distinctive and powerful stylistic weapon. But even the Neanderthals, including Stalin himself, are portrayed not as cardboard villains, but with insight and imagination.) These references also remind us that, as much as Solzhenitsyn has been accused of being a &quot;Slavophobe,&quot; as if that were an insult, the Russian culture he loves is an integral part of Western civilization. This iconic dialogue of the ages, similiar to the works of great Chinese painters, also adds another layer of delight to the book.The final and greatest thread that unifies this work is the idea of achieving humanity, of becoming what a person ought to be, of heroism. The prisoners are poets, eccentric, and philosophers (though there are also scoundrels, and everyone is tempted that way), beaten down by life and the forces of disolution within, trying to preserve their souls, or civilization, from the barbarians who are their masters. In describing the simple heroism of some of his characters, Solzhenitsyn achieves brilliance. In my opinion, First Circle is the greatest of his works, and one of the most powerful pieces of writing of the 20th Century, at least. And it is not about the Gulag, primarily: it is about what it means to be human, and the choices we all face.Aside from the characters and stories, many of the scenes are wonderful (again like Tolstoy): of Rubin standing in the courtyard at night in the snow when he hears the train whistle, of the party at the prosecutor's house, of the arrest of the diplomat. If life is sometimes too strange for fiction, (and it is) there are also pieces of fiction that seem truer than life. First Circle is a marriage of style and substance made in heaven, or at least, the highest circle of hell.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"I was first introdced to Solzhenitsyn's works when I was a freshman in high school, far too many years ago in a little town. The book was the Volume 1 of The Gulag Archipelago. It was really an eye-opener for me in so many ways, given that it was the first &quot;really serious&quot; book that I'd read.I believe that Solzhenitsyn is the best writer of the 20th century, or at least he's the top writer I've read so far (and I've read a lot of books). Maybe that's influenced by my early exposure, but I don't think so; I find his works just as compelling now as I did then.The First Circle is one of his most &quot;accessible&quot; works (that is, you can just jump in and start reading) and probably one of his best. A very compelling story; his portraits of the various vile creatures of the Soviet government have been shown to be quite accurate, and the way the various plots intertwine and are resolved is wonderful.The First Circle gives great insight into a culture totally foreign to most US citizens, as the book's a mixture of spy novel, guide to life in a Gulag camp, and brief introduction to Soviet society of the 1950s. A depressing place to be sure, but fascinating. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"No other book will summarize so brilliantly the absurdity of a system in which the quest for the common good was just a trap for the independence and free will of each person. All the events during the novel take place in just one week. Nevertheless during that brief period the author manages to convey the dark existence for millions of citizens of the USSR during the whole Stalinst period, so the overall impression is that the novel drags on for years and years.The narration of the story takes place in several different fronts which seem to connect at the end, but that never happens. Each character goes on with his life, and the reader is left to wonder what happened. Oddly enough this is part of the beauty of this novel and makes a lot of sense because Solzhenitzyn will stress until the end the lack of right for any person or system to deny a person of its individuality and abrogate for itself the power to guide other's destiny. Threfore, how could he do the same to the members of its novel? So he refuses to place a final point to their development.To put it more briefly, just read it is a great book."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"Solzhenitsyn has written for the benefit of the rest of us, a work that recreates the madness that was life under Stalin. The First Circle is a story about what happens when the talents of a nation are wasted because those in power happen to be incompetent men (that tends to be generally the case, except New Zealand). At the heart of it, it is a testament to the power of a free market to value resources and direct them to where they are most valued.Well, no, not really. Solzhenitsyn is not a capitalist at heart and his work does not disparage communism. It is a non-partisan look at a cross section of society that had to suffer the loss of lives, loved ones and youth. It is about their hope in spite of the circumstances surrounding them.Solzhenitsyn's earlier work _One day in the life of Ivan Denisovich_ made Soviet society realize the genius that was in their midst. The First Circle cements Solzhenitsyn reputation as one of the greats of modern Russian literature. This book deserves to be in your collection.Trust me, you will not regret reading this. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"The \\"restored\\" version of IN THE FIRST CIRCLE gives Anglophone readers access for the very first time to one of the three peaks of Solzhenitsyn's literary universe(the other two being the multivolume works THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO and THE RED WHEEL). The importance of this volume has nothing to do, as one reviewer inaccurately suggested, to \\"hype\\" on the part of Harper Collins. It is Solzhenitsyn who repeatedly lamented the fact that the world only knew IN THE FIRST CIRCLE, as it now properly called, in an \\"ersatz, truncated\\" form. It is he who in his \\"Author's Note\\" to this edition speaks of this edition being the only \\"authentic\\" one. His \\"restoration\\" of the original work, first published in Russian in the West in 1978, goes far beyond dramatically transforming the opening of the work. New chapters such as chapters 44, 47, and 61 deepen our understanding of Solzhenitsyn's own intellectual odyssey from Marxism to skepticism to a more robust affirmation of natural justice, conscience, and self-limitation, the hallmarks of the Solzhenitsynian intellectual and moral universe. Innokenty Volodin becomes a much more substantial figure in the course of the 96 chapter version of IFC. The great philosophical dialogue between the zeks Nerzhin, Sologdin, and Rubin is substantially fleshed out. There is a new and very suggestive chapter on Stalin making for five and not four chapters on the Soviet tyrant. Solzhenitsyn's hatred of Communism and all its works is even more pronounced in this edition, so much so that he freely countenances the legitimacy of treason against what he regards as a radically evil regime. I should add that the late Harry T. Willetts was Solzhenitsyn's preferred translator for a reason: his rich, supple, and remarkably accurate translations stand head and shoulders above the others. Those who are interested in a more detailed study of the literary, political, and philosophical significance of the 96 chapter version of In THE FIRST CIRCLE can turn to my piece on the work (\\"The Moral Witness of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\\") in the October 2009 issue of FIRST THINGS. To a reviewer above let me add that IFC first appeared in French in 1984, not 2007--American publishers have been lamentably slow in recent decades in bringing the work of the greatest writer of the twentieth century to the attention of the reading public.--Daniel J. Mahoney"},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"Drawing its title from the home of the Virtuous Pagans in Dante's Inferno, The First Circle is an epic tale of brilliant engineers and scientists imprisoned by the Soviets in a work camp.This is not the ordinary work camp, however. Instead of the daily, torturous cold that Ivan Denisovich faces in another of Solzhenitsyn's novels, the prisoners face a subtler cruelty: they cannot return home to their families until they invent certain &quot;tools&quot; for the Soviets to use against alleged (and probably innocent) spies and turncoats who would in turn be imprisoned themselves.The prisoners are thus left with this moral choice: Do they sell their souls to leave this land of no hope and return home to their families and lives? Or do they resist the call to escape back to &quot;earth&quot; and, as a result, end up (like Dante) being sent into the REAL hell of the GULAG?All the while, Solzhenitsyn maintains a vitriolic wit, and the final product stands as an invective not just against the Soviet way of life but against the materialism so prevalent there and around the world, especially in the U.S.Combine The Brothers Karamozov with Catch-22, and you have The First Circle."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"This novel is set in what passes for the best of the worst: Research duty for ex-Gulag inmates who know what misery really is. Working on idiotic deadlines set in response to Stalin's quirks, the prisoner-scientists live in a world of denial and unreality akin to Dilbert on crack. A worse fate befalls their jailer-managers, who are \\"free,\\" agents of the government, and must justify repeatedly failing to meet the ridiculous deadlines that their bosses set out of fear of offending The Boss, which typically ends in either immediate execution or in joining the ranks of those in chains.Some things that stood out as I read this book were the universality of the bureaucratic mindset: avoidance of responsibility, inertia as a policy, stonewalling, and turfmanship, all in place of actual achievement or progress in any meaningful way. Another thing is the prevalence of a false-accuser culture, where anonymus denouncements can destroy the innocent quickly, without explanation or even a trace. (Given the state of our own society today, and the risk/reward calculus that favors the accuser, this trait appeared even more ominous to me as I read the book.) The denial that gripped some of the inmates, either wholly (Rubin) or partially (Nehrzin, in the beginning, and others) about why they were in prison reminded me of \\"The Matrix,\\" in that they were dreamwalking through life in a mist of Marxist/Communist mumbo-jumbo, rationalizing their fates as random chance, a mistake, the failing of the system even, but almost never as an understanding of their suffering being inherent in the System itself. As Nehrzin awakes to this, to a degree (and the author may be semi-autobiographical in his sketch of this character, like himself a decorated artillery officer imprisoned over virtually nothing), he opens his eyes to the existence of the matrix of lies, false theory supporting false gods, etc., that has fully ensnared Russia and all within her power, hostage not only to Stalin's perversity, creeping madness, and hurbis, but to a system that is itself a reflection of all of these characteristics, too. The xenophobic search for American spies undermining Motherland security under every bush, the rewriting of history to support the current lies, and the occasional mind that breaks free by rejecting those lies, as Nehrzin did, starting in his youth, reminds one of Ayn Rand's \\"We the Living.\\"Echoing \\"1984,\\" the older prisoners remember things as they were before the official history filled men's minds. Things had been different than they were being told, better, materially and spiritually. The prisoners themselves were frequently veterans - those who had done the most for the State reaping an unlooked-for reward, like Belisarius blinded by a jealous Justinian, left to beg in the streets. The theme of war and survival is a thread that binds the veterans, either prisoner or \\"free,\\" to each other. A bond of another kind exists between the inmates and their women - the latter mostly loyal, giving up their youth, and the possibility of starting a family, waiting for a release that may never come, sustained by the rare visit that bureaucratic stonewalling and trickery tries to prevent, their love provides a flicker of hope in the ashes of their ruined lives, where even being suspected of marriage to a political criminal was enough to make earning a living an impossibility, since the State was sole employer.Something else that seemed relevant to America today was the culture war that Yaralov, an ex-prisoner now running a research lab as a Colonel, remembers while pondering his posible return to zek status, from his youth. He gave up the love of a Christian girl because while the Orthodox Church was legal in the 1920s, it was not politically correct. As an ambitious young man with a future, Yaralov was torn between his woman and his career. As the Church was chased out of the public square, it suffered from remembered abuses of thise in its' hierarchy, although those failures to meet the standard ignore the origin of the standard in question - the Church itself. The sellout of a certain medaeval Metropolitan to the Tartars, used as an example by Yaralov in telling his betrothed why he will not side with the Church becomes a metaphor for bureaucratic sellout - applied by her to Yaralov when he chooses the System over what they both know he knows as the truth.Solzehenetsyn's account of life within the highest reaches of the Soviet Prison-Industrial Complex is both a fine story in its' own right and a warning to us that we can travel the same path, if we have already not begun to do so. It is also highly literate, filled with allusions to literary and historical figures from the full scope of the Western Canon, in which Russia shares, and contains very little in the way of anger - a remarkable achievement for one who emerged from the bowels of the Gulag. While anger is largely absent, satire abounds, especially comments by those on the outside about the \\"social origin\\" of others - in a supposedly classless society.This long book is well worth the time invested in it, as it is a work of rare and tragic beauty.-Lloyd A. Conway"},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"This immense story amazingly spans only a few days in the lives of several people unduly imprisoned by Joseph Stalin's secret police. Unlike the senseless horror of the &quot;gulag&quot;, The First Circle involves the incarceration of select and highly skilled prisoners in a relatively privileged Soviet prison which is really set up as a research laboratory where these skilled inmates are exploited for their expertise. Here, (after they've been arrested under any number of false pretenses) they are forced to invent and develop elaborate electronic devices which will help in the detection and arrest of any other &quot;subversives&quot;. The main gadget that they are called upon to produce is a &quot;phonoscopy&quot;... a device that will be able to accurately identify a person by examining recorded conversation.Right from the opening tense chapters, Solzhenitsyn once again had me in his grip. For me, he is the master at capturing the foreboding sense of loss of freedom. It is palpable... in some ways, worse than outright murder... because you know that whatever happens to his characters, they are going to have to LIVE through it... they aren't even afforded the luxury of dying. At one point, he used the phrases &quot;trampled yearnings&quot; &amp; &quot;soaring passion&quot; in one sentence and it stuck with me and I feel it summarizes what his characters face here in TFC. In ch.34 the protagonist, Gleb Nerzhin is musing with a fellow inmate on the hardships of imprisonment and he concludes that, of all his deprivations, by far the worst is the loss of freedom to be with his wife. She is allowed a visit once a year, and even then, he is not allowed to kiss her. Hearing this, his cellmate Gerasimovich concludes that &quot;there is probably only one path to invulnerability... to kill within oneself ALL attachments and to renounce ALL desires.&quot;This book looks deeply into the process of passivity that creeps into and consumes the life of the imprisoned. Also, there are times when it reminds us of the resiliency of the human spirit in the midst of numbing regret and longing. (I am thinking of the unforgettable scene of Rubin following the guard toward the end of ch.67).There is a passage in ch.84 which I think wonderfully capsulizes what Solzhenitsyn is telling us here in TFC: &quot;Unfortunately for people - and fortunately for their rulers - a human being is so constituted that as long as he lives there is always something more that can be taken away from him. Even a person imprisoned for life, deprived of movement, of the sky, of family, of property, can, for instance, be transferred to a damp punishment cell, deprived of hot food, beaten with clubs, and he will feel these petty extra punishments as intensely as his earlier downfall from the heights of freedom and affluence. To avoid these final torments, the prisoner follows obediently the humiliating and hateful prison regime, which slowly kills the human being within him.&quot;This is not a &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; book. We may be able to deny ourselves the luxury of exposure to Solzhenitsyn's themes, but one thing we cannot deny is the fact that his books are based upon things that actually happened in history. Because they did. And they do. Here is one of the finest writers of the 20th Century, and this is his masterpiece."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"For the second time in the last fifteen years, Harper & Row (or HarperCollins now), which claims to own the world-wide publishing rights to The First Circle, has stopped printing this magnificent work. They did it once before in the mid-90's. When I protested to them that I could not find copies enough for my students in a Russian literature course, they shrugged me off. Happily, after letting the book languish for two years, they then licensed publishing rights to Northwestern University Press. But according to Northwestern University, Harper will not let them renew the license. Nor is Harper printing the novel. According to my latest phone call to them, they might-- \\"perhaps as early as winter, 2009.\\" Ironic, is it not, that once censored in his own country, Solzhenitsyn now suffers the same fate because an American publisher, for reasons no one at Harper can explain, will not make it available to the reading public. I am hoping my students will be able to hunt down enough used copies to read it this spring, but . . . . Shame on Harper!"},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"This new translation of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's In The First Circle which appeared in English last year, presents a \\"restored text\\" of the Russian novelist's masterwork. It is a towering achievement -- in fact, I cannot think of another 20th century novel that comes close to it in moral authority and humanism.Reading some of our most acclaimed novelists today, one cannot but be struck by the smallness of their ambition. When was the last time an American or a British writer produced a great, sprawling work of literature encompassing dozens of characters and tackling truly great themes? (I certainly include my own modest works in this criticism). Perhaps the age of such novels is past. Perhaps there's no market for them. But for Solzhenitsyn, writing was an immensely powerful act of individual resistance to a monstrous regime. This magnificent book upholds the most important human values -- freedom, courage, dignity, truth and compassion in the face of totalitarian power.Solzhenitsyn wrote the book in the 1950s from internal exile in Kazakhstan after he was released from eight years in Gulag prisons and work camps. It describes four days in the lives of prisoners at a special camp for scientists and engineers on the outskirts of Moscow called Marfino.The Russian slang word for such a prison research institute is \\"sharashka.\\" Solzhenitsyn himself spent three years at Marfino from 1947 to 1950 and his stay there had a powerful effect on his political, intellectual and spiritual development.The time is Christmas 1949, just after the celebrations of Stalin's 70th birthday, shortly before he launched a new round of attacks on \\"Jewish cosmopolitans,\\" a development which is foreshadowed in the novel.The prisoners, or zeks, in the sharashka have it easier than in other Soviet camps -- they have enough to eat, warm, dry clothes, comfortable beds and access to work materials. Compared to the rest of the Gulag, they are, as it were, in the first circle of hell. But it is still hell. They are deprived of their freedom and contact with the outside world, which continues about its business just the other side of the razor wire. These prisoners can go years without receiving a letter from loved ones. If they are lucky, they are allowed one hour-long visit with their wives once a year, with a prison official present at all times. In the course of the book, we sit in on one of these heartbreaking meetings. And their crimes? More often than not, trumped up charges concocted by the state and arbitrarily applied.The history of the book is interesting. In the early 1960s, there was a slight thaw in Soviet publishing which allowed Solzhenitsyn to publish One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich which became a worldwide sensation. The author had already completed In The First Circle and decided to try to get it approved by the Soviet censors. To do so, he toned it down, eliminating several chapters, shortening others and softening the book's general anti-Soviet tone. It was still rejected.In 1968, when it was clear the regime would never allow his work to see the light of day, Solzhenitsyn agreed to allow this toned-down version to be published in the West. Even in its truncated form, it was hailed as a masterpiece. But that version, which I read as a student years ago, does not come close to the current, restored manuscript which finally appeared a year after the author's death.After he reached the United States, Solzhenitsyn became a controversial figure, alienating many with his denunciation of what he saw as the West's weak moral fiber and his championing of some of the more reactionary aspects of Russian nationalism and Russian orthodoxy. He did not like and never really understood the West. However, the quirky political views he developed in his old age should not blind us to the fact that Solzhenitsyn was entirely correct in his critique of the Soviet Union. He saw the full truth earlier than almost anyone and he had the courage to reveal it in all its horrific details.The book begins with a young diplomat, Innokenty Volodin, who phones the U.S. embassy from a pay phone in Moscow to report that in a few days a Soviet agent in the United States will be given crucial information about the atomic bomb. Innokenty has thought long and hard before making the call. He knows the risks, but asks himself, \\"If we live in a state of constant fear, can we remain human?\\"The clueless American at the other end of the line doesn't grasp the importance of the conversation and suggests that Volodin call the Canadian embassy where they understand Russian better. Of course, the organs of the state have recorded the conversation and a hunt begins to identify the caller. Enter the prisoner-scientists of the sharashka, some of whom are working on voice identification technology. They are given the job of identifying the traitor.They eventually narrow it down to two individuals, Volodin and one other, both of whom are arrested. After all, one of them is guilty of this crime -- and the other? He must be guilty of something -- for under Soviet jurisprudence, no-one is entirely innocent.Innokenty is arrested and taken to the Lubyanka. Solzhenitsyn gives us, in exquisite detail based on personal experience, a chilling description of what actually happened to people who were taken to that infamous prison and how they were broken and dehumanized even before their interrogation began.Solzhenitsyn's narrative technique is notable. Like Tolstoy in War and Peace he follows a pattern of having one character take central stage for a few chapters, before giving way to a second and then a third and fourth and fifth. In this way, he is eventually able to present a panoramic view of the whole of Soviet society. Occasional flashbacks enable the reader to get a taste of life in Moscow and in a Russian village, establishing a counterpoint to the main action within the prison.We get inside the heads of the various prisoners, each with his own experiences and worldview. We meet Rubin, a devout communist, still convinced of the correctness of a system that has done nothing but persecute and incarcerate him. Rubin is intelligent and kind, a loyal friend -- but morally blind. In one chapter, he organizes a satirical show trial for the historical figure, Prince Igor. He knows how cruel and unjust the system is, yet he persists in his loyalty to the revolution.The other main protagonist and counterpoint to Rubin is Gleb Nerzhin, the author's alter ego, a veteran of the camps groping for way to remain human and moral and find meaning in the world.As the book proceeds, we gain a full picture of prison life. We learn about stoolies, about how the inmates divert themselves; we listen to their discussions about history, Russia and the system that is destroying them. We also meet some of their doomed wives, fighting to hang on in the absence of their loved ones, trying to stay faithful while scratching out a living in a system that regards their husbands as \\"enemies of the people.\\"And then the book's focus widens even more. We meet the KGB officer in charge of security, the camp commandant, the Minister of State Security and in five chilling chapters we are privy to the thoughts of Stalin himself. These are some of the most masterful passages of the book. Solzhenitsyn resists the temptation to ridicule or satirize. He takes the monster completely seriously, without a trace of irony. There is dark comedy in these scenes as the head of State Security, Viktor Abakumov, sweating with fear, is summoned to the monster's lair at 3 am, not knowing whether to sit or stand, not knowing if he will survive the meeting or be taken out to be shot. This is an immensely powerful man, presiding over all the cruel power of the organs of security -- yet he himself is little more than a slave when confronted by the Supreme Leader. Stalin tells him not to worry: \\"When you deserve it, that's when we'll shoot you,\\" he says.The Stalin that emerges from these pages is totally convincing as a literary creation -- and totally evil.There are other passages of comedy in this book that lighten the load of the reader. In one chapter, none other than Eleanor Roosevelt visits one of the Gulag camps. Before she arrives, the place is cleaned up, pristine sheets are placed of the beds, the library is stocked with books and the prisoners are dressed in decent clothes, even blue silk underwear, and fed a wonderful meal. The First Lady departs full of admiration for the Soviet penal system. Of course, as soon as she leaves, the underwear is ripped off, the sheets disappear and it's back to normal.Even at this early stage of his career, Solzhenitsyn clearly viewed the Soviet Union as powerful and ruthless and the West as weak and gullible.In another scene, an official gives a hilarious lecture on dialectical materialism. Solzhenitsyn perfectly captures the verbal gymnastics, complete with pompous slogans and phrases, all of which mean nothing, of the 90-minute lecture. In another, a doctoral candidate has problems finishing her thesis. She is not allowed to quote foreign sources or give credit to capitalist authorities. She also has to make sure she is not citing any Russian who has fallen afoul of the system. She finds herself constantly rewriting to delete the names of people who have been arrested or disgraced since she completed the previous draft.Despite these moments of comedy, this is a sad book. So many lives destroyed, so much suffering - it's hard to come to terms with it all. The book's hero, Nerzhin, is obviously based on the author himself. We see him finally come to terms with the truth about his own country and its ideology and begin a journey toward spiritual freedom. Nerzhin refuses to work on the voice identification technology, knowing he will be expelled from the sharashka and transferred back into the Gulag proper. But before he goes, Nerzhin has one last conversation with a fellow prisoner in which he foretells the fall of the Soviet Union: \\"Perhaps ... the new age ... with its globalized information... I'm saying that maybe in the new age a new means will be discovered for the Word to shatter concrete.\\"To think this was written in the 1950s is incredible.Solzhenitsyn's narrative technique allows him to demonstrate that the entire Soviet Union is a place from which humanity has almost been eradicated. The prisoners of the sharashka may be in their own version of hell -- but in fact the country has been turned into a kind of penal colony.Solzhenitsyn and millions of others had their lives shattered by Stalin and his henchmen, who gave themselves the right and the power to enslave and indiscriminately pass sentence on an entire nation. But thanks to this book, we can be sure that history's verdict on Stalin and on the Soviet Union will be largely written by Solzhenitsyn."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"ALEKSANDR SOLZHENITZIN IS MAYBE THE BEST WRITER/NOVELIST/HISTORIAN OF THE 20TH CENTURY.I was initially fearful that this would be tough read, but it read very smoothly. It was exciting, full of suspense,pathos. His characters are very realistic. Many of them endure horrible suffering. Many overcome their troubles. Some ruin their lives by doing the right thing, by doing good, by thinking beyond their own narrow worlds. This book is very inspiring. But it is also very funny in spots. Some situations are unbelievably clever in their humor. (the visit of Eleanor Roosevelt to the prison and the guard having the prisoners all spiffed up for the occasion. The trial of Prince Igor according to the stalinist regime.) THE STORY DEPICTS LIFE IN RUSSIA UNDER STALIN.I LOVED THIS BOOK, A REAL PAGE TURNER."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"After \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\", this is Solzhenitsyn's greatest novel.Solzhenitsyn originally thought he might be able to publish \\"In the First Circle\\" in the Soviet Union, and so \\"lightened\\" it, removing some of the more \\"objectionable\\" material, including nine full chapters. All excisions are restored for the first time in English in this new edition.Told in Solzhenitsyn's compelling polyphonic style, the novel recreates the surreal, morally charged world of the sharashka--a secret institute within the Gulag system where scientists were assigned research tasks by those who locked them up in this \\"first circle of hell.\\" Yet Solzhenitsyn also conveys the hyper-paranoid world of the Soviet apparatchiki, and offers what may be the most vivid portrait of Stalin anywhere in literature.The central moral issue of the novel is whether to collaborate with a regime if this might enable the oppression of other innocents, or whether one should instead hold true to one's principles. The protagonists are tasked with identifying a traitor from only a tape recording, knowing that success in their research will condemn the man; if, however, they choose not to cooperate, they will be shipped off to a brutally severe labor camp.There is no preachiness here. This is a gripping novel in the best traditions of Russian realism, not one of the Nobel laureate's strident political statements. Masterfully translated by Harry T. Willets, it is rich with memorable characters, finely crafted episodes and beautiful language. In fact, the use and misuse of language is a central theme in the novel, juxtaposing the truthful, spare language of the inmates with the diarrheal nonsense of the corrupt regime.As reviewed inRussian Life"},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"This book is far from just &quot;a book for engineers&quot;. It is full of profound, thought-provoking ideas. It might be slightly difficult to read as it is long and has the standard russian-novel-sized cast of characters but it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"When the great author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn passed away in the summer of 2008, he left behind a bibliography of powerful masterpieces that rank him among the pinnacles of the Russian canon. Best remembered for his epic, three-volume magnum opus, \\"The Gulag Archipelago,\\" and his equally compelling novella, \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Desinovich,\\" Mr. Solzhenitsyn's legacy no doubt draws its origins from the traumatic and probing experiences he endured in Joseph Stalin's totalitarian regime. His writing, deep-seated in a tradition infused with lofty questions about philosophy, religion, and society, no doubt echoes the hallmarks of giants like Tolstoy, Turgenev, and Dostoevsky while reexamining the state of the Russian soul during this period of crisis.This latest reincarnation of his first novel, \\"In the First Circle,\\" calls for celebration among the author's English-language readers: it not only presents this magnificent score in its unabridged entirety, but also dresses the text in a translation that faithfully captures the raw, unfiltered intentions Solzhenitsyn had originally envisioned. Written under exceptionally difficult circumstances (composed after an eight year sentence in the Gulags, trailing his nearly fatal bout with cancer and his exile to Kazakhstan, and finally the United States), this novel's manuscript saw completion in 1958, yet continued to collect dust even after the author had garnered sensational, worldwide acclaim with Ivan Desinovich.Determined to have this novel reach the public eye, Solzhenitsyn revised the draft at least four times, excising nine chapters and re-tailoring characters and details to Soviet limitations before attempting to sieve it through the censors. However, such is the fate of art in Stalinist Russia, as the press refused him the permission to have it printed. In 1968, Mr. Solzhenitsyn desperately pursued to publish this novel in the West, thus submitting this \\"ersatz, truncated\\" manuscript that generated a hasty and bowdlerized translation entitled \\"The First Circle.\\" Although that preceding version vividly portrayed the moral degeneracy of the Stalinist regime, even the author himself recognized that it rendered only a half-baked blueprint devoid of the subtleties, the depth, and the richness of character explored in his uncut and unspoiled masterpiece.\\"In the First Circle,\\" a sprawling narrative set within a time frame of four days, is based largely on the period Solzhenitsyn spent in a Moscow prison facility that doubly served as a research institute, where technicians, professionals, and intellectuals are detained to assist in developing state security technology. The title, an allusion to the first circle of hell depicted in Dante's Inferno, connotes the slightly more humane treatment these zeks (prisoners) receive, much like the guileless philosophers condemned, albeit laxly, for having never known divine grace. Formally known as the sharashka, this privileged branch of the gulag network was described by one character as \\"practically paradise,\\" an irony considering that its inhabitants are stripped of everything, most glaringly their dignity.At the beginning of the novel, the Russian diplomat Innokenty Volodin contacts the US Embassy to warn of an impending espionage operation in New York, where a Soviet spy plans to steal information about atomic bomb designs. To his misfortune, the call is intercepted by the Soviet secret police, thus sparking an investigation that sends ripples throughout the entire system--involving the whole gamut of engineers, technicians, politicians (Stalin carves out as a vain, morbid, and self-absorbed character, and Eleanor Roosevelt saunters in with quite the humorous cameo appearance), university students, communist lackeys, writers, and diplomats, all of whom live with shattered or improbable dreams in this strident, monotonous, and featureless Russia.Back in the sharashkas, the zeks are charged into developing a device that identifies voices recorded from tapped phone conversations. The zeks who inhabit this \\"special prison,\\" while aware of their privileges relevant to the more inhumanely treated members of the Gulag network, encounter a stark moral dilemma that urges them to question their motivations for aiding a system bound to acts of corruption and evil. Near the end of the story, a number of zeks, including the autobiographical hero Gleb Nerzhin, defect to their moral conscience, even if that entails suffering under the icy brutality of the Siberian gulags.Though the Russia of Solzhenitsyn's construct rings not with the tsarist decadence, the Westward-looking dandyisms, the filigreed troikas, or the luxuriant samovars of a bygone century, the author nonetheless paints his fractured people with the pitch-perfect accuracy resonant with the ethos of the quintessential Russian character. In a throwback to tradition, the author interweaves his mammoth plot with gallery of garrulous Russians discoursing in matters of the religious (\\"Christianity is the faith of the strong in spirit. We must have the courage to see the evil in the world and to root it out\\"), the political (\\"Socialism promises only equality and a full belly, and that only by means of coercion\\"), and the social (\\"Indifference, the organism's last self-preservative reaction, has become our defining characteristic\\"), no doubt reminiscent of the heroes in those great 19th century classics--incisive in their observations of the world, critical of the malaises incurred by higher earthly and spiritual forces, yet utterly sensitive to the plights of the human condition. If anyone could be rightly called the inheritor of Tolstoy and Dostoevky's greatness, that artist would be Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.Readers certainly have much to unearth and discover in this marvelous rerelease of what is arguably Solzhenitsyn's finest work of fiction. This revelatory and authoritative edition owes its existence to the eminent Solzhenitsyn scholar and Calvin College professor emeritus Edward Ericson, who worked closely with the author's family to recover the missing chapters and to tie in loose ends when its translator, Harry Willetts, died in 2005. Now, more than fifty years since the initial completion of the manuscript, this version finally rescues the novel from its \\"tortured textual history,\\" restoring not only the lost text and other previously reworked details, but shedding greater light too on the pronounced elements of Christian morality deeply embedded in Solzhenitsyn's oeuvre.As the curtain closes at the end of the novel, a small group of zeks are shuffled into meat trucks bound for those forbidding labor camps. While there appears not the visible redemption or the resolve that greets these wounded characters at the end of their journey, this story provides instead a reaffirming answer against the evils of tyranny--that of an enduring \\"fearlessness\\" that remains undiminished and undefeated in the face of oppression. However bleak, \\"In the First Circle\\" is ultimately a moving tour de force, an indubitably great symphonic masterpiece that powerfully resonates with the moral strength, the goodness, and the resilience of our humanity."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"What does a gulag for the learned elite have in common with an American corporation? Far too much. I read this book years ago, and wish that I could find my copy again. Every engineering education should commence with a reading and discussion of this most engaging book, alongside Tracy Kidder's The Soul of a New Machine. Kidder covers the exterior of the engineering process in an American context of a specific time. Solzhenitsyn, though goes to the deep essential tension, of creativity commanded to flower, on a schedule, in the arid fields of rigid institutionalism."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"Solzhenitsyn's character development and ear for incorporating heavy ideas into dialogue properly are outstanding.

The characters represent different world views from Christian to Marxist. This edition (2009) is the complete uncensored version so if you read the previous censored version it did not contain the most powerful chapters."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"In the First Circle is Solzhenitsyn's quasi-autobiographical novel about life and politics within a sector of the Soviet Union's Gulag prison system- the sharashkas. These were camps with slightly better living conditions than the devastating labor camps, and were primarily concerned with beefing up the USSR's energy, surveillance, and weapon technologies. Here it is filled with a large cast of characters, people who are perhaps not quite as downtrodden as Ivan Denisovich (and in not quite as insufferable living conditions), but who nonetheless have a quotidian apathy about them that makes for a subdued environment. The plot itself is a little thin- deputies are on the lookout for a man who is calling in their atomic secrets into an American embassy- and mostly features scenes where people interact, coalesce, and share their ideologies about Communism, life, love, and the certainty of a bleak future.This is a book that I did not enjoy nor find particularly readable, but which I nonetheless could respect. Solzhenitsyn writes of relationships, among friends and lovers alike, with a startling honesty; he also differentiates his characters through their histories and ideologies rather than through their defining characteristics with great skill. It was also very interesting to get such a broad swathe of perspectives here, from workers of various abilities to their spouses of various fidelities to their guards of various ulterior motives. Also of note is the much-lauded section where Solzhenitsyn gets right into Stalin's beleaguered mind and makes him a portrait of impressive focus. Not quite the thriller it's cracked up to be, In the First Circle is nonetheless recommended reading for anyone interested in the Gulag system and the genuine perspectives of its prisoners."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"The best part of this book was the portrait of Stalin. It's hard to write about historic figures -- whether it's Lincoln, Hitler, or whomever, they usally end up sounding wooden or cliched. Yet here, the author &quot;gets into the head&quot; of Stalin. Reading it I felt, yes, that must be exactly what Stalin thought and felt like.The rest of the book is fine too, but Stalin remains the &quot;character&quot; I remember most."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"This publisher's marketing machine (as in an Oct., 2009 Wall Street Journal article by the author of this book's foreward) claims \\"In the First Circle\\" is now \\"finally available in the West\\". Not exactly. The same text as \\"In the First Circle\\" was published in France in 2007 as \\"Le Premier Cercle\\".More importantly, the publishers claim that the previous English version of \\"The First Circle\\" was \\"bowdlerized\\", not \\"authentic\\" and by implication, polluted by Solzhenitsyn's revisions when he attempted to get the book published in the Soviet Union. This is very misleading.Solzhenitsyn prepared two versions of this novel while writing in Russia in the 1960s. The version now called \\"In the First Circle\\", just published in English, was 9 short chapters longer and had a different opening plot line from \\"The First Circle\\", which he edited to 87 chapters and unsuccessfully attempted to publish in the Soviet Union.In that editing, Solzhenitsyn, genius that he was, crafted a far more powerful opening. That's the major difference between the two versions of the novel.\\"In the First Circle\\" (the newly published version) has a young Soviet diplomat, Innokenty Volodin, call the US Embassy in Moscow to warn about a Soviet spy operation in New York related to nuclear military secrets. As such, Innokenty is a 1 in 100 million superman hero (or traitorous villain) who cannot represent ordinary people that lack the ability or the opportunity for such an act.In \\"The First Circle\\" (already available in English), the same Innokenty also makes a covert call, but to a Russian scientist who as a medical doctor, had earlier treated Innokenty's mother, to warn him against sending some promised scientific samples to colleagues in France, because that act would be considered traitorous and get the scientist arrested.Even that simple warning call was enough to cause the hunting and arrest of Innokenty himself. With this simple opening story, Solzhenitsyn shows how an ordinary man who acts out of basic humanity gets entrapped by the vicious Soviet political environment. This gets us, readers, deeply engaged because we can easily identify with Innokenty's feelings and his action. And because we sympathize with an ordinary person who becomes entangled through such a normal act, it's deeply credible and far more powerful than the extreme scenario of \\"In the First Circle\\".Therefore, \\"The First Circle\\" is the true masterpiece version of this novel.This is an unforgettable story about \\"conditions where only courage, strength of character, and loyalty to friends made a man and could decide the fate of a comrade.\\" (\\"The First Circle\\", Ch. 61.)Take a look at \\"The First Circle\\", the original, and decide for yourself. Regrettably, this masterpiece is out of print in English, but copies of the great translation by Michael Guybon are available inexpensively at used book websites such as Abebooks."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"The book's title refers to the first circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. This is the least oppressive level of Hell. The prison camp described in this book offers plenty of food to the prisoners, no backbreaking physical labor, and a warm bed. Most of Stalin's prison camps are located in Siberia where the prisoners freeze and starve. What accounts for Stalin's leniency? The prisoners are scientists working on top secret projects like a telephone for Stalin's use that can't be tapped, and a system of identifying anonymous voices on public telephones by the voice prints, similar to finger prints. In Stalin's evil country, you are not innocent until proven guilty. You are guilty as soon as you are arrested. One prisoner was put in jail because his neighbors wanted his family's apartment and made up an unsupported lie about him. They got the apartment and destroyed his life and family. Most of the prisoners were WW2 vets, POWs returning from Germany. They weren't welcomed home with appreciation and honor. They were lured home by lies, and immediately imprisoned.There are many great characters. You'll remember Nerzhin and his wife, and wonder how things will work out for them. You'll remember Rubin, the sincere communist caught in the web of the system he believes in. You'll remember Innokenty Volodin, in trouble for doing a good deed, as innocent as his first name. When you read a mediocre book there are no characters to remember, just a predictable formulaic storyline and a group of people and events you find hard to believe. This is a rare opportunity for you to be a fly on the wall, halfway around the world, observing life in a Russian prison camp. The reason I give it only 4 stars is because I like happy endings and resolved problems. This book would make a good movie. There's plenty of room for a sequel (which hasn't been written) where we can find a satisfactory ending for some of the characters. Stalin the insane sewer rat died eventually and was denounced by Khrushchev, so maybe in time these people were allowed to live out the rest of their lives in freedom."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"I've loved this novel for years, but was extremely disappointed with the translation compared to the Thomas Whitney version. The introduction states, \\"The English translation of the canonical text is Harry T.Willetts...the only person Solzhenitsyn fully trusted to render his fiction in English.\\" but then adds, \\"The editing of the English text entailed...replacing Briticisms with American diction and idiom.\\" The result detracts greatly from the impression. An example: Chapter 2, greeting the newly arrived zeks. The Whitney version:\\"And how is the food in the transit camps these days?\\"\\"At the Chelyabinsk camp--\\"\\"Chelyabinsk new or Chelyabinsk old?\\"\\"Your question indicates a connoisseur.

Quick!\\"Granted, Solzhenitsyn **may** have made this specific change, but why would the author of The Gulag Archipelago bother to twitch up a minor love scene in this novel? There are other, similar minor changes that we know Solzhenitsyn made, but the biggest is the motivation of the diplomat Volodin for contacting the American embassy. THAT changes the tone of the entire novel, making it less sinister and more cliched. I don't understand, but I'll just say I really prefer the \\"original\\", inspite of the added length of this rewrite."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"Solzhenitsyn's character development is always amazing but, this book went beyond anything I have ever experienced before. The story of Nerzhin and Nadya was especially moving and captivating. Volodin's story of the Lubyanka made me feel as though I was actually there within the cold, towering walls. It is incredible how Solzhenitsyn can bring his characters down to the deepest levels of dispair and yet provide a glimmer of hope and humanity. I have read a few of Solzhenitsyn's novels before, and this, my latest, was exceptional."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"There are some authors that seem unapproachable. We have their books on our book shelves, but we are afraid to crack the binding. Solzhenitsyn has that reputation. This book should dispel it.It is hard to imagine today an author who would write a book which he knew most likely would never be published. In the First Circle must have been such a work, written between 1955 and 1958, still during the time of the Gulag.But, this book should not only be read because of Solzhenitsyn's courage. Solzhenitsyn has written a great novel that holds the interest of the reader as he retells the history of the Soviet Union and the Gulag though his plot: A Soviet diplomat calls the American Embassy that the Soviet Union plans to steal atomic secrets. A part of Scientific Work Prison is enlisted to identify through a voice print him so that he may be arrested as a traitor.Around this plot, Solzhenitsyn dedicates himself to write a novel where the characters ring true. Rarely is there a false note. His characters, both inside and outside the camp, are not cardboard spouting ideology. We feel how they feel caught in the system as they seek answers, both great and small, on how to respond to Stalin's regime.Last but not least, this novel has all the seeds of Solzhenitsyn's great work on the Gulag.Great read."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"After \\"The First Circle\\" being incomplete yet still one of my favorite books I am completely statisfied to now get the whole uncut \\"In The First Circle\\". Solzhenitsyn has informed my political views & values of freedom for the past 20 years, but his humanity far exceeds that, he was truly a great writer who should be read by every man & woman 18 years or older. We could avoid repeating the tragedies of the past by reading and learning from both his fiction and nonfiction. Alexsander's voice resounds for freedom, dignity, compassion, and endurance of the human soul which does not have to give in to tyrrany if one sees the eternal that exists past the here & now."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"In this incredible book, Solzhenitsyn displays his artistry as a wordsmith, a story teller, a philosopher, a psychologist and so on. This is certainly one of the most profound books I've ever read. The story mostly takes place in a \\"special prison\\" where the inmates, because of their technologic skills, are put to work on weighty state problems, such as developing a \\"voice print\\" machine to catch alleged plotters against the state. The prisoners in this special unit seem to have special privileges over denizens of Soviet Russia's prison \\"archipelago.\\" But as the book proceeds, you find out that life for these men is just as cruel as in the other prisons, only here, the deprivations are more mental than physical. The book is loaded with amazing insights into and accounts of the bottomless and pitiless obscenity that was Communist Russia. There are many stunning vignettes here, but one I'll always remember was the excruciating description of a person being processed into the fabled Lubyanka prison, with all of its terror and bureaucratic tedium. You can read this book as a fascinating story, or as an indictment of the Communist system, or as a philosophical treatise. But the important thing is that you read this book, if you read no other."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"This is the last of the Solzhenitsyn tomes I am reading (read all the rest), and like all the other ones, he had the knack of infusing soul, pathos and some lightheartedness in his work. He had that rare ability to educate, inspire, and keep you wanting to read and know more. He was never the stylish master of some of the other Russian greats, but his assessment of human nature is as solid as Dostoyevski or any other icon of literature."},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"I am an avid reader of Dostoyevsky; I have read Dostoyevsky's novels more than twice each. Literature in modern culture is almost non-existent. Solzhenitsyn has brought it back through the power of character development, scene description, and an effective way of describing life in a way most people can connect with in a deeply personal way. This novel puts philosophy at the deepest level with skin and experience. The espionage plot is a minor factor. The novel describes the intensity, humor, and horror of life under oppression, and then redemption. I'm grateful I live in a world were creativity is not drown out by political oppression, and art is destroyed by laziness, or is it?"},{"Title":"The First Circle","review":"I'm a fan of long Russian novels. Whenever I peruse the literature section of a bookstore, I cannot resist the urge to dive into big books by Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, or Solzhenitsyn.Over the Christmas holidays, I spent some time with Solzhenitsyn's book In the First Circle, now available uncensored in English for the first time. Many times, when you think of a book or movie being \\"uncensored,\\" you worry about sexually explicit content. But that is not the first reaction you have if you are intimately familiar with the ways of the former Soviet Union. Those who grow up in oppressive societies immediately think of censorship in terms of free speech that criticizes the government.Solzhenitsyn's novel is a fascinating look at the people caught in the crosshairs of Soviet imperialism in the 1940's and 50's. He takes the reader into Stalin's prison camps and introduces us to a memorable cast of characters. There are scoundrels and heroes; poets and mechanics; philosophers and inventors.Solzhenitsyn has an uncanny ability to \\"get into the head\\" of the people he is describing. Drawing from his own experience in Stalin's camps, he describes the mental thought processes of the prisoners and the people in charge.Two scenes from this book stand out to me. (Spoilers to follow...) The first is Solzhenitsyn's portrayal of Joseph Stalin. Solzhenitsyn's Stalin comes across as the brilliant, yet paranoid man that he was. As you read the Stalin chapters, you cannot help but be drawn to the dictator's magnetic power, even as you recoil from his warped personality and distorted view of the world.Another scene features Eleanor Roosevelt visiting the Soviet Union in order to inspect the prisons. (Since this is a work of fiction, one hardly expects Roosevelt to show up!) Solzhenitsyn's account of her visit is filled with humor and pathos. The prisoners receive special treatment for one day. But everything is a facade. Though she walks away impressed by the level of dignity given to those behind the barbed wire, everything goes back to normal immediately after her departure. Solzhenitsyn's portrayal of American naivete is humorous, yet tinged with sadness.The book contains moments that spotlight the best and worst of humanity:The philosophical and political discussions of the prisoners.The tender scenes between husbands and wives, separated for years.The struggles and temptations of compromising your convictions or standing your ground.The dehumanizing treatment of the prisoners.In the First Circle is an in-depth look at life in Stalin's prison camps. Through the window of Solzhenitsyn's suffering, we catch a glimpse of the inner workings of the human mind and heart. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Rabin and Israel's National Security (Woodrow Wilson Center Press)","review":"This is an outstanding study of the work and world-view of former Israeli Prime- Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It centers on Rabin's lifelong dedication to the Security of Israel. It explores his development and understanding of the security doctrine of Israel. Inbar says that Rabin was not a systematic thinker but rather a pragmatic and capable leader. He is considered one of the founding fathers of the Israeli military force. He is considered also one of the great teachers of military doctrine in the Israeli Army . This study examines his view of strategic doctrine, his attitude toward US part in the Security of Israel, his relation to non- conventional threats.It also tells the story of Rabin's great contributions to Israel in its wars. Most notable in this regard is the part he played as Chief- of- Staff in the Six Day war. It notes the turnabout in Rabin's policies which came with his making of the Oslo agreement. Inbar makes it clear that Rabin had considerable doubts about this policy, and wished to pursue it cautiously.Anyone interested in the military history of Israel, or in a deeper understanding of how a major Israeli leader thought on questions of security would do well to read this work."},{"Title":"Rabin and Israel's National Security (Woodrow Wilson Center Press)","review":"A clear and unemotional examination of Rabin's impact on Israeli government, security and military affairs, including his influence through his personnel appointments, arms acquisitions and policies.

So it's an assorted bunch of funny, clever and often deep pages. Even so, you might miss one of the charms of \\"Alice's adventures in Wonderland\\": the spontaneity, the straightforwardness. This is very much the opposite situation: a book that was written slowly, painstakingly constructing the main body of the story.So you can find here almost all dimensions of Carroll's thoughts: humorous nonsense and innumerable puns (including a word as original as \\"Jabberwocky\\" or \\"Boojum\\": \\"Phlizz\\"); logical and mathematical puzzles, including a simple and clever description of a M&ouml;bius strip; tender and lovely stories for children; lots of poetry... And three elements I haven't found neither in the Alice books nor in \\"The Hunting of the Snark\\": solemn religious meditations; the only real presence of death in a Carroll text (as far as I know, not being a Carroll scholar myself) when Sylvie watches a dead hare; and an adult romance.All these aspects are intertwined in a precarious narrative line-- there are almost as many disgressions as there are chapters; but what might seem a flaw in the book can be its main charm. All in all, Carroll found here A METHOD FOR NONSENSE or, as he says, \\"a far clearer idea (...) of the meaning of the word 'chaos'\\".This is certainly not the best book to begin to read Carroll, but it's a pity it's not even half as popular as the Alice books. It's really worth reading it: it's like delving deep into the goldmine of the brain and the heart of a genius."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"At first this seems disappointing after Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. But after a while it grows on you. I don't bother to try and follow the story. I just open it at random and read bits of it. There's always an unusual and interesting idea, or some funny dialogue or else a totally off the wall dreamlike image. Also there are some great poems in it. It is admittedly a patchy book. I like Bruno- he's quite like Alice but that baby talk was popular in Victorian times and grates on you now. Lewis Carroll didn't succeed in blending these great elements into a book that's easy to read, and this is why it is less popular. But it is definitely worth getting if you want another glimpse into the mind that wrote Alice. You will find plenty of the same kind of stuff. Also I think Lewis Carroll was a really nice person as this book often cheers me up when I feel low. It is happy and positive."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"This is a book I return to now and then, just to recapture that childlike wonder that Carroll masters so well. The contrast of the adorable fairy children and their beautiful little absudities, against the strangeness of the real world of Carroll's time and culture which seems alien to a modern reader, make for a surreal story that still manages to hit its simple theme on the head: love conquers all."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"There is *nothing* disappointing about Sylvie and Bruno. It is not anything like Alice.. it surpasses Alice in every way.This book is filled with a goodness that just can't help itself... and while it can be silly at times, and crazy at others, in the end it brings me to tears, every time. It is noble and honest and the characters steal your heart...Not all of life is suffering... and this book is about that. I would really encourage you to pick it up. The first few chapters are a little crazy as you get used to this half-reality half-fantasy style... but it pulls you in so quickly, and will really blow you away.An absolutely wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"After reading the Alice books, I never imagined Carroll could write a literary failure. Unfortunately, as the introduction of this book so clearly states, Sylvie and Bruno is a literary failure. Why? Perhaps it's too much of an adult book. Perhaps the confusion of the first few chapters throws off too many impatient readers. These possibilites are certainly plausible. But what a shame! The work itself contains so many instances of wonderment that I can't name them all. Like a true craftsman of storytelling, Carroll masterfully walks the line between dream-like fantasy and all-too-familiar reality, swiveling between these two opposing states of being whenever the urge strikes.One would venture to guess that the narrator is afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. That is, until he actually brings back a tangible souvenir from the dreamworld in the form of a rare Indian flower bouquet, incapable of surviving a lengthy transport to merry old England. Upon participation in this scenario, the open-minded reader begins to question the composition of reality. Are dream worlds filled with magic out there eluding us? Can it be that our steps in the real world are never terribly far from landing on a little fairy? The ponderment of such superstition is indeed rare today, but perhaps it shouldn't be.Yes, extraordinarily deep questions are raised in this strange book where \\"actors\\" do somersaults during dramatizations of Shakespeare and gardeners run around \\"watering\\" plants with watering-cans as barren as the Sahara Desert. As anyone can see, Carroll didn't seem to have any problems coming up with wild stuff to write. I particularly enjoyed the rumor of the crocodile walking on its forehead.I think the one thing Carroll never gets enough credit for is his use of humor. Sylvie and Bruno is quite funny. I couldn't help laughing at Bruno's story of, \\"a Mouse and a Crocodile and a Man and a Goat and a Lion.\\" And the Baron's Embassy chapter is comedy gold. Carroll was truly an enlightened individual. I wish we had more like him today.Carroll was also quite Biblical, and that's evident in this book. While strongly promoting faith in the Bible, he heavily criticizes the practically (I think) defunct method of filling up every Sunday with forced, nonstop preaching, and the far from defunct method of promising financial wealth to people who give. He notes that England's ability to endure such tactics for a whole century while still believing in God is a credit to the goodness of the people there. Unfortunately, a century after the printing of this book, the belief isn't quite as strong as it used to be. Perhaps Carroll's criticisms had some validity.Carroll had the gift of innovation that is so terribly difficult for most people, including myself, to grasp. What extraordinary value his works have! It's a shame Sylvie and Bruno has so much value and yet so little popular appeal. I just wish Carroll could have shortened the story and wrapped it up in one volume.I give it four stars objectively, but I like it much, much better than many books I've given five stars too. Definitely one of my all-time favorites.Oh, and I am pleased to note the following: Carroll writes in the book's introduction that he's very against a technique he calls \\"padding\\" - which was later perfected by producer Robert Lippert in the horribly long film Lost Continent."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"The book IS inconsistent. Unlike the brilliant Alice books, there are places where what Carroll is trying to do just doesn't work. But this book is written on a GIGANTIC scale. Carroll tries to take the basis of Alice, and expand it into something of real profundity - something that covers an entire moral and ethical universe. And much of the time, he actually *succeeds* at such an impossible task. There are scenes that are hysterically funny, and scenes that will make you weep. The book is VERY touching, and gives a strong and unforgettable message on the totality, wonder and all-conquering nature of all-conquering love. Sylvie, the fairy-child, is Love Itself, embodied. Despite its spottiness, this book is very, very impressive, and you will want to read it more than once, just to re-experience the good stuff, which is very, very good.&quot;For I think it is Love. For I feel it is Love. For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!&quot;Indeed. And Amen."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"This book is terrific. The moves between Outland, Fairyland, and England are VERY confusing at first, but once you get the gist of the work it is a very enjoyable! The way Bruno talks is theonly very annoying part. His oos and other such shortenings (y'reince comes to mind) are very odd, but he is always followed by a correction by his sister Sylvie. All in all, this is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"I deleted this selection after reading the first chapter. It was not interesting enough for me to continue reading it."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","review":"Lewis Carroll I think revealed quite a bit about his preoccupations in Sylvie and Bruno but only managed a very intermittently interesting narrative. It is puzzling why Carroll felt it necessary to have three parallel worlds, England in the 1880s, Outland and Fairyland when there is hardly anything magical described in any of these three places (leaving aside the issue of tiny fairy children). It probably would have been better to drop the England sections and have put everything into Outland and Fairyland. Carroll was obviously having anxiety in reconciling his relatively orthodox Anglican beliefs with the growing emphasis on scientific thinking. Large sections of the \\"real world England\\" passages are spent in parlor room discussions of free will and the analysis of morality. The sections in Outland and Fairyland are a bit more real in some ways, ironically enough, since they deal with political corruption and oddball but scientifically grounded thoughts. However the Machiavellian characters are disposed of in the end by the most flippant methods as a sudden \\"dust storm\\" suddenly changes their personalities right as they are about to succeed to the rulership of Outland.Also Carroll's well known attitudes toward young girls, however benign in real life, provide a poor narrative grounding for a character such as Sylvie whom the narrator erratically presents as a small fairy child, a 10 year old human child and \\"hidden\\" within the 20 year old Lady Orme of the \\"contemporary\\" English narrative. Unsurprisingly the fairy child version of Sylvie is presented in a totally positive redemptive way to which standard the other two fall short even if to a slight extent.My sense is that Carroll was unsettled by the existential issues raised in his long poem The Hunting of the Snark and was trying to soften and contain them in a more realistic narrative. Sylvie and Bruno is what happens when a brilliant writer tries to pull his punches."},{"Title":"Jabberwocky","review":"I LOVE this poem by Lewis Carroll.

Unfortunately, I got the last copy, but I recommend hunting this volume down if you're interested in Shaw. Highly underrated for most of his life, his work was truly art and his quirky personality makes for good storytelling, at which French more often than not succeeds. Fans of his acting will be surprised to find out some of the well-researched factoids about this jack-of-all-trades. The reader will be surprised at how well French demonstrates that Shaw's short life was exciting, yet nearly wasted. (There is another bio of Shaw, &quot;Robert Shaw: More Than a Life&quot; by Georg Gaston.)"},{"Title":"Robert Shaw: THE PRICE OF SUCC","review":"the two bios on Robert Shaw, there is a real person. Both books should be read, but unfortunately \\"More Than A Life\\" is very hard to find and quite dear when you do. I was lucky enough to get both books.French present Shaw warts and all, so to speak. The family disapproves of this book possibly because Shaw is presented as only an Agent can do. Actors often hide things from their families that they dump all over an agent. A trusted agent often becomes a kind of sounding board and the more wretched parts of an actor's personality is shown to him but not the family.The other book is also a good read, possibly \\"cleaned up\\" a bit as the author never met Shaw that I know of.French writes first hand, but puts himself in the third person so that the book isn't a litany of \\"I\\".A fascinating actor and a fascinating life, sadly often unfulfilled. He wanted the stars, reached for the galaxy and got merely part of the earth. He was determined to be A Star, a leading man, but he was not leading man material at that time. He simply wasn't \\"pretty\\" enough for the 60's and 70's male lead type. Today, however, he'd fit right in.What is not often known, is that Shaw was a very good writer. Possibly could have been Pulizer winning but he tended to sloth off on his writing.Like many good actors, he needed a strong \\"Director\\" to keep him on track.His life stopped at age 51 leaving one to wonder at what he could have accomplished if he had lived into older years and drawn on the wisdom that comes with mellowing.But between Spielberg and Shaw we have the one of the more fascinating characters on film - Quint."},{"Title":"Plough, Sword and Book: The Structure of Human History","review":"Ernest Gellner's philosophy of human history as discussed in Plough, Sword, and Book offers readers a view of human history that is unique and comprehensive. The author aims to outline human history with theories and models that employ a method of deductive reasoning. Specifically, Gellner wishes to offer his readers a \\"clear and forceful\\" view of his philosophy so that it may be examined critically (page 13).Gellner's model of human history entails a society passing through three principal stages: hunting and gathering, agrarian society, and industrial society (pages 16-17). The author enlists a number of sources from which he derives his philosophic analysis of humanity's development and evolution. Gellner's discussion of Platonism with respect to cultural intuition and adoption of an explicit theory stating what had previously been a mere practice (pages 76-77) mingles with Hegel and Marxist theories on thought and politics (pages 142-143). His variety of sources allow for a wide range of both philosophic input and debate.Essentially, the author pushes for a philosophic historical outline that depicts hunting and gathering groups of humans who eventually initiate an agricultural community stemming from a sense of long-term obligation to their individual group (page 33). Agrarian societies-Gellner's plough-then pass into an industrial or urban society which allows for the entry of a class system in which social order must be maintained through defensive groups or order-enforcers (page 145)-Gellner's sword. The transitions between stages could not be possible without the cognitive development of mankind through the introduction of literacy (page 71) through religious scriptures-Gellner's book. In Gellner's model of human history, religion also provides legitimization of the social system (page 99) leading to modern society.As the author discusses the shift between the three principle stages of human history, he outlines the major activities that pushed society through the industrial and agricultural revolutions, or \\"great leaps\\" of human history. These activities fall into three main groups identified by Gellner as production, coercion, and cognition (page 20-23). Agrarian societies focused mainly on the production and storage of food (page 16) while Industrial societies focused on the production of wealth and weapons, or means of coercion, and the production of food becomes a lesser focus (page 17). One of the most important elements in the evolution of human history, cognition, occurred at the point when \\"the genetic equipment of man became so permissive as to allow the wide range of social comportment\\" that we can observe in the modern society (page 67).For the average reader, Gellner's \\"clear and forceful\\" statement (page 13) within the pages of Plough, Sword, and Book can be a bit overwhelming in that it provides a great deal of philosophic idea applied to history between the Neolithic age and the present. At times, Gellner's text may also seem overwritten which could muddle his \\"clear\\" statement to scholarly readers. Perhaps Gellner's most successful element within his text was his execution and compilation of so many philosophic thinkers' ideas into a single outline. Gellner includes ideas from Aristotle to Weber and from Kant to Kuhn making his philosophic vision of human history a scholarly work indeed. Although the future of human history cannot, according to Gellner (page 15), be predicted, Plough, Sword, and Book can help scholars understand the evolution of our past so that we may better understand the future though the greater possibility of comprehension provided by Gellner's scholarly efforts."},{"Title":"Plough, Sword and Book: The Structure of Human History","review":"Plough, sword and book - sounds like the title of another easily digested history of humanity, but don't be mistaken. Ernest Gellner never wrote a book just to restate the familiar and obvious. His style is intellectually challenging and not intended for leisurely reading.This book presents a theory of history utilizing mostly sociological tools, but also with many elements from the history of philosophy. Gellner finds unique perspectives by combining material from different fields in his analysis, but quite a bit of background knowledge is assumed. It seems to me that the reader should have some familiarity at least with the classic works of sociology (Durkheim, Weber) and/or the history of philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Kant). This book is of course not a detailed study of any of those classics, but much of the text proceeds by discussing platonic, cartesian and weberian ways of thought on an abstract level, so you do need to have some understanding of the associated terminology before you start reading this book.However, while abstractions can be useful for seeing the big picture, in this book they are sometimes simply confusing. Some historical exemplification in between the theorizing would have been very helpful. Too many times Gellner flies so high in his abstractions that the reader has no chance of connecting his ideas to any real event or movement in world history. This is the case especially for his analysis of Cognition, where the argument is framed with strange phrases like \\"Platonism is the supreme expression of agro-literate man\\" (p.118). It is actually difficult to understand what Gellner means by \\"Platonism\\" in this context since his usage is unconventional and historical examples are not offered.In my opinion, the analysis of the other main topics of the book (Coercion and Production) stands on a firmer basis than the theory about Cognition. Towards the end of the book some of the material is actually a bit outdated since Gellner discusses the contemporary \\"marxist state\\" and the like (the book was written in 1988).So this book has some minor flaws, but the great majority of it is still very interesting and useful for people who want to study our contemporary world from a critical and historical perspective. The breadth of material is very impressive, ranging from the dynamics of agrarian societies to problems of modern democracy and colonial legacies. And for such a short book, it's important that Gellner manages (most of the time) to produce well-structured accounts of the human past while also recognizing its diversity.For people with the some background in these topics, this is a book which can be read several times, providing new questions with each reading."},{"Title":"Plough, Sword and Book: The Structure of Human History","review":"E. Gellner analyzes the \`Structure of Human History' alongside three axes: the division of labor (fighters, priests, workers), the economic evolution (hunting/gathering, agrarian and industrial society) and the concepts of coercion (power), cognition (knowledge) and production (manufacturing).While in hunting/gathering clans everything is intermingled, a division of labor becomes necessary in an agrarian society. The produced surplus must be stored and protected: \`You own what you can defend' and \`Property is Power'. Those who could defend (the rulers) used the prestige of religion for the legitimation and the cohesion of their power base.An agrarian society is authoritarian (wealth for the rulers, poverty of the ruled) and characterized by oppression, superstition and economic stagnation. Its philosophical proponent is Plato.Within one of the agrarian societies (Western Europe) a unique industrial and scientific revolution took place. E. Gellner cannot explain the cause(s) of this revolution. (For MHO, see the end of this review).The upheaval is characterized by the separation of cognition from authority and religion (Descartes). Authority is replaced by liberalism; religion by empiricism and rationalism (D. Hume: \`superstition is the enemy of civil liberties'). Knowledge (innovation) is Power. The proponents of this revolution are the Enlightenment (Les Encyclop&eacute;distes) and the Progress (Darwin, Marx) philosophers.E. Gellner's vision on complex modern societies is far too optimistic: the maintenance of public order is not relatively easy. There is no push towards a more homogeneous humanity. He hoped that \`a certain moral climate would prevail which would feel repugnant that anyone should be deprived of nourishment, medical attention, shelter and education.'This book is a little bit too abstract, but it remains still a very worth-while read. I prefer, however, Jared Diamond's \`Guns, Germs and Steel'.N.B. Max Weber's thesis about the eruption of the industrial revolution (the link between Protestantism and capitalism) is still widely accepted. However, this link seems to be more an affair of coincidence rather than consequence. The main reason of the forceful development of the merchant society could be the loss of the stranglehold on monetary matters by the Church. The Church controlled 75 % of all monetary means in the Middle Ages (W. Manchester: \`A World only lit by Fire') and drained them largely into unproductive investments. Once the stranglehold was broken (indeed, in protestant countries) the merchant class could freely build its commercial empire.One illustration: when Antwerp was attacked in the 17th century by the Catholic Spaniards, its merchant class fled to Amsterdam."},{"Title":"Decreation: Poetry, Essays, Opera","review":"Intelligence has no other name than Anne Carson. And \\"Decreation\\" proves that Ms. Carson has not lost the good of intellect as she pursues an incomphrehensible sublime through the intricate paths that connect the uber-sublime Simone Weil, Margerate Porete, Longinus, the negative theology of Samuel Beckett, and a thousand other things, themes, and people. Though not all of the pieces in this volume are verse all are pure poetry shifting through an intense tesseract where things that are most traditional are radically re-interpreted in direction that is surreal, avant-garde, and yet classical.This kind of work is an example of what strong poets should be attempting to do today and it is one reason why Ms. Carson is the brightest bard of our hour, worthy to stand on the heights with Emily Dickinson and Paul Celan.As I read these poems and essays I feel that my own imagination and intellect are struck by a light that is feminine and precise, strong, even rutheless, breath taking in its wilful ascents and descents, and firmly dedicated to its own unique spiritual quest.There are passages in the poems in which I encountered the truly indescribable. Few are the poets these days that will dare to take on such possiblities and labors. Most poets writing are grinding out stuff that sounds like the slightly piqued pseudo-spiritual musings of third-rate diarists. But not Ms. Carson.I must confess I can hardly wait for her next volume but for now I have too much to ponder as I watch my own mind quietly re-organized by Anne Carson's on-going aesthetic triumphs."},{"Title":"Decreation: Poetry, Essays, Opera","review":"Decreation is coy, playful, obscure, difficult & profound.

In the book are tableaus of different approaches to annihilation featuring Sam Beckett and God, Marguerite Porete and God, Simone Weil and God. In the interludes, witness Sokrates and Demosthenes the orator \\"who knows how to make his nouns rain like blows\\", Virginia Woolf and Elizabeth Bishop together in a sleep-assay that describes To the Lighthouse as a \\"novel that falls asleep in the middle\\". Decreation also contains an hommage to Antonioni, as strange and beautiful as Antonioni's films. Perhaps the \\"give\\" you're looking for is on page 46, where Carson recounts Antonioni directing Lucia Bose in Story of a Love Affair - \\"To obtain the results I wanted I had to use insults, abuse, hard slaps.\\" Then again maybe not.

After initial enthusiasm I increasingly felt oppressed by this claustrophobic book, which evokes an apophatic language of transcendence to articulate what I take to be Carson's difficulty in making contact with her own animal nature. The intellect is depicted as a point of departure, but it leads only to alienation. Humans pass through this book like the shades of the Odyssey who generate speech but not warmth. Sexuality estranges, never unites.It's a rather dismal view of life, and one that does not impress me. It strikes me as the work of a writer who would rather read of the rage of Achilles than stake her own heart in the bungled human comedy.Carson is the greatest translator of Sappho that one can imagine, and in matters of elegant expression she lacks nothing."},{"Title":"Acres and Heirlooms: The Survival of Britain's Historic Estates","review":"Little more than a century ago, Britain ruling class -- which is to say its landowning class -- were united by common life experiences: Early life in the same public schools under the same headmasters, followed by three years at Oxford or Cambridge, then a stint as an army officer in the appropriate regiment, all of it leavened by foxhunting and cricket (or pig-sticking and polo if you were in India). They shared a particular way of speaking, a certain set of political and religious views, and an entitlement to wealth, for compared to aristocracies on the Continent, \\"the English landed elite owned a very large part of its nation's territory.\\" Then, in April 1894, it all began to change, when the Liberal chancellor of the exchequer, Sir William Harcourt, introduced death duties -- the taxes levied on inherited estates. He was followed by another chancellor, David Lloyd George, whose impoverished childhood in rural Wales had led him to despise the landowning class. The rates were low and the level of exemption considerable, but some large landowners could see what was coming. Just before the Great War, the 9th duke of Bedford sold off most of his estates in East Anglia and Devonshire and invested the proceeds in stocks and bonds. But the necessity of a family divesting itself of land and stately homes was greatly enlarged by the high officer casualty rate between 1914 and 1918 -- one in five of the British and Irish peers who served were killed, a rate almost four times that of the rank-and-file. Even if the death duties could eventually be paid, the upkeep on large, antiquated country homes was enormous; more than seven hundred were pulled down by their owners in the 20th century. The author follows the progress of this divestment of the landed elite, including the effects of World War II, the inroads of the modern Labour Party, the coming of the National Trust in 1937, and the Disneyization of stately homes to make them pay for themselves in the tourist trade. More than two dozen black-and-white plates, all of them new to me, illustrate those changes very nicely."},{"Title":"Baby's First Words (Sign & Say Interactive Language Series)","review":"This basic intro to signing is wonderful!

Albion Hamlin is captivated by a portrait and the adventure is on.Roberts' formula, employed so strikingly in Arundel and its sequels, is evident here again: a young American man, a bit of an innocent despite his education, falls victim to an evil woman (Harriet Faulkner, the Mary Malinson/Marie de Sabrevois figure of this book), is thrown into a swirl of epically dramatic but mostly very accurate historical events, picks up a larger than life comic-relief sidekick (King Dick, the Cap Huff figure here), encounters many adventures and grave hardships, and wins his true love in the end (Lydia; a far more demure Phoebe; much more reminiscent Ellen the 'female lead' of his novel Rabble In Arms). [Note: also like Cap Huff, King Dick serves the role of sidekick more than once in Roberts' fiction. He makes a subsequent appearance in The Lively Lady, Roberts' novel of the War of 1812.]Almost all of Roberts' books are dramatic page-turners, and this one is too, in most places--especially in the upheavals of the Haitian Revolution. But later in the book, as Albion is the captive of Barbary Pirates, the story--to me--actually bogs a little; at least until his rescue and the ensuing adventures.Among the Roberts books, this is among my least favorites (I emphatically cannot sympathize with the Tory Oliver Wiswell, but I think that's just prejudice), but yet I like it very much. High praise for Roberts the story-teller.Some complain Roberts' wriring is overwrought and his histories nothing but hopeless romances. Be this as it may, he was a master of crafting extremely exciting fictional but historically quite accurate accounts of important historic events of early American history.If you only read one Roberts book, go read Arundel, his first and I believe best novel; or Northwest Passage, a true epic. But if you get hooked on either of those, please treat yourself to reading the rest of the Roberts oeuvre, Lydia Bailey emphatically included."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey, (Permabooks)","review":"It's been more than thirty years since I first read &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot; and I'm glad to see it available again after years out of print. Kenneth Roberts was a terrific writer and he has a terrific story to tell, with action ranging from New England in the early 1800's, to Haiti during Toussaint L'Ouverture's rebellion, to the Barbary Coast. This novel is a little bit detective story, a whole lot of rousing adventure and just the right amount of romance, mixed in with plenty of pointed observations along the way about political shenanigans and the highs and lows of human nature. They really don't write 'em this way any more--which is a shame. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey, (Permabooks)","review":"Wow! This book covers more ground in a mere 500 pages than I could ever have imagined before reading it. The adventures of Albion Hamlin are postively Odyssean. Our protagonist is at various times a farmer, a lawyer, a prisoner, a soldier, and a slave. And the action takes us from New England to Haiti, France, and North Africa. Somehow, in the end, it all makes complete sense. The successful integration of so many stories and characters is remarkable.Albion's companion, King Dick, is especially interesting, a more heroic though still light-hearted incarnation of the Cap Huff character from the Arundel series, always to the rescue. And the historical characters, dozens of them, are captivating (sometimes quite literally). Unlike the Odyssey, there are no fantastic multi-headed homicidal creatures to fend off, but some of the humans are reasonable substitutes.If I had to cite a shortcoming, it would be that here and there Roberts strains plausibility almost to the breaking point, most notably in the rapidity with which Lydia Bailey and Albion Hamlin fall in love. Ironically, it is the title character, Lydia, who is perhaps the most superficial of all the personalities who make appearances in this novel. But this is a minor flaw that is more than compensated for by extraordinary character development elsewhere.In the final analysis, this is a great, grand book that has a lot to say about human nature, about war, about politics, and about humanity. It gets better with every page and has the power to capture the reader and whisk him away, never to return.Lydia Bailey earns my highest recommendation for those lucky readers who can occasionally suspend disbelief. Others will find it enjoyable, too."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey, (Permabooks)","review":"I'm particularly fond of this novel as it was the cause of my being suspended from high school ca. 1960... (My history teacher declaimed that \\"the United States is the only country in the world that has never broken a treaty!\\" Having just finished this book, I asked, \\"What about the French Spoliation Claims?\\" and was promptly sent home.) The depiction of the Haitian revolution and its main characters -- Dessalines, Christophe, Toussaint -- is based on a thorough understanding of C.L.R. James' analysis, The Black Jacobins, i.e. it is a very progressive, somewhat left-wing view. I think that the even-handedness of Roberts' evaluation of the characters -- that \\"goodness\\" and \\"badness\\" are not confined to one \\"race\\" or another -- is admirable. Also, for people who want to understand some of the roots of Haiti's historical and current devastated conditions, this is an excellent way to connect."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey, (Permabooks)","review":"I never thought about the contrarian viewpoints of early American history, and how mainstream these ideas seemed back when the issues were still being thrashed out.

I'm going to get out my Kenneth Roberts collection and start over again through the best fiction out there on the Revolutionary War!!"},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey, (Permabooks)","review":"Lydia Bailey is another great historical novel by Kenneth Roberts. The story begins around 1800 in America. The first part of the book examines the attempt of the Federalists in power to stifle all opposition through passage of the Alien and Sedition Act. The Federalists under President John Adams were afraid of Thomas Jefferson's Republicans who they believed were overly sympathetic to the French Revolution and were plotting something similar in American.The action then moves to Haiti where the protagonist goes to search for a young lady, but is soon caught up in war. The Haitian black slaves have revolted against their French masters and driven them out. The Revolutionary government of France had freed the slaves, but Napoleon comes to power and sends a huge army to put them back into slavery. The nature of Haitian society, race relations, the war, and the relationship with France are all covered in depth.The story continues in the Mediterranean with the American war with the Barbary Pirates. The hero and the young lady he was searching for, now his wife, are captured by the pirates and held in Algiers. He escapes and joins the Arab expedition under the American General Eaton who raises an army to march from Egypt to Algiers to depose Joseph Karamanli, the tyrannical ruler there. However, they are betrayed by the American envoy Tobias Lear, who negotiates a separate peace when the Arab army is on the verge of winning, and allows thetyrant to remain in power.As usual with Kenneth Roberts, the events and historical characters are based on real happenings. This is true in Haiti, and also in the Mediterranean, where General Eaton, his campaign, Joseph Karamanli, and the devious American diplomat Tobias Lear who betrayed Eaton are all historical figures. I presume the part of the story about the Federalists and the Alien and Sedition Act is also true, but I have not studied that history."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey, (Permabooks)","review":"This novel was in excellent condition along with a dust cover also in excellent condition.

Author Kenneth Roberts."},{"Title":"Colonial Women: 23 Europeans Who Helped Build a Nation","review":"This is a very good book concerning 23 different women who lived during the 1600's and 1700's. Some of these most of us have heard of before (such as Anne Hutchinson or Margaret Winthrop), but some of them are more obscure. In any case, each woman is given a short biography of from 5 to 12 pages. While sometimes the writing is a little jumpy from one place in history to another, this would be difficult to be otherwise as the author is covering the entire life of each subject in several pages. However, the writing is well done and entertaining and generally flows along smoothly. The author not only covers the individual, but also relates what is going on at the time and the conditions under which the person lived.The author packs a lot of history into these short biographies. Not only that, one picks up interesting tid-bits such as why &quot;quarter-horses&quot; are called quarter-horses.Several of these women have entire books written about them, and the author gives a bibliography after each biography (don't get those two woods confused!), so those interested in further reading have a source of material.This book may be especially interesting to girls as most history tends to only enlighten us upon what the men were doing. Also, while this book is written in an easy-to-read manner that younger people would find readable, it is not written so that an adult would find it silly (I'm 42 and I think the author hit the hard-to-find target of making the book enjoyable for both children and adults--well done author).Well-written, informative and entertaining, and all the while it teaches us history besides. A winner."},{"Title":"Colonial Women: 23 Europeans Who Helped Build a Nation","review":"A great collection of strong women during dangerous times.

However, the novel did not sit well with me: it's really two books in one. The first part deals with Robert Rogers' St. Francis raid- our fictional protagonist joins Roger's Rangers on the eve of their raid on St. Francis. This tale is briskly told, conveying the dangers and hardships of the mission, weaving historical figures into the narrative and accurately (as far as I can tell) portraying the details of the mission. In this first half (350 pages) of the novel, author Roberts deftly explores tensions between the British regulars and their Provincial counterparts; as well as portraying the ambivalent attitudes of both toward Native Americans. All in all, the first half of the novel is a brisk, rousing historical adventure. The book started to lose me in the second half, however. The life of our fictional protagonist, Langdon Towne, continues to revolve around that of his former Captain, Robert Rogers, as Rogers' life descends into a Dickensian drama. Rogers attempts to parlay his military prowess into fame, fortune, and a personal empire in Britain's newly acquired Western territories. Rogers is no match, however, for the politics and skullduggery of imperial management, as he deals with- and runs afoul of- people like Charles Townshend, Edmund Burke, Sir William Johnson, and Jeffrey Amherst. Constantly scorning authority, the alcoholic, womanizing Rogers winds up in debtor's prison in London before returning to America to raise another Ranger contingent to fight the upstart American rebels. This second part of the tale could have been told much more efficiently; it was hampered by a contrived, melodramatic romance and repetitive ruminations on the relationships between Indians and whites in the Western territories. I almost gave up on the second half of the book. If readers find themselves losing interest after the first 350 pages, I'd advise letting it go- enjoy the tale of the St. Francis raid, but you won't miss much by dropping the book after that."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"True, the language is archaic (published 1937) and the vocabulary at times daunting (we've dumbed down quite a bit since 1937).

The book is clean, the cover is new, not a mark on the book. Great."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"This tale, cast as a memoir by a fictional acquaintance of the historical Robert Rogers who gained fame in colonial America for creating and leading \\"Rogers' Rangers,\\" is lengthy but compellingly told, especially in its first part. As others have noted, the first section, which recounts how young Langdon Towne, an aspiring artist from New England, finds himself on the run from local authorities and thrust into the arms of the Rangers is fast paced, vivid and exciting narration. Towne and a companion soon end up enlisted in the Rangers on the eve of their departure for the Indian town of St. Francis where French-supported Indians who have been terrorizing the New England colonists are based. Under the spying eyes of French and Indian scouts in the latter years of the French and Indian War, Rogers' Rangers depart the British stronghold of Crown Point and, led by the indomitable Rogers, succeed in making the lengthy and difficult passage in secret to St. Francis where, in a surprise attack, they slaughter the Indians dwelling there. The return home to safety turns out to be the real challenge though as Major Rogers must herd and cozzen his failing and soon starving troops back to New England via a different path in order to avoid retaliation by the French and Indians of Canada.The long trek back nearly kills them all though many finally get through thanks only to the unyielding will and capacity for outthinking his opponents that Major Rogers reveals, thus gaining the hero worship of young Langdon Towne and others in their company. Toward the end of the journey back, nearly starved and dead, it is Rogers who manages the final leg to bring back help for what remain of his men and, in so doing, he earns the undying gratitude of the colonials and the British Army itself. But Rogers is a man who needs action and who dreams big and he has begun to think of something that only the boldest have dreamt of, finding the Northwest Passage through North America to the shores of Japan and China. Young Langdon returns to his hometown of Kittery, a coastal settlement northeast of Massachussetts, to take up his old life which he finds no easy task, under the circumstances. Still, despite the respect he has now earned from his neighbors, he eventually decides to pursue his artistic inclinations and, disappointed in love, finally takes ship for England. The second part of the tale is rich in the London of the period as young Towne works to earn his living as a painter so that he can one day return to America to paint Indians. But Rogers shows up in London, too, and before long they have resumed their former close relationship with Towne hero worshipping the great man. Rogers is working to get support from the English aristocratic class and, especially, from the king himself, for the expedition to discover the Northwest Passage and promises to take Langdon Towne with him when he goes.Meanwhile, Towne is enlisted in a task laid on him by Rogers' personal secretary, one Natty Potter, to find the lost daughter of the secretary's disparate youth. In a complex series of events, Rogers seems to get what he is after, all the while drinking heavily and carousing with the London upper crust, while Langdon, through Rogers' good offices, achieves some respectability as an artist himself. Returning to the Americas, his relationship with Rogers restored, Langdon Towne affiliates himself with the larger than life adventurer once more and soon finds himself in Michilimakinac, at the juncture of the Great Lakes where Rogers means to establish himself and branch out from there to discover the elusive Northwest Passage. But things don't go as smoothly as the relatively simple operation that destroyed St. Francis had and Rogers soon finds himself embroiled in a political battle with the influential Sir William Johnson, His Majesty's Indian Agent (and friend of the Iroquois Confederation), who aims to retain a monopoly on the Indian trade at all costs. Rogers' plans get in the way of Johnson's objectives and the two are set on a collision course.There is as rich a detailing of wilderness life in this part of the book as in the first half though we never see the Indians themselves in any great depth. But the narrative threads are less taut as the tale shifts from one of adventure against deadly adversity to the complex interactions of numerous personalities against the backdrop of the Johnson-Rogers feud over Indian control. In the end the forceful and energetic Rogers is undone by the subtler and more cunning Johnson (aided and abetted by the shortsightedness of Rogers' own supporters in London who tie his hands rather than fund his plans, to which they have supposedly signed on) and all of the major's dreams come crashing down upon him. A lately discovered betrayal by the major of his young protege's personal interests turns Langdon Towne against Rogers too, as he soon sets out to rescue his damsel-in-distress, spirited away from him to Montreal.The rest of the novel brings Towne at last back to London and his lady love -- and, surprisingly, Rogers, too, though the latter is no longer in the condition or state in which he had once been wont to appear. Eliciting Towne's sympathetic assistance in a Debtor's Prison in London, Rogers wins back at least a modicum of his old friend's loyalty, albeit without the same level of respect, and the two part again, Towne to become the artist he had dreamed of being and Rogers to move onto other ventures and unachievable dreams. With the onset of the Revolutionary War, Rogers returns yet again, though now on the wrong side as far as the colonists are concerned for he is still serving the British. But the man, whatever his skills on the battlefield in guerrilla war has become but a shadow of his former self and so the story fades with the fading of Major Robert Rogers himself.Kenneth Roberts has penned a worthy novel which strikes true to the historical record and populates his pages with vividly drawn characters, not least of whom is the larger than life Robert Rogers. That the historical Rogers ended up on the wrong side in the Revolutionary War goes a long way toward explaining why his name and fame largely faded from America's historical record.Stuart W.

(I must admit that everytime I read Rogers' dialogue in \\"Northwest Passage\\" I hear the voice of Spencer Tracy.) Anyway \\"Northwest Passage,\\" the novel, is actually made up of two very different books.Book I is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read. It's the story of Rogers' Rangers attack on the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis during the French and Indian War. The story revolves around a fictional character, Langdon Towne, an upper middle class lad who wants to become a great artist by painting \\"true life\\" subjects such as Indians. Fleeing a dispute with local crooked politicians, Towne joins Major Rogers and his Rangers on the eve of their departure for St. Francis. What happens next is a thrilling story. Roberts' descriptions of the northern New England terrain, the agony of fatigue and starvation, and the gruesome depiction of the barbaric nature of war are stunning to read. Also amazing is the depiction of Major Rogers as seen through the worshipful eyes of Towne. The reader will finish Book I with a heroic image of Rogers as an indefatigable, courageous, clever tactician and born leader.Book II, though, is a disappointment. Of course, it is very understandable that Book II is a let down, since Book I can hardly be topped as a historical adventure. Roberts' spends most of Book II tearing down the heroic image of Rogers that he built-up in Book I. Alcohol, debt, political enemies, a bad marriage, and his own vices reduce Rogers to a rather pathetic character. Book II also suffers from a lack of focus- we follow Towne as he develops into a famous painter from New England, to England, to the Upper Great Lakes, to Canada, back to England, and then to New England. Unlike Book I, which dealt with just a few short months of time, Book II is all over the place. However, the biggest problem with Book II is that nothing really happens in it- just Rogers' long decline and Towne's search for fulfillment.Finally, Kenneth Roberts' books usually contain some extremely well developed and strong female characters, but \\"Northwest Passage\\" is lacking in this department. The interesting character of Jennie Coit disappears quickly. And Anne Potter, who had the possibility to be extremely interesting, is just too thinly drawn.\\"Northwest Passage's\\" Book I is a terrific piece of historical fiction. I cannot speak more highly of it. However, Book II drags, and is really only interesting in that illustrates what happens to the characters introduced in Book I. Book II is actually just a very long and detailed epilogue to Book I."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"Kenneth Roberts' &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; is one of the great novels of the 1930's. Little remembered now, it is the story of Major Robert Rogers and the early Rangers of the French and Indian War. Most of the book is an accurate description of what occured during that time period, and one gets an incredible feel for the hardships and calamities that befall these men. The book is written in the first person as the narrator is one of the Major's trusted associates; the story involves both men and their lives together in the wilderness and much later when their paths cross once again near the end of the 18th Century. Rogers himself commanded the first real &quot;commando&quot; unit and he is the father of all subsequent outfits like the Green Berets, the Navy Seals etc. Kenneth Roberts was one of the great historical fiction writers of his day and anyone who is interested in this time period would be wise to read this book. It is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"Kenneth Roberts was one of America's best-known nonfiction magazine writers back during the heyday of the Saturday Evening Post. One of his best-known articles was a profile of Hitler following the Beer Hall Putsch, which became a book in its own right at a time when no one in America knew who Hitler was.Beginning in the mid-1930s, Roberts wrote a series of brilliant but erratic historical novels about America in the late 1700s, set in his beloved Maine or in neighboring Boston and Portsmouth, NH. \\"Northwest Passage\\" (which was serialized by the Post) was his masterpiece and the most popular book in America for two years during the 1930s, although it's barely remembered today (or, if remembered, known only as the source for a mediocre Spencer Tracy movie of the same name).The book is the story of a real person, Major Robert Rogers, a miltary leader from pre-Revolutionary America whose unit, Rogers' Rangers, was America's first to fight \\"Indian-style\\" (in other words, to fight battles the way we fight them today). Rogers' great success in warfare led to him becoming one of the colonies' first published authors, a star in London, and later the royal governor of Michilimackinac (the fort at the tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan ... and the land westward), but his unwillingness to join with pluderers who wanted to loot the British and colonial treasuries in the name of the Crown led to his arrest and unwarranted disgrace ... and to his ultimate decision to side with the British during the American Revolution, like Roberts' other main hero, Benedict Arnold (\\"Arundel\\" and \\"Rabble in Arms\\").This novel is made up of two very different but intricately-plotted books. Book 1, which ranges in place from Harvard College to the British Army during the French and Indian Wars and the New England art world, tells the story of a young man, Langdon Towne, who becomes Rogers' personal secretary during Rogers' Rangers' expedition to destroy the town of St. Francis, home of the native group most hostile to the New England settlers. Book 2, which begins in London, crosses back to upstate Michigan and the Dakota lands, and then returns to London, tells the story of Towne's advancement as an artist and his involvement with Rogers' plan to discover the Northwest Passage.The reason that this book rates 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with a writing issue that must be mentioned. Roberts' friend Booth Tarkington served as \\"editor\\" of the first three-quarters of the book, and the Roberts-Tarkington prose is stellar. However, under severe time pressure to finish the second half of the book (due to its smash-hit status), Roberts wrote the last quarter without Tarkington's help, and the change in writing quality is jarring -- especially as it comes right during the most historically-important and dramatically-important section of the book, Rogers' betrayal by his Northwest Passage expedition commanders and by his British and American enemies. Roberts had offered Tarkington co-writing credit, which Tarkington refused, but this justaposition of styles shows just how critical Tarkington's help was. The plot continues smoothly, though, even if the writing doesn't.One more point: in researching and writing this book, Roberts uncovered (after two years of searching, and just before publication of Book 2) the actual court-marshal transcripts of the two court-marshals with which Rogers was involved, which were believed to have been destroyed by Rogers' enemies -- and both supported Roberts' sympathetic treatment of Rogers. Thus, not only was this book incredibly popular, but it was significant for historical research as well. What more can you ask from one book?"},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"I first discovered Northwest Passage at a library while I was still in high school, and ever since then I have been a confirmed Kenneth Roberts fan. His ability to bring the frontier and its characters alive is uncanny and unmatched by any other author I've ever read. His research into the foods, weapons, country and historical events he writes about is unparalleled, and each character in all of of his novels seems so real it sometimes becomes diffcult to determine if they were real or not. Mingling real-life historical figures such as George Washington, Benedict Arnold and others, with fictional characters such as Steven Nason, Cap Huff, and other truly unforgettable creations, lends them a credibility that results in history coming alive. One's understanding of historical events and people that have become blase' over the years is competely turned upside down and inside out as you gain new insight and understanding of what happened, why it happened and what it meant through Roberts' masterful writing backed up by exhaustive research into his subjects and events. The characters not only are drawn larger than life in all their strengths and weaknesses, but as they move through several of Roberts' novels and are observed and encountered differently when viewed from different perspectives, we begin to realize that history is not static but is dynamic and alive. Example: RABBLE IN ARMS and OLIVER WISWELL are both books about the American Revolution, but written from diametrically opposite viewpoints ! RABBLE IN ARMS follows the struggle of the colonists to free themselves from England's grip as envisioned from the rebellious colonists' perspective, while OLIVER WISWELL is about the very same events written from the perspective of a Loyalist; many of the very same characters populate both novels, but the view one gets of them is so different from one to the other of the books that it hardly seems as if at first they are about the same thing. Additionally, OLIVER WISWELL is an outstanding exploration of the Loyalist cause and why they believed we would all be better off to remain loyal subjects of England.I've read all of Roberts' books, and have a first edition of OLIVER WISWELL purchased for $3.00 from a used bookstore with an original newspaper review that had been tucked inside the book by the original purchaser. The review is of the novel itself, and after reading that review from more than 60 years ago, it is very apparent over the years the very high and well-deserved reputation of Roberts has not diminished.My recommendation is: read them. Read them all !! You will never find finer writing or an author with a keener appreciation of his subject matter and the period about which he writes than Kenneth Roberts. All of Roberts' books should be reprinted, again and again, as they were when they were first published (check the frontispieces to see how many times his novels have been re-printed over the years --- it's astounding!). Every person who reads Roberts becomes a devotee and a reader for life, and every one to whom you loan a copy of any of his novels will then be someone with whom you can share the pure pleasure of having read a Kenneth Roberts novel, and there are many of us out there. Welcome to the astounding, incredible world that will soon be at your fingertips!"},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"Northwest Passage:Kenneth Roberts was the premier historical fiction author of his day. What starts out as a simple French and Indian War tale of a daring raid on the St. Francis Indian village by Major Robert Rogers, eventually spans North America, Europe and the Mediterranean. Roberts' descriptions of wilderness warfare and survival bespeak his excruciatingly thorough research and knowledge of eighteenth century America, to the point where you might wonder if he was actually there. His battle scenes are unsparingly violent and brutal, even by today's standards, but the whole novel is infused with a quaint romanticism, that is usually avoided in modern literature. In Robert's works, warfare is bloody, and politics unsavory, but noble spirits and strong hearts prevail. Anyone who likes historical fiction, art history, or adventure travel, would do well to start with Northwest Passage."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"Kenneth Roberts is my favorite novelist so this review may be somewhat biased, but Northwest Passage truly is a book people should read. It is gripping, a book I had a difficult time setting down. Roberts had a style that was unique in that the reader can many times feel the sensations he is describing. When the soldiers were hungy and were failing at hunting, Roberts could create a sensation of hunger and frustration. When he described the streets of London, the reader feels like he/she is actually there.This book is wonderful. It's full of lively, intelligent characters and solid story plots. It is as good a represtation of colonial America as was ever done in the form of a novel. Hopefully it will remain a timeless classic forever."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"As a history buff, Revolutionary War reenactor and New Englander, I was interested in reading about this author who I'd never heard of from my area. Although this story is historical fiction, the events mentioned (and many of the characters) are real. The amount of detail the author was able to put in this book is staggering. Once you start reading this story you will be dragged into the daily struggles of the many characters. In addition, you'll better understand the trials of the native Americans and how they suffered and were taken advantage of. There was a 1940 movie by the same name starring Spencer Tracy which follows the book pretty closely. Unfortunately the movie only takes in the first half of the book. Since reading this book, I have read 4 other historical novels by Kenneth Roberts and enjoyed each one. He is a prolific writer and has taken great pains to portray the events and their details in an easy reading style. Sit down with this book on a snowy evening in front of your fire and be transported back to the 18th century. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"I was fourteen years old when a family friend gifted me on my birthday with Rabble in Arms in Hungarian translation. It took no little trouble and risk to locate other works by Roberts in Communist controlled Hungary. Northwest Passage was the second book by Roberts I read and this as well as all other works in Roberts 'Chronicles of Arundel' series sold me on the US. Northwest Passage is the story of revenge within the framework of the French and Indian War, a fantastic account of courage, endurance and heroism. It is also the story of one man, Major Robert Rogers; one man's life at its zenith, as he relentlessly inspires his men to superhuman performance; also at its nadir, as he descendes into debauchery, debt, and succumbs to disease. The narrator, Langdon Towne, aspiring artist, only matters insofar as he is the one,(in first person, as many of Roberts' protagonists do,) who tells the story. His viewpoint is that of a participant, not an outside observer, and this makes the story come alive even more than it otherwise would have.It is one of Roberts' masterful works. It lost nothing in translation although I consider myself fortunate to have many of Roberts' works in their first editions.It is my uderstanding that Roberts' works had been translated into over 52 languages. If any of those translation are as well done as the Hungarian version Roberts should be a universally celebrated and rewarded author.Northwest Passage is true classic. Even though the movie with Spencer Tracy now seems obsolete this deserves a remake that should closely follow the book. I wouldn't recommend changing anything just go by the book. I sure would go and see it. As it is I have the book and have enjoyed reading and rereading it over the many years."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"I've spent a lot of time on the history surrounding the actual events of Rogers Rangers raid on the Abenaki village of Odanak in 1758. But here is a book that throws back the curtain and hurls us out the window into the midst of 18th Century America and Britain.This is simply one of the finest historical novels out there; closely rivalling LeGrand Cannon's Look To the Mountain. Good historical escapist fun and drama."},{"Title":"Northwest passage (Crest book)","review":"Somehow I only recently got around to reading Northwest Passage, even though it is better known and deals with an earlier period in American history than than the Roberts novels on which I started, such as Arundel and Oliver Wiswell. I'm glad I waited.Other reviewers have commented on the differences between the first and second halves of the novel. Not only are they stylistic, but the scope of the story widens dramatically in part 2. Here's where reading NWP out of order helped, though, because the other novels created a context that made the dramatic shifts more understandable than they might have been otherwise.Without giving any spoilers, all of Roberts' usual themes are here, including betrayal, corruption, and a fairly cynical attitude towards women.All in all, great, thrilling stuff, of a type that isn't really done any longer. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Hot & Spicy Latin Dishes: The Best Fiery Food from Las Americas","review":"This book was filled with anecdotes and anthropological points of view of the history and cultures that created these dishes. What I found very useful about the listings was that each recipe was put into its own country category, and sometimes even it's city of origin. It had many recipes that were not mainsteam, restaurant fair, but more the home-cooking of latin american people, which I like. I also liked the fact that they used chiles that are not found in the US, but gave you substitutions of chiles that are available there."},{"Title":"Hot & Spicy Latin Dishes: The Best Fiery Food from Las Americas","review":"These are rather unusual recipes for the usual palate--I don't know how accurately they reflect the original dishes but they range from Bolivian to Peruvian to Amazonian dishes. Many of them, recipes I've never seen elsewhere. Most ingredients are available (especially in latin markets) but the variety of chiles used may be difficult for many people to replicate. At the front of the book is a short explanation of the beginning of this cuisine in Latin America, but I would have appreciated possible substitutions if you can't find a particular chile. Lots of meat and fish dishes. And some dishes call for things like steak sauce or worcestershire sauce, which clearly aren't native to Latin America but they must be used to imitate flavors.The recipes themselves are quite simple and don't tend to have long lists of ingredients. This is not a difficult cookbook and this isn't nuevo Latin cuisine. But, simple, spicy food. This is a cookbook for someone looking for an easy introduction to spicy latin food without relying too much on authenticity."},{"Title":"Seventh Son","review":"Richard III is a figure without whom historical novelists would surely be lost. I'm happy to report I enjoyed this novel better than most about this king.Tannahill's novel picks up shortly after the battle of Tewkesbury, with Richard and his brother George fighting over the Warwick inheritance, and ends at Bosworth. It's written in a sardonic, somewhat emotionally detached style that may be off-putting to some readers but which I liked.Richard III is portrayed by Tannahill as neither a villain nor a saint, but something in between--in other words, as a fallible human being. He marries Anne for her lands, not for love, but he's a faithful husband who eventually comes to love his wife and is devastated by her death. Though he governs fairly, he has a ruthless streak and has no qualms about taking the lands of the Countess of Oxford or about his mother-in-law's dispossession. He makes mistakes: Richard's act of executing Hastings without trial on very flimsy grounds engenders distrust and hostility that haunt Richard throughout his reign, ultimately leading to his defeat at Bosworth.Anne Neville is attractively portrayed as a resilient young woman with a backbone and opinions of her own. The episode where she works as a kitchen maid, pure melodrama in the hands of some novelists, is almost farcical here--Anne, seeing Richard come to rescue her, does not swoon or burst into tears of relief, but tidies her hair. She has a sense of humor, which Richard does not always appreciate. (\\"'Two more bastards?'\\" she asks when Richard, having already invited his out-of-wedlock children to spend Christmas at court, proposes to invite his nieces as well.) Her death scene is moving without being maudlin.The Woodvilles are their usual villainous selves, but at least they're villains with a sense of style. (\\"'Dear me. I will have to think of something else,'\\" says Elizabeth Woodville when Richard tells her he always checks his food for poison.) With a few exceptions, such as Richard's friend Francis Lovell, a major character with a well developed personality, most of the other characters are sketched in, but they're vivid sketches. I liked this sentence in particular, uttered by Edward IV's womanizing friend about Jane Shore: \\"'Lovely woman,' sighed Lord Hastings, doggy-eyed.\\"For those of us who like author's notes, Tannahill provides a long one, including a section on further reading."},{"Title":"Seventh Son","review":"There were many things to enjoy about Reay Tannahill's book The Seventh Son. I so appreciate it when an author includes a family tree and the one Tannahill includes in her book is very nice and includes the ten children born to Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville as well as the four marriages of Margaret Beaufort. There is also a map of Medieval England showing the roads available at the time.This story is about the War of the Roses, the princes in the tower and Richard III. I'm somewhat familiar with the events that transpired, having read several books on the subject, I find the history fascinating.I thought that Tannahill's portrayal of Richard III as a shrewd and calculating man of his times is probably a bit more realistic than some of the depictions I have previously read.I really enjoyed the many smirky comments offered by the characters. Here's one from Will Hastings, talking about finding a rich wife for Richard Duke of Gloucester \\"the Lady Anne seems to be the only candidate, since the queen's brothers have already appropriated to themselves all the other great heiresses in the realm... However, I understand that Henry Stafford is close to death, which will make a widow of that clever wife of his, the Lady Margaret Beaufort. She might be available.\\"Another amusing exchange between Richard and his dear friend Francis Lovell.\\"When has civil war developed out of anything other than personal ambition?\\"\\"You are becoming unpleasantly cynical.\\"\\"Realistic.\\"\\"Cynical.\\"And here where the Duke of Buckingham is described: \\"The future may not prove so rosy for him.\\" Buckingham remarked in the end with his special friendly smile, the slack-muscled and rabbity one that displayed the entire battery of his admirably white teeth, the upper and the lower. There must be some trick to it, Francis thought sleepily. Most people showed only their upper teeth, and not even those if they were black and decaying, as most men's were.And here's one more from one of Elizabeth Woodville's ladies-in-waiting. \\"It's just as I have always said. Scratch a Woodville and you find a commoner.\\"These were some of my favorite parts of the book. But I also enjoyed the inclusion of several historical bits of information that give the whole chain of events that unfolded a very different perspective. One important one being the fact that when young George Neville died the properties that Richard Duke of Gloucester had been given by his brother the king would revert back to a member of the Neville family. And that the Protectorship that Edward IV wanted for his son did not hold up legally after his death.This was the same story with a different focus and included several important pieces of information that I don't recall reading about before. I thought that Tannahill did a nice job laying out the history and I really enjoyed the smart and biting comments from these 'characters'. I think that people who like their historical fiction to focus on the facts will enjoy this. I did enjoy it as well but I think I would have loved it if the author had offered greater character development and more personal insights, fictional as they would have been. But another enjoyable book about the controversial King Richard III."},{"Title":"Seventh Son","review":"How nice to have a novel with a realistic, well rounded Richard instead of the pure and saintly one we're always finding in the latest and *cough* greatest historical novels. Tannahill begins her novel in 1471 as Richard is planning to marry Anne Neville and recounts his life until that fateful day at Bosworth. Most of this is known history and enough reviewers have recounted what's covered in the book I needn't rehash it again.As noted earlier, what I most enjoyed was the more life-like Richard - although depicted as an honorable man he was still very much a man of his times and ruthless when he needed to be. I really enjoyed how the relationship between Richard and Anne slowly developed during their marriage, instead of the pure as the driven snow instantaneous true love we're always seeing these days. Outside of Francis, none of the other main players are as fully developed as you might find in some other novels on this period, but at the same time you're not getting all black and white - everyone has their shades of gray - even Margaret Beaufort and Elizabeth Woodville - a very refreshing change.All in all I found this to be a very enjoyable read, although Tannahill's dry wit and sarcasm may not appeal to all readers. Still tops with me for books on Richard III is still Sharon Kay Penman's fabulousThe Sunne In Splendour: A Novel of Richard III, but it's always fun to read another author's take on the always enigmatic Richard and the mystery of the Princes in the Tower. Four stars."},{"Title":"Seventh Son","review":"A rounded portrayal of Richard III as neither the evil bloodthirsty devil depicted by Sir Thomas More and William Shakespeare or the glowing saint of the Richard III Society, Rosemary Hawley Jarman and Sharon Kay Penman. It is strong in dialogue and descriptiveness but somewhat rushed and not quite as engaging as The Sunne in Splendour which is more detailed and fully fleshed outThis novel while exhibiting a certain gritty realism, is not quite as colourful or exciting. Everything here just happens too quickly-for example his Queen Anne is vivacious and engaging and two pages later has died of consumption, similarly before that the death of Edward takes place very abruptly. Starts after the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 in which Henry VI faced his final defeat and the Earl of Warwick was killed. Ends on the battlefield with the valiant charge of Richard against his myriad enemies, and his death at the hands of a thousand enemy soldiers.Presents Richard as scheming and cerebral but capable of love and loyalty. He is absolved here of the death of the princes in the tower but seems to have had no love lost for them"},{"Title":"Seventh Son","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. As another reviewer has mentioned, the author's style is a little emotionally detached and some readers may not care for it, but the more I read, the more I appreciated it. It suits the story she is telling.What I liked best about the book is the realistic portrayal of Richard III and his wife, Anne. Too often their relationship is portrayed like a romance novel but this Richard and Anne are very real:* She had always been desperately careful not to make demands on him. Nothing had ever been said, but her instincts told her that their good relationship depended on it.* Anne held him, and was horrified. Horrified that George should have to pay the ultimate penalty for his weaknesses, and at his brother's hands. Even more horrified to discover how little she knew of her own husband. Cool, controlled, sardonic Richard, who had passion in him after all.* Briefly, Richard wondered where all the pleasure of their relationship had gone. In these last months, secure in the knowledge that he had done only what it was necessary to do, he had reassured himself that, as a sensible woman, Anne would eventually come to accept it. He could see that it had not happened yet. He would just have to wait, and not force her.One device the author uses to humanize Richard is to show through the reactions of his wife and closest friend that grief over King Edward's death is impairing his judgment, although Richard is never able to see it.Other than Richard and Anne, the majority of characters are just sketches. Richard's friend Francis Lovell is more fleshed out but the only other is Margaret Beaufort. The portrayal of Margaret Beaufort is chilling. She is as monstrous as Shakespeare's Richard III.For anyone interested in a novel with a balanced view of the historical figure of Richard III, I recommend The Seventh Son.[ASIN:0747270422 Seventh Son]]"},{"Title":"Seventh Son","review":"Perhaps I've just read to many books on this subject, I fear I was not inspired by this book."},{"Title":"Spy Who Kissed Me (Five Star Expressions)","review":"The Spy Who Kissed MeThis is a most entertaining tale about a woman who has little going for herself except that she is the caricaturist of a children's book. She does not appreciate this success however, especially since her twin sister is married and has teen kids to account for.Her life changes dramatically when a bleeding man drops in her lap from the open sunroof in her sister's car and she has to flee or take a shot herself. This man brought with him a stirring in her heart and confusion to her mind. Her peaceful existence was torn apart and her life changed forever.This book had me glued to the pages with the witty ways the author tells her tale. I finished it in two days. The protagonist finds herself in many situations that not only turned her blood cold but make her heart and cheeks hot. The use of the English language is superb and you can share the feelings the characters are having in a very real way. Not many authors can convey to their readers these feelings, but Pauline did a superb job in this book.

Part of the reason I was not fond of this tale was it was told in first person, making the reader rely solely on one voice to describe absolutely everything in the story. Sometimes the heroine was spot on with her descriptions and other times I was left to fill in the blanks, visualizing people and places with not enough detail. I also could not relate well to the heroine who seemed flighty.Isabel aka Stan is caught up in an escapade not of her own making. A handsome man catapults into her car wounded and Isabel finds herself tending to injured CIA Agent Kelvin Kapone. This is all very exciting for Isabel but then again Isabel does not lead a normal life, I gathered she was a virgin in her thirties (apparently being Baptist explains this), tall and statuesque. She is an illustrator and her favorite character she draws is a cockroach (had a hard time even liking this caricature) and oh she plays in a rock band with a bunch of eighteen year olds.Isabel keeps running into Kel and she soon realizes that she is targeted by the same man who injured Kel, he had a lightening recovery. Isobel likes Kel but she is being pursued by her ex -brother-in-law's sibling and she is not above engaging in some dirty dancing with the young guns in her band which for me never felt sexy or funny but desperate. The guys in her band are all vying to take her out instead of dating girls their own age and she tries to convince the reader that the boys only want to kiss her on the date, really? I guess this must be before the era of cougars.This story relies heavily on coincidences, more than just the initial one of Isabel being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Isabel and Kel's tension is more action packed (Isabel truly does worry for her personal safety) rather than sexually charged. I loved the Scarecrow and Mrs. King series and maybe this was a take on that story but it never got off the ground the same way as Amanda King (she had a very normal life) and Lee Stetson."},{"Title":"Spy Who Kissed Me (Five Star Expressions)","review":"Ever since CIA agent Kelvin Kapone dove into Isabel Stanley's borrowed car ahead of a barrage of bullets, she has found herself in lust with Kel, in demand by male friends, and in danger from mysterious enemies.Funny tale of a spy and a cockroach cartoonist, with a dollop of mystery mixed in.

The good point is that she shows you how to use the herbs rather than telling you to purchase an already made salve/tincture/etc. If this book included more herbs it would be a lot better."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"I suffered through the first third of this book, wondering if there might be some pertinent information. It was just her personal belief system which she has interwoven with the use of herbs. While I will agree that I believe that we have gotten out of touch with our bodies as they pertain to the earth. I don't espouse bleeding into the earth during your period in order to do it! (she does, by the way) What I did glean was that a good way to learn about herbs would be to focus on just one herb-learn all about it, and what it can do. (don't sleep with it, as she suggests) I think just having it in your kitchen and garden and using it regularly would do. Starting on page 86 with Burdock, she walks you through harvesting and using the herb. This is useful and informative and I'm sure I will utilize it quite a bit. All in all, I suggest that unless you worship women and the earth-then skip the first half and go straight to using the herbs."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"I don't know of any other book that covers the approaches to healing in such an insightful way. I had numerous ahh haa moments.

Susan Weed gently offers information about three traditional ways of healing along with insightful aspects of each. She goes on to explain that the Wise Woman Traditions are nourishing and simple, easy approach to healing.Later, in the book, Weed shares her knowledge of alternative healing with seven common, abundant herbs. She teaches in an entertaining way the nutrients contained in each, the effect they have on the body, and a variety of ways to prepare and use them. Weed offers her knowledge in such a fashion that the reader suddenly realizes they are refreshed. It's almost as if they just visited an earthy scented forest or a butterfly filled, grass-waving field.To add further to the good feelings this guide presents Toni Bernhard sprinkles charming illustrations throughout the book and Alan McKnight a watercolor book-cover along with delightful calligraphic plant names. Susan Weed follows through with her belief that healing comes first by nourishment. She feeds reader's souls with the way she writes. One cannot help but relax and have fun reading and using this book."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"Written simply and effectively, Healing Wise is one of the very best herbal texts I have come across. Weed's emphasis on a small number of herbs having the ability to do a great many things is important--it is a &quot;back to basics&quot; approach, one that I feel is essential in this day of &quot;more, better, best&quot;.Though I utilize many other herbals, Healing Wise is the book I usually grab first. Thank you Ms. Weed for opening my eyes (and heart) a little wider to the world around me, I am grateful."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"The writing is fun to read and the content is top notch. I really enjoy the legend and lore as well as the praactical information about how to use the herbs.

I wish this were an encyclopedia in length."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"I always new backyard plants could cure common colds, maybe minor skin irritation...But what about cancer? Appendicitus? Or detox the liver, give you all the vitamins and minerals you ever wanted?...Regrow hair, and heal diabetes? Lower cholestrol and blood pressure, and do basically anything modern medicine can! (Without the side effects). But now I know they do, and the medicines taught in here are easy to make. This book is full of information on healing with herbs, and presented with insight and wit. I feel confident any health problem I may come across can be cured. Not with western medicine (which has always made me feel iffy), but simple gifts from Mother Nature we should all get to know better, and shoud've used all along!"},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"Susun Weed is the BOMB. I especially appreciated the quick response to the questions I posted at the website when I used her recipes for making tinctures. There is something to be said for her stance on no licensing for herbalists. She holds no certifications having had her education in herbalism in a life long pursuit of the path. I would trust her word over a certified herbalist any day simply because she practices and lives by what she writes about. A wonderful resource for those of us growing older. I am ten years post hysterectomy and the ovaries are starting to fluctuate. The tinctures that she profiles in this book went a long way to addressing the specific complaints I was having without having to go look for 'menopause' formulas. Supplementing the things your body needs as its ability to produce them naturally declines will go a long way towards easing the transition into Cronehood.Buy the book, it's wonderfully informative AND entertaining. Get all her other books while you're at it!"},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"Upon picking up Susun S. Weed's HEALING WISE (WISE WOMAN HERBAL SERIES) I was amazed to learn the history behind the Wise Woman Tradition. For those of you who may not know, the Wise Woman tradition is the oldest tradition of healing known on Earth. Unfortunately, it is very rarely identified - in fact, many do not call it by its rightful name. It focuses upon a woman-centered tradition of self-love and respect of the earth and all creatures.With accurate and descriptive passages, it took me back to the time of my Grandmother's own healing touch. Many times I have said to myself, if I only had written down all of Grandmother's teachings, oh the wealth of knowledge I would have had today. I'm happy to say this fascinating folklore tradition has not been lost. Susun Weed has done a magnificent job in capturing the very essence of this unique alternative medicine technique.After finishing her book, I knew this author had created something that would be cherished and passed on to future generations."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"What a powerful book! It has changed the way I feel towards modern medicine, the chaos in my life, and even my backyard. The seven featured common weeds are given voices and distinct personalities. For instance, dandelion speaks from this book with a charming and joyous French accent.My medicine cabinet has fewer pharmaceuticals these days and an increasing assortment of odd little bottles of tinctures, oils, and salves that I have had great fun making from plants I have found within walking distance of my home.The voice of Wise Woman wisdom rings throughout this book and I find myself turning to this book for solutions to my various discomforts instead of calling the doctor."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"This is a wonderful book filled with wisdom and love. The author has presented the reader with a simple, clear cut, and hands on approach to herbalism. The reader is presented with the 3 traditions of healing, scientific, heroic, and wisewoman. After reading this book I decided to get involved in naturopathic medicine and stay clear of the scientific and heroic traditions of healing. Susun Weed has such an apporach to her writing, reading the book makes you feel like she is by your side guiding your hand as you prepare your simples. This is truly a book to cherish through out the years."},{"Title":"Healing Wise (Wise Woman Herbal Series)","review":"This book is written by the truest deffinition of the word witch I know of.

It's easy to understand and is loaded with usefull information."},{"Title":"How to Argue with an Economist: Reopening Political Debate in Australia","review":"This is a good book. It doesn't get bogged down in economic language or take too long to read. It provides a historical context to the last few decades of Australian politics and the way things have been done. It takes note of the relationship between the Tax Office and it's bureaucrats and those on the edge, the back bench Members of Parliment, and outer government agencies.It goes into detail of the nature of Economic Rationalism. Although we may feel we understand it, this book gives examples and help us understand that which is around us but not necessarily understood. It talks about people, and how people see the world. It doesn't humiliate those of either side of politics and doesn't dismiss the beliefs we, or they have.It is however, focussed wholly on the Australian experience of politics and the economy. This may put some international readers off, but on the other hand we already have enough books about how the American Market works. This book provides a good balance for those of us not under the American sphere of influence."},{"Title":"How to Argue with an Economist: Reopening Political Debate in Australia","review":"One of those books that expresses perfectly that gut feeling you have in your stomach that something is not quite right. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"How to Argue with an Economist: Reopening Political Debate in Australia","review":"I've always thought economics was a dry, theoretical subject area. HOW WRONG I WAS! Ms Edwards makes the topic crunchingly relevant and digestable. The key concepts are clearly explained and related to recent events. I never knew how economics contirbutes to shaping our community.This book has left me with a sense of urgency regarding economics. Government policies matter, not just for short-term budget balancing, but for long term impacts on how we think and act.The autor's experience at the upper levels of the public service gives startling insight into why our politicians only seem able to create mind-numbingly similar 'solutions' to still unresolved problems.A first-rate read.

Mr. Bloch brings down to earth complex topics such as IPO's, Venture Capital, Underwritings and other investment banking subjects. Though it hasn't been updated, the book contains a lot of information about the core issues of investment banking. Also, there is an excelent description of the evolution of the investment banking business and how technology, changes in regulations and the increasing power of institutions has changed the investment banking landscape. The book is very helpfull because Mr. Bloch uses a clear language to explain investment banking subjects and he avoids excesive use of jargon. The reader must take into account that though it's a great book, the investment banking lanscape has changed a lot since the 90's."},{"Title":"Sinuhe The Egyptian","review":"An answer to the enquiry regarding the authenticity of the Sinuhe character. Unfortunately, I can not say for sure, but the generally accepted consensus wiew in Finland is that Mr Waltari invented the character of Sinuhe and his life. He did a lot of research on the egyptian customs and other background, in fact so much that the novel was used as reading material in the Cairo university according to a finnish legend. However, it is just a novel nevertheless. He also published a play on Ekhnaton just before the WWII Mr Waltari studied theology and philosophy, so the religious contents of the novel and the similarities with the Ecclesiates in the Bible are by no means coincidential. In fact my personal wiew is that a lot of the novel can be seen as an allegory of europe between the world wars, as the Aton religion can be seen as a parallel to communism, while the Hittites use sun signs (i.e. swastikas) as their war totems, not to mention the siege of Gaza as parallel to what happened in Leningrad in 1941-44..... Anyway, any story can be interpreted as a hidden parallel. Sinuhe remains a great monument to the human, with his failures as well as his greatness. BTW, somebody claimed that the book was based on the ancient egyptian legend of Sinuhe. In fact, at the early part of Mr Waltari's novel Sinuhe himself refers to the ancient legend, having been made fun of his name by his childhood friends, so I very much doubt the assumption of the novel being based on the original tale. It is posible, thought, that the english abridged translation omitted this passing reference..... According to mr Waltari himself, the novel had to be written because Sinuhe sat on his desk and pleaded him to write his life story (! ) Mr Waltari describes the writing process in a great little book called &quot;Nelj&auml; p&auml;iv&auml;nlaskua&quot; which far as I know has been translated to english with title &quot; A Nail Merchant at Nightfall&quot; If anybody out there has seen a copy, I'd be delighted to hear your wiews."},{"Title":"Sinuhe The Egyptian","review":"Amazon sells this book but it is called The Egyptian, just in case you want to buy it. Don't miss this incredible book full of such rich detail, philosophy and story you would wish it would never end.

The book is rather long but you will not even notice how many pages it has because it captures you completely.

It stars Edmund Purdom as Sinhue and Jean Simmons as (I forget her name)--the woman who bore him a son. Tommy Retig, who played Timmy in the TV series LASSIE, played Sinhue's son. I think Victor Mature played the pharoah who wanted to worship one god.The movie has an eerie, compelling quality that I can't put into words. The fascinating plot unfolds in a setting where everything seems to be exactly as it was in ancient Egypt. You get the feeling that everything in the movie was lovingly researched for historical accuracy. You feel like you ARE in ancient Egypt. The acting is wonderful, the direction is wonderful, the costumes, the set, and the devoted attention to historical detail made this a movie I love to watch over and over.It is made in Biblical epic style, which I have always enjoyed. I can't think of one Biblical epic I didn't like. But there is nothing excessive or superfluous in this film, even though it has &quot;a cast of thousands.&quot; There is just enough, and not too much.I don't know when it was made, or very many details about its production.

They were a wonderful followup to the earlier generations of Luftwaffe camouflage and markings books, featured excellent pilot biographies, contained carefully selected and unique photos, and had amazingly well executed and interpreted artwork.Circumstances took me away from these books for the intervening years, and I am just now catching up, picking and choosing the volumes that I hoped would provide the most interesting new information.Kampfflieger Volume Four, Bombers of the Luftwaffe Summer 1943 - May 1945 by Nick Beale (despite the better known authors whose names appear on the cover mock-up in Amazon's description) is nothing like the early volumes in the Jagdwaffe series. The writing is only about unit dispositions and combat operations, with almost nothing about the participants. There is nothing about camouflage and markings beyond the artwork and its captions, which contain many errors.The photo captions are a disaster. Whoever wrote them simply did not know the difference between the three common versions of the Ju 88 (A-1, A-5, and A-4) or didn't care to look for the distinguishing features. Reaching into esoterica, a Ju 88 A-4 is called an A-15 because the caption writer ignored the plainly visible gondola. This confusion is compounded by artwork that relies on one late Ju 88 A-4 outline template, apparently repeated from earlier volumes, for all Ju-88 versions. Any squiggle upper surface camouflage pattern is called color 76, even when it's clearly a lighter color, probably white or 99 primer. The captions assign the cloud-spotted He 177s of KG 100 to KG 40, repeating an error that was cleared up nearly a decade ago. In short, none of the photo or artwork captions can be taken at face value; all must be evaluated with information from more reliable sources.This volume contains many photos, some new and interesting, of the usual cast of Luftwaffe bombers, but only one (yes, just one each) Me 410 and Ju 88 S. The jet bombers are represented by a few of the same photos that everyone else uses. The artwork for the Ar 234 is prosaic beyond excuse.If you are collecting this series, I suppose you'll want this volume to complete the set, but there is really no other reason to buy it. There are many more books available that cover the aircraft and their crews in more detail, have more accurate descriptions of camouflage and markings, and are more interesting at less expense."},{"Title":"Kampfflieger Bombers Vol. 4 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"This book lets the reader look into the deperate last war years of the Luftwaffe Kampflieger, very informative and interesting reading. Excellent profiles and many previously unpublished photographs. Highly recommended to any Luftwaffe enthusiast and/or modeler."},{"Title":"Kampfflieger Bombers Vol. 4 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"Author Nick Beale wraps up the four-volume 'Kampfflieger' set with this nicely done history of Luftwaffe bomber ops from mid-1943 to war's end. In this case, Ian Allan Publishing saved the best for last and that's saying something given the high quality of the first three volumes.After years of triumphant combat, 1943 saw the first steps in the eventual decline of the German bomber force. Committed to action on all fronts, Luftwaffe bombers were stretched to the breaking point. During the last two years of war, irreplaceable losses of aircrew coupled with growing demands for more fighters and ground-support aircraft, dwindling fuel stocks and other factors eventually reduced the once-deadly Kampfflieger to a shell of its former self. Though new aircraft and weapons such as the Arado 234, Messerschmitt 262 and Mistel pick-a-backs were introduced during this period, many units labored on flying hoary old warhorses like Heinkel 111s.Beale's book deserves a rating higher than 5 stars. Since German bombers were active on all fronts, Beale had a lot of history to cover. However he does a marvelous job of covering all fronts, summarizing the major actions, aircraft and weapons developments along with little-known ops and units.And the book is a visual treat depicting, as it does, the wide range of of aircraft flown during this period. Among the 14 color profiles by Tim Brown, Tom Tullis and Dennis Davison are artworks depicting He 111s and 177s, Focke Wulf 190s, Junkers 88s and 188s, Ar 234s, Me 262s and two profiles of Mistel combinations - talk about variety! The book also features 170 black & white and color photos of aircrew, aircraft, unit badges, maps and combat scenes.Pick this one up asap - it's a delight!"},{"Title":"We're History!: The 20th-Century Survivor's Final Exam","review":"I can't decide whether &quot;We're History&quot; belongs on my bookshelf next to &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; and &quot;The Crucial Decade&quot; or in the cabinet where I keep &quot;Scrabble&quot; and &quot;Monopoly.&quot; As with his previous works, Mr. O'Neill has produced a thoroughly delightful volume which at once captures the author's astute observations about this century and presents a compendium of challenging and entertaining quizzes that test our memories of the people and events that have shaped our lives.

For example, it was interesting to find out that 101 years ago, we didn't have the means to make a tuna fish sandwich-- no presliced bread, no jarred mayonnaise, and no canned tuna. People made their own bread. Ditto with mayonnaise. And canned tuna? You would have had to catch it yourself, and even then, it probably didn't resemble the kind you get from Starkist or Chicken of the Sea today. And forget about finding it in cans-- lead in cans was a big problem. In this book, you also get to find out, decade by decade, what things were invented and became available to the general public. Interesting."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Although I am not a big fan of war-related novels, this book kept me riveted by its brilliant plot and it's treatment of the realities of the First World War. As a piece of story-telling it is absolutely first-rate and entirely compelling. What stops me from giving it 5 stars is the one-dimensional characterization of Mathilde and her family, and the occasional simplistic descriptions that leaves little room for the reader's imagination. These are very minor complaints in a novel that I would highly recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"My bookclub hated this book, just hated it. This was a very good sign (they hated Frankenstein, too, one of my favorites!). I, as usual, hadn't even bought (let alone read) the book in time for our bookclub meeting, so when I received it as a gift last year, I moved it to the top of the ever-growing pile of fiction, New Yorker magazines, and miscellaneous other printed matter mounting up on my bedside table.This is a really powerful and evocative story. It pulled me in right away, in part due to the mysterious plot line, but also because of the curious structure of the book. It's unlike anything else I've read for a long time. Brings to mind &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; and &quot;The Shipping News&quot; in that past and present are intermingled seamlessly, adding depth and dimension to an otherwise simple story.I can absolutely understand why the members of my (now ex-) bookgroup didn't like this book: it requires some close reading, some flipping around to remind yourself who's who, and it unfolds relatively slowly (but very vividly). But the descriptions of WWI France, the characters, and the appalling reality of open-trench warfare are plausably and deftly rendered. I learned a lot, and I cared a lot for the characters. I can't say that about many books I've read lately.Not everyone will like it. Only way to find out which side you're on is... throw it in the shopping basket! Strongly recommended"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Sebastien Japrisot is a world class author and this is his best work to date.Part mystery, part historical fiction, part war novel, part romance, A Very Long Engagement follows the exploits of one Mathilde Donnay as she tries to establish just what really happened to her fianc&eacute; on the front lines during a battle at Picardy in WW1.Mathilde is one of the truly unique protagonists to appear in many a year. Her determination and unyielding spirit are quite inspiring.This is a book that speaks to many things-honor, devotion, love, the chaos and cruelties of war, friendship, the triumph of the individual. It's the sort of novel that warms your soul while concomitantly breaking your heart. In the end, it stands as a remarkable spiritual work that will stay with you forever.Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Five desperate men shoot themselves in order to be relieved from the horrifying frontline at the Somme, in WWI. A court-martial decides to punish them by leaving them alone in no-man's land, to be killed in the crossfire. Then all hell breaks loose and they all die. Or not?One of these men's fianc&eacute;e, a young girl who can't walk since age 3, receives information that makes her suspect his boyfriend might have gotten away alive. So she embarks in a painful, long and often frustrating ordeal to find out the truth.Along the way, I got to really love Matti. She's kinda spoiled and obstinate, but she is a wonderful person, full of true love. Other characters are equally appealing, and the story of Manech and his infortunate companions at war is revealed bit by it, through confusing memories and even contradictory pieces of information.We discover a terrible but beautiful story through what Clausewitz called \\"the fog of war\\". And this story is about courage, nobility, cruelty, loyalty, friendship and, above all, true love.Absolutely recommended, it is a novel that will easily remain in your memory."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"War is not glorious. Especially if you're Manech, a 20-year old French soldier convicted by a military court, along with four others, of committing self-mutilation with the intent of escaping service in the front lines of World War I. The punishment is grotesque. Rather than death by a firing squad, the five are to be thrust, hands bound, over the wire fronting the most forward trench and into the No Man's Land between the French and German positions - there to die by whatever bullet, mortar shell, or bomb strikes them down. The subsequent deaths of all five are attested to. Letters are sent to surviving family members by the French authorities saying their boys \\"died in battle\\". This was in 1917.Mathilde was Manech's fianc&eacute;e when he marched off to battle. She's also confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk since she fell off a stepladder at age 3. In 1919, she's contacted by a dying survivor of the war, ex-Sergeant Esperanza, who'd been in charge of the provost detail assigned to escort the five condemned men to the front trench, as well as act as censor for the last letter each was permitted to write home. He tells Mathilde of their bizarre fate, and gives her copies of their last letters, transcribed by him personally. Using these copies and the veteran's story to provide clues, Mathilde embarks on a multi-year search for the truth behind Manech's death. Interviewing friends, family members, and lovers of Marech's four condemned companions, as well as other soldiers present in the trench, Mathilde needs to answer the question, \\"Is he truly dead?\\" She has doubts. The evidence is inconsistent.A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is an odyssey of mystery, official cover-ups, lies, misperceptions, secrets, coincidence, tenuous clues, guilt, innocence, and honor. And, ultimately, love. Astute and sardonic Mathilde, perhaps because of her affliction, is a take-no-prisoners dynamo of perseverance. No obstacle is too great that it can't be overcome. In the end, she finds ... Truth.This novel by S&eacute;bastien Japrisot is an unusual and unusually intelligent detective story, as well as a look at an almost-forgotten time and place strewn with the wreckage - physical, emotional and psychological - of the War to End All Wars. You'll put it down feeling ... satisfied. I recommend it unreservedly."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is one of the best WWI stories I have read, including Pat Barker's Resurrection trilogy. The rhythm of the opening section, with it's repeated Watch Out For The Wire holds you immediately. You want to know what is going to happen, not just to the prisoners, but to all of the men whose eyes stare out at them from the trenches. The writing is beautiful; the characters unforgettable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A quick, engrossing, thought-provoking read. A first-glance, the story sounds like a repackaging of Kubrick's 1957 film, Paths of Glory: the insanity of WWI military (in)justice, etc. We already know that bad things happen to soldiers who are branded as cowards by the French army. You wonder where Japriscot will take the story that could possibly be fresh. He succeeds by casting it as a mystery rather than a courtroom drama, and by forcing the reader to peel back memories of seemingly inconsequential details with each new piece of evidence. The writing is elegant and restrained, the pacing brisk and mesmerizing. Japriscot pulls off an intricate plot with ingenious narrative devices, without pounding us on the head with post-modernism for its own sake. It's part war novel, part romance, part mystery--sort of a French Snow Falling on Cedars. Very unlikely to disappoint."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was a very engrossing book whose story is told from many viewpoints. I especially enjoyed the character of Mathilde and her enthusiasm and tenacity to find the &quot;truth&quot;. However, I found the translation quite stilted. Having read many translated books and thoroughly enjoying them, this title was quite a chore. I found some of the translated content to be almost elementary in nature. I only wish that I was fluent in French, as I know I would have enjoyed this title immensely. Don't let this stop you, however, from chosing this book, as the story is a good one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This isn't a mystery in the widely-accepted sense of a mystery. But it is a story of putting together clues to discover the truth. I don't need to summarize the book again (there are plenty of good ones already submitted), but I wanted to add my five stars to the review page. By the way, I read this after I saw the film version (which I also recommend). It's worth reading even after seeing it performed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"All the other reviewers have said it all--this is a good book. I am adding my two cents because I am having such a hard time finding books of this quality to read. Something different, something well written (my interpretation of the translation was that it is Etchevery's style of writing--a little bit Hemingway), something that makes you think.I rely a lot on these reader reviews to help me find those types of books. I hope you find this review helpful."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"S&eacute;bastien Japrisot, an author, screenwriter and director was was born in Marseille in 1931. \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" was first published in France in 1991.The book opens on a cold night in January 1917, during the First World War. Five French soldiers are being marched to Bingo Cr&eacute;puscule, a frontline trench at the Somme. All five had been found guilty of self-mutilation, in an attempt to be invalided out of the war : as a result, they have been sentenced to death. Unarmed and wIth their hands bound, the five - known to their fellow soldiers as the Eskimo, Six-Sous, That Man, Common Law and the Cornflower - are thrown into no-man's land as night falls.While the sentence isn't exactly fair on any of the five men, it's the Cornflower's inclusion on the list that's hardest to take. Still only a teenager, he was shellshocked to the point of total amnesia - he had no real idea of who he was, let alone what was happening to him. The Cornflower's real name was Jean Etchervery, although he was known as Manech to his friends and family, and he grew up in Cap Breton near Biarritz. Manech had left a fiancee behind, Mathilde Donnay, and - just before he'd been sent over, he'd been allowed to write her a letter. Just over two and a half years later, Mathilde receives another letter - this time from a nun. A former soldier in her care is dying, and he wants to meet her. Daniel Esperanza had been at the Somme, and had met Manech in January 1917. What Esperanza has to tell her leads Mathilde to investigate what really happened that day - and all the little clues, all the slight inconsistencies gives her some, slight hope that Manech might still be alive.A very easily read, beautifully written book - totally recommended. (Jeunet's film version is excellent too, so long as you don't mind subttiles)."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A Very Long Engagement is not a \\"casual\\" read. It demands careful attention, that and a pad of paper to keep all the characters and their various nicknames straight. Without this forethought the story could easily be construed as confusing and convoluted. It may not easy keeping all the details in order but once you do the result is immensely worthy of your time. Mathilde is a wonderful heroine, loyal, witty and relentless in her pursuit of the truth. Just the kind of gal you would want on your side. This gripping story of devotion and fearless determination coupled with the insanity and cruelty of war is a must read. 4.5 stars"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This book was recommended by a co-worker and, boy, am I glad it was. The book is a bit slow getting going but I quickly found I didn't want to put it down. The cross-genre aspect (part romance, part mystery, part historical fiction) was amazingly well-done. I doubt that few authors could pull this off; Japrisot did so beautifully. The character development is also incredibly well done. Although you never meet many of the characters, by the time you're done reading the book, you feel like you knew each and every one intimately. I've recommended this book to a friend who teaches high school English as a study in Character development--she intends to incorporate this into her class next year! GREAT book!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I chose this book after hearing it reviewed on NPR. It touched so many feelings, the horror of war, the comedy of errors, the discipline of the military, the passion of young love, the depth of maternal love, the loyalty of friends, the determination to seek the truth. I found it hard to believe this book was authored by a man! Definitely on my list of books to bring along to a desert island."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"It's a beautiful story told through the soul of a passionate and persistent young heroine. Her lost fiance is named Cornflower, not because of his youth (as indicated in another review) but because of his clear blue eyes. This comes from the French word for cornflower, &quot;bleuet.&quot; These clear blue eyes and innocent soul frozen in boyhood are the quest that holds the story together. Some will find it hard to follow because of the jigsaw-like pieces that come from multiple voices, through letters and a few personal meetings. But it holds together and in the end, a believeable sense of peace descends... bringing an end to &quot;the Great War&quot; and a new life for those who survived. I read it in French and English, and it should be noted that the translation, as always, leaves a few things out. It also helps to have a sense of French geography (or a map) to appreciate the full range of the quest."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and keep scanning the bookstores to see if any of his other novels have been translated into English. (I even bough one in its native French on my last trip there -- which I am struggling through in my schoolboy french.

How does one capture years ofpining, childhood sweethearts, brutality of war, layersand layers of mystery? Read Japrisot and weep.

The wholeway through the I kept thinking &quot;well, either:A. he's dead, or B. he's not dead&quot;yet Mathilde faces an outcome that is not A, not B, noteven C or D but somewhere closer to X or Y.

So I approached the book with great anticipation. Sadly, after an interesting beginning, the book became quite tedious. Ultimately I finished it just so I could get it done with, not because I was enjoying it . Some prior reviewers have blamed the translation but the problem lies in the story itself. There is a very linear simple and obvious plot which is made overly complicated by a plethora of ancillary inessential characters and confusing twists and turns which are impossible to keep straight. In addition there is no character development - the characters are drawn once (very simply and always sentimentally) and never change, and are drawn with thick crayon at that. The depiction of WWI was well done, but other than that it is not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This book was chosen by my twelve-year-long book group. I would not have found Sebastian Japrisot otherwise. This isn't the kind of novel I normally search for, and although the translation made some sentences seem choppy, the story line is so vivid. I could feel the fright of crawling through the trenches with bullets buzzing over my head, of the agony of the smell of death, of the soldier's despair of seeing loved ones ever again. This was beautifully written, but I found I had to write down the character's names while reading, in order to remember who each one was. This was compelling to one who has never been in a war."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"\\"A Very Long Engagement, \\"(\\"Un long dimanche de fianailles,\\") (1994), by the best-selling French author Sebastien Japrisot, is a dark, dramatic, emotional and romantic mystery of a sort, set in France shortly after the end of World War I. The novel won the 1991 Prix Interallie. It concerns Mathilde Donnay, a wealthy, crippled young Frenchwoman who wants to know for sure what happened to Manech, her missing fisherman fianc&eacute;, during World War I. Manech appears to have died at the Somme River, after being found guilty of self-mutilation - to get sent home from the front--at a court-martial with 27 other soldiers. But statements made by witnesses, as to what happened at the trench Bingo Crepuscule that cold morning in January, 1917, conflict.There can be no doubt that the First World War, which was fought largely in the trenches dug by each side, was a terrible killer of men, as the Allies - French, British, and eventually American; and the Germans, struggled repeatedly over the same soil. In fact, historians and demographers say that the French lost so many men in the 19th century Napoleonic Wars that it has had a negative impact on the size of the French populace to this day, and then came World War I a century later. So there are millions fewer French than there otherwise might have been. The author makes his negative feelings on World War I, which I imagine were shared by many French, and British, crystal clear in this book.Japrisot has done a remarkable job in creating this novel. He gives us a very accurate, evocative portrait of the French nation at war, and shortly afterward. Excellent dialog, narrative and descriptive writing, and a complex, multi-strand mystery, of which he pulls a few strands out to give us a powerful ending I sure didn't see coming. His characters, even the minor ones, are vividly drawn. However, Manech, and four other men, a carpenter, a farmer, a pimp and a mechanic, are sent to Bingo Crepuscule to be thrown into no-man's land with arms bound, and killed by German bullets. And I must admit that, as vividly as Japrisot has drawn the men and their circumstances, and as likely as it is, in reality, that five sentenced men should face execution together, I had a difficult time following the five men, their women, and the others in their lives, particularly, I'm sorry to say, with all those French names. Duh! I have been known actually to chart characters, if I like a book enough, and the characters are confusing enough: I did that with the Chinese-named mothers and daughters in Amy Tan's enchanting THE JOY LUCK CLUB. But I didn't feel like doing so much work here. And I was able to get at least the book's riveting conclusion straight.The Marseille-born Japrisot, who was called France's Graham Greene, was well-known and loved in the French-speaking world, and little-known in the English-speaking world. He was an author, screen writer and director: a number of his books have been translated into English and other languages, and made into films. This one was made into a French film of the same name,A Very Long Engagement, starring Audrey Tautou (Amelie).The Sleeping Car Murderswas also made into a film of the same name, THE SLEEPING CAR MURDERS, and is pretty much an all-star production as French actors go, featuring Simone Signoret (Room at the Top), her husband Yves Montand (The Wages of Fear - Criterion Collection), and Signoret's daughter, Catherine Allegret , as well as Michel Piccoli, Claude Mann, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. It was directed by Costa-Gavras. I remember seeing this film and enjoying it. Unfortunately, however, my enjoyment of this book was lessened by my difficulty in following all those characters. But you may have an easier time of it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The plot is a sort of mystery, decently realized. The fact that it's entwined with WWI makes it somewhat novel (forgive me).But the flatly drawn characters all but kill the story. There's little growth, little development -- for all their experiences, all the characters seem to remain the same as when they were first introduced in the novel. And what's worse, the lead character is almost saccarine sweet -- so much sentimentality!The writing itself is decent, but not good enough to overcome the poor characterization and the sentimentality.Great literature it is not."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"\\"Once upon a time, there were five French Soldiers who had gone off to war, because that's the way of the world.\\" So begins Sebastien Japrisot's haunting novel which chronicles not only the horrors of war and the endurance of love, but the ways in which World War 1 forever changed the lives of those who were caught up in the conflict.I have already read this book several times. For some reason, I seem to find myself returning to it every few years. Japrisot's writing is so beautiful and flows so well in translation (the novel was originally written in French) that it makes me want to take language lessons so that I could enjoy his writing in his native language.The story concerns Mathilde Donnay, an intelligent and strong-willed protagonist who happens to be confined to a wheelchair because of an early childhood injury. Don't let this detail bother you, as it certainly doesn't bother Mathilde. She has far too many fish to fry to let a little thing like partial paralysis get in her way. As a young girl, Mathilde formed a lasting friendship with a boy named Manech, who became her fiancee after their childhood friendship developed into a strong and loving relationship. At the tender age of 19, Manech was sent off to the war, serving as an infantryman on the front of the French lines. Literally driven past the point of endurance by the horrors he has witnessed, Manech arranges for an accommodating soldier in German trench to shoot him in the hand. Manech is sentenced to death for this self-mutilation, along with four other soldiers. Their sentence is to be thrown into no-man's land, the space between the French and German trenches, with no weapons and their hands tied behind their backs. What happened to Manech and his fellow inmates becomes a mystery, one which Mathilde is not willing to let remain unsolved, and spends seven years trying to uncover. In pursuing this mystery she will uncover not only Manech's ultimate fate, but also learn the stories of those who witnessed it.This is such a beautiful novel, and Mathilde is such a likable character. Each time I read it I find myself furiously turning the pages, hoping for a resolution to lives that were so unfairly interrupted."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I'm one of those people who never watches the movie first. The book is simply the better experience, and it's lessened, typically, by having seen the film first.That truism didn't exactly hold for A Very Long Engagement. I actually saw the movie first (didn't know there was a novel at the time), and I loved it. I watched it twice and immediately recommended it to my friends. About a year later, then, I happened upon the book and picked up a free copy. I doubted that I'd ever read it, but one rainy day, I picked it up. Before that day was over I was finished.The movie does follow the novel very closely, but I was still swept away. The mystery is so complex, and yet tight and logical. Once you're grabbed by it, you must follow it through to the end. The characters, especially Mathilde and Manech (who we've gotten to know through memory), are so engaging.Mainly though, it's just so hopeful. I think that's what got me each time I've experienced the story, the romantic notion that no matter how absurd and confused and sorrowful and illogical this life can seem, perhaps truth and love at least have a fighting chance.I think everyone needs to be told that sort of story every once in a while. This one does it awfully well."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down. I was thoroughly caught up in the mystery and in the search for the truth. Like other books highlighting consequences of war, I was saddened and revolted by the tragedies. I truly cared what happened to these men. I didn't like all of them - but the author makes you care about them by his description and dialogue. Even some of the extraneous and minor characters had a charm of their own and each brought you closer to the truth. I was maddened at times trying to figure out the ending. That's what makes this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Wheelchair-bound Mathilde Donnay sets her sights on the past to unravel the mystery of her fiance's death in Japrisot's complex novel of love and human perception. Set in post World War I France, the story opens with a masterfully sardonic description of five soldiers, condemned to die for shooting themslves in the hand, being tumbled into the no-man's land between the French and German trenches.Their loved ones are informed of their death in combat. One, Mathilde, determines to know more and is assisted by a dying ex-soldier -- the man who led the condemned group to the Front.Mathilde, still unsatisfied, notes oddities and discrepancies in the meagre record she has compiled. She tracks down any possible witness, relentlessly pursues every lead. All evidence, however contradictory in other respects, points to the same end and even Mathilde finally seems resigned to learning no more than just how her lover died.With humor and an anecdotal style, Japrisot maintains a certain distance from his characters that makes the savagery of war all the more visceral. He leads the reader on with human mysteries -- there are as many versions of the soldiers' deaths as there are individual memories -- and with flashes of pathos and kindness. And the story's ending is as touching as it is surprising."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a fantastic story; a mystery, love story, and historical account. I won't recount the plot, since that's provided above. I just finished Corelli's Mandolin, which is similar but not nearly as flawless as this. Although translated from French, the language is beautiful and lyrical. You will be trying to figure out what exactly happened during the entire reading, and then at the end will want to go back to put the pieces together. Truly an aching, touching story."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a wonderful little book, a best-seller and heart-wrenching tear-jerker in the best sense (and there is a good sense of those terms). A girl's fiance' is reported dead in World War One, but she has reason to doubt the report. She tracks down leads for years, with the sort of perseverance only such a motivation brings. In the process she encounters help and hindrance, lies and truth, wisdom and incompetence, enough so that those who detest suspense can value this book while pretending to ignore it.Only after more than half of the story has been told are we given a glimpse of our heroine's pre-war happiness. The scene could stand alone, but is unbearably beautiful when read in its place."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I picked up this novel in part due to the many glowing reviews here. In retrospect, I have to wonder if these people were lauding the book or the movie. The book is very tedious in many respects due to its format. I think that Japrisot based his writing partially upon Calvino's work, such as the novel 'If on a Winters Night a Traveler,' or 'Invisible Cities.' The chapters of Japrisot weave from here to there in time and perspective dealing with first hand accounts, letters, and conversations. I think that all of this was a little too clever for Japrisot and that after a while the cumbersome nature of all this forces a collapse of will and you as a reader will be overwhelmed by its overworked zeal. I brought up Calvino because where-as 'Winters Night' is magical in many ways, 'Engagement' comes across as sort of typical.You might disagree with my summation here. The story is pretty good, though I would not recommend it to anyone. I think that Japrisot's cleverness smothers a lot of what was enjoyable in regards to the plot. I would say that if you enjoyed this book, you are in for a nice treat if you have not read 'Winters Night...' by Calvino. You might also be interested in Murakami's 'Wind Up Bird Chronicle'."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"It is a shame that I saw &quot;Amalie&quot; before reading this book. Though I loved the movie, I kept seeing that actress as the main character of this book. And though there are some similarities in personality, Mathilde exposes herself to our examination far more deeply than Amalie did.Many books have been written about missing fiances, missing lovers, war widows. This book takes those stories and binds them into a gripping mystery. This novel is NOT a tear-jerker and for that alone, it is wonderful. It is a novel about strength and love and a wish for what could have been. It is about who you would want to be if your lover was lost in the war. I will be buying this book for my mother and my best friends. It is something different. I loved it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I didn't expect to love this book. I'm not much of a history buff and hardly ever read mysteries, so I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. The love story is great and the images are wonderful. I can't say enough about it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"In 1917 five French soldiers are sentenced to death for desertion. Instead of being normally executed, they are taken to the French front to be shot dead by the Germans.Mathilde Donnay, the seventeen-year-old fiancee of one of the five, is told her lover died bravely in combat. But two years later she's contacted a dying officer who tells her otherwise. Some facts are missing from his story. There's a slim chance one or two of the men survived, and so, Mathilde undertakes a heroic search for the truth.A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is the story of Mathilde's search, told in a collage of scenes, letters, and narrating voices of those who knew the five men. What emerges is a gripping, sometimes thrilling mystery as Mathilde uncovers one piece of a very complex puzzle after another. Along the way we get to know not only the man Mathilde loves but also the other four (a carpenter, a welder, a pimp and a farmer) and their loved ones.Mathilde is a wonderful heroine. A fall off a ladder at age three left her bound to a wheelchair, but she's completely free of self pity. She is above all stubborn, someone who will not give up no matter what. Many people try to tell her that her search is futile, but she persists with doggedness that is at times a little selfish, but also a measure of her loyalty and love for her fiance.Most of the characters in A VERY LONG ENGAGMENT are very likeable. While their circumstances are sometimes sad, and we see how the war has affected their lives, the book is also uplifting because so many of them go out of their way to help others.The first chapter is a bit slow, but after that, the book takes off like a roller coaster. Clue after clue falls into place, and Japrisot keeps the reader guessing. The setting, France 1919-1924, is beautifully and authentically rendered.I enjoyed A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT tremendously. It is a story about devotion and dedication, as well as a story about the tragedy of war, and the beauty of life."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Sebastien Japrisot -- what a discovery! &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; is everything you could possibly want in a novel. It is divine and picturesque. It is unbelievably sad and beautiful, competantly evoking anger and pain in even the most jaded of readers. I found myself in tears and rapture countless times over. For the first time, I am hoping desperately for a second novel as I was completely tormented at having to come to the end of this one. An absolute must read for anyone looking for real literature in the existing sea of legal deception, post-mortum examination, and intellectual cannabalism."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"More than a year has gone by since Mathilde received word of her lover's death in the war, when in the summer of 1919 she is contacted by an ex-soldier dying in a hospital who tells her he knew Manech (her fiance) and that Manech's death was not what was officially reported. Instead of dying in combat as she had believed, Manech was part of a group charged with cowardice & to set an example for other soldiers was condemned to die by being tossed into \\"no man's land\\", the area between the French & German trenches to be killed by the Germans. Mathilde needs to know exactly what happened to Manech, has the money to pursue the truth & does so, and along the way it begins to appear possible that not all 5 men died that night, 1 or maybe even 2 may have survived, but if they did and were found they would now have prison terms to serve.The author has given us an intricate puzzle, Japrisot's style of writing is something new to me there is no one I can think of to compare him to. This is a first rate detective story for the intelligent reader, definitely not a \\"formula\\" mystery, also it is a war novel with grim descriptions of trench life. The prose is blunt, there are no wasted words in the main plot, yet along the way there are so many \\"asides\\", little anecdotes and fascinating glimpses into the private lives and motivations of ordinary people during the war, the book is never dull.Highly recommend this bestseller from France."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've read this book twice and am ordering another copy to give away. At once a literary mystery, a WWI history lesson, and a love story with a true heroine, A Very Long Engagement will keep you turning pages until the very end.

Don't plan to do anything else while you're reading this book!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"After I finished this book, I went online and ordered all the books of Mr. Japrisot's from Amazon. Some of the reviews cautioned against expecting the same level of narrative in the other books, but who cares? I'd try anything by this author.

It was the perfect balance between mystery, historic fact and clever story telling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this for a book discussion group about three years ago - I had a month to read it, but devoured it in a matter of three days! (I would have done in one sitting if I were not obliged to go to work.) This is a flawlessly written mystery that captures very eloquently the devastating horrors of war - poetically integrating ironic twists of fate with the tenacity of hope in the human heart. Japrisot has created an absolutely lovable three-dimensional heroine in Mathilde - who the reader can't help but follow across any vast expanse or obstacle - holding on to scarcely even a thread of hope - to find the true fate of her fianc&eacute; lost in the \\"no man's land\\" of WWI. This is a fine read - but be forewarned - you'll have a very hard time putting this one down!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a marvelous book. It is a powerful indictment of the hideous way in which WWI was fought. The central event of the story provides us with a clear picture of the inhumane nature of that conflict. The writer weaves an engrossing tale of love, mystery and history. There is however, an air of unreality to the gentle and kind nature of most of the characters that Mathilde comes in contact with. These characters are in stark juxtaposition with the shadowy figures that caused the inhumane sentence to be carried out. The only fault I can find is that the characters could have been more complicated."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I discovered this book in the library several years ago, but was not able to read it at the time and lost track of it. A friend's book club read it last year, but I did not hear many comments. I ran across it in a used book shop recently and was re-interested because I had enjoyed &quot;Birdsong&quot; (by Sebastian Faulks), also a love/war story set in WWI France. &quot;Birdsong&quot; follows a young Englishman through a disappointed love affair with the wife of his French employer into the trenches and tunnels of a very ugly war. The detail is unsurpassed -- how could this be written by someone who had never experienced it? If you enjoyed Japrisot's novel, you should give &quot;Birdsong&quot; a read."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A little lady in a wheelchair has been told by everyone that her fiancee has been killed in World War 1, like so many of his fellow soldiers, but somehow, she wants absolute proof, and doubts that it exists.

The story takes place in the early 1900s in Europe. It is about a woman who cannot accept the fact that her fianc&eacute;e died at war. She begins an investigation by travelling all over the world to find out exactly what happened that fateful day. Over the course of many years she begins to unravel the terrible event and all the people that this affected. The story is actually quite interesting and the ending is beautiful but the way it was composed was poor.I understand the author wanted to introduce numerous characters due to the fact that this was an investigation and many people would be involved. However, I had a hard time keep all the characters straight. The book is also composed of a lot of letter correspondence, half the time I didn't know wrote the letter or what relevance it. Most letters began with a story of the writers life when we really only wanted to know what exactly you know about the day in question or persons involved. I thought there was a lot of useless information and useless characters when I really just wanted to get to the point.I ended up skimming the last few pages just so I could finish the book and move on to something else. I was very disappointed in the book, I do think it could have been a beautiful story."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Someone questioned the meaning of the last page, specifically &quot;HOSSEGOR, 1989&quot; &amp; &quot;NOISY-SUR-ECOLE, 1991&quot;.

I had a really hard time with the translation in general -it was too vague. I am still not sure how the book ended! How sad!The heroine is SPOILED rotten, and I felt NO sympathy for her. Poor little rich girl. She had too much time on her hands and used her wealthy Daddy's money to pursue her curiosity.... hurting others while she was at it! How selfish!The other characters were very real, but nonetheless boring. Eskimo could have been interesting, but the plot was so confusing who knows?!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This book is better suited for a short-story, as it's pace and meandering detours added nothing to the development of the characters or a plot. I never cared about anyone in the book, not even sympathy for the main character with her &quot;disability.&quot; The only reason I forced my way through the book was that it was my reading group's monthly selection. Try War and Peace instead: it might have more pages, but you will get through it faster."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"There are many things I hate about this book: the neurotic and spoiled main character, the various extraneous sub-plots, the multitude of unneccesary characters to track, etc. First of all, Mathilde is not a heroine. She is a spoiled girl who happens to be handicapped but who also has more advantages than the countless others in the book who also lost loved ones. Her ability to &quot;overcome the odds and search for her lover&quot; are only made possible by the wealth of her father, as is her ability to &quot;overcome the odds and become an artist&quot;. Her character is trite and predictable. Secondly, the many characters in this story only detract from the main plot line and only force the reader to endure more of this book.I carefully considered attributing some of the arduousness of reading this book to its translation (or poor translation). However, when considering the magnitude of the translated works of Hugo, Dostoyevsky, Chekov, Kafka, and others, I do not think that there is any excuse for the poor quality of this read.In short, this is the worst book I have read in a LONG TIME!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"In my previous review of this book, I mentioned Pat Barker's WWI trilogy and incorrectly referred to it at &quot;Resurrection&quot; when in fact it is the &quot;Regeneration&quot; trilogy. I apologise for the error."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Wow! I just finished this book after reading it every spare minute for the last 2 days. I did not want to put it down. The beginning of this novel is probably the best introduction to a group of characters that I have ever read. Not only for its character development but for the rhythm of the language. A spectacular achievement considering this is translated from the original French.This is a love story and an intriguing mystery as well as an indictment of the carnage of WWI. And in the midst of the climax of the story, the author gives further detail to a minor character (Mathilde's mother cancelling the cheese course) that had me laughing out loud. How did he know that I needed a break in the tension?This is a well told story that had me enthralled from beginning to end, deepened my definition of love, taught me more about WWI (Pat Barker's trilogy is fabulous for this also, and just as fascinating) and caused me to appreciate again the privilege of reading great literature and all the benefits truly great books bring to life.A must read."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A Very Long Engagement is a magical book, one which weaves a tale and catches you in its spell--it will haunt you long after you put it down. The novel begins as five condemned French soldiers walk to their doom during World War I. They have all shot themselves, trying to get out of fighting and as punishment, will be thrown into the no-man's-land between the French trenches and the German trenches. Their families know nothing of this and after they die, are told them men died honorably. A few years later, Mathilde, the fiance of one of the men discovers some of the truth about what happened and she becomes convinced that her fiance has did not die--or at least did not die as she was told. She tries, doggedly, to uncover the truth. Along the way, she discovers many atrocities of that war. The novel pulls you along to its rather unexpected, yet still deeply satisfying ending, pulls you so much you won't be able to put this one down. The power of love, the strength of friendship, the failure of memory--all these come into play in this outstanding novel. I highly recommend this novel to all devoted readers. It's a bit of a challenge, following all the little clues Matilde gets, putting the truth together and tossing out the lies, but it's worth it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. Japrisot not only artfully held the suspense until the last possible moment, he gave me such wonderful characters to care about that I couldn't *help* but frantically turn the pages trying to find out Did Manech die or didn't he?? But it's not just a good mystery story. It's realistic historical fiction that gave me a vivid sense of the trenches and post-war life. It's a beautiful, painful romance story. It's a clever, astute rendering of how people help each other and lie to each other and care for each other and punish each other. All of this, brilliant at every facet, in one little book. It's a brilliantly *woven* story...like Mathilde, the heroine, you have to hold on tho the wire and don't let go until you get to the end as Japrisot winds you through his labyrinthine tale."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The plot, the characters, the story, these are all very good, and very compelling, but I can't help but be annoyed at the translation.If you speak French, you can see right through lines that have been poorly translated too literally, and areas where too much liberty has been taken to get a particular point. At least, I hope this is the fault of the translator and the original is not this poorly done. My experience of French literature has been such that I can't imagine muddled phrases and incomplete lines would receive the resounding praise in France as is advertised on the book jacket.Worst of all, I have found myself frequently reading the re-reading a sentence three or four times to discover in vain what the devil is going on.In a description of Angel and another soldier's pact to shot each other in the hand (p.14): &quot;At the last moment, because his entire being felt revulsion at the prospect of keeping his word, Angel had snatched his hand away from the mouth of the other man's gun and had closed his eyes. He'd pulled the trigger on his own gun, however. Now he was missing two joints from a ring finger and the tip of a middle finger, but the cootie-counting days of the other poor clod were over for good, as he'd taken Angel's blast full in the face, and the horses, desperate to escape this mess of human lunacy, had trampled the rest of him to a pulp.&quot;First off, it sounds as if Angel pulls his hand away totally, but you find that's not so. Then, it makes you go back and re-read the passage a few more times, wondering, &quot;Did Angel shoot this guy in the face? What am I missing?&quot; My only conclusion is that the translator could have used different words, such as &quot;full on in the hand.&quot; For all that, the translator could also have avoided the painful use of phrases such as &quot;cootie-counting days.&quot;Is the original this bad as well?I like a good story as much as the next person, but part of what makes it great is the telling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this for my book club, and was surprised to find that so many women in my group could not get into this book! Some gave up after 5, 10 or even 50 pages. They were frustrated by what they saw as choppy translations and hard-to-remember French names. Those who did finish the book, like me, found it to be so rewarding! (Actually, I didn't have any difficulty getting into it from the get-go, but I do admit to making a cheat sheet to keep track of the characters' names and aliases.) The end is not cheesy, where many American writers and film makers would take this path. I did see it coming a bit, but it was still handled beautifully and with sincere emotion. I really liked how the author took a circular approach to this story, returning again and again to the same scene, each time with a new perspective or missing piece of the puzzle. Well worth the effort. I would definitely recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I confess that I feel just a bit stingy in offering only four stars to this book, because I cannot identify a single area in which it is lacking. Japrisot's story is both moving and entertaining, the characters are richly developed and easy to care about, and the events described seem completely credible.I guess I find myself comparing it to books like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is, of course, grossly unfair. For one thing, it could reasonably be argued that those books are among the best written in the twentieth century, and how fair is it to judge every new novel on its ability to measure up favorably to such a standard? Secondly, although ENGAGEMENT is about the First World War, it is more accurately read as mystery/love story.My favorite thing about this novel is the way in which Japrisot offers the reader an opportunity to form quick intitial judgements about many of the characters, and then slowly provides the reader a deeper understanding of these individuals and their motives as the book progresses. I found that, by the end of the book, I liked almost everyone involved in this story. Perhaps not a &quot;great&quot; book, but certainly a very good one - and a damned sight better than most of what has proven to be publishable/marketable over the last fifteen to twenty years."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I made the mistake of starting this book, misplacing it, finding it, and discovering I couldn't pick up where I'd left off and had to start at the beginning again. It's just not a book to read casually. You've got to concentrate and pay attention and read long chunks at a time.Dissatisfied with the official account of her lovers death in WWI, crippled artist Mathilde sets out to learn the truth. Here's the deal: five soldiers were condemned to death for self-mutilation. The manner of their execution was odd: they were forced into the no-man's-land between the French and German lines and left to fend for themselves. Everyone assumed they would all quickly die, but it seems at least one didn't . And there's confusion about his identity. And there's the fact that one of the buried men was wearing German boots, so what's that all about?A spellbinding and enchanting story, Japrisot's A Very Long Engagement is a little of everything: history, mystery, romance, intrigue, and all done in a splendidly literary style.This book was translated from the French, which may account for a small bit of the obscureness of the writing. But oh boy, is it worth sticking with it. If you're not smokin' anything, not drinkin' anything - if you're paying attention all the time, you're in for a superb reading experience."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I never would have guessed a book like this out of Japrisot after reading his 60s noir stuff -- I read it once when it first came out in English, read it too fast in the way that dogs and children are apt to gobble their food faster than the speed of tasteability, and then (as is the way with most good books) everyone I knew borrowed it and then leant it to their friends, and so on -- 2.5 years went by -- the book wound up in the hands of my friend Ted, one of the ten or twelve inhabitants of the planet who actually have the cojones to return a long-overdue book (I am NOT one of that rare dozen, by the way)mailed it back to me, and I read it twice, and it was even better than I remembered it, especially at Round 3, when I actually chilled out and read it at an excruciating turtlespace... To be able, at the cranky and over-post-post-contemporarized fin de siecle, to write such an overwhelmingly beautiful and downright odd love story without resorting to worn-lace nostalgia or otherwise bowing away from what presently squats before us as the toadlike specter of our world -- that's a feat worth more than ten million silly opinions. My own included."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and I wish it was seventy-five thousand million trillion pages longer. Japrisot's prose is elegant, the plot is riveting, and the protagonist is someone I wish I knew in real life. You will want to read it in one sitting; it's that good. I'm a voracious reader who generally reads 1-3 books each week, and I would rank this one as the best I've read in the last six months (and there have been some contenders, let me tell you.) The translation manages to let the elegance of the writing shine through. I can't say enough good things, so I'll just stop here!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I love this book. I first got into the world of A Very Long Engagement through the movie, and I immediately decided to read the book. The book is very well written, holding its different subplots and and the main plot together nearly seamlessly. At the end the elements that become key are ones that you have nearly forgotten or, possibly, skipped over, the reason why I give it four stars. Otherwise I adore this book, and it is a wonderfully good read."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This novel is beatiful. The faith of the principal character is so amazing that I cannot stop the reading until the end. Outstanding."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is historical fiction at its best, a page-turner filled with great characters. As we follow the heroine, Mathilde, on her quest for her lost love, we end up falling in love with her. By the last hundred pages, you feel as though you are as invested as her in unraveling the mystery of what happened to her fiance. A great book. Also recommended: BIRDSONG by Sebastian Faulks and EASTER ISLAND by Jennifer Vanderbes."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"What would you do, and how far would you go, to bring back the love of your life? That question is at the heart of Sebastien Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement,\\" a quiet little story about love and war. While the story drags a little at times, the exquisite story of Matti and the love for a man whom she won't believe is dead.Wheelchair-bound Mathilde grew up with Manech, and as teenagers they fell in love and became engaged. But Manech is killed in action, leaving Matti to dwell on her imaginary adventures. But one day she is contacted by a dying veteran, Daniel Esperanza, who tells her a terrible story -- Manech was one of five men who shot themselves in the hand to avoid fighting. Because of that, they were condemned to death: sent to the front lines with their hands bound.But Matti doesn't accept it -- she believes that there is chance, even a small one, that Manech survived somehow. She has her friends assist her in searching through mounds of paperwork, and she herself writes to anyone who might be able to help her -- ex-officers, widows, and lovers. And slowly Matti begins to piece together what happened that day -- and why Manech might still be alive.\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" is complex and a bit confusing, but it's also worth the effort. Japrisot takes a simple plot and gives it some extra twists, a few lessons about war and misery -- but at its heart, \\"Engagement\\" is just about love and determination. It's difficult not to be stirred by Matti's long quest to find her lover.Japrisot's complex paper trail is a bit hard to follow, and the novel tends to drag in the middle, which is mostly Matti reading and writing letters. Japrisot seems uncertain where to go at that point. But the novel is also a jigsaw puzzle -- the German boots, the color of a young man's eyes, a lost hand, and a packet of old letters are all pieces. And many scenes in it are exceptionally tender and beautifully written. Matti's flashbacks and fantasies are dreamy, and even the real world seems to be a bit hazy. The climactic scene is without a doubt the most beautiful, understated and yet deeply romantic.Japrisot created a wonderful character in Matti. Despite being stuck in a wheelchair, she doesn't let this hold her back; she lets her mind fly in all sorts of fantasies. Perhaps it's that childlike belief in the unbelievable that lets her hold on to the belief that Manech is alive. And though Manech only appears for a few pages over the whole book, he becomes as strong as presence as Matti is. Japrisot avoids the cliches of young lovers, while convincing readers that what Matti and Manech share is stronger than anything that comes between them.\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" (now a movie starring Audrey Tautou) is an exquisite love story, heartbreaking and uplifting at once. And it will leave readers with a question -- how long would you look for your one true love?"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I also loved this book and I couldn't put it down towards the end.The war descriptions were very moving,especially the part about the prisoners going into &quot;No-mans Land&quot;.This book will teach you a lot about World War 1-especially about the effects of it,not only on the soldiers,but on their families also."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Winner of an Audie award for her presentation of The Time Traveler's Wife, Maggi-Meg Reed gives a haunting, memorable portrayal of narrator Mathilde Donnay on the Abridged version of A Very Long Engagement.Another equally gifted actress, Isabel Keating is impressive and affecting as she gives voice to the Unabridged Edition of this emotionally riveting story of a search for a lost love.France is the backdrop and the time is before and after World War I. Mathilde has been unable to walk since childhood. Although confined to a wheelchair she has gained some reputation as a painter, yet she's unable to recover from the loss of her fiance. Jean Etchevery was a soldier in the war and declared dead; it was a dishonorable death. He was accused and found guilty of deliberately mutilating himself so he would not have to go into battle. He and four others were taken among the trenches and left to die.Mathilde cannot accept this explanation and with the aid of a private defective and interviews with families of other soldiers she believes Jean is still alive. But, if that is the truth, many more questions arise.Listeners will not soon forget this story of the dreadful toll of war.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is an amazing story of love and hope.

The army has decided to &quot;execute&quot; these men in a gruesome show, to discourage others from wounding themselves to get out of the war. In the dead of night, with hands tied behind their backs, the five are thrown out of the trench into no-man's land between the French and German troops and left to die as the fighting begins. Two years later, wheelchair bound, Mathilde Donnay, fiance of one of the doomed soldiers, receives a letter from a sergeant who was at the front and met her fiance that fateful night. After visiting him and hearing his story, she is convinced that at least one of the men survived and is still alive somewhere in France, hopefully her fiance. The very resourceful and tenacious Mathilde begins a relentless search to find out exactly what happened that night and after..... A Very Long Engagement is a magical, spellbinding novel that has it all...history, mystery, romance, intrigue and suspense...From the first page, you are pulled into the story and transported back in time to France during and after World War I. The original, interesting characters are beautifully drawn; the plot, intricate and compelling, full of twists, turns and surprises that will keep you off balance and turning pages to the end and the scenes, vivid and riveting.

This is an amazing story told with insight, wisdom and sensitivity and a novel that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The storyline in this book is great and the author certainly does a good job educating the reader in the psychological horrors of war. However, the story is often difficult to follow with lots of new names appearing throughout that are hard to keep track of. It is by no means a &quot;fast read&quot;, but if your willing to really concentrate and wade through it, its a pretty good one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've been reviewing for over 5 years. In that time, there is only one book that I ever started that I did not finish, and I never reviewed that book because I barely got 20 pages into it (if that). Well, now that number is increasing to two.I won't give a summary as many, many others have given a really detailed summary that is far better than anything I could ever have done justice to. Instead, let me tell you why I stopped at page 113 and why I have no inclination to finish this book.The first twenty pages are spent introducing five soldiers--their names, their prison numbers, their family, their main characteristics. The next thirty or so pages are spent reintroducing those five soldiers and continuing a few moments ahead in their story. And finally, at page 60, we are introduced, in a large, very exposition-heavy 5 page section, our main character.I found the writing to be terribly confusing. I don't know if it was meant to be that way, or if that is a fault of translating from French, or maybe I am just plain stupid, but sentences sounded weird, the writing was dense, and I had to start skimming in order to make any progress in this book. The book is written in present tense, but that felt more unwieldy and clumsy than some YA books I've read. Sections switched points of view sometimes without a section break, leading from first-person to third-person in just a paragraph. And it seems an omniscient narrator is dictating this...except for a few places where I thought it was Mathilde.The characters are painfully dull. First of all, I could hardly keep them all straight. They were like a deck of only red cards, which the author flashed at me. I couldn't tell who was a diamond, who was a heart, if that person was a 3 of hearts or perhaps a 6 of diamonds. The characters were so flat, it would be a compliment to call them two-dimensional. About the only one I cared for was the soldier wrongfully accused of self-mutilation...and I have absolutely no idea what his name is or who he is beyond that he didn't self-mutilate and was wrongfully charged. Mathilde was a horrible character, in my opinion. She was stiff, unlikeable (calling random people \\"sh&& kicker\\" is NOT a way to endear a character to me), and oddly characterized. I don't mind having a woman proud of her body, but this passage just doesn't sound like any woman I know:\\"She has very lovely breasts. She's proud of them: they're heavy, well-rounded, and softer than silk. When she caresses her *CENSORED* she soon feels like making love. She makes love all by herself.\\"Male fantasy? Bad translation? A very, extremely confident woman that I've never encountered? I don't have a clue.Mathilde exchanges letters with various people. These people are startlingly open about their private lives, sometimes going on pages and pages (when they supposedly aren't big on writing) to elaborate on every last detail of that person's life to a complete stranger.The story is supposed to be about a mystery, but it really didn't kick into gear until the last 20 pages that I read. Even then, I have no drive to figure it out, because I can predict one of three outcomes: 1) Mathilde finds Manech and reunites (unlikely), 2) Mathilde finds Manech and doesn't reunite (most likely), and 3) Mathilde finds Manech dead (unlikely). It doesn't really matter what ending will be chosen. Lessons will be Learned; People will Change; Morals will be Passed on.And this is why I am giving up on this book. There is no way I can force myself to read another page, and with so many other better books out there, I am going to pass on this one.HOWEVER, just because I didn't like it, doesn't mean it's horrible. I rated it 2 stars because \\"I didn't like it\\"; I'm sure lots of people who love mysteries, historicals, and books about World War I will love this. To them, I say, go ahead and give this book a try. I hope you have a much more enjoyable read than I did.Brought to you by:*C.S.

So much in one place. I loved it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was one of the most compelling books I ever read. It is hard and demanding, but worht it. The details you need to remember are legion (in fact, after 100 pages, I started over -- this time with a notebook and pen). But the plot is very well done, intricate and fascinating. The characters are equally compelling [I really enjoy books in which the lead characters are likable and complex]. The protrayal of war is eye opening (and I think the new movie version does an excellent - if gorey - job of doing that). The movie is also very good -- but focuses on images that movies do well. The book is its own reward and I as many would say is better than the movie (only because it can be more detailed and longer). OK, so I really enjoyed both.Buy it. I'm recommending it to everyone."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Part historical, part detective-mystery, this is quite a remarkable work which combines fiction and fact and evokes a whole gamut of emotions from pain, anxiety, curiousity to some precious moments of beauty. The title may form preconceptions, but this isn't Mills &amp; Boon romance, or even a love story in the accepted sense. The reality of the horrors of war, particularly trenchlife in the 1st World War are vividly brought to life--the story relolves around the grim sentence of 5 soldiers caught for desertion and thrown into No Mans Land between the French &amp; German Lines at the Front Line of the Somme; and Mathilde Donnay, a cripple from childhood who is afianced to one of those soldiers. Her courage and fortitude to discover what happened to her fiance isn't super hero(ine) stuff, but her character grabs you so much, that you, the reader, can't bear not to find out too. Linda Coverdale has done a superb translation, although this book was a best seller and prize winner in France there was no guarantee that much of the essence would be lost (as happens with so many translations fronm one language to another), but she has done full justice to the original work. She has captured it all in the well-written, even flowing, riveting and compulsive reading--nothing has been lost in the translation. You don't have to be a war-story buff to enjoy this poignant tale. I whole-heartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I'm amazed at how many people loved this book.

The juxtaposition of the horrors of war and the pure gleam of enduring love is beautiful and heartrending at the same time. The soldiers' emotions feel very relevant today - this novel explores the personal costs of war in a way few stories can - with elegance and grace to balance the gritty realities of warfare. I highly recommend this book - it might very well become a part of you as it has for me."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I love the book. I couldn't wait to see the movie. I must admit the movie fell flat. Don't waste your time with movie, but definitely read the novel. It is set during and just after WWI. Wheelchair-bound Mathilde Donnay is told that her fianc&eacute; has died honorably during the war. She notices discrepancies in the official story and is convinced that her fianc&eacute; is still alive. This is a love story set in a historical setting, but what I loved about the novel was the mystery or I should say mysteries because there are several in this novel that Mathilde must solve. I really admired Mathilde's tenacity to find the truth about her fianc&eacute;. The twists and turns this story took while investigating her fianc&eacute;s whereabouts and the mysteries that are discovered and solved during this time really keep you guessing about what actually happened to her fianc&eacute; right up to the end of the novel. I read this novel in 2 days, something I haven't done in quite some time."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is an excellent book. Its greatest strength is the main character Mathilde. She is a complex, three-dimensional character who is believable and interesting. At times maddening, you still can't help but like and admire her.The plot is a kind of mystery which does make for compelling reading. However, since it incorporates so many different stories, story lines, and characters it becomes needlessly complicated at times and, yes, might even strain your patience.Still, after reading this book I now want to see the movie to see how the director approached this ultra-complex story."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"One of the best books I have ever read.

The combination of a bittersweet love story told in conjunction with the battle scenes is very compelling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was different than anything else I've ever read and I enjoyed exploring a new author and style. I was wondering about the last page though. Can someone please explain why the format of the last page is as is and why the dates are so recent. Up until that point I thought this was the final account of the incident in the trenches. What are the dates about? I'd appreciate it if anyone would like to answer.

The story is beautifully realized, and the characters very lifelike and human. I was a little disappointed at the publishers reviews as well as the blurb on the back of the book - I felt as though it gave away a bit too much of the story. Japrisot, however, leaves the reader in complete suspense until the end of the novel. There were parts where the story dragged a bit - about forty percent is told in the form of letters to the main character, and some of these letters should have been two or three pages shorter. I also had a bit of trouble keeping all of the minor characters straight. In the end I gave this book a five out of five stars for its originality and the strength of the characters."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Just finished reading \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" and boy-o-boy was it good!

I tend to like that stilted flavor. The author's use of present tense verbs in describing the action was also interesting. The plot itself was quite simple. The opening descriptions of the five condemned men and the surreal horror of WWI was the best part of the book. The conclusion also grabbed the reader's attention as it offerd a resolution to the question of the plot. The middle of the book, however, dragged. How long can a person write letters, ask questions, and talk about a missing lover before getting tedious? I have mixed feelings about the whole impression made by the book and probably would have liked it better as a condensation."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Talk about inter-genre. S&eacute;bastien Japrisot's novel \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" hardly fits one single genre. The book is at first --and most of it a war drama--, but at some point --still early in the beginning-- the narrative is also a love story. As the pages move, the novel becomes a thriller. But, above all, it is a fable. Just check the first sentence, the classic \\"Once upon a time...\\" The result may generate mixed feelings among the readers, but not by chance.As the story goes, \\"once upon a time, there were five French soldiers, who had gone off to war because that's the way of the world\\". From the beginning we meet the five soldiers. Japrisot describes with details who these soldiers are, and where and why -- actually not much of the \`why', after all, this is the quest of the book. Then we're introduced to Mathilde, a young girl, whose fianc&eacute; was one of the five soldiers -- or so the thinks.Years later, she receives a letter from a dying man, claiming to have information on her boyfriend. This is the beginning of Mathilde's journey, which will take many years until its heartbreaking conclusion. Throughout her quest, she'll come across the most different kind of people, some will be helpful and others not. Because that's the way of the world.The non-linear narrative is enhanced by the many devices used by Japrisot. From digressions to flashbacks, and many letters, the readers discoveries events before Mathilde. However, one will be able to fully understand some pieces of information only later -- when the girl can place the piece on her giant war jigsaw.The gallery of supporting characters is as colorful and the main ones. Mathilde is a strange girl. Confined to a wheelchair since her childhood, she has created many different lives inside her mind. At some point, one wonders if this fianc&eacute; really exists. There are many small plots surrounding Mathilde's secondary lives -- but it will all converge in the end.The five soldiers also have a special place in the narrative. Alongside with their friends, wives, children, they become a portray of the human condition, affected by the WWI. Letters from both sides are the perfect device to give dimension of their dramas.As the narrative advances, it becomes stranger, until its surprising climax. With this novel Japrisot (1931-2003) proved to be a great storyteller, whose talent will be largely missed."},{"Title":"One Hundred Great Essays (Penguin Academics Series) (2nd Edition)","review":"If you are an instructor of advanced English Composition or a literature class, this volume, edited by Robert DiYanni, is very comprehensive and represents a wide range of subjects and styles.The anthology includes writers like: James Baldwin, Stephen Jay Gould, E.B. White, Langston Hughes, Gertrude Ehrlich, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, George Orwell, and Maxine Hong Kingston. I might not recommend this book for an introduction to literature or introduction to expository prose because it is too overwhelming, and one would never be able to cover even one-third of the essays. However, in a more advanced class, this would fit in quite well.I don't always agree with the commentaries that precede each essay, and I don't find all the \\"Possibilities for writing\\" questions after each essay that valuable. However, most of them have some relevance.All in all, \\"One Hundred Great Essays\\" by Robert DiYanni is a worthwhile and practical collection that will appeal to teachers and students alike.Rocco Dormarunno, College of New Rochelle"},{"Title":"One Hundred Great Essays (Penguin Academics Series) (2nd Edition)","review":"I give up. There's no way I can communicate, within a reasonable investment of my time, the many great things about this book. But if you've an interest in the essay genre, and have not read it, you're doing yourself a great disservice.Reviewing the table of contents removes any need for me to comment on the actual essays. From staples like Montaigne and Lamb to contemporary pieces from Dave Berry and Tom Wolfe-the editor has presented a fresh variety of both content and form. He leaves you to beat any one of these essayists into the ground on your own time, and instead lifts you up on his shoulders to have a look around.In my estimation, the book's best quality is its ability to guide you through the process of reading essays analytically; as well as guiding you through these works individually without shoving the editor's interpretation down your throat. Exercises for analytical reading, notes on the authors, notes on the individual works-it's got it all.This book holds something valuable for everyone.William Dylan Powell"},{"Title":"One Hundred Great Essays (Penguin Academics Series) (2nd Edition)","review":"In part this review is based upon my use of the book in the classroom, in essay writing classes. But this may not be so much a bias, for what other possible reason would this book be written? (And it does overtly identify itself as for the classroom.) And yet I have to ask, why would you then collect this particular group of works? Yes, there are some truly great essays in this collection: Emerson's \\"Nature\\" (but no other Emerson, strangely), Orwell's \\"Shooting an Elephant,\\" Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" but how do you explain excerpts from _The Communist Manifesto_, _Natural Selection_, and other books? Obviously they are not essays. So of what value are they in exploring the structural and stylistic demands of the essay? And what of the Gettysburg Address? Or the introduction to Brownmiller's book _Femininity_? Or Plato's Allegory of the Cave?Yet that excerpt might be more damning than Diyanni realizes, for it is worth pointing that the excerpt of the Republic that covers the allegory of the cave is limited to the allegory proper, and eliminates the rhetorical context that follows: a context that puts the allegory within Socrates's argument as a whole. If the allegory was to be of some value as a \\"Great Essay,\\" wouldn't it be necessary to keep it within the greater rhetorical structure, so the reader could see how Plato developed the structure and rhetoric of the argument as a whole? If the first question offered by Diyanni in the \\"Possibilities for Writing\\" (that follows every 'essay') is \\"Analyze Plato's allegory carefully,\\" wouldn't it be necessary to include the whole of the rhetorical structure of the text, so the allegory could be analyzed in full? After all, the main point of the allegory is not the issue of the world of illusion, but the obligations of the enlightened to educate. Something Diyanni seems to have fallen short on.Beyond the silliness of 'great essays' that are not essays, there are far too many contemporary essays that really are not that good at all. In using this book in an upper-class, collegiate article and essay course, we spoke far more (and far more readily) of flaws, weaknesses, and flat poor writing than moments of quality. To many of these examples are no more great essays than a Grisham novel is great literature. And far too many of them offer nothing in the nature of examples of brilliance in essay writing for the anthology to be of any value.There are some great things. And many of the essays are fun to read -- in the way that Grisham might be considered fun to read. But I believe they were chosen far more on content than on writing excellence. One of the primary reasons I believe this are those questions, those \\"Possibilities for Writing,\\" that follow the texts. For example, after Guy Davenport's \\"The Geography of the Imagination,\\" a rather incontinent piece, the first question is: \\"Define what Davenport means by 'gothic,' 'classical,' and 'arabesque,' using your own examples to supplement your definitions.\\" How in any way is that question involved with great essay writing? How in any way is that about essay writing -- or essays! -- at all? (That is, outside of revealing to an attendent student just how poorly Davenport utilized, defined and controlled those ideas.) It isn't: it concerns content only. As such this is a poor anthology for any educational purpose.I titled this review \\"Commentary on the State of Belles Lettres?\\" Obviously this anthology offers texts from over a large span of time, and some of the writing is obviously of quality, so I don't mean the essays themselves (as a whole); rather, I refer in a lesser part to the contemporary essays, and in a greater to Diyanni's sensibility: for if this is what is considered a collection of 'great essays,' how far, indeed, the concept of the essay has fallen. Perhaps a better title would be _100 Examples of Prose (both Great and Not-so-great)_. If you enjoy prose, but without great demands of quality, perhaps this is worthy bedside (or commode-side) reading. But if you are looking to explore what lies within writing great essays, look elsewhere.

Not very good but acceptable"},{"Title":"One Hundred Great Essays (Penguin Academics Series) (2nd Edition)","review":"There are several ways you could look at examining a book of 100 Great Essays. First, you could argue for months over whether these 100 are the absolute best in the world across all time. Are they the best written? The best examples of what essays have been like across the centuries? The best collection that includes a variety of cultural backgrounds? The best to catch the attention of the target audience, which we'll assume is the 18-20 year old new writer?I realize there is no way any two people could ever come to a consensus on this issue, but I do think Diyanni did a reasonable job coming up with a collection which is interesting to read, that new writers will find inspiring, and that covers a range of time periods and ethnic backgrounds. There are essays by dead white males and by feisty female hispanics. There are serious essays about politics and fun essays about cats vs dogs. Some essays make you think, \\"this person feels exactly the way I do!\\" and other essays where you shake your head in disagreement the entire time. Perhaps most importantly, for the vast majority of these essays, you enjoy reading them, and you are drawn into wanting to write essays of your own. If the book is going to do one thing, I think that is a key. It demonstrates a variety of writing styles, all of them are fairly well done, and they inject an enthusiasm into the reader to give it a try.The brief biographies and commentaries are helpful to place a given essay in its location in history. Knowing that an essay written about the African American experience was created in 1950 rather than 2010 makes a fairly significant difference.The questions to ponder at the end of each essay are not rocket science. \\"Do you agree or disagree with the author\\" is fairly bland. \\"Write a similar essay\\" is not something we needed the book to direct us towards. Definitely all of those end-of-essay questions could use some tuning.Still, for me that is not the great value of the book. The value is that, in one spot, I have a ton of wonderful essays that I can read, enjoy, and draw inspiration from. It's like having a \\"writing prompts\\" book chock full of brilliant ideas. I often found myself finishing one essay that had been assigned, and reading right into the next one because it seemed so appealing.

So, a lot of the book talks about posture, breathing, warm-up, focus, etc. For instance, the breathing and posture exercises are very useful.However, if you want a book about the singing techniques, or the performance itself, I don't think this is the book for you. For instance, there are just a few very vague paragraphs about vibrato, which would certainly disappoint someone looking for more detail.This small book, while useful, is not really the \\"ultimate handbook\\" advertised on the cover. I think this is really more an introductory manual for beginners, or for singers wanting tips on warm-up or posture.On a technical note, the quality of the printing and illustrations is poor. Some text appears to be missing, and several of the diagrams cannot be read. It could also use a bit more proof-reading.

Today, in a time of monetary crisis for many school districts in the nation, any book that can shed light on where to get money for innovative and creative programing is welcome. Dr. Levenson's does that and more.Classroom teachers can use his work as a guide to understanding what it takes to write a grant proposal. Nowhere in a teacher's college education is anything like this taught, or for that matter, mentioned. Yet, teachers are constantly trying to be innovative and creative in their teaching. Sometimes, without funds it is hard to try the new and &quot;impractical&quot; in the classroom. With the guidance of Dr. Levenson's book, teachers are walked through the grant writing proposal step by step. But the book does not stop there!He lists places where money can be found. The federal, state and local government all have some money earmarked for educational innovation. He lists them. Private funds and foundations, an area where money for the public school systems is growing rapidly, are listed and studied. Levenson tells what types of grants each foundation likes to fund (an extremely important idea).As someone who has written and won school grants, I would have appreciated this book when I was a public school teacher. I think all school districts should have at least one copy of this book in each of their schools. It will encourage teachers to do what they can do best-teach, think, and write grants creatively."},{"Title":"How to Get Grants and Gifts for the Public Schools","review":"In an era of diminishing resources, Stanley Levenson's book is an invaluable tool for schools and districts alike. His easy to follow recipe for writing winning grants gives school personnel the confidence to write their own proposals without the need of contracting an outside consultant. His book includes examples of successful proposals which he also uses to familiarize the reader of effective writing styles. What I also found tremendously helpful were his fresh and creative approaches to fundraising which many schools and school districts tend to overlook. For a very small but wise investment, our schools have profited from Dr. Levenson's insight. I'm sure many others would, too."},{"Title":"How to Get Grants and Gifts for the Public Schools","review":"Fundraising for America's schools has gone way beyond the bake sale.

That one technique where he swirls the food around in the pan has been very helpful for me when I make my turkey meatball recipe. It helps to brown all the sides of the meatballs evenly. Who would have known.Well, I tried the \\"Parisian Mustard Sausage Rolls\\" which were just smashing. Now, I did have to use Crescent roll dough, which did work quite well and I used breakfast pork sausage links. We served the rolls with eggs and orange juice for breakfast.I find that when cooking from a cookbook by a chef, you can adapt the recipes slightly to your own taste. I left out the Dijon mustard and they were still very good. While this recipe was in the \\"Snack Attack\\" chapter, they work very well to add a gourmet flair to a breakfast plate. I will also keep this recipe in mind for a brunch.I am looking forward to making Butternut Squash Spiced Soup, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Lightning Lamb Dhansak (great picture!), Baconeese, Citrus Couscous, Golden Raisin Salad and Banana Raita. Each recipe has a nice bold heading and the text is easy to read. There is a headnote from Ainsley to add a pleasant personal touch.\\"You know what it's like: home late from work and you'd love a delicious supper, well...a touch of French pistou blended with some al dente Italian pasta and you have the perfect answer.....\\" pg. 95, Premier Pistou-PastaThe colors in this book are delightfully refreshing and almost tranquil. If you are a cookbook collector, you will enjoy reading the headnotes at the beginning of each recipe and the \\"Try This\\" or \\"Chef's Tips\\" info at the end of some recipes.Chef Ainsley gives advice on how to adapt a recipe, why you shouldn't make a recipe with fresh herbs too far ahead of time, how to make use of frozen foods like rice or how to completely change a recipe by substituting various ingredients.So, if you are looking for tasty sandwiches, hot snacks, delicious soups, mouthwatering curries, mini-pizzas and pastas you can make in a hurry, you will enjoy some great fast food at home.If you love this book, look forAinsley Harriott's Meals in MinutesandAinsley Harriott's Barbecue Bible.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Ainsley Harriott's Gourmet Express (DK American Original)","review":"So far, I have only tried three of the recipes but I intend to try a lot more.

The Baconese potatoes were a big hit. If there was one thing wrong with the book it is that the conversions are a little off. Where most cookbooks would say 1/4 cup of ingredient, Ainsley says 3oz. of ingredient for the American conversions. Also the book is a little inconsistent in that sometimes the British units are in parentheses and sometime the American units are in parentheses.My overall rating is great recipes but you need to do a little math to do the conversions in you head."},{"Title":"Ancient Enemy (Howard Moon Deer Mysteries)","review":"In the 4th installment of Mr. Westbrook's fictional San Geronimo detective series, much more attention is given to the novels namesake, Howard Moon Deer.Moon Deer is not your typical Native American.

It seems bones have been un-earthed and key clues left behind that may once and for all settle the argument if the Anazazi were once cannibals are at sake.But when another Indian boy shows up at Howie's front door shot, he has only minutes to give Moon Deer an unidentifiable artifact to hide before he dies.Now Howie, D.T., the local War Chief and his shady companions must ascend the mountain on horseback and secure the site. But again, not everything as it seems and Howie soon suspects everyone has his or her own agenda. Clearly D.T. is lying about something, as is the War Chief. Howie realizes that he may be over his head on this one and soon he is on the run to save his life when people start revealing their true colors.The climax takes us back into town, where Wilder and his wife Emma, doing their own detective work uncover some interesting information about all the players and make another discovery that surprises the reader. What was the artifact that everyone seems to be clamoring for back at Howie' place?Overall, Ancient Enemy was a more solid read than Red Moon. The author gave a lot of attention to Moon Deer, and made all the characters believable both in description and motivation. I felt the story always moved forward, and there was really no lack in action and development. It was also nice to see the author include more Native American lore that was missing from Red Moon, and I think the reader will notice that this novel was put together very nicely as compared to previous novels in this series. Looking forward to more."},{"Title":"Ancient Enemy (Howard Moon Deer Mysteries)","review":"Synopsis:This is part of a series of novels about Howard Moon Deer, a highly-educated Souix Indian who is living in Northern Arizona and helping Jack Wilbur, a blind ex-police chief from San Francisco run a detective agency near the Pueblo Indians. By th way, Howard Moon Deer knows absolutely nothing about being a detective. They run across a couple of murders involving the Pueblos and an ancient Anasazi town and human remains that may have the key to their disappearance centuries ago. The title refers to the Navajo's name for the Anasazi.My review:Sound gimmicky? Sound like a bad detective show like Jake and the Fat Man or Remington Steele? Sure it does, but it still works. Mostly it works because Howard Moon Deer is as much of a fish out of water as the reader is. Although he is a Native American the Souix are not like the Arizona Indians at all - plus, he has pretty much abandoned his Indian ancestry in search of a doctorate in literature. So, the characters are interesting, the books stand alone very well since this is my first one but it is the third in the series. The anthropology of the Anasazi and the Pueblos made the book very interesting for me.I give this book an \\"A-\\""},{"Title":"SEARCH FOR THE RARE PLUMADOR","review":"Search for the Rare Plumador is a rather rare children's popup book which to my knowledge was only printed once in 1983. I loved this book as a child. The basic plot is that an orinthologist is accompanied by a newspaper reporter and a photographer to Dragon Island to recover is lost bird, the Rare Plumador. The centerpiece of the book is a huge 8-panel 3D popup map of Dragon Island. Read along as the adventurers avoid pirates, snakes, a dragon, and other dangers in their quest to find the bird. As the explorers discover clues, try to see what they see.The popup Dragon Island is nothing short of AWESOME for a little kid to explore. I don't know how many hours I laid on the floor with the book all the way open exploring the different trails, searching for various animals, and letting my imagination run wild. My mother was always happy when I opened this book because that was an hour that I wasn't bothering her when she could clean the house of have some alone time. This book gave me my early love of maps which was eventually augmented by J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth.I recently wanted to re-purchase this book since my old copy had disappeared in the last 20 years. I spent a month searching for it online, which was difficult considering I had forgotten the title and authors. Eventually I found it and bought it from an Amazon seller who had a copy in Like New condition. I was quite fortunate.When buying a copy of this book you want to make sure that it has all the pieces. Fortunately there are not very many removable or moving parts to get lost. On page 3 there is an envelope with a removable piece of paper which has a picture of the Plumador and its footprints. The reader is supposed to use this to help him/her find the bird. On page 6 there is a pocket containing a removable standup of the three adventurers which the reader can use to move the characters around the map. Originally the three characters are all on one piece, but they are divided by black lines where the reader can choose to cut them apart and move them around individually. The book has no other moving or removable pieces. There is just the 8-panel popup map, and it should be relatively easy to tell whether anything on that is damaged.Please see my three customer images above."},{"Title":"SEARCH FOR THE RARE PLUMADOR","review":"This book has pieces to it which is why I bought it. The copy I had lost the pieces over the years. They said it was like new. That should mean that all the pieces are there. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Nuttall's Standard dictionary of the English language: Based on the labours of the most eminent lexicographers","review":"Very disappointing. The lettering is very blurred and most difficult to read, in fact some of the entries are impossible to read. Wherever possible I use my old very damaged version."},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"\\"Dark Dance\\" is an early foray into horror for fantasy author Tanith Lee. I've never read any of her books, and I bought \\"Dark Dance\\" based on the cover description and the fact that the novel was published by the excellent, short-lived Abyss Horror (Dell) label. The Abyss Horror books were released in the early 90s, and introduced me to several quality horror novelists and stories. A shame it didn't catch on.This eerie tale begins with Rachela, a young twenty-something woman with some issues. She lives her life working jobs that go nowhere, and is haunted by her memories and personal demons, the most demonic of which was her mother. Mother kept Rachela under a clamp, molding her into a hermitesque life, while reinforcing the fact that Rachela was NOT to associate with her unknown father and his family. Rachela, of course, thinks her mother is a nut, and has been (almost) content since she died.Then the summons arrives.Her father's clan, the Scarabae family, has sent a messenger to find Rachela and offer her a chance to live in the family mansion deep in the English countryside. Rachela is stubborn and independent, and refuses the offer as long as she can. Fate seems to take over at that point, and she finds herself making the journey out of London and toward her destiny.There are a couple of reasons why I won't expand very much more on the plot. Number one is a fear of spoilers. Number two: this novel tells a long story, but is slow in developing, meaning that certain plotlines shouldn't be spoken here for fear of giving away the whole novel. I will say that the Scarabae clan is strange, ancient, detached from reality, and never leave their home. Rachela has a love-hate relationship with them and in particular her father Adamus. The Scarabae wish to continue their family line, and it just wouldn't do to poison the bloodline with any \\"outsiders\\"...The story takes place over a long period of time, with excellent usage of sinister prose combined with a sense of building horror. Ms. Lee has a style not unlike Anne Rice, and builds her own reality as the story dictates. This book is not as realistic as some would like, but I appreciate the fact that Lee does not waste time dwelling on the small stuff. The tale is told with the detail required to advance the plot with no padded filler.I couldn't put this book down. It captivated me all the way though, although it could have had a little bit more detail regarding the Scarabae and the history of this bizarre family. The ending worked for me. The book has little \\"shock\\" horror, but makes up for it with general creepiness. The characters all seem to be detached from the events around them, and I thought the characters could have expressed more personal horror during their journey of the damned. Still, \\"Dark Dance\\" rates a firm 4 star rating from me."},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"Rachaela Day is the protagonist in Dark Dance, an attractive, dark-haired 29-year-old who lives a quiet, uninterrupted life between her small apartment and meaningless job in a bookstore. Her mother died four years ago (a woman Rachaela didn't mourn) and, many years earlier, her father had abandoned them. Otherwise, she has no family, no friends.Then she is contacted repeatedly by messengers: her father's family want to meet with her, to make amends for his abandoning her all those years ago. Obviously, Rachaela is apprehensive, but when she is mysteriously fired and notified of a future building eviction, she has nowhere else to turn but to these strangers.The House, simply named, is home to the Scarabae (pronounced Scarraby), a group of a dozen or so eccentric family members, including her father Adamus. As her mother had explained to her as a child, the Scarabae are unusual, &quot;darkly ominous&quot; people, which Rachaels discovers is all too true. She also learns their invitation had a more deviant purpose: to mate father with daughter. However, nobody expected the outcome to be so fatal.Dark Dance is the first of three books in the Blood Opera Sequence; &quot;Personal Darkness&quot; and &quot;Darkness, I&quot; follow. This series is so far my favorite Tanith Lee series, as well as my favorite all-time vampire series. It's not as bloody as most present-day vampire books (in fact, there's very little gore; it's more gothic than violent), but if you're a big vampire fan (which I am), I would recommend you read all three books.As fair warning, there are some sex scenes between father and daughter that might offend some readers.If you've already read the Blood Opera Sequence, you might like Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles or Lives of the Mayfair Witches. Both series are somewhat alike to Tanith Lee's tale of the Scarabae, that is, if Anne Rice had merged her vampire world with her witch world.I also recommend reading &quot;The Kiss&quot; by Kathryn Reines if you like vampires."},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"Yes, the heroine of the tale, Rachaela, is depressing and sulky, but for some reason I really, really like her; her personality is so clear, complex, somehow REAL. A unique protagonist with an odd charm, a clear vision, a quick mind. Very different.This book, like all of Ms. Lee's stuff, is completely outside the norm. Her stories seem to follow a predictable plot, but somehow Lee's writing makes the whole story veer off its tracks. Lee's novels always seem to be isolated and lonely, distant, almost cold. And yet, despite all this, her characters are strange and engaging, and you actually care about them.To anyone who likes it a little different, who enjoys an original prose style, who likes the characters different and compelling and unusual, I recommend this book. IF you can find it. This book, Dark Dance, is all but impossible to find anywhere. *sigh*Lee's writing style is, as ever, truly excellent. Her plots take off into their own forests along their own dark paths, the characters are truly different and arresting. Altogether, a fabulous book. Tanith Lee, you're a wonder."},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"All I am about to say about this author and this book, is that it is well worth your time to read this tale. I feel that you will leave this book, feeling amazed and smitten by the beloved Rachella. Tanith Lee tops my list of extraordinary storytellers, she has captured the hearts of all her fans and will not ever let go. This book is beautiful. Read it. (and the other 2 in the Blood Opera series.)"},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"Rachaela is like no other character I've ever read about. She is written so well, you care for her. The story it self is disturbing, but you can't put it down. I had a hard time doing that my self. It is, unfortunatley, hard to find. I'm lucky a local library carries a copy of it. I recomend it anyone who loves horror."},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and I felt it tapped straight into my dreams. I actually read the sequel first (my local library always buys books in the wrong order) and I loved it. a lot of people have been cruel about Personal Darkness, but I found myself addicted. I read Dark Dance about a month later and found it just as delicious... Tanith Lee is a modern genius. Even in these stories, set in contemporary London, she weaves a subtle web of symbolism and Magick. She highlights the wyrd goings on behind the mask of normality in modern culture, making the stories a lot more sinister than if they were set in a different time or different world. Tanith, your work is beautiful and inspiring. Give us more."},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"A dynamic book that reads like an intriguing psychological thriller set in a fantastic world. However, what really makes this book shine is Tanith's writing style. The descriptions are nothing short of captivating especially when referring to the character's inner thoughts and motivations.A fantastic story, complimented by a truly creative writing style."},{"Title":"Dark Dance","review":"Beautiful prose illuminates this vampire tale set in an ever-changing mysterious house just outside of London and starring the most depressive &amp; apathetic heroine you'll ever care about.

Tanith Lee usually does MUCH better."},{"Title":"How to study","review":"I have had this book for a long time. I still refer to it frequently, not to refresh my memory, but to enjoy the writing and to get inspiration to study harder. This book has everything from making plans, timetables and motivation to the impact of smoking and exercise on study. It outlines the best known methods for studying both subjects like english literature and mathematics. I am surprised that this book has gone out of print. Read it even if you are not a student. Everyone of us needs to learn things and this book will make it easier."},{"Title":"How to study","review":"30 years back when my college grades were showing a downward trend, I approached my professor for help.

I followed the book like a Bible. Needless to say, I came out from the college with flying colours! I gifted this book to a close friend. I wish I kept a copy for the sake of my sons. A really wonderful book!"},{"Title":"How to study","review":"I entered the seminary after seven years at work, and I felt it wise to prepare for the daunting task of embarking on six years of full time study. The advice in Maddox's excellent book was exactly what I needed.Did it work? Judge for yourself. I was one of five students chosen as guinea pigs for a new STB/MA course overseen by Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, doing the degree work on top of the regular seminary coursework. I passed cum laude.It seems to me that academic success is made up of three factors: intelligence, application, and skill. I don't see how you can make yourself more intelligent. How hard you work is up to you. Working hard unskillfully might make you feel virtuous, but it's mostly a waste.

Writer Sloane Tanen and photographer Stefan Hagen take those tiny little stuffed yellow chicks you can find at Easter and put them in wickedly funny scenarios in gorgeously detailed dioramas. This is the first book in the series BITTER WITH BAGGAGE SEEKS SAME: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SOME CHICKENS and it's both delightfully bitter and sunny-natured. And who can't relate to adorable little spoiled tyrant Coco who is rarely seen without her tiara and dreams \\"that one day she would grow up to be a benevolent queen...or a supermodel?\\"The second book in the series--GOING FOR THE BRONZE: STILL BITTER, MORE BAGGAGE is equally hilarious. One of my favorite pages shows two chickens peering over the side of the Titanic while a chicken floats beneath them and one of them comments, \\"I don't know, the last thing he said was something about being king of the world and then I may have accidentally pushed him.\\" No one is safe from the satire including Charles and Camilla, American Idol, and Hooters. And the photographs are so detailed that you can spend hours just noticing things in the background.I should warn you that, due to a wee bit of naughty language, these picture books are for adults only, but Sloane Tanen has also written a children's book called COCO ALL YEAR ROUND. If you want your child to develop a deliciously dark and dysfunctional sense of humor right along with you, you can read them rhymes featuring the adorable Coco like \\"I walk down the street with my whole Girl Scout troop. It would have been fun had I not slipped in poop.\\" (I'll spare you a description of the illustration on this one.)(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at www.teresamedeiros.com)"},{"Title":"Bitter With Baggage Seeks Same: The Life and Times of Some Chickens","review":"This book cracks me up.

I WILL purchase one for myself and perhaps other single gal pals of mine! I don't know how she finds all the materials for the settings she photos the chicks in, it's a very creative, cute concept.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bitter With Baggage Seeks Same: The Life and Times of Some Chickens","review":"This book is so funny! I kid you not, I almost peed my pants when I read it.

I also feel that this might have been more successful as a series of prints--at least I would like some of them to put on my wall (blue chicks coming to America)--something I can't do to a very nice book."},{"Title":"Bitter With Baggage Seeks Same: The Life and Times of Some Chickens","review":"I saw this book while shopping for Christmas gifts, and had to buy it for myself--in spite of my having gone over budget already with everyone else's gifts! This book is absolutely hysterical--the photos are delightful (as another editorialist put it: you'll spend hours going over the photos) and are full of visual asides and &quot;bonus laughs&quot; for those who look carefully. The chicks are too too adorable, you'll fall in love with their little personalities and true-to-life scenarios. I brought it with me to a wine bar last night and shared it with a friend (was going to give it to her as a gift but couldn't bear to let it go), and we laughed so hard we were crying--BEFORE our drinks were even served! (Bartender was entirely intrigued!) Today I will give it to a fashion-savvy female friend of mine--only because I have found it for order here on Amazon--and am positive I'll be crying with hysterical laughter when I go through it with her, too.

There is almost nothing better or quicker than these funny Sloane Tanen books with chicks encountering all sorts of dilemmas and \\"gotcha\\" situations. Sometimes a quick laugh is really what you need to get you through the day. These books are great for those who have a \\"Far Side\\" sense of humor and enjoy Gary Larson's work such asThe Far Side Gallery.

This is a shame because the breakup of the marriage of the prim professor Brian and his wife Erica is a fine and subtly humorous novel. The novel is set in the Vietnam era as a background to the campus setting, but it is also is part of the atmosphere that leads to a seachange in the lives of all the characters.Brian passively allows himself to be drawn into an cheesy, self serving affair with a nubile student. One of the novels digs at colleges of the sixties is that the girl is barely literate, which is apparently no impediment to being a graduate student.Erica, who has been a demure and dutiful wife has an intellect as sharp as her professor husband She is less than happy with the situation, but is determined to put Brain's feet to the fire on this issue. She also finds that with Brian out of the house she is able to deal with the many annoyances imposed on her by her prissy spouse, such as his insistence that she does not work on campus.Less pleasant are her two teen children who are cleverly likened to the South Vietnamese of the day, dependant for aid on people they resent and her weedy, weird college friend Sandy, the only male available to spend time with her. Lurie's description of events are smart, satirical and just plain funny. Most importantly this is novel about change and the need and the inevitablity of moving forward."},{"Title":"The War Between The Tates","review":"The first half of this book shows a horribly plausible example of a middle aged marriage falling apart at the seams, due to chance happenings. The psychology of the husband, Brian Tate, is thoroughly and sympathetically examined - he looks like a success, but his own self-view is very different. This, and the great feeling of the palce and period (1969) are the strengths of this novel.Its weaknesses are that it gets less convincing towards the end, and the author's rather simplistic femanism gets the better of her, particularly when pontificating on male relationships.Overall, not one of her best, but still a good read."},{"Title":"The War Between The Tates","review":"This was the first novel by Alison Lurie that I've read and it made a deep impression. It is very witty and humorous as are all her works but it is among the darkest. It's fine enough to have gotten the Pulitzer except that the direction of the author's sarcasm would, I imagine, be a downer for the prize-determiners. Happily Foreign Affairs, which got the Pulitzer, directs its sarcasm more across the board, for instannce at the interactions between Brits and Americans; this time the fact that the two protagonists are English professors is evidently forgivable.All her fiction is interesting, but here is what I like best, aside from the two aforementioned novels: The Truth About Lorin Jones, The Nowhere City, Imaginary Friends."},{"Title":"The War Between The Tates","review":"This is my favorite novel by Lurie. I love Alison Lurie because she is a genius at studying the psychology of her characters. In this book, both Tates are dissected and their thoughts analyzed, verbalized and explained to full clarity, and this makes them so easy to understand, and therefore to love or hate. My favorite part of the whole book is when Erica starts measuring the pros and cons of something in her head. Lurie is so structured in her analysis, it's almost impossible not to follow her thread. Moreover, this novel analyzes the disintegration of a marriage, and the dynamics and motivations are so universal and so timeless that they can be applied to the 60's or to the 00's alike."},{"Title":"The War Between The Tates","review":"I read this book when I was fifteen, and I was appalled at the heavy-handed way Lurie heaps scorn on virtually ALL the characters. Hippies, academics, and housewives, all seem to rate as easy joke material for her, but she never explains why. I also felt that she comes across as callous and self-righteous in the way she gloats over all the misery her make believe people suffer. If you read a classic like DEAD SOULS by Gogol you see some mean, petty people -- but Gogol doesn't laugh at them for suffering, only for being foolish. Lurie doesn't get how satire works.Getting to the specifics -- a reviewer above made an interesting point. Given that Erica Tate is described (over and over) as a stunning beauty, it is awfully odd that when Brian leaves her the only man she can find to hang out with is uber-dweeb Zed. This guy makes Woody Allen look like Bruce Willis! Similarly, Professor Brian Tate is such a pompous little twerp that it's difficult to imagine even the most depraved and lustful hippie chick throwing herself at him.Lurie knows less than nothing about the Sixties youth culture she intends to \\"satirize.\\" At one point Brian catches his daughter listening to a \\"Stones record\\" and the chorus of the song supposedly goes \\"awah gotcha BOOM BOOM!\\"Listen to every Stones album from \\"England's Newest Hit Makers\\" to \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\" and you will never find this song. Why couldn't the lady have done some homework? Either that or taken five seconds to make up a pretend rock group, perhaps with an oh-so-clever \\"satirical\\" name like the Ugly Brutes or something?Another problem, given that Wendy is supposed to be a nubile hippie chick, and Brian a staid professor, the sex scenes should have been a lot steamier than they were. All things considered, Lurie totally underestimated the hippy generation, its staying power, determination, and so forth. The Stones are still rolling, thirty years later, but no one is reading this book.Awah gotcha BOOM BOOM!"},{"Title":"The War Between The Tates","review":"This book is awful. The characters are one-dimensional, have no self-knowledge whatsoever, and are unbelievably stereotypical. It's not badly written, but it's pointless, depressing, and it's hard to figure out what it all means. Just a bad idea. It's also very badly dated."},{"Title":"Chicken Parents Chicken Schools: Reclaiming Your Influence and Authority","review":"This book comes from a man who is a teacher and parent, succeeding in both halves. It's a relief to find a book that is direct and influencial. I was very satisfied with this book and it's suggestions. Everyone can afford to learn something new."},{"Title":"The Fighters","review":"I was surprised how thorough, well-written, accurate, and interesting a noted British wildlife and conservation author (Colin Willock) was with this World War 2 novel. I learned that the author tried joining the RAF but wasn't able to because of eyesight. Fortunately for us he didn't hide his aircraft interest and knowledge but decided to put it to pen in this 1973 publication. Here are the reasons I really enjoyed this book:-Covers the WW2 air war from 1939-1945 mainly from the perspectives of England, Germany, and somewhat from the USA and others.-Very interesting and balanced characterization of the main characters from England/USA and Germany.-Provides balanced political, military, and citizen beliefs, feelings, and opinions from all sides.-Great story mixture and settings with historic figures and fictional characters.-Accurate depiction and development of WW2 aircraft (trainers, fighters, bombers, jets) from 1939-1945. So much detail for some I'd recommend you have an aircraft identification book while reading the novel. I used \\"Aircraft of World War II\\" by Christ Chant, Brown Packaging Books, 1999. It enhances the story by finding about the aircraft characteristics, armament, speed, color(s), intended purpose(s, etc.-The book helped me have empathy, especially for the innocent citizenry from all countries. Great amount of suffering, hardship, and sacrifice for the human race during the conflict and thereafter.-Portrayal that not all German citizens or military leaders supported or liked the direction Hitler or Facism was taking Germany.-Obvious use of numerous historical sources and personal pilot input in the compilation of this book.-Clever use of author's researcher & secretary (G. Conway)in providing interesting Epilogue and happenings of the principal surviving characters of the book.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this very interesting book and highly recommend it to students, teachers, scholars, historians and readers of WW2 and it's aircraft."},{"Title":"The Fighters","review":"First read this book when it was first publised. Bought it for a friend who lent it to me to read. We both enjoyed this story, which included both sides of the air war during WWII. Reading this book sparked a life long interest in planes and WWII in particular. I especially liked the inclusion of reference to actual characters."},{"Title":"The English Reformation","review":"A.G. Dickens book, the English Reformation, is one of the most influential books on the Reformation ever written, and this fact makes an evaluation very difficult. For Dickens, the Reformation had much less to do with the divorce of Henry VIII than with the corruption and decay of the Catholic Church and the rising expectations of a literate, educated laity. When Protestantism emerged, according to Dickens, it was rapidly taken up by the average Englishmen who was tired of Catholic ritual and hungry for preaching and direct experience of reading Scripture. There was a \\"magnetic process\\" that attracted the English to Protestantism because of its intrinsic merits, something that Dickens argues makes it a viable religion today (81). That Dickens' argument found a warm reception in the twentieth century should come as no surprise, for it made the Reformation not an act of state--imposed by fiat on an unwilling populace--but the natural progression of a literate, rational, hence modernizing society. To make his argument, Dickens relies on varied primary and secondary source material, ranging from parish records, prayer books, to the state papers of Henry VIII, and even the memoirs of a Venetian ambassador in England. However, Dickens' favorite and most problematic source is doubtless John Foxe's propagandistic martyrology, The Acts and Monuments (1563). Foxe an early Protestant who saw first hand the Marian persecutions, recounts the history and the development of the English Church from the time of John Wycliffe through the \\"Marian reaction\\" to Elizabeth I.Dickens shows the English Reformation to be \\"an integral part of the European movement,\\" which was propelled by the new learning of the Renaissance (13). Its emphasis on philology and history revealed the medieval church's estrangement from biblical teaching and, therefore, deviation from the teachings of the purer, early Christian church. According to Dickens, this humanist critique foreshadowed the later criticisms by Lutheran reformers against the \\"superstitious\\" doctrines of the medieval church and the authority of the papacy. The emphasis on history and Scripture inherent in humanism superseded churchly, Aristotelian, scholasticism. Dickens shows that this spirit of reform found a warm reception in England, as the followers of John Wycliffe were already advocating a Bible-based Christianity and denouncing the hierarchical corrupt Catholic Church. That Lollardy was a precursor to the Reformation, according to Dickens, is indisputable, but rampant anti-clericalism among all social classes also contributed to the ground swell of popular sentiment against the Catholic Church.The Catholic Church after all, according to Dickens, was in total decay, which contributed to England's inevitable happy separation. In Dickens, the bishops and higher clergy were secular figures and solely concerned with enriching themselves at the expense of the parishioner: Christian teaching was dismissed and the Catholic administration, \\"hard, mechanical, and institutional\\" (66). The monasteries, once a central part of the vitality of medieval Catholicism, had become \\"an uninspired and lukewarm establishment,\\" secular in nature and a haven for \\"rogues and vagabonds\\" (78-79). Dickens sets this state of the Catholic Church in stark contrast to the emergence of a literate laity imbued with knowledge of the Bible engendered by Lollardy and humanism. This rift between the laity and the Catholic hierarchy is central to Dickens' thesis that Catholicism was as unpopular as it was unedifying and superseded by a popular Protestant Christianity. The machinations of Henry VIII merely began a political process which fulfilled the aspirations inherent in English culture and society since the fourteenth century.The Second Edition of Dickens' book, published in 1989, contains a new chapter (13) and some ameliorations, the most significant being a new section on Thomas More. Despite the revisionist assault directed almost exclusively on this work, Dickens holds his ground that there were long term causes of the Reformation and that the \\"Marian reaction\\" was unpopular. Interestingly, the most damning criticism against him, that he engages in Whig history and accepts too wholeheartedly John Foxe's account of the Reformation, goes unmentioned. Dickens' book, although certainly diminished in stature, is still a significant and powerful explanation of the English Reformation. Paradoxically, because of the revisionist onslaught, Dickens book is still relevant to the ongoing discussion of the English Reformation."},{"Title":"The English Reformation","review":"Groundbreaking for its use of local evidence (wills, church records, etc), Dickens' thesis has since been convincingly overturned. His argument that \\"A multitude of nagging testamentary and tithe causes, lay resentment against the moral jurisdiction and the heavy probate fees of the church courts, the rise of lay education, humanist biblical criticism,... the declining reputation of the Roman Curia... and many more [influences] had created before the meeting of the Reformation Parliament an atmosphere little short of explosive..\\" (p. 326) fell at the hands of Revisionists like Eamon Duffy (see his The Stripping of the Alters, 1992, and Fires of Faith, 2009).Dickens work is too Protestant triumphalist to be taken seriously today. For example, on the martyrs of Mary Tudor's reign, he wrote that they had \\"a wealth of human fortitude, of \`civil courage', of adherence to mere principle which the English in their history have seldom found a comparable chance to display\\". (p. 271) Who needs that much artificial sweetener?If you want a balanced, well-written, up-to-date narrative of the Reformation during the Tudor period utilizing the latest research, try Alec Ryrie's \\"The Age of Reformation.\\" (2009)"},{"Title":"The English Reformation","review":"Dicken's work on the ENglish reformation has been re-worked and in essense overuled. But, it it and always will be a classic. Dicken's does a fantastic job at covering Henry VIII's reformation, and the detail is incredibly dense. However, I do wish his tiny section on Mary I's reign would have been expanded. It is just a short little snipet on the Marian reign, and I think he could have expanded it. However, I think Dicken's was more concerned about the reformed religious groups rather than the catholics. But, the marriage between Mary and Philip certainly opens windows for the many problems during Elizabeth's reign.Overall, its a great book for information on the ENglish reformation, but many of his ideas have been redone by modern scholars and challenged many of the once held views by Dickens. No, I will not jot all them down with a list of recent scholars writing against Dicken's. Im not being paid for this review, so it will suffice for me to say that the work is a classic, and I would also read it with some modern works in sight."},{"Title":"The English Reformation","review":"Although this was not one of my tutor's recommended &quot;books to buy&quot; I have bought it anyhow. Although Dickens' descriptions of The English Reformation are, at times, simplistic, this book is invaluable for gaining an overview of what was going on during the period. I recommend it to any college student, as a springboard to more weightier tomes."},{"Title":"The English Reformation","review":"Closer to 3.5 stars.To learn that the English Reformation had its own history rather than one piggybacking off of that of Germany and France is invaluable. The examination of characters such as Wycliffe, the Lollards, and other precursors to the Reformation was great.I understand that the type of research Dickens did concerning land ownership, wills, etc. is not exactly stimulating to read about, but I wish he would have written in a slightly more enjoyable manner."},{"Title":"Computer Analysis and Qualitative Research (New Technologies for Social Research series)","review":"Nice! What a nice share of experience... interviewing CAQDAS users was the best way to warn the reader from computing pitfalls. Unfortunately, this book differs widely from the previous issue (published in 1991 and collecting useful papers)... In one word, this book must be read by CAQDAS users."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"The first forms of multicellular, complex life formed about 600 million years ago and left fossils first discovered near the Ediacaran Hills in Australia. Hence they are called the Ediacarans. Since their discovery in 1946 little has been written for the lay reader about these early forms of life. Mark McMenamin's Garden of Ediacaria is one of the few books to cover the subject. For that reason alone the reader interested in the history of early life on earth should read it. The scientific facts are presented and the history of their discovery is explained. No other source of this information is readily available to the non-scientist.The book is, however, both pedantic and annoying. McMenamin's personal role in the discoveries and the importance of his work is explained in intrusive detail. The book is almost a diary that should have been titled &quot;Ediacarans: My Success In The Science Of Paleobiology.&quot; For example, to understand the Ediacarans we really don't need to see photos of McMenamin's identification card or hotel in Namibia or read about his travel plans on fossil hunting expeditions.Worst of all McMenamin's basic theses about the Ediacarans begin to get lost in the somewhat confused narrative of his personal history. Ultimately the book leaves the reader with the impression that the real story of the Ediacarans is only about 100 pages long, but McMenamin needed 250 pages to satisfy his publisher, so he filled in with a lot of unnecessary &quot;history.&quot;Cut to half its length this book could tell a clear and fascinating story of the earliest multicelled life and their discovery. I suggest that the reader quickly skim the protracted personal stories and concentrate on the sections describing the Ediacaran biota. Read that way, the book is interesting and well worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"Although I've only given it two stars (I decided to be more charitable and give it three stars), I'm not sorry I bought the book (used), because it is the only popular book available on this fascinating subject.The \\"travelogue\\" or biographical information didn't bother me much. It's fairly standard in popular science writing, because the non-scientific challenges of field work in remote and exotic (to Western readers, anyway) locations is interesting to the lay public. (See, for example, Peter Ward's book Gorgon, which I think strikes a better balance between personal detail and the scientific story.) However, I agree with some of the critics in thinking that McMennamin overdoes it with his extended digressions on Namibian history and the evolution of German aircraft. Some of his diary entries are overlong and could have been summarized in a few sentences. The space taken up by these digressions and diary entries could have been devoted to more photos and high-quality illustrations, and to a more detailed discussion of the evidence supporting his conclusions. The author does a better job focusing on the science in the second half of the book.What most bothered me in this book was the author's 9th inning invocation of neovitalism to explain parallel or convergent evolution, which seemed to come out of left field (to continue the baseball metaphor). It appears to me to be based on rather thin evidence: the very termite-like social organization of naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber), and the similar adaptations of distantly related desert plants. The naked mole rat example seems exceptional and coincidental. If vitalism was at work in evolution, I'd expect more widespread termite-like eusociality in fossorial vertebrates and the close but non-fossorial relatives of naked mole rats. The example of convergence in desert plants seems to me adequately explained by the extremity of the environment limiting the range of possible adaptations that will work. Only those organisms that come up with successful adaptations will survive in the desert, another form of contingency. McMennamin should consider writing another book more fully making the case that natural selection cum evo-devo cum self-organizing criticality (call it neo-neo-Darwinism) needs help from any sort of vitalism."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"The Ediacaran fossils are an interesting chapter in the history of life. They are also an interesting chapter in &quot;The Garden Of Ediacara.&quot; Unfortunately, this book appears to have more material in it about Mark McMenamin than it does about the subject matter. Is it truly necessary to show a photograph of a hotel in Namibia or the author's official Mexican fieldwork badge in order to discuss the first complex life forms? I don't think so. The reader truly has to pick and choose what paragraphs to read in order to learn about Ediacaran fossils as opposed to the author's travelogues. Much of the material is simply extraneous. Proper editing would have made this book much more interesting and pleasurable."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"The Garden of Ediacara reads like a 295-page Valentine card written by Mark A. S. McMenamin to Mark A. S. McMenamin. I have never seen such egotistic indulgence in a work which claims to be a scientific treatise. Nor have I ever seen an author cite his own (rather ordinary) words in a chapter epigraph! Where the reader might have enjoyed a color photo of an Ediacaran animal, he or she is treated instead to a color photo of Mark A. S. McMenamin's identification card. This is like showing the reader your driver's license (by the way it happens to have a photograph of Mark A. S. McMenamin's face on it). Columbia Press really let its guard down and this thing will take its rightful place as an awkward sore, much like the writings of Wilhelm Reich of &quot;orgone energy&quot; fame."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"I'm still puzzling over how this one got through the editors at Columbia. The Ediacaran fauna represents a fascinating piece of evolutionary history, and a popular-press work on it would be a great help for students in understanding how the scientific study of evolution works. It could also give an insight into the mind of a scientist. It's a shame that this book does not fit the bill. Other reviewers have covered most of the shortcomings (although they missed my favourite gem - we now know the name of his parents' realtor), but I think the thrust of several reviews, that there is something worthwhile at the end to reward one's wading through the extraneous filler that comprises the majority of the book, is misleading. The meat of the work alluded to by other reviewers dissolves into a very loose presentation of neovitalism that does little more than take away from the author's credibility. I would like to see his scientific ideas presented lucidly, with better editing this time, and then the book could perhaps be of use. Until then, if you want a look at a quirky (but endearing) scientist doing evolution science, read Darwin's Dreampond. For a good popular look at evolution, try Carl Zimmer's \\"Evolution\\" or Mayr's \\"What Evolution Is.\\""},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"McMenamin takes up where Dolf Seilacher left off in theorizing that the Ediacara (precursors to the animals of the Cambrian explosion) were in fact a separate experiment in body plan, distinct from both plants and animals. He goes so far as to suggest that they may have independently developed nervous systems and sense organs. If McMenamin is right he is presenting evidence for the independent development of intelligence in more than one evolutionary lineage. Such a finding would have profound implications to our understanding of our place in the universe. Unfortunately, I didn't find his arguments very convincing. Seilacher has made a good case for the Ediacara having a unique and tough body plan unlike that of subsequent animals. Some Ediacara do show organs that may be heads--but to assert this is not to assert that they were heads, that they had nervous systems or sense organs. There may be plenty of other sensible explanations for Ediacaran body plans. We j! ust don't have evidence either way. As to the debate about whether the Ediacara were precursors of Cambrian animals or a separate line, there is no reason why they could not have been a separate evolutionary line; the fact that Ediacaran fossils are preserved in sediments that wouldn't preserve Cambrian-type organisms or soft-bodied creatures like worms suggests that a parallel development of animals with Ediacarans was possible, but simply isn't recorded. This is a very intriguing book, and obviously a very political one, designed to land like a bomb in the middle of the debate about Ediacara. As such I think readers should read it with some skepticism, bearing in mind that the Ediacara are almost the last virgin territory for evolutionary biologists to stake fundamental claims. If McMenamin is right it's groundbreaking stuff--but it's way too early to say."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"I have read the book nearly twice and each time close it with a deep sense of disappointment. The problem I have with the story is the personal observation and biographical material. I wanted to read about Ediacaran animals NOT the namibian airport, recalcitrant gatekeepers and inane diary entries about who the author had dinner with. Some of the book could have been taken up with more photos and perhaps professional sketches and not the crayon drawings from Mrs Thompson's second grade class.The ideas the author presents on the fauna are what made me get through the book at all. Those were great but occupy very little of the book."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"Disappointing reading. There is some interesting information here, but it is mostly at the end. Before you find it though, you have to go thru a lot of personal anecdotes in tedious detail and other interjections of questionable relevance. A pity, because some of the ideas and explanation seemed good, but in need of fuller treatment."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"In my experience, scientists are a modest lot. Unfortunately, some science popularists seem to have an ego the size of all outdoors. However, if you have the patience to battle your way through the I said..., I did..., I am..., then McMenamin's book contains a few interesting snippets for anyone interested in the Vendian biota.Alternatively, you could read Chapter 3 of &quot;Major Events in the History of Life&quot; (Ed. by J. William Schopf and available from Amazon) in which Bruce Runnegar writes about the fossils (rather than about Bruce Runnegar.)"},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"The author makes the hypothesis that Edicaran fauna are distinct from other multicellular animals and that they underwent a different type of embryological development. The book presents no real scientific test of these ideas. Instead appeals to over extended analogies and conjecture."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"Other reviewers here have been about right, though none has mentioned McMenamin's most brilliant conception, which is that Ediacaran body plans could be derived if development were highly directional, unlike in animal embryos. Unidirectional development yields something wormlike, development in four directions gives something like a buttercup blossom. I can think of no way to pursue this idea further, but it seems a plausible distinction between Ediacaran near-animals and animals. As for McMenamin's discussion of neovitalism, I couldn't understand a word of it. There were a couple of factual errors. Writing about German Southwest Africa, McMenamin said that Bismarck had \`\`decided'' it was time to have colonies. Bismarck never wanted the German Empire to have colonies, as any student of 19th century European politics would know. McMenamin's excursion into Urantia is a bit more troublesome. He says Urantia (a holy book that purports to have been revealed by gods) foretold reconstructions of Ediacaran conditions decades before scientists worked them out, and wonders how they did it. He does not understand that the common folk often adopt ideas scientists first reject (examples, evolution before Darwin, continental drift before plate tectonics), and only later come to accept. In this case, continental drift is the key. \`\`The Urantia Book'' was dictated by a Chicago insurance agent in the 1930s. The \`\`scientific'' chapters were drawn from articles in the Sunday supplements -- where continental drift was a commonplace 30 years before geologists were persuaded of the reality of plate tectonics. The Urantia story has been researched in mind-numbing detail by Martin Gardner, and it is very surprising McMenamin did not find Gardner's work, probably the only critique of Urantia ever published."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"Reading this book was a real delight. McMenamin weaves his personal experiences in the field with a fascinating account of his quest to solve the problem of the Ediacara fossils - just what were they, animals, or some other multicellular organism or perhaps a mixture of both? This book is well documented so the reader can follow up the argument from primary sources. For me there is nothing more intellectually stimulating than a following a debate on the cutting edge of science with the underlying philosophical issues fully discussed. This book is an exemplar of science writing at its best. I am in complete sympathy with McMenamin's support of the concept of evolutionary directionality driven by both internal and external factors. In particular, the author views encephalization as a biological attractor. Whole new research programs should follow from this book."},{"Title":"The Garden of Ediacara","review":"The Garden of Ediacara is the only book I know of which is devoted to these early mutlicellular organisms. The book is fairly well written and deals with a number of questions about these early organsisms. Among these questions are; the feeding habits of the organisms, their early development, their relationship (or lack of it) to modern animals, their development and mode of reproduction, their extinction, and the possibility that they evolved a simple central nervous system. Several of the chapters in this book could be better written and also contribute little towards the understanding of these organisms. This seriously detracts from the book. The end of the book deals with the question of whether or not evolution is random and makes for interesting reading. It contradicts S. J. Gould's contention that evolutionary sucess is heavily dependent on random factors. As this is the only book about the Ediacara and it's mostly well written, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Captured Hearts, Five Favorite Love Stories: Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know/ The Antagonists/ Buried Treasure/ Fathers and Daughters/ Precious Rogue","review":"The stories are good, but have all been published before.

But actually, not in this case. For once, I seem to have stumbled across an anthology in which the individual novellas are all very readable, enjoyable, and which suit the format of a shorter length. This is particularly surprising in the case of this anthology, in which all stories are about 70 pages long.Three of my favourite writers are in this five-author anthology, which might have contributed to my enjoyment - but then Putney and Layton's novellas are not set in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century England, which is the setting I'm used to from them.There is something of a theme to the collection, in that four out of five stories concern men who are or who appear to be rogues, and who reform right under the heroine's nose. MJP's contribution, set in Texas a hundred or so years ago, sees a condemned man being taken to hang for murder. Along the way, a young woman - who, it turns out, might have good reason to hate him - takes pity on him and they spend one unforgettable night together. But he's condemned to die, so how can they have a future?Joan Wolf, an author I've never encountered before, sets her story, The Antagonists, in Regency England; the hero and heroine are cousins who grew up together. I would normally have wanted much more to this story, but Wolf uses an interesting technique. The story is told in first person, from the heroine's POV. And since Dinah starts off by telling us how spoilt and nasty her cousin Thorn (the Earl of Thornton) is, we're led off on quite a misleading track. (Although Dinah does reveal that she has a tendency to exaggerate!)Layton's contribution, Buried Treasure, was the disappointment in this collection for me. A pirate narrowly survives a murder attempt and recovers in the house of a beautiful young woman whose seduction he plots. Unfortunately, for reasons related to both his behaviour towards her and to his fellow pirates, I couldn't come to like Dancer at all, and wouldn't want to re-read this novella.Next was Patricia Rice, also new to me; her tale, Fathers and Daughters, covers the well-worn subject-matter of an impoverished suitor who was turned away by the heroine's father. Carolyn also believes that Jack accepted money from her father to walk away from her. Now that he's back, can he possibly convince her that he wasn't only interested in her money, and that he wasn't paid to reject her?Finally, Mary Balogh's Precious Rogue. This is a lovely story, told with Balogh's great skill; Patricia, the poor relation who is effectively her aunt's slave, has no great opinion of her cousin's suitor, Mr Bancroft. After all, the man is an unprincipled rake, and - although no-one else seems to notice - during Patricia's aunt's house party Bancroft conducts clandestine affairs with at least three women. But what Patricia can't ignore is the fact that he is *nice* to her. And she enjoys their verbal fencing... too much for her own good. After all, he's going to marry her cousin...This one is certainly worth a look."},{"Title":"Benjamin Banneker (Black Americans of achievement)","review":"Inside Benjamin Banneker: Scientist and Mathematician lies many secrets of the life of one of the 18th centuries most accomplished black Americans. To find out more about this man, read the book by Kevin Conley. The book is all about the life of Benjamin Banneker, an 18th century free black American who wrote almanacs and was an original surveyor of Washington D.C. I would recommend this book to any Americans who wanted to learn more about the people involved with the history of their country.This book being a biography, I feel that I must review my thoughts on the man being written about. Benjamin Banneker was a very important man of our country, and this book does him justice. He was a man of many accomplishments, and none of them were easy to come by. He had to manage a tobacco farm and complete astronomy calculations all while trying to get his almanac published.He was a hard worker, and that is why I admire him.One aspect of the book that I was really impressed with was the way the author used vivid vocabulary in just the right spots. He described everyhitng that was important with enhanced vocabulary and detail. An example of this would be when the author was describing the detail of Mr. Bannekers work he would use phrases like \\"nearly incomprehensible\\" or \\"mind boggling\\". The vocabulary in this book made it much more interesting than it would have been if it had not been used so well.I think that the author of this book did Mr. Banneker the justice he deserved. He includes all of the major things that Banneker accomplished in his life and really makes it feel like you know him. He included many helpful visuals and pictures of Mr. Banneker's work, which really made the reader understand how hard the things he was doing were.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about one of the great people that lived before them.

This book details the immense hardship in the Reichkommisariat Ukraine ruled by the \\"brutal dog\\" Erich Koch. It gives many examples of Ukrainians being executed for the smallest reasons like having a knife or looking like a 'bandit'. The chapter of starvation in Kiev is eye opening as most people don't know the starvation that effected occupied Soviet cities and large towns due to economic exploitation and stealing by the German occupiers. The chapters dealing with the elimination of the Jews, Roma, and POW's are poignant. Another reason why this book is great is the author's great sympathy for the Ukrainian people who in the west are all regarded as Nazis. The truth of the fact is that 20% of Ukrainians died as a result of Nazi rule or at the front fighting in the Red Army. Also few books deal with the sufferings of the Slavic peoples of the Soviet Union who were considered Untermenschen (subhumans) by the Germans. This book is well worth it if you want to know the tremendous suffering of the Soviet peoples in their Great Patriotic War."},{"Title":"Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule","review":"Harvest of Despair; Life and Death in Ukraine Under Nazi RuleKarel BerkhoffBelknap PressThe history of Ukraine is a tangled web of invasion, exploitation, and, despite it all, hope. As you drive through the Ukrainian countryside, you can see monuments to the \\"Great Patriotic War\\" and most major cities have more than one memorial to the Soviet citizens who defended their homeland against the Nazi invaders who planned on re-making Ukraine into a German agricultural colony.Karel Berkhoff's Harvest of Despair is an attempt to look at the Nazi plans for the occupied Ukraine and Ukrainian reaction to them. In every sense, the Ukrainian people were caught between a rock and a hard place- the two choices left to them were Hitler's Nazis or the Stalin's Soviet Union. Berkhoff's narrative places the Ukrainian choices into context, explaining why the two choices were variously chosen, and why, in the end, both proved inadequate.When the Nazi's first invaded Ukraine in June, 1941, many welcomed the Germans as liberators. Indeed, the treatment that the Ukrainian peasantry received under Stalin's collectivization plan and engineered famine would make almost any alternative seem attractive. Coupled with the lack of good information about Nazi rule in other parts of Europe and the almost total collapse of Soviet defenses, Germany seemed a ray of hope. That hope was soon dashed as the nature of Nazi rule manifested itself.The Nazis planned on making Ukraine an agricultural colony to be populated by \\"Germanic\\" people. The Slavic Ukrainian people, by definition inferior according to Nazi ideology, were at best an impediment to these plans. The Ukrainians were tolerated insomuch as there were economically useful to the Nazi regime. Peasants, who produced food in abundance, were allowed to survive, albeit with the ever-present danger of forced labor in Germany or summary execution. City dwellers, especially those who were not deemed economically useful were expected to starve, which they did by the thousands.The brutality of the Nazi regime, whether revealed in the mass execution of the local Jewish populations, the summary executions under the most flimsy of pretexts, or the conditions suffered by those in forced labor in Germany, soon soured the Ukrainians to the prospect of their \\"liberation.\\" But the Ukrainians found themselves as powerless in the face of Nazi power as they did under the Soviets. That there was resistance at all, be it evading work to sheltering Jews, is remarkable in a society where resistance to authority was swiftly and severely punished, regardless of the regime.Berkhoff organized Harvest of Despair thematically, which allows the reader to \\"spiral\\" their knowledge into a coherent whole after reading the entire work, while allowing each chapter to stand alone if necessary. One item that would have been useful to the general reader would be an explanation of the German military and civilian terms in greater detail. Comparisons with other Nazi occupied territory would have also been useful as context. Whether the Ukrainian experience was typical or not would help the general reader understand the extent in which Ukraine suffered, before, during, and after the occupation. Harvest of Despair is a well researched and written treatment of this horrible chapter of history."},{"Title":"Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule","review":"This remarkable and harrowing book is a study of the Nazis' genocidal rule over the Ukraine from 1941 to 1944, which killed 4.1 million people. Hitler's view was, \\"The destruction of the major Russian cities is a prerequisite for the permanence of our power in Russia.\\" Erich Koch, Reichskommissar for Ukraine, aimed to \`smash Ukrainian industry and drive the proletariat back to the country'. Berkhoff describes what he calls the Nazis' \`genocidal massacre' of Soviet POWs.He points out that by contrast, the Soviet authorities appealed to \`the self-esteem, independence, and trustworthiness of ordinary people'.Appallingly, elements in Ukrainian society collaborated with the Nazi occupier. Orthodox Church leaders in the Ukraine condemned not the Holocaust but \`Jewish-Bolshevism'. A Ukrainian Nationalist leaflet of 1941 said, \\"Moscow, Poland, the Hungarians, Jewry are your enemies. Destroy them.\\" Ukrainian nationalist leaders admitted that the Ukrainian Insurgent Army policy was to \`exterminate Ukraine's national minorities'. In 1943, Ukrainians killed more than 15,000 Poles living in the Ukraine.Berkhoff sums up, \\"the Nazi regime in the \`East' was driven by the Nazi conviction that Ukraine was, or should become, a clean national minorities' slate for the German people. ... This extreme German nationalism combined with anti-Bolshevism, anti-Semitism, and a racist view of the \`Russians', and the results were terror, murder, massacre, and genocide.\\"In his book on the Ukraine, Harvest of Sorrow, the Foreign Office propagandist (and Thatcher speech-writer) Robert Conquest had devoted just one sentence to this genocidal Nazi occupation, calling it \`a period between two waves of Red Terror'.But Berkhoff concludes more accurately, \\"never before in the history of Ukraine did so many social and ethnic groups suffer so much during one period.\\""},{"Title":"Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule","review":"The author does a good job of academically analyzing the Nazi Rule of Ukraine. He depicts the initial joy of the German invasion followed by the killing of the Jews, Roma, and POWs, forced starvation of the city dwellers, limited employment of civilians and the generally repressive rule of the German authorities. Indeed, if the Germans were on their best behavior and treated the locals correctly, the local population would have brought them over to their side. However, the Germans and their rule forced to look at the starving thirties with nostalgia. Ukrainians switched sides and fought for the Red Army, partisans, and the nationalists. This arrogance by the Germans and their thoughts of the master race just may have cost them the war.This is an OK book. I think the author tried to appeal to the academic audience for this book and sacrificed the general readership. The book sheds light on why the Germans lost the support of the Ukrainian population through their tactics and inhumanity. When a population bloodied by Stalin preferred his leadership to that of the Nazis, a small part of the war in the East was decided. For this reason, WWII historians should read this book."},{"Title":"Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule","review":"Karel C. Berkhoff has written an outstanding contribution to the 20th century/WW II history of the borderland battleground of the Ukraine. Ordinary life is dissected under an expert historian's scalpel, straightforwardly presenting the gruesome facts of Nazi rule for ordinary people without the need for Robert Conquest's statistical chicanery, or Timothy Snyder's heavy-handed polemics.I will take issue, though, when Berkhoff quotes German military administrators writing of the locals wishing \\"for a German victory in their hearts.\\" This is rather the wishful self-delusion common to all conquering armies, soon turning into violent disillusion. The \\"Uncle Tom\\" cheering and smiling were the tools of everyday survival for peasant populations, in avoiding trouble with whomever installed himself as master of their house: \\"the slave sees the master but the master never sees the slave,\\" as the saying goes. Some of these welcoming Ukrainian masses were, in a few years, to be vengefully raping and looting on the streets of Berlin to express the true contents of their hearts. At the same time, I recognize the ambiguity inherent in enduring such situations: my wife's mother, growing up in southwest Russia close to this area, recalls armed German soldiers bursting into their izba with drawn weapons; yet by the end of the occupation they \\"got along\\" with their occupiers and she still practices German.Berkhoff details the \\"little\\" genocides along with the major holocaust: the liquidation of the Roma, the deliberate starvation of the POW camps and cities, and the elimination of ethnic Poles in the western provinces - this by Ukrainian \\"patriots,\\" who conducted their own race war between the lines to ensure Poland could have no further claim to this region. Here we see Timothy Snyder's convenient lines between victims and victimizers realistically smudged, as the OUN-UPA ruled with a reign of terror that would have done Hitler or Stalin proud. I disagree when Berkhoff states that all these people were liquidated for what they were doing: in fact, they didn't have to do anything. Simply being of the \\"wrong blood\\" was a death sentence in itself. The accusations were mere rationalization.Also interesting was his brief description on the psychology of looting (p. 34). This would explain its prevalence through the history of war, from Atlanta to Baghdad. In fact, the overall German experience in Ukraine has more than a faint echo of the US occupation of Iraq, without the most egregious atrocity. Also bringing an ironic smile were Berkhoff's reproduction of German propaganda posters, on page 121 and especially 214: the liberated people look through the broken wall to glimpse the European plentitude beckoning beyond. So suspiciously parallel is this to cold war propaganda that I suspect a similar authorship. It's not that they \\"didn't know\\" of Nazi means and methods - the Soviet media was full of anti-fascist atrocity stories - but that they chose to ignore it precisely because it was official propaganda. Only when the invaders' rule was a reality could they then judge its merits. (One might wonder if the Ukrainian people also feel duped on this go-around of Western liberation.)Overall a good focus on hell as lived at a certain time in a not-so-small place."},{"Title":"Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule","review":"This book is better that I have read on the everyday life (it would be better to say the daily terror) in the lands occupied by the Germans.The entire scorn for the human life, the collaboration of all the Germans in the slaughters, all, the Wermacht, the police men and the colonists, made difficult to consider the German human beings and it is surprising that the Russians were not doing the same when they occupied Germany.The author treats horrible topics, the slaughter of the Jews the starvation for famine of the cities, the mortal vans that were gassing its occupants, the genocide of the Russian prisoners: more than three millions!, the Poles' slaughters for the Ukrainian nationalists and vice versa. A compendium of horror but explained good and from a very neutral point of view.Sometimes five stars remain short for a book and this is the case."},{"Title":"Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule","review":"This Dutch historian discusses such relatively-familiar events as the Soviet famine-genocide of Ukrainians, the scorched-earth policies of both the retreating Soviets and Germans, deportations of Ukrainians for forced labor, imposed Nazi hunger (p. 45), etc. The German occupation cost the lives of at least 1 million people of all nationalities in the Reichskommissariat Ukraine alone. (p. 307).As for Ukrainians and Jews, \\"Both factions of the OUN were anti-Semitic themselves, and wartime documents with regard to leading Banderites show that during the German invasion, they wanted the Jews, or at least Jewish males, killed, and that they were willing to participate in the process.\\" (p. 83, 348; see also p. 288, 429).Berkhoff then elaborates on the little-known OUN-UPA genocide of Poles (pp. 286-300). Soviet partisan leader Strokach said that the UPA has, \\"...the aim of totally destroying the Poles in Ukraine.\\" (p. 287, 428). Berkhoff also quotes a fascinating letter, by SB-leader Vasyl Makar, who describes the \\"action to destroy the Poles\\" which had \\"not produced the expected results\\". (p. 287, 428). What further proof is needed for genocide? The fact that all Poles weren't killed wasn't from the UPA not trying!Unfortunately, Berkhoff cites secondary sources that grossly underestimate the Polish victims. (p. 286, 427). In actuality, detailed village-by-village compilations (Siemaszko and Siemaszko for Volyn, and Komanski for the Tarnopol area) alone record over 45,000 Polish deaths. Owing to the fact that their coverage is spotty, and then only applicable to a fraction of the relevant overall geographic area, the actual number of Poles murdered by the OUN-UPA genocide is easily in the 150,000-300,000 range. Berkhoff also errs in implying that Taras Czuprynka (Roman Shukhevych) ended the killings. (pp. 298-299). To the contrary, there exists a document in which Skukhevych called for the speeding-up of the destruction of Polish villages prior to the arrival of the Red Army.Berkhoff is perceptive in realizing that the Polish killing of Ukrainians near Zamosc-Kholm (Chelm), often used as a pretext for the OUN-UPA genocide of Poles, will not do. It was neither indiscriminate, nor remotely commensurate, nor even \\"initial\\". He writes: \\"Here too, the complaints of the main aggressor had some validity. Polish underground activists had been murdering Ukrainian leading figures in the Lublin district since at least May 1942, and Polish partisans (which had grown in number after a Nazi campaign to expel peasants) assaulted police stations, which were manned by Ukrainians. But Ukrainian policemen there had been killing Poles, and overall the events were more complex than the Banderites would like to admit.\\" (p. 293). Berkhoff also understands the fact that Volhynian Poles siding with Germans against Ukrainians was a response to, not provocation of, the OUN-UPA genocide against Poles, and that it seemed much larger than it actually was because of the involvement of Germans who spoke Polish (Silesian Germans, Volksdeutsche, etc.)(p. 294).Finally, Ukrainians also suffered from the UPA. (pp. 297-298). There were massive killings of suspected traitors, draconian terror against even minor peasant disobedience, grudge-killings, increasingly-onerous restrictions and levies of goods, etc."},{"Title":"Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule","review":"This beautifully researched book should help substitute some well-documented scholarship for the acrimonious debates that have raged since the conclusion of World War II. Some of these debates upon which the book sheds light: Was Ukraine victim of Nazi aggression or its collaborator? Did Eastern and Western Ukraine experience cardinally different occupation policies? Did Eastern and Western Ukrainians both welcome the German invasion of 1941 and for what reasons? Did the two parts of the country develop different defense mechanisms against German policies? How did the common people react to initial promises, and how did they react later to the actual policies of exploitation and starvation of Ukrainian urban centers? Did the two factions of the OUN develop different strategies of dealing with the occupation? Did Eastern Ukrainians welcome OUN workers to mitigate Nazi excesses? Did the differing schools of thought among the Nazi hierarchy itself - that is, Koch versus Rosenberg, et al - in dealing with Ukrainians have much impact? Did the de facto on-the-ground changes in policy come too late?Much in the book is especially relevant today - as the debates flare up again - and could, for example, help explain the radically different views Western Ukrainians and Eastern Ukrainians take toward the OUN and the UPA.

There is nothing like getting attention from your enemies. Mr. Berkhoff's book only confirms the importance of the documentary film, even as it sets out to castigate, once again, the Ukrainian people as anti-semitic nazi sympathizers and collaborators. While a number of individulas did engage in deplorable anti-Jewish activities, the insinuations that Ukrainians and others as people, as an ethnic group are somehow guilty and even, as Morley Safer once put it on \\"60 Minutes\\", \\"genetically anti-smitic\\", is totally irresponsible and unacceptable.

I read the 2nd Edition which is not as updated as the one for sale now, it only went up through 1989 which things were looking very good for the craft.It has a good balance of technical vs. stories so the non-pilot will never be bored. The sheer number of innovations on the machine are fascinating to hear about and how it's competitors all failed to be built with the exception of the TU-144 which was its own horrorshow. Most interesting fact: they did NOT test a two-engine failure at Mach 2 because the same type of testing crashed two American B-58 Hustlers and they knew that loss of a single test article would mean the end of the program. I did enjoy learning the stories behind the FUD campaign (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) with respect to SST engine noise and sonic booms which were two things the public did not know the difference about."},{"Title":"Flying Concorde","review":"The Concorde flies from New York to London New York to ParisWashington,D.C. to London Washington,D.C. to Paris.Air France/British Airways. they use the Concorde on the set of The Concorde Airport 79."},{"Title":"Life Smiles Back","review":"The other reviewers are right about the humor and charm of these photos.However, in LIFE magazine they were full page, and beautifully printed which enhanced their impact.

This book explores their background and history. In the first chapter, Cotterill exmines the pre-contact migrations of the Siouian, Algonquian and Muskogean Nations and their village lifestyles, cultures and government. This sets the stage for their early meetings with the English colonists, and after the Revolutionary War, the Americans as well. Several chapters go into the gradual decline of the southern Nations as they found more and more of their lands claimed by Euro-American settlers who saw today's Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississipi and the Carlonias as valuable real estate.Several historical figures and events are mentioned, such as Alexander McGillivray (Creek leader who sought an alliance with Spain against the state of Georgia), Tecumseh (the Shawnee war leader who sought to unify the Indians against Euro-American settlers) and the Creek Wars. After the Creek Wars, the book focuses an entire chapter on the beginnings of Indian Removal in 1820 which would ultimately culminate in the Trail of Tears, Andrew Jackson's forced (and illegal) deportation of the Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole from their homelands in the Southeast to &quot;Indian Territory&quot; (Oklahoma).It then has a further chapter focusing on how the Southern Indians changed and adapted in the fifty years afterwards, in dress, culture, dwellings, education, language and religion. The final chapter covers 1825-1830, the final removal of the Southern Nations. It focuses on the struggles (both physical and in court) that the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and especially Seminole faced with being relocated to reservations and ultimately the Trails of Tears, in which Andrew Jackson (illegally; the Cherokee won against him in court but he ignored that ruling) deported members of the Five Nations from their homelands in the south to Indian Territory (today's Oklahoma).This is really a nice, scholarly book for understanding the history of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast. It is particularly nice as it focuses on a specific timeframe (from English contact to 1830) and a specific area (the traditional homelands in the Southeast), so the focus is much more specific than it could be otherwise. My only criticism of this book is that information on the Seminole is fairly scant. Still, this is an excellent book for pure history of any of the Nations in the Southeast and if you are studying Native American history or culture, I strongly recommend this book and others in the series."},{"Title":"Psychology of Consciousness: Psych Consciousness & Reaching Full Potential Pkg.","review":"Want to know what psychologists, rather than philosophers, have to say about consciousness?

Allison Tholl has. She drove away from the man that loved her. She put more into her job at the University than into her relationship with Paul Walker. It's been a year since they parted and she would give anything to go back in time and make things right. She wouldn't be so selfish or so blind to everything but getting tenure. She wouldn't have rejected his proposal or had the horrible argument that followed. As she walks along the beach where they held hands for the last time, Allison is oblivious to the storm that is moving in. Her thoughts are filled with if only's and a wish for a second chance. Her inattention is costly as she is struck by lightening.The next thing Allison hears is Paul's voice asking her if she is okay. Is this real or is she hallucinating? Somehow, the storm has thrown her back in time to the very night that she and Paul broke up. Allison has her second chance. Will Allison make the correct choices this time? Will this alternate reality last or will she wake up alone and heartbroken once again?Electrical Storm by Isabella Jordan is a story of second chances. Allison has an opportunity that most people only dream about. The chance to change that one big mistake you made, that you would give anything to do over, if only you could. Allison knows what her future holds without Paul and she doesn't like what she sees. Paul loves Allison, but he isn't willing to be put last in her life. They have a passionate relationship, but he wants more. He isn't afraid to put it all on the line for love.I liked the fact that Allison knows she made the wrong choice and does not put the blame on anyone other than herself. She takes responsibility for it. She grows from her mistake and it makes her stronger. Strong enough to let go of the things she considered obstacles to her relationship. Allison learns what is important: that love is something no one can live without. Electrical Storm is a well-written, enlightening story with twists and turns in the plot that I enjoyed. I recommend it for anyone who's ever wanted a second chance.Waiting For YouColleen O'Leary's day has gone from bad to worse. It's not bad enough that she's late for her new boss' party, but when she stops to ask for directions, she stumbles across an assault. While she helps the other woman get away, the would-be attacker turns his attention to Colleen. The mysterious man is much more dangerous than she thinks. He is no ordinary man; he is a vampire, and Colleen is the reincarnation of his lost love, Eileen, who was murdered 200 years ago.Vampire, Sean Farrell, has been searching for Regan Sheehan, the vampire who killed his lover for almost 200 years. When he finally gets her in his grip, who should come to her rescue, but the one she destroyed centuries ago. Talk about ironic. Now that he's found Colleen again, he is determined to reawaken her memories, and make her fall in love with him again. Sean has waited for over 200 years for this chance. He's not about to lose her for a second time. He will use every trick he knows, including all of his seductive powers, to reach the memories locked inside of Colleen's mind. A course of events is put in motion that will either bring Colleen her soul mate or her death.Waiting for You by Isabella Jordan is love story that shows true love never dies. Sean is a tall, dark, and dangerous character, who is also loaded with plenty of seductive punch. Colleen's character has to overcome fear of the unknown, and believe in not only that vampires do exist, but also in reincarnation. The seduction of Colleen's mind, heart and body is a major part of the story, and is well done. The sexual chemistry between Sean and Colleen is fierce and intensely erotic. Waiting for You drew me in from the first page and never let up! The story develops quickly and maintains the reader's interest with an interesting and twisting plot. I am partial to vampires and Sean is one seriously hot hunk! Waiting for You is definitely on my keeper list.DeliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Introduction To Fortran 90/95 (B.E.S.T.

Since those usually discuss languages like C, C++ and Java. But when it comes to raw number crunching, and where a GUI might be nice, but is strictly secondary, there is a ton of legacy code in Fortran.So there is still a need for a book like this, which discusses how to use the latest version, Fortran 95. What the author strives for is to cover something lacking in many older Fortran texts. Those tend to explain the syntax and how to write small programs, of a few thousand lines or less.But there is often little discussion on how to manage the complexity of libraries stretching to 10^5 lines or 10^6 lines of code. How can you maintain and understand and add to these bodies? Issues like unit testing, which quite often discussed in java or C++, are well described here. Design discipline is also emphasised.So if you are still writing in Fortran, and are wondering about coping with growing code, consider this book."},{"Title":"Introduction To Fortran 90/95 (B.E.S.T.

There are no kabuki, Zen or origami cliches here; nor does it deal with the more-recently-hackneyed themes of Japan as a bladerunner-esque neon-soaked cyberpunk dystopia. This is real stuff, down to earth and relevant. The subject is the trials and travails of farmers who sold off their land during the economic boom of the 80's when the price of land was high, transforming the former Arcadian paradise into an ugly, anonymous suburban brown land of restaurants, nightclubs, convenience stores and the like. The transformation of the people is as shocking as that of the land: former farming communities suddenly found themselves with satchels of cash from their land sales, but uprooted from tradition they drifted predictably into all kinds of malaise, from indolence and nouveau-riche bad taste to family rifts and alienation.

He and Ayako together give us very sexy scenes as well. A very good translation who gives us a proposal for finding solace in the middle of the worldly environment we live in."},{"Title":"Distant Thunder","review":"Those who have lived or traveled extensively in Japan are familiar with how difficult it is to put into words the images and experiences that define our everyday reality. When writing a letter to relatives back home and trying to describe what things are like here, at some point we inevitably give up and conclude with something like, \\". . . but I guess you just have to be here to understand it.\\"Words on a page may never be the same as real-life experience, but Tatematsu's writing comes closer than most. Originally published in Japanese in 1980, _Enrai_ (the Japanese title) won the Noma Prize for New Writers, and is well known in Japan. His writing style is clear and down-to-earth, and the effortless descriptions of the everyday surroundings we take for granted in Japan are one of this novel's greatest strengths. Tomatoes, sweat, sex, and thunderstorms come vividly to life in the reader's mind through Tatematsu's prose.Never getting stuck on these descriptions, however, the plot unfolds quickly and unexpectedly. No preplanned outline or logical order of events is evident in the flow of the novel; rather, the reader is simply and profoundly given the opportunity to experience a short period in a young man's life. Mitsuo lives in a world that is rapidly changing, in his view mostly for the worse. At the height of the bubble economy, Tokyo is devouring the Kanto plain in a spree of careless urbanization. From the book:\\"Two years before, the prefecture decided to locate an apartment complex and a manufacturing center there. Offered fistfuls of money, the villagers rushed to sell their land. . . . The bulldozers came in waves, uprooting the trees, carving the land, and burying the fields. Buildings rose from the earth like piles of timber. The builders widened the old country lanes and paved them with asphalt. Soon they were covered by an endless stream of cars. Supermarkets, sushi bars, and nightclubs suddenly materialized.\\"In this setting, Mitsuo's father leaves the family to move in with his girlfriend, his brother is a banker in Tokyo, and his best friend runs off with another man's wife. Mitsuo, however, is determined to live simply with his mother and grandmother, using what is left of his family's land to grow tomatoes in a greenhouse.At an o-miai (arranged marriage interview) he is pressured to attend, Mitsuo meets Ayako:\\"He wanted a woman as plump as a tomato. That's all that was lacking in his life, a woman. He didn't need a house. The two of them would build something from scratch. The things that fell apart around him would no longer bother him. . . . He wanted to drag the woman away from the stiff formality of the o-miai, open his heart to her, and hear her side of things. That would be a much better way to decide upon a marriage than this kind of torture.\\"Ayako likes his no-nonsense attitude and admires his determination--this, plus the fact that she soon finds herself carrying his child, leads them to plan a hasty marriage. Ill-fated though it may seem, they seem to be a perfect match, and soon become steadfast partners in a crazy world. The progress of their relationship is a compelling if somewhat unlikely aspect of the story.At the end of the book, the reader is left admiring Mitsuo's dedication to simple farm life, envying his uncomplicated relationship with Ayako, and identifying with his subtle doubts about the not-so-distant thunder of urbanization and modernization."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Our hero is 13 year old Stanley - a very young 13 at that.

Sounds FUN to me! He also has a Mom and a flirty, pretty older sister Callie and his faithful dog, Nub.But Stanley finds out that life isn't all Mayberry and he's not Opie. There's a murder mystery (or two), bigotry, spousal abuse, child abuse.This is one of my favorite Lansdale books. I love the characters, the slow Southern pacing, the hints of darkness but also the feelings of hope, friendship and love. I recommend this to anyone who loves reading a fine book."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"This Lansdale novel, unlike the other Lansdale novels I've read, is told from the point of view of a thirteen year old boy named Stanley. It's not filled with the off-the-rails cursing and crazy gore that I expect when reading a work from this guy but it still kept my attention. Set in a small town in Texas in 1958, it makes sense that Stanley's \\"voice\\" is still quite innocent. I don't think you could get away with that sort of innocence today, what with the internet and MTV and their marathon showings of pregnant teens and spoiled skater bois and all but it works here.Stanley's parents recently purchased the local drive-in and having made only one friend, Stan's a bit of a lonely kid. He has an older sister but all they do is bicker. One summer day he and his trusty dog Nub unearth a box filled with love letters written long ago. This gets his curiosity going and he does some snooping, along with the ancient often drunken projectionist, and learns that a house use to stand where he found the box and that a young girl died inside when it burned to the ground. He then discovers another young girl was tragically murdered on the same night. Certain the two events are tied together; he spends his summer determined to find out the truth, befriending some colorful characters along the way, and disturbing things better off left alone.I'm a sucker for coming of age tales and this is a good one. It drags a little here and there but the characters kept me coming back for more. I'll never claim to be some big mystery wiz and though I guessed one important aspect of the mystery the rest of it kept me guessing. The characters are interesting and realistic (always most important to me) and the tale is scary, funny, heartwarming and compelling with a very well done sense of place. The twists, turns and chills come in the most unexpected places. Reading this I felt like I was tagging along with Stan, Nub and Buster during a long lazy summer. It's good classic stuff from Mr. Lansdale hisownself."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I heard about Joe R Lansdale through 2 sources: Ramsey Campbell citing The Nightrunners as the last book he read that actually scared him (high praise indeed), and a visual quote in Punisher Max, where the female spook is seen in her cell reading 'Sunset and Sawdust'. This book was the only one I could find in my local bookshop-and it's a keeper. A brilliant, evocative coming of age novel, off beat murder/mystery, thriller and psychological chiller rolled into one-strongly character driven, and as an English reader, I loved the powerful evocation of late 50's Deep South America.

Now I'm off to order the rest of his books."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I read this book in a day and half. FINALLY! I have found a book that for me was nearly impossible to put down. The kiddies went with Dad for a few hours and I didn't do any housework! That may sound silly but for me that's a big deal. What a riveting, thought provoking, mysterious, heartbreaking tale. The era and the scenery were so visible - every character came to life upon first introduction. It was also a case of a double edge sword for me - I wanted to find out the conclusion but I didn't want it to end! Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"If it's a coming-of-age story with supernatural elements set in the late 50s (or thereabouts) there's a good chance I'll like it, and the venerable Joe R. Lansdale's \\"A Fine Dark Line\\" novel is no exception.I don't think the fun of this novel is about the believability of the events but its wonderful ambiance full of evocative nostalgia and old-school action. It feels delightfully pulpy in places but also has a modern, self-conscious sensibility about it.The protagonist of the book is 13 year old Stanley Mitchell. He lives in the fictional small East Texas down of Dewmont. He lives with an older sister by a few years, Cassie, and his mother and father in a house with an outer wall that doubles as the drive-in (owned and operated by the family) projection screen. Also featured prominently are two African-American characters, the projectionist Buster Smith and the family's housekeeper and cook Rosy, and of course what story like this is complete without a loyal and heroic pet dog. The era, setting, set-up, and cast of characters all make for an intriguing start that makes it easy to get into the book.One day Stanley finds a buried box full of letters that hint at tragedy and scandal in the town's past. This box of letters starts Stanley on the road to a series of improbable yet entertaining adventures, and a lot of growing up. Along the way Stanley also learns through his adventures and the people around him, particularly Buster, Rosy, and his sister, about pertinent life issues, like love, sex, racism, abuse, and many facets of human nature. In his adventures he comes across threats both supernatural and human.Lansdale is a very gifted storyteller with a good sense of the era and a natural ear for the dialogue. Some it may seem over the top to modern readers who didn't live through the time, but mostly it rings true. The characters are all excellently fleshed out, the plotting is fine and the pacing superb.To conclude, this novel is really a crowd pleaser, and I could see it appealing to mature readers of all ages and interests. I prefer it to Lansdale's earlier coming-of-age novel with supernatural touches (set in the Depression era) \\"The Bottoms.\\" I recommend \\"A Fine Dark Line\\" without reservation."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I liked very much the book. I've just finished American Pastoral and I was looking for something different. It was my first time with Joe R. Lansdale. I like the town's descriptions, the plot and the characters. In a way I found too many issues put together (the racial one, the discovery of hate and lust, the sexual education) but very well mixed up. It's a very good draw of fifties America and I could visualize every situation described. I will surely buy the other Lansdale's book available in Italy even if I think the original version is surely better to read."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"A great coming of age novel written by a true pro.I rank this one with the other great coming of age novelssuch as: Boy's Life, Something Wicked This Way Comes, TheTraveling Vampire Show and Summer of Night.

What could be better."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I think everyone else who's written a rewiew as pretty muched summed up the story so I'll keep it simple. This book is one of the best I've read. I'd compare it to To Kill a Mockingbird and Homer Hickam's Rocket Boys. Same tone, different story obviously. His characters are superb and writing style flowing and descriptive in his very East Texas way. No question, pick up this book and you'll be taken to another time and engaged wholeheartedly. VERY highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"In the summer of 1958, the Mitchel family moves to Dewmont, East Texas to run the drive-in movie theatre, which they just bought. They hire half black-half Indian Buster Lighthouse Smith to operate the projector and a black woman Rosy to help Mrs. Mitchell with the cooking and the cleaning. Thirteen year old Stanley Jr. becomes closer to Buster and Rosy than he does to his parents because they listen to his dreams and fears.While playing with his dog Nub, Stanley finds a half-buried chest. When he opens it he discovers inside a bunch of love letters written in 1942. There are no signatures on the letters only initials and Stanley becomes obsessed with finding out who wrote them and what happened to them. He figures out who the writers were by questioning various townsfolk. He and Buster, a former Seminole police officer, investigate further, an action that puts him, his family and his two friends in danger.A FINE DARK LINE is a powerful coming of age tale set in a place and time when people of influence can get away with murder. The summer of 1958 is a traumatic time for the protagonist as he learns about sex, incest, homosexuality, and wife beating while someone tries to kill him. He successfully blackmails the town's most powerful citizens yet understands his experiences are meaningless in the greater scheme of life. Joe R. Lansdale once again transcends genre to write a haunting historical novel focusing on the human condition.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"In the summer of 1958, in Dewmont, Texas, thirteen-year-old Stanley Mitchell lives in the DewDrop Drive-In that is owned by his parents. This summer things will changes for Stan, as he will have some life-changing adventures with his friend Richard Chapman, who hides over at Stan's because he is mentally and physically abused by his fanatically religious father, and because Stan's family has a television.Then two things will happen that will change Stan's life forever. The first is that while playing out behind his house he finds a rusty box. The other is that a large black woman, Rosey May Bell will come to work for them.In the box Stan finds a sheaf of old letters from M to J. The letters are of a romantic nature, and being the curious child that he is, Stan decides to try to find out who M and J are, and what has happened to them. It turns out that they were to lovers, one rich, and the other dirt poor, and from a family of ill repute. J probably was a Stilwind who died a terrible death in a house that was burned down, and that used to be behind the drive-in, while M died a terrible death by the near-by railway tracks. Their ghosts are said to haunt these places.After breaking a leg in an accident, Stan finally meets and befriends the old black man who drinks a little too much, and who has seen way too much in his life. Buster Abbot Lighthorse is an old broken-down, black ex-lawman who seems to be at the end of his days, and is now the projectionist as the Dew-Drop Drive-In. He is the man who teaches Stan a bit about life, and who helps him sort through things in an effort to get to the bottom of the long, thirty years now, buried M and J mystery. He will also end up saving Stan's life during this 1958 summer.The other part revolves around the Mitchell household. Rosey May is a charming, Aunt Jemima type who takes a liking to the family, and the family takes a liking to her. Then one day she shows up in the middle of the night, she's beaten and scared. Her drunken husband has abused her, has tried to turn her out, and has threatened to kill her.Breaking with tradition, the Mitchell's takes her in to keep her safe. And in doing so, Rosey May changes the traditional Southern attitude Mitchell's outlook towards black folk of the day. Then the Mitchell clan realizes that they are being stalked by Rosey Mae's husband, the terminally mean Bubba Joe.For me, this coming of age story seems a bit too long. It's clearly two novellas that seem to have been braided together. Still, there is a fairly clear demarcation between the two stories, when one is resolved, the other, which had been meandering along, takes center stage. It would have been better, I think, to have written each story as a self-contained novella, and then just have been published together as a collection.On the other hand, \\"A Fine Dark Line\\" by Joe R. Lansdale is filled chock-a-block with Lansdale's trademark Southern colloquialisms, down-home dialogue, real pop culture references, and down-to-earth, ordinary salt-of-the-earth characters. This is a novel that owes more than a tip of the hat to such works as \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee, there's even a scene in the novel that seems lifted from that novel. This novel also owes something to the childhood stories of Ray Bradbury, although with none of Bradbury's romantic nostalgia. This is a novel that has a real dark streak to it, as Stan will have to learn, almost overnight, about things like sex, homosexuality, murder, child-abuse, alcoholism, spousal abuse, racism, insanity, dark, buried secrets, and the fact that monsters aren't all on the screen, sometimes they are human and exist in real life. A Southern gothic in the grand tradition, which uses attitudes and dialogue of the times unsensationally, in a way that will make many who are looking for revisionistically politically correct telling of the events of 1958 in rural Texas very uncomfortable.There are those that are comparing this novel to Lansdale's \\"The Bottoms\\"; they are welcome to such comparisons, and only because I have yet to read \\"The Bottoms\\". A good novel, but still, the story meanders, the plot is disjointed, and the novel is just a little too long and unfocused. I'll round up, but really, the book deserves three and a half stars. I read the Wheeler books large print version of this novel and I found it an easy read, and it is printed on permanent paper that will not yellow over the years."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Lansdale describes a summer in 1958 when 13 year-old Stanley Michel Jr and his family moved to a house that formed the screen of the drive-in theater in Dewmont Texas. During that summer, Stanley loses his childhood innocence when he learns about racial bigotry, passion, cruelty and violence. He also becomes close to his 16 year old sister, befriends the aged black man who runs the projector and solves a 20 year old murder mystery.This \\"not to be missed\\" story draws its characters and their personalities so finely, you feel like you can actually see them. I enjoyed some of the dialogue of the characters so much, I reread parts of the story.The title, Fine Dark Line, signifies many things in the story. There is a quote by Stanley in the story in which he feared that a force he felt in his room would take hold of him and drag him with them \\"across the fine dark line that made up the border between the world of the living and the world of the dead.\\" I also think there was a fine dark line between the lives of the blacks and the whites in the town, the poor and the rich, and instances we see of both cruelty and love.There are lots of memorable characters. In addition to Stanley Jr. who narrates the story, we meet his friend Richard, who receives regular beatings my his religious fanatic father but finds the courage to stand up to him; the aging black projectionist, Buster Lighthouse Smith, who helps him solve the mystery letters found in an abandoned house. Buster teaches him how to research what actually happened to two murdered teenage girls, but more importantly, teaches Stanley many life lessons. His sister Callie, a co-conspirator in his investigations, introduces him to many adult issues.This book has been compared to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and is as memorable. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Remember the days of drive in movies? Remember reading books and comics about your heroes late at night? Remember solving murders and trying not to get killed? Well, maybe you don't remember the last one but Stanley Mitchel does and Joe R. Lansdale has done a masterful job of telling Stanley's tale. This book takes us back to a much simpler time when life was slower but there were still terrors. Stanley and his friends are working on solving the mystery of some old murders and get caught up in a very dangerous chain of events. As in most of Mr. Lansdale's books he does a wonderful job of mixing the mystery and terror with humor and heart."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"It's 1958 and Stanley Mitchel is a very young thirteen years old. His family has just moved to the small town of Dewmont, Texas where they have purchased the Dew Drop Drive-in and Concession stand. Although he's out of school for the summer, Stanley is about to learn some tough lessons about love, loyalty, friendship, racism and about the perversity that often lurks deep in the human heart. Oh yeah, he also figures out why those cars parked out near the back fence each night at the drive-in are always rockin'.One day Stanley and his faithful dog, Nub, discover a rusty old box full of love letters buried in the yard of a burned out house behind the family's property. The letters were written by a young girl who had been brutally murdered twenty years earlier. With the help of Buster Abbot Lighthorse Smith, the surly and aging African American projectionist employed by his father, Stanley decides to solve the old murder that has fallen into his lap. The boy starts digging but there are some folks in Dewmont who would prefer to \\"let sleeping dogs lie.\\" Before too long, Stanley and his family are immersed in and threatened by the sins of Dewmont - past and present. As the violence and menace close in and as Stanley gets closer and closer to the truth, the young boy's eyes are opened and his heart is broken by the tragic and bittersweet drama of adulthood and the inevitable loss of innocence that always seems to come along for the ride.A FINE DARK LINE is a powerful and haunting work. Lansdale writes with grace and genuine emotion. His experience in the gothic tradition enables him to give his readers a glimpse of the darkest reaches of the human soul while at the same time crafting a story that is as uplifting, hopeful and as ripe with promise as a sunny day stretching ahead of a young boy and his dog on summer vacation. But just beneath the surface or hiding behind that big oak tree just beyond the next corner are danger, disappointment and death. Stanley soon discovers that learning to be a man means glorying in and appreciating that promise while being at the same time always prepared to face disillusionment and disenchantment. \\"That's life,\\" Buster tells Stanley, \\"Ain't always satisfactory, but sometimes the part that is, is pretty damn good. Thing to remember is, enjoy life, \`cause in the end, dirt and flesh is pretty much the same thing. You understand that?\\"A FINE DARK LINE is a novel that succeeds on multiple levels: as a mystery with wondrously wrought gothic elements, as a moving and poignant evocation of a bygone era, and as the story of one small boy's soul-wrenching journey to adulthood and, ultimately, to peace with himself and his place in the world. But Stanley's journey is also our journey as well. It's Lansdale's ability to make that connection in such an effective and entertaining way that elevates this book beyond the level of the ordinary thriller.(James Clar - MYSTERY NEWS)"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Lansdale is a great writer. He's so good that he can write in his sleep -- which may be the problem with A Fine Dark Line. Lansdale's ability in dealing with issues of race, sexuality, good and evil, is remarkable. You never feel like you're being preached to, which is probably a testimony to Lansdale's good common sense. However, in A Fine Dark Line, the ghosts invoked come from other novels. Anyone who has read To Kill a Mockingbird or Tom Sawyer, knows he or she has read earlier and greater efforts. A violent fight at night in a storm; a town mystery or two; a boy entering into early manhood; strange lights down by the railroad tracks; a headless girl. American Folklore 101. Yep. Lansdale's pushing the buttons. Still, this book is worth a read, since you quickly come attached to the Mitchel family and their friends. But if you've read Lansdale's The Drive-in, you'll find yourself longing for the early wild man, as opposed to this tame, mainstream version of a pulp master."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"A FINE DARK LINE represents Joe Landsale at the top of his game. In this bittersweet coming of age novel set in rural 1950's Texas, Lansdale manages to do just about everything right. All of the notes he hits novel are clear and in tune and a few manage to reach deep enough to stir up some seriously deep, dark and muddy emotions.Lansdale was an impressively talented writer fifteen years ago when he wrote THE DRIVE-IN, a bizarre and wildly fun novel about teenagers trapped by aliens in an all-night triple-feature, and he's only gotten better over the years. Fans of Lansdale's earlier work will recognize some perineal elements and themes in A FINE DARK LINE.As the title suggests, racial concerns feature prominently in A FINE DARK LINE. Lansdale is also concerned here with the choices we're forced to make as humans. Friendship and love-both spoken and unspoken-are also major elements in this highly entertaining and affecting novel.If you've read Lansdale before, you know what a talented storyteller the man is, and have shouldn't hesitate picking up this novel. It's one of his best yet.If you haven't read him, but are on the lookout for an author who knows how to mix laugh-out-loud humor with just the right amount of nostalgia, poetic observationl skills, and honest, sometimes soft, sometimes steely emotion, then Lansdale's your man and A FINE DARK LINE's your poison. Drink deep, and enjoy."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Joe Lansdale has written a coming-of-age story of 13y.o. Stanley Mitchell growing up in East Texas, 1958. In A FINE DARK LINE Stanley crosses from innocence to the cold realities of domestic violence, racism, alcoholism, and murder as well as experiencing the natural awakening to sexual feelings, and realizing the necessity of work and friendships.The picture Lansdale paints of the past, in the post WWII, pre-computer age, creates nostalgia via its realism. Stanley finds some love letters of a young girl with a mysterious past and a lost identity. He becomes interested in discovering more about her and is compelled to find out what happenned to her. In the process he befriends an elderly Black man and an abused boy his own age. As Stanley interacts with several adults and family members he passes from childhood into adolescence.Lansdale writes there's a \\"fine dark line between black mystery and reality\\" and Stanley fears that his intrusion into the events of the past by openning the old letters has offended the gods, changing fate and causing evil things to happen to him. At the time it may have felt that way, but with the perspective and benefit from years of living, his reflections on the past help Stanley realize how much he's learned and how he's been molded into the man he is today.As is characteristic of superb, meaningful writing, there is the story and the added meaning of the story the reader can \\"take home\\". Besides an intriguing mystery, Joe Lansdale has given his readers plenty to reflect upon and keep in A FINE DARK LINE."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"This is a 5 star book! Like his last book, THE BOTTOMS, (The Edgar Winner for Best Mystery Novel), A FINE DARK LINE is also impossible to putdown, takes you to another place in time, such a pleasure to read, I loved this book. I amin awe of this writer and his infinite imagination. Just readthe other 5 star reviews?"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I enjoyed The Bottoms so well that I thrilled to see another Joe Lansdale story set in East Texas. Underlying the unraveling of two murders that took place long ago, there is social history that is examined. As I read the book, I could remember the time and remember how attitudes were changing for many people, but staying the same for others. As typical of the time, Stanley went from still clinging to Santa Claus to learning about sex, murder, domestic violence and bigotry all in one summer. He struggled with knowing that events were against the law, but feeling in his heart that they were the right thing to do at the time. In every respect, this was a wonderful reading experience."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"While this book is very good and very well written, it almost feels like the family from the Bottoms picked up and moved to a drive-in. Don't get me wrong there are big differences between the families, but this is another coming of age story by Champion Joe that involves gruesome murders.I guess you could call this a sequel in tone to the Bottoms. Once again our hero is a young lad spending his time investigating a couple of grisly murders. What sets this book apart from the Bottoms is that this family is a little more affluent, and live in a nicer town. Also aside from the basic premise of a young man solving murders the stories and characters are completely different.I enjoyed the fact that the father in A Fine Dark Line is not a perfect man. He has a temper that can go off at any second. He has no qualms about &quot;slapping a teenager smart,&quot; or beating on a man who abuses both Stanley's and his own family.I liked that we actually witnessed the hero, Stanley Jr., getting smarter as the book progressed. I felt the writing style got a little better as the book went on, and since it was written in the first person from Stanley Jr.'s point-of-view, I thought the writing style reflected the protagonist getting smarter.My one complaint is that this book lacked much of that famous Lansdale dialog. You know the kind. The dialog scenes that would have you belly laughing. Those kinds of dialog.To be kind, there is a great dialog near the end of the book between Stanley Jr. and one of his family's tormentors. I won't say any more.&quot;The worm has spoken.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Remember taking Sunday drives in the country? You weren't really GOING anyplace in particular, the drive was the adventure.\\"A Fine Dark Line\\" is the literary equivalent to those outings. Sometimes nothing spectacular was really happening, but it didn't matter...I was thoroughly engrossed and just enjoying the ride.Joe Lansdale's novel is a rich, atmospheric, character-driven tale that immerses its readers in the life of 13 year old Stanley Mitchel.It's the summer of 1958 in East Texas. A time when youthful naivet&eacute; gives way to understanding (or at least TRYING to understand)concepts like life, death, family relationships and racial strife. Suddenly, Stanley is drawn into the mystery surrounding the deaths of two young girls almost twenty years earlier.But, for me, the 'mystery' was secondary. It is the characters and their lives that make this book memorable.If pressed on 'what's the book about?' I'd have to say, \\"eh...not much, really. There's kind of a mystery...but the novel really doesn't have a major plot pushing it.\\"And yet, it instantly became one of my favorite books. Lansdale gives us such a vast array of multidimensional characters, each with a story so deeply satisfying, that the 'plot' takes a backseat.I loved \\"A Fine Dark Line\\", and I thank Lansdale for giving me people I will remember for a lifetime."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Heartwarming characters that are fresh and precious. It's so nice to read a coming-of-age tale about a nice, normal, loving family. Usually the family in this genre is abusive, nuts or whatever, so this offering by Lansdale was great fun to read. There were plenty of enemies and evil challenges coming at our young heroes, and the faithful little dog Nub prattles on through it all. Emotional, amazing, relevant, heartbreaking, and healing. This has become a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"At first blush, the idea of Joe Lansdale - the man behind The Complete Drive-In and Bubba Ho-Tep - writing a coming-of-age story seems like a strange one. After all, A Fine Dark Line is a relatively grounded work; while there's a brutal crime at the heart of the novel, the book has little in the way of pure horror, and certainly none of the cheerfully offensive nature that those works have. But Lansdale has always grounded his work with outstanding, rich characters, and A Fine Dark Line is no exception. Depicting life in a small Texas town in the era right before the civil rights movement, A Fine Dark Line creates a vivid, involving world filled with characters we're genuinely attached to and involved with, be they the family's African-American maid or our narrator's big sister, who's every bit as difficult and quietly loving as you'd expect a big sister to be. There are few simple characters here, and Lansdale does a phenomenal job weaving together a slew of different plot threads into a cohesive whole that ends up showing a short time period that changes one young boy into a man. Lansdale doesn't lose the edge or the knack for tension that he's always shown; a nighttime brawl and a midnight expedition are but two perfect examples of how well the man can create tension out of the simplest components. But as good as the plotting is, it always comes back to the characters, so much so that a book-closing epilogue where we learn what happened to these characters over time feels genuinely moving and necessary rather than cloying and tacked-on like those so often do. I keep saying this about Lansdale, but the man is a neglected gem in fiction; I've yet to read anything by him that's disappointed me, and A Fine Dark Line holds its own with anything else he's done. It's a moving, engaging coming-of-age tale that wears its darkness and realism well, creating a tale that feels more genuine and believable than you might expect."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Joe R. Lansdale's extensive body of work ranges from steampunk mayhem to East Texas noir, with a few stops along the way for the unclassifiable and truly bizarre. His Hap Collins and Leonard Pine stories are some of my favourite mystery novels - the perfect balance of character, setting and detection. His more pulpy work - for example the Drive-In series or his infamous \\"The God of the Razor\\" - is noteworthy in a completely different way, a combination of splatterpunk horror and lingering weird (little w) imagery, William S. Burroughs landscapes populated by Richard Laymon characters.Mr. Lansdale also exercises himself by walking along a completely different spectrum, with his coming of age and historical fiction set in his beloved Texas. Sunset and Sawdust (2004), The Bottoms (nominated for some award or another) (20000, The Boar (1998) and, perhaps best of all, A Fine Dark Line (2002).A Fine Dark Line is ostensibly a mystery. Stanley Mitchell is a naive 13 year old in the mid-sized town of Dumont, Texas, 1958. While playing the woods behind his house, he finds a half-buried box of old letters - the only surviving artefact of a burned down mansion from a generation before. The letters tell the story of two young women, both, Stanley learns, dead under mysterious circumstances.Stanley's no detective - he's a lonely, fairly intelligent kid living in a small town on the brink of change. He starts the book distraught that he only learned Santa Claus was a lie the previous year (and has the good grace to realise how embarrassing that is for a 12 year old). He loves his comic books, Roy Rodgers cowboy boots and his dumb-but-loyal dog, Nub.The mystery, such as it is, provides the central structure to his coming of age story. The forgotten murders provide Stanley an excuse to explore Dumont from top to bottom - from the glossy spires of the town's upper class to the ungainly sprawl of the pre-Civil Rights era African American neighborhood. Mr. Lansdale is excellent at depicting both extremes and populating his Texas town with a cast of fascinating characters. Stanley's eyes open a little more with each encounter, and his discomfort is alternately disconcerting and heart-warming. His old sister explains to him \\"the birds and the bees\\", but also the harsh realities of what its like to be a 16 year old girl in 1958. The family's elderly handyman, Buster Smith, teaches Stanley about the rudiments of detection - but also the unfortunate truths of high-functioning alcoholism and the bitter fruits of racism.By the end of A Fine Dark Line, Stanley's a very different person - exposed to sex, race, violence, classism and, eventually, death. The reader's concern isn't whether he'll find the murderer, but what sort of man Stanley will be by the close of the book. With his father, his mother and his friends, he's surrounded by examples of good people struggling to make do - and he's also constantly exposed to the 'success stories' of reprehensible people. Stanley learns that the values expressed in his comic books might not be those shared by the real world.And Stanley is a nice kid - that's easily seen in the behavior of those around him. But there's an edge to it, especially with his African-American friends like Buster and Rosy Mae. They see Buster as a child, innocent and good-willed. But they also know that, at any moment, he could be absorbed into the social mainstream and turn against them. Stanley's lucky (perhaps anachronistically so) to have fairly liberal role models in his mother and father. But even so, most of the book's resolution involves people - friends and family both - learning to let their guard down and trust one another. (Also a serial killer with a scythe, but that's to be expected.)A recurring theme throughout Mr. Lansdale's books in every genre, is the difference between justice and the law. Through Stanley, the reader learns how, in his small town, the two are not necessarily intertwined. Not merely with the unsolved murders, but also with the treatment of many of Stanley's friends. Similarly, the tension throughout A Fine Dark Line has nothing to do with the crimes, but everything to do with the choices that Stanley has to make.Although I'm painting A Fine Dark Line to sound a bit like an Afterschool Special, the closest comparison is more Stand By Me. The book perfectly captures the eye-opening awkwardness of that One Magical Transitional Summer, underpinned with the awareness that who Stanley becomes now will be him for the rest of his life. (This is all a fairly inaccurate media/literary construct of adolescence that everyone now accepts as given for coming of age stories, but that's a topic for another day.)Dumont, Texas, 1958 is also young, naive and on the verge of growing up. And if Mr. Lansdale is clear about what happens with Stanley, he leaves it to the reader to decide what kind of adult that Dumont becomes."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I loved the characters and the mystery! Seeing the real world through the eyes of a child becoming an adult is wonderful and somewhat frightening. I think of Grisham's \\"The Painted House\\" although Lansdale's story is grittier. The character sees the world with bright eyes and learns his lessons at the knee of the old projectionist. It's really worth the read!"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"When I finished the last page of this book, folded it and put it on my shelf, I was thinking, \\" Damn I am actually really glad I read this.\\"It's a great story, very well driven, excellent characters, and very laid back - like a story told by an old man on a old creaking rocking chair thats outside on a late evening summer day.I recommended this book to everyone I meet, even when the subject isn't on books.\\" So those Yankees are really doing bad this season...\\"\\" Yo guys, Read a Fine Dark Line!.\\"Weird Stares afterwards, but a couple weeks later they come back and thank me for telling them about the book.This goes on one of my list of, top favorite books, even along THE BOTTOMS, which was just as good.A Fine Dark Line is gonna make you want more Lansdale, even if it means to get his underpants."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"A story told from the perspective of a 13 year old boy.At time frustrating how obvious some of the twists were, but.....this was told from a 13 year olds perspective, so I'm glad I was smarter.And I wasn't always. Like Memento, clues can be misleading when you don't have the full picture. And I never would have guessed the final twist.Can't wait to read more by this guy."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"A great yarn: I really enjoyed this story, but I think it needed a little editing--say 10 pages altogether of dialog. I don't want to give the plot away (read other reviews), but I think it should have been toned down a bit on the stereotypes (using the \\"N\\" word too much, resulting in some distraction for the reader. A little editing out would have made its use more powerful).But I let those things go and kept reading. It would be unfair to take off any stars for those things. A novel is not reality.I'm reminded of \\"Boy's Life,\\" by Robert McCammon. One of the characters in a small southern town walks around with no clothes on, but nobody does anything because he is the son of the owner of the town's only bank. Now I had no problem with the the son being crazy, but having him walk around in the altogether was a little over the top. And not realistic. Still, \\"Boy's Life\\" was one of the best books I ever read.That said, I still enjoyed \\"A Fine Dark Line,\\" and at the end, it brought tears to my eyes. So what more can I say? I got into the life of thirteen-year-old Stanley Mitchell and wanted to find out how the mystery ended. I will definitely read more novels by Joe Lansdale.Check out the following three great coming-of-age stories:1. \\"Boy's Life,\\" by Robert McCammonBoy's Life2. \\"Summer of Night, by Dan SimmonsSummer of Night (Aspect Fantasy)3. \\"The Traveling Vampire Show,\\" by Richard LaymonThe Traveling Vampire Show"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"In East Texas in the late fifties, 13-year-old Stanley Mitchel's father owns a drive-in at the edge of town.

When he also finds out that two young girls died mysteriously the night of the fire twenty years before, Stanley investigates."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"This audio book is abridged, and it shows. Unfortunately I love Lansdale's work and I love audio books, but Joe only has only a couple of books on audio and they happen to be abridged. Anyway, even though I own the book, I knew I would get to this story faster if I listed to audio book. The story only clocks in at 4 discs, and it feels short. I expect that all major plot points are covered by this abridgement, but it does feel like there needs to be more character development.The story itself is a mystery, and it is about a family that buys a local drive-in in a new town. The protagonist is the boy, and his adventures. He finds out that behind the drive-in is a burned house, and that burned house has some mystery attached to it, in the form of a murdered girl. The boy and one of the workers at the drive-in decide to investigate for fun, but it doesn't turn into fun when the boy gets wrapped up in the real mystery of the murder.It is an interesting listen, as the story is entertaining, but since it's an abridgment I can only recommend it if you've read the novel, as I feel like I need to go to the book to get more answers. Good voice acting by the reader, though. The voice was very professional."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I found this book in the mystery/thriller section. It could have been in many other sections as well: coming of age, southern literature, 1950's literature, dysfunctional families or race relations to name just a few.The narrator, East Texan 13 year old Stanley Mitchel, Jr., gets a lifetime's worth of education during one summer vacation in the 1950's. While \\"investigating\\" a few murders and the ghosts of their victims, he learns about the birds and the bees, race relations (his mother is liberal his father uses the word \\"nigger\\"), murderers, friendship and dysfunctional families. His family, though it has warts, is a close-knit support group. Every character in the book has depth and believeability. There are no cardboard cutouts in this novel. Even the evil protagonists never quite fit into a stereotype.The story moves at a blistering pace. The many evolving relationships move the book along as much, if not more than, the mystery component. There are some truly loveable characters here - main and tangential, and some truly nasty evil-doers as well. The mystery is really the vehicle that meshes the characters' relationships.Mr. Lansdale is a superb writer. He captures the down to earth voice of the teen narrator extremely well. There is something of Huck Finn/Tom Sawyer in both the telling and the wide-eyed view the narrator brings to the telling of the tale.This is an extremely fast-paced read, but there are so many subplots and social issues touched upon that it would be great reading group fodder. Highly entertaining. Highly thought-provoking. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"In Joe R. Lansdale's newest novel, A FINE DARK LINE, the reader is carried back to the summer of 1958 when thirteen-year-old Stanley Mitchell, Jr. and his family move to Dewmont, Texas to take over the ownership of the town's only drive-in movie theater. This is the summer that Stanley will lose his childhood innocence and learn that there's no Santa Claus, what sex is really about, the ugly truth concerning racism, and the painful reality about death, murder and the human monsters that hide behind the masks of one's next-door neighbors. It's also the summer that young Stanley begins to learn about the power of friendship, family, love, and the unrelenting courage that's needed in the face of horror. Stanley's journey into adulthood begins when he finds a half-buried metal box filled with old love letters near a burnt-down house in the woods behind the drive-in theater where he and his family now live. The letters belonged to a young girl who was gruesomely murdered almost two decades before. The fact that the crime was never solved triggers Stanley's curiosity. With the help of his older sister, Caldonia, and his new friends Richard Chapman and old Buster Lighthorse Smith, he begins to slowly, but persistently, dig into the past, not knowing that what he discovers will change his life forever. Brilliantly written by one of America's top authors, A FINE DARK LINE carries us back to when comic books were a nickel, Tarzan movies played on TV in the mornings, and a young boy could believe that the fictional John Carter of Mars actually existed. This was a time when anything seemed possible, and small-town life during the hot, sweltering summer months was slow and relaxed, and the local teenagers flocked to the drive-in theater at night to see the newest movies and to make out in their cars. Mr. Lansdale is able to capture the pure ambience of these forgotten memories with a simplicity of words that draws the reader into the story as if he/she was walking the streets of Dewmont with Stanley and his dog, Nub. Each of the main and supporting characters are fully developed individuals that you either love or hate, and one can't help finding themselves laughing out loud as Stanley learns about the \\"birds and the bees\\" from Caldonia and Buster, or feeling the soul-wrenching emptiness as he experiences first hand from the Mitchell's housekeeper, Rosy Mae, how terrible men can be toward the women they love. This is not only a journey for Stanley, but one for the reader as well. You'll come away with a little more knowledge of what it means to be a human being in all of its mixed-up aspects. Like Mr. Lansdale's previous award-winning novel, THE BOTTOMS, this book is what I would call a \\"life experience,\\" and it's one I would highly recommend to any person wishing more than a casual read. Entertaining, thought provoking, and nostalgic, A FINE DARK LINE is a true masterpiece from one of America's most gifted writers."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Joe Lansdale proves again he can recreate with a fine eye growing up in East Texas during the '50's.

His daddy owns the Dew Drop Drive-In movie, and their home is kind of between the screen and the concession stand, which Stanley thinks is a very good thing. The whole family, Mom (\\"Gal\\"), Daddy, and older sister Callie run the theatre. It is the summer of 1958, and as Stanley says, more things happen in that summer than have happened in his entire life. He finds a hidden trove of love letters that lead in him to a burned out plantation in the woods in back of the drive-in and discovers a young girl was burned to death in the fire. On the same night another young girl was murdered on the railroad tracks, decapitated and her head never found. Rumored ghosts abound. The remnants of the house and mill are eerily entwined with vines and saplings that have grown around and through them. Stanley decides to investigate the mystery, and gets a great deal more than he bargained for---corruption in high places, blackmail, and two psychotics: father of his best friend Richard and erstwhile boyfriend Bubba, huge and terrifying, of the family's housekeeper Rosy Mae.The characterizations are sublime. High spirited, cheerleader-cute sister Callie is wonderfully drawn. She knows she has great powers of attraction and uses them like an inexperienced marksman with an assault rifle. Friend Richard wrenches your heart with his deprived and catastrophic home life. The family employees, Buster, the projectionist, and Rosy Mae, crackle with life, earthiness, and vibrancy. Daddy, in spite of his bad temper and propensity to fight, shines with goodness, and mother Gal is secretly in charge of everyone.\\"A Fine Dark Line\\" is witty, terrifying and occasionally mischievous. Sometimes credibility is stretched. Even in 1958, could there be one 13-year-old boy that still believed in Santa Claus? The amount of terror and mayhem that happened on one night couldn't have happened to most people in a lifetime. But believe me, you will consider every last word right and true as you race through the pages. A book not to be missed.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"The arrival of A FINE DARK LINE prompts a legitimate question regarding its author, Joe R. Lansdale: is there anything this guy can't do well? My first encounter with him was THE DRIVE IN, a science fiction horror novel. This was followed by THE MAGIC WAGON --- a gothic western if you will --- and COLD IN JULY, a mystery. Then came the Batman-based CAPTURED BY THE ENGINES, TARZAN'S LOST ADVENTURE, the Jonah Hex comic book story arcs, and on and on and on...and they are all great. So with A FINE DARK LINE, we have a coming of age novel set in rural Texas in the 1950s, a time both better and worse than our own and inexorably linked to it. And, like all his other works that have preceded it, A FINE DARK LINE is his finest work to date.A FINE DARK LINE is told through the eyes of Stanley Mitchell, a thirteen year-old boy standing on the summer cusp of adolescence, the younger of two children in a family that isn't poverty-stricken but not exactly next door neighbors to Scrooge McDuck, either. No, the Mitchells are the owners and proprietors of the only drive-in theater in Dewmont, Texas. Stanley's youth and innocence are consumed in a slow-burning maelstrom sparked by his discovery of a tin box containing a collection of troubled love letters that ultimately lead him to a burned out house, the mysterious deaths of two young women and secrets that the powers that be in Dewmont would prefer to stay buried. Stanley's unlikely ally is Buster Smith, the projectionist at the theater, an elderly black man whose attempts to drown his demons in alcohol are doomed to failure but who has a depth that only Stanley is aware of. In attempting to solve the mysteries of the deaths of the two women, Stanley exposes not only himself, but also his family and friends, to danger. A FINE DARK LINE, however, is more than a mystery story. It is, ultimately, the tale of a time not so long gone but vanished completely nonetheless. Lansdale uses the mystery as a vehicle to explore the cultural landscape, race relations and sexual mores of the 1950s. What is most remarkable here is that Lansdale is able to capture so perfectly the voice of a 13 year-old boy in that era. I suspect that, to at least some extent, it is his own, some 50 years removed. If so, it resonates within him pitch-perfectly and his translation is unerring.With A FINE DARK LINE, Lansdale continues to expand the breadth and scope of his literary vision. One could easily come to the conclusion that his talent and landscape know no boundaries. He is a writer who has exceeded the promise of his earliest work and the expectations of his readers --- and will undoubtedly continue to do so.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"It is unusual for a writer to successfully cross the boundaries between literary genres, but Joe R. Lansdale does so with ease. He's written horror stories and novels, science fiction, and mysteries. What's more, the author has won awards in different genres, from six Bram Stoker Awards for horror to the Edgar Award and the American Mystery Award. Up until a month ago, I never read a Joe Lansdale book. I heard of him over the years, always meant to pick up one of his books, but just never got around to it. The recent release and the subsequent clamor of praise for &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep,&quot; a Lansdale short story adapted for the big screen by &quot;Phantasm&quot; creator Don Coscarelli, finally inspired me to sit down with a Lansdale tome or two. Surprisingly, I picked two of his mystery stories, the recent &quot;Sunset and Sawdust&quot; and &quot;A Fine Dark Line.&quot; I liked the former, a whodunit set in the steamy environs of East Texas during the Depression. I also, it turns out, enjoyed the former, a whodunit set in East Texas during the late 1950s. Lansdale writes about East Texas because he knows the region like the back of his hand. It's possible the writer may well do for the Lone Star state what Stephen King did for Maine and what Bentley Little is trying to do for Arizona.&quot;A Fine Dark Line&quot; stars Stanley Mitchel, Jr., a man in his late fifties recalling a series of startling events that occurred in the Summer of 1958 when he was thirteen years old and living in Dewmont, Texas. The Mitchel family was well off in Dewmont since they owned the local drive-in theater. Stanley Mitchel, Sr., the patriarch of the clan, is a no nonsense type of guy who doesn't hesitate to hand out a few slaps to keep peace in the family. For instance, when daughter Callie falls under suspicion for sleeping with the local bad boy, Chester, Stanley Mitchel makes sure the lout doesn't come around anymore. With his family and employees, the father is different; a loving, caring man who believes that his children and wife should have all the decent things in life. Although he embodies many of the racial attitudes of the day, he acquiesces to his spouse's demand to take in a black woman named Rosy Mae when domestic problems with her abusive boyfriend Bubba Joe threaten to put the woman in the local morgue. Mitchel Sr. puts up with the taciturn Buster Abbot Lighthorse Smith, an alcoholic black man who runs the projection booth at the theater. In short, the family is what you would call liberal today, but radical in 1950's Texas.The mystery begins in earnest when Stanley Mitchel Jr., with loyal dog Nub in tow, uncovers a cache of letters in the wooded area behind the drive-in. These epistles, written back during the Second World War, detail an enigmatic relationship between two people known only as 'M' and 'J'. Intrigued, Stanley investigates the origins of these love letters and in the process uncovers several nasty secrets about the town's richest residents. Soon, Stanley joins forces with the moody Buster Smith. Together the two embark on a covert operation to discover the identities of the two letter writers, an operation that rapidly uncovers more than the two unlikely sleuths thought possible. Nothing less than murder, corruption, and several other unsavory activities come to light. A seemingly unrelated subplot involving Stanley's friend Richard and the boy's hyper religious and abusive father plays a significant role in the inevitable final showdown. During the course of the story, Stanley Mitchel, Jr. moves from childhood into adulthood as he learns how the world really works. &quot;A Fine Dark Line&quot; is primarily a mystery story, but it is also a coming of age story as well as a tale about changing race relations in the South.While I have only read two Lansdale books to date, I already detect a pattern in the man's writings. First, his concerns about race permeate his books. As a child of the South during the tumultuous days of the 1960s, Lansdale must have personally witnessed many of the riots, marches, and other activities associated with the Civil Rights struggle. The author is obviously no Bull Conner or George Wallace, however. Stanley Mitchel's family's attitudes about local blacks must have been similar to the opinions held by Joe Lansdale's family. Second, the author's prose strikes all the right chords. Clean, sparse, and to the point, Lansdale wastes few words describing his characters and the atmosphere of East Texas. He advances the plot effortlessly, without any needless exposition so common amongst his more verbose colleagues. Finally, Lansdale knows how to write effective scenes, perhaps best evidenced in &quot;A Fine Dark Line&quot; with the chase sequence in the woods where Richard, Callie, and Stanley meet up with the ominous Bubba Joe while on a quest to discover more information about the letters. It is a scary situation while at the same time revealing several important plot elements in the space of a just a few pages.&quot;A Fine Dark Line&quot; is a fine dark read. The story moves at a lightening fast pace, is humorous in spots (witness Stanley's observations about the balloons), and fleshes out even minor characters effectively. The only drawback I saw was the jacket flap, which was full of errors. For example, the flap refers to Buster Abbot Lighthorse Smith as Buster LIGHTHOUSE Smith (?) and misspells Stanley Mitchel's last name. If I were Joe Lansdale, I'd have been furious over these slipshod mistakes. &quot;A Fine Dark Line&quot; felt like a good place to start for me, the novice Lansdale reader. Now if I can just find a few of his horror stories, I'll go a little further."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Opening with a sweetly melancholic passage recounting some of his earliest memories, Stanley Mitchell, the now fifty seven year old narrator of A Fine Dark Line, quickly gets down to the business at hand, telling a story which began in the summer of 1958. That summer, Stanley's discovery of a long buried diary eventually leads to the revelation of the truth behind a scandal in the town's past, involving the deaths of two young women from opposite ends of the social spectrum. A modern day Tom Sawyer, Stanley finds himself in the middle of things, his curiosity and naivet&eacute; placing him in the path of mortal danger.Given Lansdale's notorious sense of the bizarre, much of the novel concerns itself with Stanley\`s often harrowing adventures around his hometown of Dewmont, Texas. The strongest portions of the novel, however, deal not with Stanley's investigations, nor with their macabre side effects, but with his mundane, day to day life: his loving, if sometimes embattled relationships with his father, mother, and sister, his comradery with his friend Richard (Huck to Stanley's Tom), his affectionate reliance on the family housekeeper Rosy Mae, and his often contentious association with Buster Lighthorse Smith, an elderly black man who runs the projector at the Mitchell family drive-in. Lansdale's portrait of Stanley's family life and 1958 Dewmont possesses all the detail and authenticity of an old home movie; he chronicles the townspeople's prejudices, dreams, and petty squabbles with deceptive ease. Doing so, he demonstrates that the \\"fine dark line\\" of the title delineates not only the barriers between races and social classes, and between the past and the present, but also the ones that exist between childhood and adulthood, and between spouses and friends.Wise and knowing, A Fine Dark Line is blessed with the same air of authenticity as Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, or Stephen King's \\"The Body,\\" making it a worthy successor to Lansdale's Edgar Award winning regional gothic The Bottoms. Lansdale's writing continues to climb to higher levels--always a distinctive voice, he continues to hone his craft, producing ever more suspenseful, colorful, and engaging work, creating books which are increasingly more personal and heartfelt."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"I enjoyed this novel for it's interesting plot and well-devoloped characters.The young protagonist, his older sister, and his dog spend one 1950's Texas summer learning about other people's lives and motivations, discover the sometimes harsh truth about family and friendships, and uncover and help solve a set of murders from the town's past."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"It's rare that you find yourself really sad when a book ends. This was the case for me in Lansdale's wonderful A FINE DARK LINE. Although it is a mystery, it is also a marvelous look at growing up in what seemed to be more &quot;innocent&quot; times, when the local drive in was the hottest place in town on Friday and Saturday nights. The Mitchell family, including the story's narrative voice, Stanley, is a warm and comfortably stoic group, highly developed morals, a sense of family love, and a warm heart for even those outside of the family (most noticeably in their &quot;adoption&quot; of the Negress Rosy). Buster Lighthorse Smith, who works as the projectionist at the Mitchell's drive-in, is a moody, often caustic alcoholic, who becomes a friend to young Stanley and helps him in his investigation of two murders committed twenty years before. Although this mystery is what drives the storyline of A FINE DARK LINE, it is the development of the characters, including Stanley's friend, Richard, and many other supporting characters, that elevates this book to its level of excellence. One of the murders is solved; the other,well, that's for you to decide. But nonetheless, I wanted to spend more time with Stanley and his family and friends; the wrap up at the end adds to the nostalgic feel of learning about people you knew. A great book!"},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Joe Lansdale, who started his career as a horror writer, is now best known for his hard-biting, hard-edged and very dark mystery and thrillers. The last few years has a offered a softer version of Lansdale who, although still writing mysteries, has decided to deal more with the pains and fears of growing up. A Fine Dark Line is another addition to this lot and, although it is genuine Lansdale, the whole still left me a bit disappointed. This one felt more like the outline for a greater novel than anything else.Stanley is a thirteen year old boy who, during the summer of 1958, moves with his family to a new town. His father has bought the town's drive-in as a family business and that's where Stan will see himself live with his parents and sister. Soon enough, he uncovers a box full of old letters, which will lead him to discover a mystery that has just been waiting to be unearthed.The mystery deals with a couple of young girls who were killed nearly thirty years ago. Their deaths are still unresolved and Stanley, with the help of his sister and the old projectionist, decides to figure things out by himself.Since the book is set in the 50s it will, of course, deal with sexuality, with the black revolution and with movies of the era. Lansdale tries to deal with too much in too little time. There are great echoes of To Kill a Mockingbird in this one (even a Boo Radley-like character appears in A Fine Dark Line), which just shows the kind of thing Lansdale was striving to achieve. The book is barely 300 pages long and yet, it has more to deal with than most books twice its size. It really saddens me to say that this one feels more like an outline Lansdale didn't feel he had to courage to see through.I still enjoyed reading A Fine Dark Line. The book has great characters and some very chilling situation. But the whole thing left me thirsting for more. This is the rare case where the story could have used a little more flesh on its skeleton. As it stands, A Fine Dark Line is an average book by an author capable of much better (like his great book The Bottoms, one of the best mystery to ever see print)."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Although Lansdale's Stanley is few years older than I am, I can say that not much changed in East Texas from 1958 to the 1960's when I grew up. Although I grew up in Austin, Dewmont is like the small towns around the state that I visited as a little girl. Lansdale gets the atmosphere and dialogue dead-on. Of all the characters, Stanley's dad is my favorite. He reminds me so much of men that I knew when I was little---big-hearted and learning to get rid of the prejudices that were taught to them. He provides some hilarious moments as he rights wrongs against his family. This isn't deep reading, folks. It's just sweet, and strange, and authentic."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"This is basically The Bottoms revisited. The story is changed a little bit, but the premise is the same, a coming of age story involving a murder mystery in the gone-by south admist the turmoil of ratial inequality. Like the bottoms, it's beatufuly described, and you really care about the characters, even though some of them are simple and ignorant ( I guess that's what makes them real. )But The Bottoms is much better (in my opinion) and I'm not sure why he even wrote this. Why make an almost carbon copy of a better book?Still, it's lansdale, and it's good. It's no Drive In Omnibus, but it beats a lot of what's out there. Now if he'd only get back to writing the mojo that made me love his work so much."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Just finished reading A Fine Dark Line and I am hooked! This was a completely engrossing, poignant yarn about a 13 year-old boy and the goings-on in his Texas town over the summer of 1958. This was a good old-fashioned murder mystery, coming-of-age, friendship/relationship tale all rolled into one. Kinda reminded me of some of Stephen King's works where a boy or boys are the main character (Stand By Me, Hearts in Atlantis, etc.). I just did not want this book to end, I loved the story and the characters so much! Can't wait to find some more Lansdale books and/or stories to read next."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"After reading Joe Lansdale's magnificent novel THE BOTTOMS, I wanted to immediately read another one of his books. I eventually decided on A FINE DARK LINE, which is kind of an unofficial companion piece to that Edgar-winning novel. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as THE BOTTOMS, but it's still a mighty fine read.A FINE DARK LINE is substantially similar to THE BOTTOMS in its structure. It is a historical novel set in a small town in East Texas, except in takes place in 1958 instead of 1932. The main character is a young boy on the verge of manhood who uncovers evidence of a crime that took place in the town's past, and involves some of the town's most powerful citizens.I enjoyed A FINE DARK LINE very much, because I simply adore Lansdale's writing style. He has an uncanny ear for dialogue, and the working class characters in this novel are so real and vivid they virtually leap off the page. Further, Lansdale is pretty unflinching when it comes to confronting issues such as racism and sexual taboos, but he's able to pull this off without coming across as moralistic or preachy. Lansdale also has a great sense of humor, and there are many laugh-out moments in this book, especially when it comes to the main character's sexual awakening.A FINE DARK LINE is a bit slow and sentimental in spots, and the crime plot isn't as well developed and exciting as the one in THE BOTTOMS. Still, this is a lovely, evocative novel that offers real insight to life in small town America in the 1950s. While I wouldn't recommend this novel over THE BOTTOMS, it is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"A Fine Dark Line","review":"Having read and enjoyed most of Joe R. Lansdale's earlier mysteries, I approached A Fine Dark Line with pleasant anticipation. I finished the book yesterday evening slightly puzzled. I am not sure whether Lansdale is writing the coming of age story in the small southern town, a mystery, or a thriller. All these elements mix rather haphazardly as Stanley Mitchel Jr. discovers sex, ghosts, old dark mysteries, race relations, and child abuse in the small east Texas town of Dewmont.Lansdale is a skilled writer and once again he has created a narrative of power and grace. But the pieces do not fit together and this reader left the book scratching her head, wondering what the point was. The mystery is only partially solved, loose ends are tied up rather hurriedly at the end (the disappearance of Richard and the Roy Rogers boots) and we are not real sure what impact the events have had on Stanley's life. I realize that authors often make statements by not tying loose ends up neatly for the reader, but this narrative had so many loose ends that the reader is left confused as to the ultimate point of the book. The disparate themes in the book are covered by other writers in a much more cogent fashion."},{"Title":"Cocine para sus Nios en Microondas (Spanish Edition)","review":"porque s&oacute;lo contiene recetas infantiles sabros&iacute;simas, pero tiene otras dos virtudes inigualables!1.-El horno de microondas conserva los valores nutritivos, las vitaminas de los alimentos que se pierden cuando se guisan a fuego directo!

Murder, extortion, and more conspire to keep him around and place him in the eye of this hurricane.There's quite a number of problems with the book. It has way too many characters with dull names, making them hard to keep track of. And the plot moves at a reckless, twisty-turny pace, full of intrigues and double-crosses and whatnot, moreso than the average crime novel.
