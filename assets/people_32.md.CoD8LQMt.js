It's dead on accuracy with describing women was amazing and frustrating. I was forced to examine areas of my life that I didn't want to admit existed. It is an amazing guide for growing into the women that God intended us to be. I would reccommend it for all women!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Although Staci's ideas are easy to relate to and give the reader a sense of child-like wonder in a cotton-candy, fluffy-kitty sort of way, it became known quickly that this book is not meant for the serious student of the Scriptures...or maybe it is (if you want to put something to the test). 1st Thessalonians: 21 reads, \\"Test everything.\\" For each Scripture Staci put in her book, I put her to the \\"test.\\"One of many examples of a misuse of a scripture (or misrepresentation, rather) in her book is in Chapter 5, titled \\" A Special Hatred.\\" Mrs. Eldredge leads you to believe that God is talking about ALL of his people in Jeremiah 30:16-17 and then she asks the questions, \\" How will God treat your enemies,\\"...,\\"how will he treat you?\\" This scripture is NOT talking about the Gentiles or foreigners as she will have you believe...it is SPECIFICALLY referring to the restoration of Israel and those from \\"Jacob's tents\\" (Jeremiah 30:18) - in other words, God's people the Jews. Therefore, we don't ALL fall under that category...most of us reading this book probably DON'T fall under that category, unless you are a Christian Jew. Another OBVIOUS misuse of the Scriptures is when Staci is trying to use Ezekiel 28:17 to describe what happend to Lucifer and how his beauty became his downfall. This scripture has NOTHING TO DO WITH LUCIFER if you read the scriptures in context to chapter 28 in the Bible. In context, this scripture is about the King of Tyre who called himself \\"a god\\" (Ezekiel 28:2-3)but he is merely \\"a man\\" (Ezekiel 28:9). I believe the Lord could possibly be comparing the King of Tyre to the once \\"Most Beautiful Angel\\" who fell from his position, (Lucifer /Satan)but we can only infer this...it is not fact within this scripture. Therefore, this perception is based on mere conjecture.Again, this book is interesting if you don't care to get too deep or care that the scriptures quoted are used out of context and are not succinct with the Bible's teaching. This book would be a good example of what NOT to buy for someone who is looking for a book that is Biblically sound. It is obvious that Mrs. Eldredge put a lot of heart into her book but the vagueness and misrepresentations of the Bible's teachings were enough to make me put the book down from disappointment. I ended up reading it to the end only because even bad books deserve an un-bias critique from knowing the book up to the last page. I must admit, though, that in the end I just felt like a child who got an ice-cream cone expecting the whole cone to be filled and after 2 licks, finding the rest of the cone is filled with nothing but air. :("},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read everything that John Eldredge has written and have found each of his books enlightening and wonderful. That being said none can top this book in reaching women on a deep heart level. The female version of WILD AT HEART, this book explores the deepest longings of women to be seen as beautiful and to be desired for the person they are. Co-written with his wife, Stasi, for the female perspective it gives a full picture of the relationships between men and women.For that reason (and many others), men in particular would benefit from reading this book in order to understand the women in their lives. As the authors write at one point, \\"Women are a mystery to be enjoyed, not a problem to be solved.\\" This directly addresses the problem most women find in their relationships as they are labeled too much of this or not enough of that (too emotional, too needy, not smart enough, not independent enough.) This book helps both sexes explore how the differences between men and women can be understood and appreciated in a way that edifies both.At the heart of this book are the principles at the center of each Eldrege book: that there is a battle for our hearts and that we must fight to regain the person that Christ died for us to be. Take the time to read this book and work through the guided journal when it comes out in July. I promise it will be a life changing journey that will open your heart more deeply to Christ and the ones you love."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"John and Stasi Eldredge have discovered some interesting things about human desires. These kept me going as I read the book. However, I disagreed with other statements that were so dogmatically made.For example, I found that I only have two of the three desires that supposedly are universal to all women. I also have one (maybe two) of the desires that are universal to all men. What does that say about me as a woman?Having said all that, I did benefit from the book. It was good to realize that most women do have many of the same suppressed dreams and desires that I do. It was also comforting to acknowledge that God has a plan to develop me as a person by using the struggles and even the things which have brought me shame in the past.I am glad that I read this book and I would recommend it to others, but would suggest that you use some discernment when you read it"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm currently doing a group study of Waking the Dead, my third read of that book, and I think that it is a very good book. I enjoyed Wild at Heart and I'm giving this book a strong recommendation for both men and women alike. I won't say that this offering is as good as Waking the Dead, or as much of an impact to a man was Wild at Heart was, however, I still believe that Christian men will gain a lot of understanding from reading this as I did.There is of course a group of Christians out there that doesn't believe that God actually speaks to people today. Okay for them, however, I'd not listen to them, if God is that silent, they are fools too. As for the Eldridge's style of using books, movies and the like to create word pictures and draw analogies from, well if they are wrong then C.S. Lewis and Tolkien were idiots too I guess. Gee, you'd think John was selling dope on a street corner the way some Christians bash him. Oh Well.In any case, if you liked earlier works by Eldridge, you'll probably enjoy this one too, if not, then you probably won't.One negative reviewer wrote that there is a \\"strange emphasis\\" on spiritual warfare.Think about that one. A strange emphasis indeed. I wonder if Paul ever taught about standing firm against the schemes of the devil or if Peter ever mentioned that the devil is like a lion seeking out whom he might destroy or if Jesus ever mentioned something about a thief that comes to steal and destroy. Ummmm. Well maybe not.Perhaps all this talk about spiritual warfare was just for \\"back in the day\\" after all, if one looks around this planet it's hard to see any destruction, I mean, heck, it's all peace and jelly beans.I give the book a strong recommendation to Christian women and the to the men that love them."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think a lot of the reviews that gave this book five stars never opened their Bible. If they did they would notice how often she twists or quotes scriptures out of context. This book is based far more on movies than on scriptures.For instance in the Bible, Jesus says he is the Bridegroom and the Church is his Bride. This is a continued metaphor that God uses in the Old Test. to represent his relationship with the Unfaithful Israel.The main basis for this book is to lead you to believe that you are the Bride and Jesus wants to be your lover.She goes way past biblical when she says \\"Jack with Rose on the bow of the Titanic, his arms around her waist, their first kiss... Now, put yourself in the scene as the Beauty, and Jesus as the Lover.\\"Stasi is trying to tell us that we are supposed to fantasize about kissing and holding Jesus. ???? I think she didn't watch the movie because Rose was engaged when she had an affair and she had sex before marriage. But according to Stasi this is what we desire... to be a Beauty like Rose."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I've read several reviews for Captivating and it seems like you either love it or it makes you want to throw up. I read it and i have to say it was both suprising and disappointing. It is suprising because John and Stasi definitely understand the importance of family in shaping who we become. They also do a great job of pointing out how God views us. The disappointment comes in, though, in their misuse of the Bible. If the things they said in the book are true and how God really views us, which i believe they are, then they should have had lots of great Scripture to apply. Instead, most of the verses in Captivating were used out of context. In that respect the book was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A lot of people rave about this one. It's good, but I think it can be dangerous for younger girls to read. It focuses on \\"unveiling your beauty\\" (being vulnerable, etc.) as a woman, but that should really be saved for the right man, not just a middle school/high school crush. It can probably be tempting for girls to want to do that prematurely. Also, it can be kind of heavy at times, might not be right for all middle or high school girls. As for the way it talks about femininity and being a woman, I did enjoy those parts. Some of them are beautifully written and I strive for grasping my true femininity. I guess I just didn't love the WHOLE book as much as other people."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My husband of 26 years left me for another woman recently. This book seem to speak directly to the questions and ache in my soul. It helps me to understand why I depended on the love of my husband so much & how I can really fill that void with Jesus. I never really understood before but this book helps me to understand how much Jesus loves me & why."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I recently reviewed the book Captivating:Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge for Booksneeze and let me give a quick synopsis of a few things I did not like about this book.I really disliked the portrayal of women as a whole in this book as being broken, hurting, incomplete individuals. This is a common mindset afflicting women in christian culture. I may not have had a great childhood and neither may have you, but twenty years later I do not need to wallow in the injustices of my life. I believe it is much, much better to fill ones heart and mind with what God says about us as women, as his creation and children. I believe we are all \\"more than conquerors in Christ Jesus\\". The authors play up women's broken needs and incompleteness as needing men. I wish they had played up more the fact that wholeness and completeness will only ever be found in Christ, whether you are a single woman or happily married.I dislike the author's intimidation with and contempt for the Proverbs 31 woman.Several time this chapter is referenced and never in light of the beautiful scriptural example it is meant to be.I dislike the book's focus on emotionalism and fluff.Entire portions of are bent and twisted to build up women's self esteem, tell her she is the glorifying piece of creation all the world was missing, and that she is the incarnation of God (umm...that would be Jesus, not Eve) \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God\\" (pg. 44, Captivating).I wish I could give this book a good review. There is an incredible need for Biblically sound literature which don't play on women's tendency for emotionalism. I want the truth and life found in scripture.Have you read Captivating? If so, what was your take?"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I read this book for the first time about 6 years ago. I had a really hard time with it back then, and when it got to the \\"Jesus is my lover\\" chapter, I was completely turned off. My college group decided last year that the women would do this book. So, I read it again. And this time I decided to figure out why I had such a hard time with it.Lack of Scripture. I actually counted the scriptural references AND media references in each chapter... the media references were more than triple the scriptural references. Not to mention that a ton of scripture was used way out of context. There was one chapter where they used a verse about friendship that honestly didn't fit... I found 17 other verses they could've used for the chapter and all of them fit better than the one they chose.The way they portrayed women was awful. Yes, little girls have wedding fantasies, and dream about being rescued by their knight in shining armor. But really? This book made women seem weak. Yes, women are broken, but all humans are broken. I hated the way they made women seem so helpless.The theology was completely messed up. \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God\\" (pg. 44) ... What? Eve is the incarnation of God? Hmm, interesting since Jesus is the only incarnation of God. Another one I liked was that Eve is the crown of creation. Ok... so since Eve was the last created, that makes her the crown of creation? Technically, mankind is the crown of creation. Not just Eve. Lets not forget the completely self centered view they try to give women when they state 'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me. Creation reached its zenith in me.'.Is something going wrong in your life? Oh, thats ok, just blame Satan/Demons. Not feeling well? You must be under spiritual attack... Don't get me wrong, I'm a firm believer that Satan and his demons play a huge role in life, spiritual warfare is very real. But to blame every single thing that goes wrong on demons? Come on. We're humans, we mess up. We have free will. Because of that, we make stupid choices. Sometimes God himself takes things away from us because of this. God does things for us... even if we see it as something going wrong. Whats sad is that my small group leader really focused in on this section and went on and on about how Satan tried to kill her that day, in multiple ways.When it comes to spiritual books like this, being theologically sound and having a good scriptural base is key. The fact that this book has neither makes it dangerous for women of all ages to read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Yeah, I know, the title of this review seems weird, but I picked this book up to read more about my wife. The only problem is, I definitely don't think this was written for men. So, now that is out of the way, I'll move on...I think this is an excellent book to really capture the essence of a woman. From the guys who brought you \\"Wild At Heart\\" for us men, they really take the time to explain how a woman works and how they can better understand themselves. The reason I said before that it was written for women is because they assume that you understand what they're talking about, probably being a woman reading the book, and that all the concepts just flow. For a guy, its a little hard to understand, but my wife seems to love it.Overall, I think its a great read for any woman looking to explore why they are the way they are and how to deal with the feelings and emotions that come from being a woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book. I felt like the Proverbs 31 woman was portrayed as delightful, attainable, and desirable. I also have a new found understanding about why women are the way we are. I love the story of love and longing that is described between God and his daughters that he has created. If you have a daughter, wife, or mother then you should read this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"For the root of all holiness is romance.\\"I have a problem with that statement theologically and logically. It is very wrong. The authors have tied the idea of the love of God into our modern sexualized views of romance. English doesn't have the same ability to express different types of love the way the Greek can, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. The kind of love in this book is not what I want my personal relationship with Jesus to be about. The church being the bride of Christ does not mean that we as individuals should be desiring a fluttering-butterfly in the pit of our stomach feeling about Jesus.The thing the authors are trying to do is give women the knowledge that beauty is not about the outside, and they are deeply loved by God. Their goal is admirable. The methods are just not okay. Instead of using scripture to heal the broken hearts they apply examples from literature and especially cinema. The problem is encouraging people to live in a fantasy world will not help them adjust to life as it really is. Their point that we need to turn to God to complete us, and not other humans, is right on the money. But I don't find this book freeing. I find it deeply enslaving to a mental concept rooted in fantasy and fluff instead of what really matters.Real relationships are about being a community to one another and helping each other through practicalities in life. Closeness and deep connection do not require the artificial trappings of 'romance' that are pushed on us by our consumer culture. We need to stop being victims and feeling alone and quit looking for Jesus to be a fill in for some movie hero. He's so much bigger and so far beyond that fantasy foolishness!!!The evangelical community has done it again. Instead of engaging the MIND and exploring reason and reality we are pushing feelings and insubstantial fluff. We are taking our view of what our relationship with God should be from popular culture instead of taking our view of what culture should be from God."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think what I really enjoyed about this book is that it brings spiritual truths out and it is really between the reader and God. Stasi and John both use examples of their own lives, but they are constantly encouraging the reader to take it to God. As a 20-year-old, God is still revealing who He created me to be. At this age, I have had to deal with issues that have held me back. This book opened up places in my heart that I didn't even know were closed (God used this book to do so,anyhow). I loved that they brought out three questions that a woman really does ask. My heart affirmed that they are the questions I have asked, and God showed me how He answers them. After finishing this book, I am even more enthused in accepting God's call on my life, and accepting that I am beautiful and irreplaceable. Read the book for yourself, and really see how it affects your heart!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I couldn't even finish this book. Rather than focusing on how we have sinful hearts that should desire what God wants, it tries to get women to focus too much on ourselves. When I stand before the Lord one day, I want to have lived fully for Him, not for myself and my beauty. Too dangerous of a book focused on psychology instead of the Holy Scriptures and our Incredible Lord."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have worked with Christian college-aged women in a bible college setting for eight years. Every year the same identity issues are a source of struggle for these women as the try to figure out not only their futures but their pasts and how the two interact. There is confusion about how to live a Godly life while pursuing their 'calling' and relationships with men and friendships with other women.This book addresses so many of the heart matters that when understood and applied to life can tansform women of any age I believe. If the principles taught in Captivating were used in the lives of Christian women the church would be a different place. Women wouldn't any longer seek approval and affirmation from men and men would no longer be confused about how to support the women in their life. Although this ideal, it will not happen...but as many women as possible should read and apply.I highly recommmend using this in a small group as the materials are difficult and bring up challenging ideas. The accountability afforded in a small group make for lasting changes and comfort and support during the most difficult chapters."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book had a profound impact on my spiritual life. Who knew that God was so romantic?!! I highly recommend it to every single woman ever, especially teens who are searching for meaning and purpose. Some Catholic women may have a hard time being fed spiritually by Protestant material (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but I am a devout Catholic and I was very much inspired. There is no polarizing material contained in the book nor anything that goes against Church teachings (as far as I remember). All in all, a great book for any denomination."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I had a really hard time reading this book. It is just not my cup of tea.

Maybe to some women, but not to me.\\" But as I read more, everything started to make more sense. This book has close ties to the Theology of the Body of John Paul II, but never explicitly so. This book encouraged such a positive change of perspective for me that I ordered 3 copies for other women I know. And then I ordered Wild at Heart (also equally eye-opening) for their husbands. I highly recommend this to every woman I know who is not scared of self-reflection."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The women I have given this to have nothing but praise for the book.The women's class at my church are going to do the dvd series in the fall that gives them a chance to go through it together like the guys did with \\"Wild At Heart\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Wild at Heart was an amazing book and so I was excited to learn that the Eldredges were collaborating to put Captivating together. Like Wild at Heart did for men, it speaks to the innermost desires that women have. Other reviews might leave you wondering if it is worth reading, but I insist it is beneficial to you as a woman, enlightening to you as a man, and a wonderful tool to deepen a marriage.First, you must get it. This book is not a set of rules or a list of do's and dont's. Therefore, you cannot read it as such. It begs you throughout to explore your emotions and their causes. As Christians, we know that we were created with purpose. You have all heard that everyone has a God-shaped hole in their heart that only God can fill. Well, we have to admit, then, that we were designed to need Him. Some adults still don't understand this need, much less the children that we all were. Children have this need, too, and they look to fill it from their mothers and fathers. Because no parents are perfect, we receive wounds when our need is not fulfilled. These wounds harden our hearts so that we learn to do without, to live without, to choke down our emotions with a determination from an idea that the need cannot be filled and that we must \\"grow up\\" and learn to be independent. But, God created all of us, men and women, to be dependent on Him. It's no wonder why we struggle so much. We were literally not designed to be living the lives that we do.This book goes into the subject that all women have at one time or another repressed. It is the first steps to a path of having a deeper relationship with God. It brings light to the cycle of a lot of today's churches that deal with a recurring group of people that volunteer and then get \\"burnt out\\".A very long previous review explained that \\"we don't need to feel good about ourselves\\" because \\"we are all failures, women and men alike\\". While I agree that we have all failed and that we need Jesus to save us, I disagree with the theme of that review that makes it sound like the buck stops there. Yes, we all need to be saved and born again, but Jesus did not just die to save us from our sins alone. He died to set us free from the shackles of our sinful nature. He died so that we, through Him, could come to the Father and have relationship with Him. Communion with Him. Life through Him. If we, as Christians, teach the next generation to live a life void of personal loving relationship with God, then we have failed beyond the decision of Adam and Eve. If you have not been taught that you can have an amazing purposeful intimate relationship with God that satisfies you to your very core then I say read this book. Read Wild at Heart, too. God created men and women differently because he instilled different parts of Himself into each of them so that together they would be \\"in His image.\\" We can only know the complete heart of God when we know all aspects of his personality. So, I say read both of these books to fully understand the nature of our God and where you fit in to His desires."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a dynamic book explaining the great love of God the Father for all people, but most especially women of any age. As a bride groom He seeks us out and wants so much for us, as his bride to know of His undying love for us and how He cherishes us. It's a book that can be read all at once, but is even better if taken section by section and absorbed into your inner being. It is definitely a challenging, enchanting book. I see myself ina different light since reading it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book has been pretty good so far. I kind read through it pretty quickly and learned a bit from it, now I'm going back with a study guide and the journal to make the most of it and I'm taking slowly to be able to really focus and apply some of the material."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Every woman has three core desires: to know they are beautiful, to have an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to be romanced. In the new and expanded Captivating, John and Stasi Eldridge explain how these are woven into a woman's heart and how a woman can uncover the truth that God wants her to know about each of them.John and Stasi start by looking at the fallen, wounded heart of a woman. We see how past hurts and the attacks of our enemy have damaged our view of ourselves and clouded us from being able to truly understand and internalize how God thinks and feels about us. They give practical steps to help us move past the hurts and experience the romance of our King, how beautiful we are to Him, and that irreplaceable role He has set within us.I highly suggest that every woman read this book. We all need to deeply know our Lord and His love and desire for us. I also recommend that men read this book. Often men say they have a difficult time understanding women (after all we are complicated). Men need to know what is happening in the heart of women. This is a perfect way to gain more of that understanding.Get a copy, read it, and let the truths within it change you.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program.

I would pray that you would pick up this book and allow God to touch your heart. It will change your life if you are open to it. I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book and I hated this book.I will start with what I loved about it. I truly enjoyed the writing style of both authors. I was constantly drawn into the stories and the descriptions and I often found it hard to put down. It is an easy read and for that I am thankful. This busy wife and mom can rarely find more than a couple minutes at a time to read. I loved the fact that this book is not your typical \\"Follow these steps and you too can be the best woman, wife, and mother God created you to be.\\" Instead of focusing on what each woman can do to better her life, the authors focus on what every woman needs. She desires to be loved and cherished. She longs to be beautiful to someone. This book reaches out to women in their most vulnerable place, their heart. I found this book to truly uplift who I am as a woman and it encouraged me to reach out to my Lord Father as exactly as I was created. He created me to be beautiful and no one knows that better than Him.However, I found this book to be quite frustrating at the same time. I have no doubt that there are so many women out there who were used and abused from childhood on and I in no way discredit what they endured. I can't even imagine. But, there are also plenty of women, me included, who never endured any major abuse (for that I am eternally thankful). This book focuses so much on women who were abused that one would think that all women were at some point. That is not true. One would also think that all women are over-emotional, soulless, and hurt. This too is not true.I would most definitely recommend this book to any woman who has suffered any form of abuse. I believe it could help her start over and see herself as God created her to be. I, however, would not recommend this book to all the women in my life. I believe this book is marketed to all women when in reality it is written for a certain group.This book was provided by BookSneeze.com as a review copy and this review reflects my honest opinion."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The book captured me at the beginning but towards the end I lost interest. Overall it is a good book and glad that I read it. She has a lot of great points."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This has been a book I had had on my wishlist for years. I had heard good reviews from John Eldridge's book \\"Wild at Heart\\" and was looking forward to reading this book, the companion to it - focused towards women, whereas \\"Wild at Heart\\" is focused towards men. I started reading this book a couple of months ago, and it has taken me a while to work my way through it. Each chapter was short, but slow to read. This is not a book that can be easily read in a weekend. Overall, this book was nice. The book is inteded to look at a woman's heart and soul and tried to address some of the issues that women deal with. Most women have a lot of baggage that we carry around due to our life experiences. This book tries to show women how the past hurts effect us and how we really are beautiful and loved by God.I'm sure this book will be very helpful for some women. I found most of it to be \`nice' and \`a good reminder', but I didn't end up having any \`AHA!' moments while reading it. I'm not sorry I read it, but it didn't quite live up to the hype that my friends had given it when recommending I read it.This book was sent to me by Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their book review program. I was sent a free copy of this book to review. I was not required to write a positive review and the opinions expressed are my own."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The girlfriend and I decided to read the Eldredge books and then switch once we were done. She read Captivating, and I read Wild At Heart. Not sure what to expect at first, I agreed. After diving into Wild At Heart, I could not wait to get my hands on Captivating. As CRAZY as it may seem, I definitely feel that I can understand a woman's heart more. Some things I already knew, some I had no idea, but all around I definitely have a clearer picture on why women feel the way they feel. Guys, don't be reluctant to read this book. It's not a hard read, and you (and your love interest) will be thankful you did! Thank you John and Stasi!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This spring (I'm a little behind...) I read the book, \\"Captivating\\" by John and Stasi Eldredge. This was the revised and expanded version from what came out a few years ago. I was stunned by this book, it truly changed the way I view myself from God's eyes. Captivating was written to an audience of women, challenging them to understand our beloved worth as a woman. My little girl is three years old right now and in the \\"dress-up\\" phase...she loves to prance around in these beautiful dresses and put on jewelery and make-up. The authors encourage readers to find the little girl inside each woman that is longing to just be loved and turn that devotion over to God. It says in the Bible that we are God's heirs, and He is a King, so I must be a princess. God is EXTREMELY captivated by us as women, and as what we can bring to the world. \\"There is a song written on your heart and you must sing it. The world is waiting, needing what it is you have to offer. You must live the life you were born to live.\\" (John and Stasi Eldredge) This book pushes the misconception that women are destined for certain roles, and encourages readers to embrace the uniqueness inside each of us and offer our love, devotion and hope to the world and the people around us. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs to know the precious gift that lays inside them."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is the new revised and expanded edition of Captivating, John and Stasi Eldredge seeks to \\"unveil the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" God has created us to Love and be loved and He has given each one of us a heart that yearns to be close to Him.In this book there are many things that I agree with and many things I had issues with. Overall, I think this is a good read that makes us (as women) stop and think about who He created us to be and How Much He does love us. I do think the book lacked scripture backing in some areas but that just caused me to go seeking the truth in my own time with Him.I would encourage you to read this book and find God - wherever you are in your walk with Him.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program.

Captivating, written a husband and wife team (John and Staci Eldredge) is a great book for women to read about their inner desires and what 'captivates' them.The Eldredge's outline the three desires for women: to be romanced, to play a role in their own adventures, and to display beauty. The book uses a lot of pop culture media to describe who Godly woman should emulate. It is not meant to replace the Bible but as an addition to your studies.I really enjoyed reading a book designed just for women! Lately it has been rather hard for me since I have gone back to work and my husband has been staying home with our little one. As a woman, I feel like that is my role and have struggled with the temporary role reversal. Captivating helped me to understand better where I am coming from and how I can still be a Godly woman and mother. My only criticism for the book is that there is A LOT of media references that not everyone can relate to.

They use both description and exposition, drawing the reader into what is an exciting, investigative, and compelling book.Examples of their use to descriptive references were made in relationship to personal thoughts, feelings, experiences, and revelations from their own lives. A particular example from the book that I can recall was in relation to depictions made toward God answering prayers. \\"The kiss\\" from God that Stasi talks about in one of her latter chapters was a story reflecting God's goodness that I found to be beautiful and inspiring. The imagery also used in descriptions offered of experiences had, was powerful, relatable, and inviting. I was never dismissive of the content, but rather enthralled to read on.Because of the realistic and honest nature of the Eldredge couple's writing, it is easy to become a part of the ideas made throughout the book.There are some aspects of the book however, that I felt could have been left out. Namely: the common and often overused mention to movie titles. This seemed to be distracting within the context of the statement being made, and detracted from the seriousness or validity of the main ideas presented. Likewise, I felt that there was a great deal of overgeneralization. Though it can be valuable to share stories from personal experience, it should be pursued with careful intention.Overall, it was woman's insecurities, fears, joys, and desires as the things being discussed in this book. There was great consideration into expressing the feelings and emotions of woman. There were many moments throughout my reading this book, that I was forced to pause and think about the notions or thoughts that were presented. They were powerful, convicting, and strongly explained. I closed the back page of Captivating feeling satisfied and fulfilled.

I thank God for John and Stasi and the work they do."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The book Captivating by Stasi and John Eldredge is an eye opening novel about the role of a Christian woman. It touches on many topics such as a woman's relationship with God and a woman's influences in her life. The book recognizes the struggles many women face dealing with appearance, self-confidence, and past experiences. It also talks about the power that is unique to women especially in sharing our faith and God's kindness.I liked all the main aspects of the book and the points it had. It was very interesting to learn about a woman's role as a Christian. The book makes you think about your life and how the role as a Christian woman is applied. It made several references to the bible that connected the points Stasi and John had. It was an enjoyable and easy read. Throughout the book, however, I found many things to be repetitive. This could be the authors' way of getting their points across. The book also includes several stories of different young women. It is at some points random. It is hard to keep up with who is who.Overall I thought it was an enjoyable book. For women, it is hard to know our role and importance as Christians. I would recommend it to any Christian woman who is willing to learn and accept others opinions. I would also suggest it to Christian men who want a better understanding of women's importance as Christians. It is important for all of us as Christians to understand the importance of women."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I picked this book up and read it in a week. I loved it. Having grown up in a Christian home I have heard and seen a lot about how the church believes a woman of God should be. I really related a lot to the points that the authors made. I have found that after reading the book I saw a lot of their principals throughout life every day. It's also pointed me back to the Bible, and more specifically to the Old testament. I haven't been able to relate much to God the Father because I've always seen Him as a judge, however after reading this book I realized that I have His characteristics too. God gave me characteristics of a woman for a reazon. I read some of the negative coments others have posted and it saddens me. Some points are valid, howevre I want to tell the women, read it again! I'm finding that it's written for every woman and it's transforming how I view this amazing God that we serve.Read it! Enjoy it!

It has awakened a desire to live a stronger, more passionate life.In the first chapter, they write \\"This book is not about what you ought to do or who you ought to be. It's about discovering who you already are, as a woman\\". I think that pretty much sums it up. Captivating is a book on realizing who you are as a woman of God.I enjoyed the way it is written, speaking to women of all ages.It is refreshing to find a book that isn't directed at dating or marriage. (Though I'm thankful for those, too)It has made me realize again, that God is so much bigger than we imagine and that He loves us with a love that is stronger than we could ever know. How He has created Woman unique.

Reading some of it brought back to surface some past hurts and some pain I've tried to ignore for years--but it was a good thing as it helped me to finally address and deal with those particular issues.

Great for a Women's Ministry Read. Makes you feel really special!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"CaptivatingI was very excited to receive a copy of the book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge. The title and subject really drew my attention, and I was very interested in what the Eldredges had to say. My excitement soon turned to dismay as I read. In order to keep this a review and not another book I will not go into great detail the problems I had with the book. There were some good aspects which I will list first, and then I will briefly describe some of the problems.Before I even started reading I liked the idea of both John and Stasi authoring the book. I thought it would be very beneficial to get a man and womans point of view. A lot of times I just didn't know who was writing so that got a little confusing. They made several interesting observations about Scripture that I had never thought about and thus made me search those Scriptures to see for myself. For example, on pages 48 and 49 they are describing the scene in the Garden of Eden where Eve is being tempted by the serpent. On page 49 they write, \\"Now, to be fair, Adam doesn't exactly ride to her rescue.\\" Definitely food for thought.I appreciated the fact that Stasi was willing to open her heart and share a lot from her personal life. I'm sure it took a lot of courage to actually write her struggles, fears, and past sins in a book for all to read. I could tell she has a genuine concern for women and wants to do all she can to help.The best part of the book was found on page 126. I believe this is precisely what the authors are trying to help us understand is the heart of the issue. They write, \\"Jesus says the first and greatest commandment is 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind' (Matt. 22:37)... It is from hearts filled with love for him that all good works and acts of love flow.\\" I believe the authors are trying to help us understand that for a woman to be truly captivating and beautiful she will love God with all that she is. I absolutely agree, but this brings me to the problems I have with the book.Instead of introducing this passage of Scripture and taking us to an understanding of how that looks for a woman today, they start the book by generalizing how all women think or what they want. Little girl dreams of princesses and fairy tales, dress-up clothes, and tea parties are expounded upon. Too many movies are quoted. (I have never even seen half of the movies they mentioned.) The first part of the book seemed totally unnecessary. Why do I need to be reminded of how I felt or acted as a child. All of that is right and good in its proper place, but how do princesses and tea parties help me to love God with all that I am?The biggest issues I have with this book are over God's Word. I had hardly starting reading when on page 6 Stasi criticizes the Proverbs 31 woman! Then on page 45 Stasi (I think) writes, \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God-a life offering, life-saving lover, a relational specialist, full of tender mercy and hope.\\" WHAT?!?!? The incarnation? Someone please tell me I read that wrong! Song of Solomon was quoted occasionally and there again liberties were taken that I do not believe were accurate. On page 197 the author again writes, \\"Ladies, you are the Bride of Christ.\\" Now I understand that this is a book written to women so the author could have just been using the word ladies, because as Christian ladies we are part of the church. However, since there are other theological issues with this book I'm not quite sure how to read that statement. Then on page 220 the author again writes, \\"He [Jesus] is captivated by your beauty.\\" I'm sorry, but I can't agree with that statement either. There is a lot I could say just on these few quotes, but this is a review not another book. These quotes are just a few examples of why I have problems with this book.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book to anyone. There are too many theological issues. If you do choose to read it, be very careful. The authors make there ideas sound very good and Biblical. That is the problem! They are THEIR ideas! Have a copy of the Bible beside you if you do read Captivating and compare what you are reading with what God's Word says. You will find that Captivating does not line up with the Scriptures. Follow God's Word (not me or the author of any book) and you will find the truth.I received a free copy of this book from Thomas Nelson publishers for review purposes."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I've also giving it to about 4 other women and they've enjoyed it as well.

The only thing I want to point out is this:If you DON'T want a scripturally-based view of who you are as a woman, read this book.

We all fall short of the goal...does that mean we should throw out the goal????New American Standard Bible (1995) Proverbs 12:1Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, But he who hates reproof is stupid.This book is like SO MANY \\"teachers\\" today:\\"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn their ears away from the truth; and will turn aside to myths\\" (2 Timothy 4:3-4, NASB).Come on ladies, God has MORE for us!

Of course, this makes sense because God speaks to all of us in different ways.Take a chance, read the book, it may be one of the best books you've ever read...and may truly release your soul to live freely as a passionate and fulfilled Woman of God."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The message of this book is so desperately needed and is a MUST read for those longing for more freedom and life.

My sister and I read this book aloud and decided the following:- The concepts are backed up with scripture, but many of the ideas are subjective interpretations of the scripture passages.- The middle can get a little redundant, and some of the uses of terms, such as \\"Jesus as lover\\" and \\"romancer\\" can be uncomfortable.However, if the reader focuses beyond the everyday use of the terms, and at the intent of the writers, this book can be a refreshing and uplifting perspective on what it means to be a woman, especially in this day and age. At the very least, it's an excellent conduit for feminine introspection."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This was the life affirming/life changing book I wish I'd had the wisdom to write. It is a wonderful discussion of what it means to be a woman - how women reflect the image of God - and how feminine differs from masculine (and it has nothing to do with long skirts or cookie baking!). The women to whom I've recommended the book are moved to tears of joy after reading it and plan to read it several times. The cover has put several women I know off from reading it - don't know why - but this is one book NOT to judge by its cover. If you are a woman warrior or a woman wounded or a woman seeking to understand her own design - this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book does nothing for \\"opening\\" women's hearts. It is the same Christian dribble over and over again. Same lame stories to back up said dribble. Nothing new here. Nothing to open your eyes, mind, spirit, or heart. Don't waste your time or money!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge is for women, what John Eldgedge's best-selling book, Wild at Heart is for men.\\"Every woman I've ever met feels it - something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does. An underlying, gut feeling of failing at who she is.\\" In Captivating, the Eldredges attempt to explain the very nature of what it means to be a woman: \\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\"The book goes on to explain the way sin has impacted women, and the ways women are often wounded by their parents, society's expectations, the church, men, spiritual attacks, and their own defense mechanisms. It provides hope and a path to healing and wholeness.Favorite Quotes* The vast desire and capacity a woman has for intimate relationships tells us of God's vast desire and capacity for intimate relationships. (P 29)* Christianity changes dramatically when we discover that it, too, is a great romance. (P 30)* Beauty is the essence of God. (P 35)* Little boys want to know, Do I have what it takes? Little girls want to know, Am I lovely? (P 47)* When a man goes bad, as every man has in some way gone bad after the Fall, what is most deeply marred is his strength. He either becomes a passive, weak man--strength surrendered--or he becomes a violent, driven man--strength unglued. When a woman falls from grace, what is most deeply marred is her tender vulnerability, beauty that invites to life. She becomes a dominating, controlling woman--or a desolate, needy, mousy woman. (P 51)* Women who are stunningly beautiful are women who... love truly and honestly without demanding that they be loved in return. (P 145)* All women are uniquely gifted to heal others in their lives become more of who they truly are--to encourage, nurture, and mother them toward their true selves. (P 179)* There is a mighty strength and fierceness set in the hearts of women by God... Women are warriors too. (P 188)* Jesus is extending his hand to you. He is inviting you to dance with him. He asks, \\"May I have this dance... every day of your life?\\" (P 220)Personal ThoughtsThere is great disagreement in our society as to the essence and role of women. So, any book that attempts to define and describe those things is guaranteed to be controversial and met with criticism.John and Stasi Eldredge claim \\"every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things:\\"1) To be romanced - Every woman wants to be wanted, to be pursued, to be loved. They are NOT saying a woman is incomplete unless she has a man who wants, pursues, and loves her. In fact, they specifically say no man can fully satisfy this desire, only God can.2) To play an irreplaceable role in a shared adventure - Women were not created to be boring, busy machines of routine. They crave adventure and want to matter just like men do, but they want to pursue adventure and meaning in conjunction with relationships, as an essential part of a team.3) To unveil beauty - Every woman wants to be beautiful on the outside, but more than that, every woman wants to be beautiful on the inside, and every woman wants to create beauty in this world. I think we (men especially, but also women) almost completely misunderstand the importance and power of beauty. Beauty is essentially a vision of things the way they should be. There is beauty in art, in music, in a garden, in a family laughing together, in an elderly couple holding hands. Beauty is the holiness and grandeur of God. A woman's desire to unveil beauty is an innate desire to reveal the glory of God.Obviously, I am not a woman, and to be honest, I don't have the courage to say I understand the mysteries of a woman's soul. But there is something about each of these desires that resonates with what I know of the women in my life.There's a lot more in Captivating, particularly dealing with the wounds and brokenness all women deal with. I think women will find it tremendously insightful and encouraging. And I also recommend it to every man who wants to understand women better. My wife, Jennifer, and I are going to read through the book together and discuss it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I must admit, when I first began reading this book, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it. I have been on such a rampage lately about the demise of femininity that I was sure this was just going to be one more book in a line of recent releases full of lies and leading more women astray. I am happy to say, I was wrong.It took me quite some time to read Captivating in its entirety, but not because of the book. I was in the midst of chaos in my personal life, and time slipped away, but I found myself carving out every moment I could to spend time in the pages of this book. I have been trying to find something spectacular to write for this review which would nail how I felt as I turned each page and learned more about myself in the process, but there only seems to be one word which fits. I found this book to be aptly named, because it truly is captivating!Women everywhere need to read Captivating to discover the absolute treasure they are to their Father. Men need to read it to have a better understanding of the vast differences between the sexes, and why that is such an invaluable gift from God.Aside from the usual Eldridge trademark of quoting movies some Christians may find questionable, I loved this offering from the dynamic Eldridge duo, and will look forward to reading more from them in the future."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"the most incredible book. completely changed my life.

This book will help you succeed.The authors use \\"romancing God\\" as an allegory, that is, \\"romancing God\\" is like unto romancing a man in certain ways.This is a vulgar de-exultation of God as I understand Him in Scripture.There is no room here for the blood, sweat & tears of a godly woman's life. Nothing to speak of hard working, serving women.The author states some of her own values such as, \\"preferring to venture outside rather than inside the home, preferring someone else doing the dishes, and preferring a good movie.\\"What of her fanciful values when compared to those of the woman in Proverbs 31?The encouragement in this book captivates you to another god ~ yourself.Women will be wounded and mis-guided if they adhere to these captivating principles.This book was among the influential reads that led my sister-in-law to be captivated away from her 26 year marriage and 4 children because she couldn't wear the tiara this prescribes AND love God with all her heart, soul, mind, and strength.\\"Herself\\" got in the way, and \\"Captivating\\" helped her succeed in bringing about a flesh-ripping divorce.Ladies, please find something better to read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Best book I have ever read on being a woman!

First of all, the Elderedges make many generalizations. They seem to think that every other woman has the same problems that they have had.Secondly, on page six, they talk about Proverbs 31. They disagree with this passage, claiming that women are not failures. 2Corinthians 5:17 clearly says that we are all failures.They use many movies as examples, rather than looking to the scriptures.The Elderedges constantly refer to the book Song of Songs, taking it completely out of context. It was written by Solomon to his maiden, and the Eldgedges use it as God speaking to women.They confuse Biblical love with romance.They make many claims such as \\"For the root of all holiness is romance\\" without any \\"proof\\", probably because that is not a true statement.They assume the desires of women are good. No one's desires are good, and it's wrong to make that assumption.The book makes God out as a lover, rather than a holy creator, which is wrong and perverse to think. It is so misleading, and is really dangerous for all of the women out there who are reading this book. As Christian women, we should think of ourselves as nothing, and humble ourselves, not have a self-inflated view of ourselves because of our sex as the Eldgedges encourage. The heresy presented in this book is ridiculous."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Useful ammunition for the psuedo-Christian menopausal former barfly spending time in 12-step meetings searching for a new man to re-do whatever daddy did."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Do not pay attention to those who gave this book a bad review.

It is the best book I have ever read that deals with women and it challanges misconceptions that the \\"religious\\" world has about women. It is all about putting our trust in the Lord as the Lover of our souls and allowing ourselves to have a deeper relationship with Him. It talks about how that He sees us. There is just so much more to this book. AWESOME!!!!

I would encourage you to read John Eldredge's, the co-authors other book, \\"Wild at Heart\\". It touches on everything in this book, and will also help you understand yourself better as a man, which in turn will help you come to a better understanding of what makes woman tick. If you are a male that is into counseling woman then I would recommend this book to you.From my interaction with woman over the years, I can see this book bringing healing to many a woman's life, as long as they give the book a chance and are honest with themselves. I do see some anger in some of the other reviews, but I really think these reviewers are just missing the point.As a man I do find the type of woman that the author tries to lead all woman to become, to be the only ones that I truly find Captivating. And no matter what some people would say, as a woman you are entitled to be Captivating. So buy the book and enjoy becoming all that you can be."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The co. said clean copy and it was completely underlined-though I wasn't upset and took it as a gift from above.."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Every woman needs a copy of this book.

It makes little sense to walk out of a light-hearted romantic comedy and then turn to the Bible to find a series of proof-texts to back up the warm, fuzzy emotions delivered by Hollywood's view of romance. It is time for Christians to become more critically minded about sex, romance, and marriage. We should turn to the scriptures first and ask for the counsel of those around us who exemplify feminine strength. Christians should be the ones critiquing overly romanitcized love, not endorsing it. I could go on but the rest of the book was just too silly to read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"...Have to admit that this book is very revealing....talks about the very core of woman's vision of self and things around her...what the Bible describes as 'wicked is the heart and who can measure its depth' was the ancient author attempt to capture what Eldredge couple did in their book..... SIMPLE AS THAT and yet in agreement what Jeshua said that in latter days the knowledge of spiritual/invisible WILL INCREASE...I was blown away by Eldredge description of Adam and Eve failure in the garden of EDEN --- ABSOLUTELY stunning and I KNOW it was it!

I was compelled to buy it and I am very glad I did. I felt the Eldredges did a wonderful job of taking biblical truths, making them culturally relevant, and revealing God's heart towards women. I found the references to movies and music a much needed open door for the unchurched and sick-of-church. The message I received from this book is one of restored relationship with the One who loved us first and aren't all we of faith to be ministers of reconcilliation? I certainly hope that they develop a small group discussion guide to accompany the book. I would be willing to lead it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge is a wonderful gift for the woman in your life.

I had to read through tears in one chapter, I laughed, I shouted, I praised God, and I even blushed with the thought of Jesus actually persuing me and romancing...me? It's amazing. Beautifully written. The way they used scriptures to enhance their words was brilliant, to say the least. Everything I was facing regarding my wounds, my doubts and the spiritual attack I was under were in this book! I was left in awe and absolutely speechless reading certain parts of this book. Absolutely amazing. Thank God for this book. And God bless the authors! I feel spiritually free and uplifted. I am beautiful and I WILL walk in my Godly authority. This is an absolute read for ALL women. And men as well! I was a little heart broken that the book had to end, but as it did end, I felt utterly full!

Much of the message resonated with me, but several points weaken it. The biggest problem I found was the poor theology and scripture taken was out of context. The other big issue is that this book walks a razor's edge towards teaching self centeredness. It attempts to point the wounded heart towards healing (a very noble goal), but falls short by meandering into worldliness (way too many references to secular movies, music, etc.). It also puts women into a box, citing \\"what all little girls play\\", and \\"what all women long for\\"; while we all have some of the basic feelings described, not every little girl plays princess (though I did), nor does every woman long to be romanced (a good friend of mine hates it when her husband brings her flowers). Regardless of the above points, the book is worth reading if you are a woman hurting and lonely from rejection in your life. Just be sure to have a good Bible and perhaps a concordance nearby."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I read alot and say to all you women out there, you must read this one, it will do your spirit good.

Is that how you see yourself - as a timid teenager tiptoeing through FantasyLand? Idly waiting outside the castle for someone to come along and tell you that your ribbons look pretty and your feet are so dainty?If so, you might identify with the rather meek, child-like creatures these authors apparently think all women are (or want to be). So, I'm not surprised they chose a book cover that looked more suited to a children's book of fairy tales and nothing at all like a book of substance geared toward grown women with adult responsibilities.There was very little in this book that resonated with me. I found it shallow, silly and, at times, downright offensive in its portrayal of women as trite, helpless beings who live only for male attention. As embarrassed as I am to have spent an hour and half reading it, I'm more embarrassed for the people who wrote it.

At what cost?"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"/CAPTIVATING: UNVEILING THE MYSTERY OF A WOMAN's SOUL serves as evidence of the epidemic of confused ideation which unfortunately, finds its way into print.The perennial faults, common to New Age literature, [The CARTESIAN AFFLICTION & The ERROR OF ECCLECTICISM, are made evident in this book, by authors claiming vaguely, to be \\"Christian\\".Even the title reference, concerning \\"A WOMAN's SOUL\\" more than suggests that the SOUL is itself SEXED, or qualified by a gender, and this would specifically make the book unChristian in its theological foundations. In Christian theology, there is no such thing as a SOUL being feminized or masculinized.One can only wonder what system of Checks & Balances such author use, or failed to use, as they compare their proposals to valid propositions.Philosophically, the core difficulty concerns the issue of human IDENTITY. The authors fail to identify SOUL as the human identity, and opt instead for a modernist interpretation of being founded upon SEXUAL IDENTITY. Therefore, if I am born male, my identity is that of a male, rather than that of a SOUL.This fault established, the foundation for nearly everything the authors write is not only weak in its rationality, it is contradictory to even the most simple and basic of Christian doctrine, regardless of whether the reader is either Catholic, Protestant, or any other sect.______________________________________________________THE THREE HERETICAL PREMISES:PREMISE (A): The first woman, EVE, according to the Eldredges was not a creation of God, similar to ADAM, nor was EVE molded from ADAMS Rib as Genesis indicates. According to the Eldredges, the essential premise of their book is that EVE was an INCARNATED GOD, and not mortal as ADAM was mortal.Here is the evidence for that:\\"Eve was given to the world as the INCARNATION of a beautiful, captivating God--\\" p. 44, mid-page, CAPTIVATING by John & Staci Eldredge (paperback edition) [caps mine---BB]Genesis 2: 21--22 indicates something entirely different.PREMISE (B) The second premise of the Eldridges is that God the Father did not send Jesus Christ. This is because even before the generations leading up to Jesus, God had cease to act. The FINAL ACT of God, as claimed by the Eldredges, is that God's final act was the INCARNATION of EVE as a God.Here is the evidence for that.\\"She is the crescendo, the FINAL, astonishing WORK OF GOD. Woman.\\"----p. 25, CAPTIVATING, by John & Stasi Eldredge.PREMISE (C): The third premise of the Eldridges is that Chapter 31 of the book or PROVERBS contains an INFAMOUS ICON,Here is the evidence for that.\\"We're all living in the shadow that INFAMOUS ICON, 'The Proverbs 31 Woman,' whose life is so busy I wonder when does she have time for friendships, for taking walks, or reading good books? Her light never goes out at night? When does she have sex? Somehow she has SANCTIFIED THE SHAME most women live under, BIBLICAL PROOF that yet again we don't measure up.\\"---p. 6, CAPTIVATING, John & Staci Eldredge (paperback) [caps mine---BB]Any objective person, reading Proverbs 31, can see that the scripture claims nothing that would serve as a BIBLICAL PROOF that:(a) Women do not measure up. In point of fact, it was WOMAN who bore the MESSIAH.(b) There is an INFAMOUS ICON described in Proverbs 31.(c) The woman described in Proverbs 31 has SANCTIFIED THE SHAME women live under.The Eldredges, at the least, have borne false witness.The book seems committed to answer common Mass Minded dilemmas, which appear in the earthly, rather than the spiritual woman. CAPTIVATING is consistent with New Age publications, including in a later chapter with address of fantastical and worldly propositions for \\"Warrior Princesses\\". This is itself strange in consideration of Christian doctrine. It only addresses woman as a maiden, or unmarried. It fails to address the status of the married woman.__________________________________________________At the beginning of each chapter, the authors offer several quotes from literary figures of the past, and other personages, as though to indicate that the twisted associations of the author's ratiocinative processes are supported as standard philosphical underpinnings throughout the realm of literature. However, many of such quotes are taken entirely out of context, and others are not even remotely related to the Feminist ideological proposals of the authors.For example, Chapter 3 begins with a quote from William Shakespeare:\\"O pernicious woman.\\"That's all. It isn't even a complete sentence; but by the confused ideation of the authorship, somehow the line of the character in a Shakespearean play, is to be construed to imply that Shakespeare himself held some philosophy that all womanhood is PERNICIOUS. Anyone familiar with the Catholicity of the Bard would see the utter absurdity of such a proposal._________________________________________________Sometimes, it is not pleasant to indicate the massive faults of authors, because a reviewer would prefer to be kind; but if one neglects to review according to facts, and consider reviewing on a factual basis, all manner of nonsensical propositions find their way into print.That such literature has little at all to do with Jesus Christ, or a dynamic and vital spiritual life, is obvious.Is is most certainly New Age writing and that it is philosphically flawed is readily apparent from even the very first line of the book:FIRST LINE: \\"Now we are on holy ground.\\"--INTRODUCTIONHow do the authors determine what \\"holy ground\\" is?No indication is given.How do the authors show that \\"we are on holy ground.\\"?No indication is givenWhere precisely is the \\"holy ground\\"?No indication is given.The reader must assume that ground is \\"holy\\" merely because the authors are upon it, and for no other reason._____________________________________________________If the \\"final ...work of God\\" is the creation of Woman (or the INCARNATION of a God), who was it who sent a Son to be sacrificed for the sins of man on Calvary?In short, the Eldredges just Make-Things-Up.[ see Cartesian Affliction]/"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Our women's Bible study group started using this book this fall but quickly discovered we couldn't continue.

Stasi herself seems to have many issues that are unresolved and if you view the videos that come with the book it is clear that the women in the group need help in climbing out of the pit instead of repeatedly discussing their difficult past (which since I am a former social worker didn't seem all that difficult by comparison to what many women suffer in our world)."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I received this as an \\"audio book\\" gift for Christmas and listened to the entire reading in one afternoon.

It seemed to do a good job of articulating the female condition for those individuals *for whom these generalizations are true.* Unfortunately, not all women resonate with the book's premises, and some feel that it perpetuates gender stereotypes. It also gets very Christian-ese at points and I struggled to keep my attention focused during those parts.The book expands the Eldredge pantheon begun in The Sacred Romance and Wild at Heart, and while those books have been very helpful to me, I've started feeling as though the authors find themselves painted into a corner with their only option being to continue fleshing out the details of their uniquely flavored male/female/spiritual mythos. Perhaps this book can best serve as a conversation-starter: I could easily err if I assume that it's true for all the women I know, but I could also accelerate my understanding of an individual person by asking, \\"What parts of this book seem true for you?\\" Any book that generalizes about gender is bound to draw some fire, but I do still believe that there tend to be baseline psychological differences between the average man and the average woman in terms of deep desires, motivations, etc., and that this book is another helpful tool in gaining understanding."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A wonderfully insightful book about the heart of a woman.

I am alreay buying copies for family and friends and will recomend it for years to come. It is also one that I will be re-reading with my husband. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"First off, I'm a guy. Allow that to change how you take my review however you'd like.I just finished reading the book about a week ago. It wasn't my first attempt. The Christian Student Center I belong to had a girls group class over the book, and I saw a copy lying down in the center. I must say this, it's a real page-turner. I was so disgusted by everything I read that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see the next garish leap of logic. I read about a hundred pages, walking away thinking, \\"Is it really possible to combine self-aggrandizement and fragility to that degree?\\"I kept wanting to finish the book, if for no other reason than to fully understand the type of women that would agree with the material so that I could better spot and avoid them. Finally, I asked a female friend to loan me her copy. I will say this: towards the end, the outrageous claims die down and the book starts to make more sense. But getting there is quite a chore. I kept asking myself, \\"Do women really believe this?\\"-Can a woman really be so self-absorbed as to agree with the authors' idea of ONLY Woman as the \\"Crown of Creation\\"? (I chuckled when I read them saying that Woman was NOT an afterthought of God, because according to the Bible she either was, or male and female were created together)-Is the central theme of EVERY woman's story \\"The assault on her heart\\"? (If you summed up your life story in one sentence, I hope for your sake, for all our sakes, that it wouldn't be, \\"My heart has been assaulted all my life, to the point that it is my life's defining characteristic.\\")-Is the central question of a woman's life REALLY \\"Am I lovely?\\"? Do women not have something more noble, more altruistic, to think about?-If a woman is supposed to exude calm and rest and \\"All is well,\\" what does that mean for female entrepreneurs, female carpenters, single moms who have to work hard jobs to feed their kids, etc.? Are they doing \\"femininity\\" wrong? Are tomboys and girls who don't like wearing makeup displeasing God?-Are the women reading this book really swallowing the outrageous claims of the authors hook, line, and sinker? (\\"No one has come up with a good enough translation for that Hebrew word until us\\", \\"Men being the head of the family is not the perfect order and was only established because of the Fall\\", etc.)In between these major gaffes, the text really seems incoherent. The writers will meander around a topic and connect all sorts of things that don't fit or make sense. I'm also a person in the camp of \\"fewer movie quotes, more Scripture quotes.\\" Frankly, as I read I was reminded of a misogynist tract I read earlier that suggested female communication consisted of telling stories at each other, trying to make each other more cheerful, and occasionally asking, \\"Does that make sense?\\" after a non sequitur tale. When the book itself offered up a variation of \\"Does that make sense?\\", I laughed out loud.Despite everything I've said, I'm not sure I wouldn't recommend the book. There are obviously some women who love this book and think everything in it is true and wonderful. To that end, reading it feels like doing military recon. I'd suggest this book to guys to help them find out what type of girls they want to date and marry. I'd suggest this book to girls and women whom I doubt would agree with it, to see if they could come up with better alternatives.Let me also say that I got a few epiphanies out of this book. I now realize that women believe beauty has utility, and as a person who has long seen almost no benefit to something being more beautiful than useful, this is great food for thought. I also came to consider that our romantic relationships are the closest mirrors of our relationship with God. What is lacking in the latter may cause problems in the former.Overall, I'm glad I read the book, if only to know more about the women that agree with it. However, I desperately hope most women don't see themselves as simultaneously God's greatest accomplishment and the victim of continuous emotional assault. In short, I hope my future wife thinks the same things about this book I do: it's a weird and saddening little tome; thank God the Bible tells a very different story."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book.

Our questions are all different, am I lovely? May not be yours, it may be... am i happy? Do i have what it takes? am i important?This book inspired me to seek Jesus on a very personal level, letting him deal with issues from my past as well. I believe if you read this book as the story it is, without getting legalistic, you will truly appriciate the message of the book.Stasi takes you through her journey...and hopes you will start on yours.The bible is always open to interpretation by the reader, but it is the Holy Spirit who makes the words speak to your heart. It is a living word of God, and The Song of Solomon is an example of that... its not just a pretty song...As for the negative comments some have made about captivating,these are likely from offense, and a negative,critical spirit.This book has brought many women i know closer to the Lord.We should encourage these things, even if it wasn't your thing.The Word of God tells us our words are powerful, that they speak life or death... they either build people up, or tear them down.This book was a builder, it spoke life.We should do the same."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is mostly emotional claptrap. As my daughter put it, \\"I don't want Jesus to be my boyfriend!\\" Women--don't be seduced by this. Your relationship with God and with others, as scripture demonstrates, is much bolder than this."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I read Captivating as part of a Bible study. It was painful. I found it to be too egocentric for my taste. Like other reviewers, I could not relate. I walked away from it feeling like there was something wrong with me because I don't get all gushy over made in Hollywood romance. Other times the book depressed me and made me wonder if I too should be sitting around crying that my father missed my ballet recital when I was 4 or that he paid more attention to my brothers."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Here at last is a book that seeks to give women spiritual guidance without any trite \\"how to be a good lady\\" instructions. John Elderedge's wife took over the writing of this book for the most part and the result is a truly moving work. Let me tell you, I can be EXTREMELY picky about Christian guidebooks (particularly ones aimed at women) because so many of them are written by well-meaning but misguided people who fill the books with unrealistic portrayals of angelic women, not to mention a good dose of the old \\"obey your husbands\\" tripe. Not only does this book have nothing of the sort, but it addresses these sorts of messages directly and reminds us of how beloved we are by God instead of telling us how short we fall of His expectations. When I first read the dust jacket, it alone made me feel as though the author had seen directly into my heart and was answering my unspoken prayers!Eldredge encourages us to be strong rather than telling us to hide behind our husbands or give up our dreams. I realize that there are some negative comments about this book, but I noticed a strange contrast between people's reasons for disliking it: some of them are feminists claiming the book puts women down, whereas others are claiming it boosts women's egos too much! Well gee, it can't be doing both, can it? For those of you who were offended by the book, Eldredge is NOT trying to describe women as fairytale-loving children; she is simply trying to address the need to be loved. The passages in the book where Eldredge discusses female warriors should be proof enough that she does NOT consider women as dainty princesses. As to the people who claim this book boosts the female ego too much...well, I'm not sure what they're thinking, but I can't say that I'm pleased with their comments. I don't see a thing wrong with trying to uplift women by telling us how Christ loves us and I can't understand why some people put down this book for doing so, particularly the ninny who claimed to be from a group called \\"ladies against feminism\\". I feel so bad for the poor woman who said, \\"As Christian women, we need to consider ourselves nothing!\\" That is a very harmful and sad way of thinking. Satan tells us we are nothing, not God; look at His sacrifice for us! And yes, that is certainly due to His goodness and not ours, but it must mean we are worth something if the God of all creation cares so for us. He also made us in His image, so to call God's children, His most precious creation \\"nothing\\" is insulting to the Holy Father as well as harmful to us. As Christians, we must humble ourselves, but that does NOT mean tearing ourselves down.There are many misconceptions with the book, one being that it raises women above men by saying that with Eve, \\"God's creation reached its zenith\\". The meaning of this is not that Eve was better than Adam, but that she was God's finishing touch to Eden, His last masterpiece. And what's wrong with saying that the world would be incomplete without women? It WOULD be rather difficult if there was only one sex, wouldn't it? I also know Eldridge offended some by saying that the word helpmate can sound mundane when applied to women. Well, it can be mundane, if it's misused or if that's all we are. There's more to women than being wives, just as there's more to men than being husbands; women weren't made to serve men. Before any of us were spouses, we were people with our own purposes to fulfill for God, and that unique purpose is still there after we marry. One very huffy person actually said \\"How dare they!\\" when accusing the authors of calling Godly women exhausted. The authors were attempting to address the harm women can do themselves if they beat themselves up trying to be nearly perfect in God's eyes; that IS a real problem that I've seen even Christian authors do.There's also a misunderstanding about the book passage that mentions a scene from \\"Titanic\\" (the one with Jack and Rose at the ship's front) and tells the reader to picture herself as Rose and Jesus as Jack standing behind her. This is NOT meant to be a romantic image of Jesus, as many seem to think; Eldredge is talking about the symbolism of Jack supporting Rose and showing her a new world. (I can't believe someone's complaint about comparing Jack to Jesus because of Jack's \\"belief\\" in fornication. Instead of nitpicking Jack's character, let's remember the fact that he makes the ultimate sacrifice for Rose and encourages her to persevere in life no matter what; sounds Christlike to me!To all the women who have a problem with the portrayal of women here, both the feminists who claim it's not strong enough and the ultra-conservatives who say it's not Christian enough, I give you this line from the book: \\"Redeemed women of God have tender, merciful hearts, backbones of steel, and hands that have been trained for battle. There is something incredibly fierce in the heart of a woman that is to be contended with, not dismissed, not disdained, but recognized, honored, welcomed and trained.\\"Doesn't this sound like a Godly, strong woman to you? I have never heard a sentence that so perfectly captures the essence of Christian womanhood. I've long wanted to be a woman both loving and fierce, and Eldredge practically took these words right out of my heart and put them in her book.There are a few comments in the book that were unnecessary; the offensive \\"three things every woman wants\\" line was a massive overgeneralization and I didn't like the silly comment that many artistic subjects are female because the male body looks ridiculous naked. Excuse me, but there's no need to insult men like that! God made Adam a perfect specimen of beauty too. These comments are outweighed by the good ones, though (IMHO) and the overall message is good. I think this gem of a book has something to offer every woman, even if it's only a small thing. Whether you are a romantic wanting to marry or an independent feminist (or both like me!) I recommend you read this and rejoice in Christ's perfect love for you!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I devoured this book in three days. Although the language gets a bit flowery at times and overly dramatic for me, I did take home some key messages. The main message that stood out to me is that what does being created a woman say about God. What does the creation of Eve say about God? What does your life say about God? Why is God Captivated by Eve and by you? The book encourages the reader to look deeper into themselves and into the Holy Spirit inside to discover what makes their hearts uniquely feminine and uniquely them.I did not get a sense, like other readers, from the book to be passive and to wait to be rescued. I think they point to the contrary, either women are too passive or too controlling. Spiritual battles are fought every single day, and as women they call for us to be active and go to battle with God and with each other to maintain the peace that the Lord offers all believers.Stasi and John look at two visions of Eve, Fallen and Redeemed. The Fallen Eve has to have control and has to keep on tasting the forbidden fruit. We can be the Redeemed, Forgiven Eve not through control, good works, manipulation, or legalism, but through the promises that God offers us.If the reader does not get anything else from Captivating, they will get that God put certain abilities, skills, interests, traits, etc. for the glory of God and to use and to manage them well will be Captivating for themselves and for others."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"By stating what women really want up front, the authors assume that all women are the same -- and that if they're not, they ought to be. I don't want to \\"play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure,\\" this meaning, someone else's adventure (a man's). I've always loved going out and having adventures, being adventurous through life in various ways. Being with a man has always hindered that. Fathers are protective, husbands can be controlling or uninterested in adventure.This grossly erroneous assumption about women from the outset casts the book on a very shaky foundation. By now I'm used to being \\"wrong\\" and \\"bad\\" for not being a stereotypical feminine Christian woman, and I understand that some women really truly are that way at heart. But the authors don't seem to understand that as foundationally as they are themselves, I'm equally myself. Different. Millions of women don't fit their mold, at a core level.I hope future books written by these authors will address all women, not just how they think all women are, or think all women *should* be."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I first began to read Captivating expected it to be based on Christian beliefs. As I continued reading, I found this was not true. The book makes many references to popular fiction (fairy tales, books, movies) while including just enough scripture to be considered spiritual. Even when considering the book from a secular point of view, it did not make sense. It presented ideas that were contradictory to one another and did not address the contradiction. I never felt sure about the message of the book; it went in circles without reaching conclusions."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating is the complimentary book for women to the book Wild at Heart for men by John Eldredge. In it the Eldredges describe the things that every woman longs for: to reveal beauty, to be romanced, and to be a part of a great adventure. They dig down to examine things like why little girls like to twirl around and play dress up. Another component is the discussion of relationships and how women are very much relationally oriented and many times define their well being by how their relationships are going. These may include relationships with friends, a husband/significant other, those they act as a mother to (whether their own children or other people), or their relationships as a daughter.The Eldredges describe how vital it is that a woman develops foremost her relationship with God and fills up the desires of their heart with Him rather than seeking it from other relationships whether those be their husband, children, parents, or friends. Ultimately, they must get those heart desires answered by The Bridegroom.Throughout the book, they use examples from both the Bible and popular movies/books. Some may be uncomfortable with the large number of examples from fiction vis a vis strictly Biblical examples. My feeling was that some of the examples from fictional stories may help the reader gain a perspective on femininity from stories they enjoy outside of the Bible.I was not able to personally identify with some of the components of the book but believe it would be a good read for any woman to gain a greater understanding of the desires of her heart or men who want a glimpse into how women work."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I want to find a woman who is strong on her own, and whose strength will not eclipse mine, but enhance it. Perhaps this is how one comes to be twenty-five years old, well-educated, itinerant in life, and still single. In many ways I am guilty of couch-potato-hood in the realm of romance because I have despaired of ever finding what it is I have sought for nearly a decade. But a ray of hope shines through.The Eldredge's \\"Captivating\\" has articulated possibilities whose existence I had begun to doubt. It claims that women can be both strong and feminine, and it does such a persuasive job that even a skeptic like me can believe it. My girl friends have found their freedom in this book--freedom from lies that have plagued them for years. I have found a cause to fight for, a host of new ways to affirm the women I know, to free them to be who they were made to be. It has been so long since I wept at a non-fiction book, but this one has reawakened a longing I stuffed down a long time ago, a longing for something I thought didn't exist--until now.Women, recommend this to your men. Men, care enough to read it and ask honest, vulnerable questions.ALong"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"No, I'm not a kid, but had to review this tripe.This book claims to tap into the deep, hidden desires of every woman. Let me tell you something, any time a book ( other than the bible) purports to teach something that applies to ALL people, or ALL of some kind of people, it's not true.I distinctly recall the games I played as a little girl, none of which involved being a princess, and being rescued. I was a missionary, an explorer, an escapee, but never the helpless victim. It was a boring role to play then, and a boring role to play now. I believe my childish game in which my brother and I fought until we both agreed to stop ( not because either of us had won, of course) would not quite fit \\"Captivating's\\" enchanting and dull view of woman.Did God create Amy Carmicheal? Or Gladys Alward? They didn't exactly fit the princess category. Both worked like dogs, and neither married. Both were blessed by God.Christian authors who attempt to generalize, and say that this applies to EVERY WOMAN/MAN inevitably run smack into people like me. Or Amy, or Gladys.See, there's good stuff in the book, but ultimately, I felt like I usually do with these books: smacked over the head with a narrow-minded perception of a \\"Christian\\" ideal from which one cannot deviate and be a true man/woman.I also read the author's husband's book, which was better than this one, and better than I expected. However, their joint views are terrible. It seems to be summed up in this1. God has a specific plan for every man to follow, a will for his life.2. If you're a woman, basically, you marry and are take along on that man's adventure.It leaves no room for God having a specific plan for a woman. What about Mary Slessingar, the missionary who broke an engagement to follow God's calling? The fiery redhead missionary of inner Africa? Should she have simply married this man and followed him on His Big Adventure, which consisted of lingering in the more civilized, preached-at coastal regions?Not all of us want to be an emaciated princess ( check the cover of this book...is her midriff bare?) and not all of us are longing for a knight in shining armor. Many of us are out of the tower, and hoping to meet the shining knight, side by side in the midst of battle, both having followed God's call.This book just plays on the whole princess theme, which purportedly is the deepest heart---and I guess the best heart of womanhood. Not to mention that most, if not all of these original tales were written by MEN, who naturally couldn't have the troublesome medieval female troubling them on their adventures, and thus conveniently put them in castles, or towers, or other out of the way places.Maybe this selfish, RESCUE ME idea is just that---selfish, and un-Christian idea that has no actual place in Scripture. Maybe that's why it left a sour taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Although I was initally excited about the captivating study guide, as I progressed I became more disturbed. In Chapter 6, The author relates our relationship to God in a sexual way by using the Song of Solomon. I believe the Song of Solomon to be an allergory of a husband of wife relationship. It disturbs me to think that we could relate to God in such a preverse way. This could be a very confusing study guide for those new in their faith or that are sexually active. I believe this to be a distortion and misinterpretation of scripture. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A must read for every woman searching. This was given to me as a gift during a time when I really needed support and it was perfect. Truly a blessing. I have since given it to 4 women. If you are a woman wondering about worth, beauty and are looking for answers, this could be it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I waded through a ton of these reviews after I had read the book and wow... some people obviously do not understand what the book was about.ONE: as another reviewer said, if you are such a strong woman that doesn't need to be rescued then why do you have a relationship with Jesus? He came to SAVE each one of us individually. And it isn't just a one time deal...it is continual and eternal. Thus, would it not make sense, that God would plant a longing somewhere in our heart too be saved by someone larger than life?TWO: Goodness, I could not believe that so many people were up in arms about the idea of God being a lover. It isn't a new idea and it doesn't mean you dream about making out with Jesus... For instance: nuns. They wed themselves to Christ. I highly doubt they fantasize about having sex with God. Seriously. What is sex but a device, created by God, for two people to become one and unite in love? How does one unite with God? Is it not by accepting him, by bringing him into your heart? By loving him above all else? And knowing that to him, you are beyond precious. How can you believe in the Christian God and the sacrifice his son made if you cannot believe that God sees you individually and loves you in a deep and unique way that no human mind or heart could ever fully comprehend or repay? Why, then, is it wrong to see God as the ultimate Lover? He invites us to have a personal relationship with him and what is more personal than taking him as the love of your life?I know I am his darling and when the world is too much for me and I sit by my window crying, feeling like an utter failure, the Lord is there with his arms around me, letting me cry and telling me it will all be okay, that he loves me more than than I could comprehend and he will never leave.God is an infinite being and it is laughable too think about him in human terms, but that is all we have and he knows that, he made it that way. \\"Captivating\\" puts it across in terms that are easy and familiar. It is an introduction, not a definition. It is aimed at those who have been hurt, who have locked themselves away from God and from men. Not really those who are already firm Christians.THREE: If you were a tomboy, that's great. But you don't have to use a condescending tone when talking about those who weren't. I was both. I played dress-up with my sisters and I caught bullfrogs in the pond. I had dreams of being a hero in wars and had dreams of some handsome man rescuing me. But you know what? I never would have admitted the latter to anyone, much less the fact that such dreams (both kinds) continued indefinitely.When I walk down a dark alley at night in the city my heart beats faster, I clutch my can of mace, and think about the self-defense moves I know. And I never admit to anyone that I would feel safer if my boyfriend were walking with me.When someone says something nasty to me and I choke up, unable to respond, so incredibly hurt that it takes my power of speech away, I am beyond grateful when my boyfriend jumps to my defense telling the other that they just can't speak like that to me. And I am thankful to him for *trying* to protect me and fight my fights with for for me. Key word: trying.Why is that wrong? All through my teenage years and now into my young adult years I was ashamed of these sorts of thoughts. I was a strong woman. I could take care of myself.I have goals and ambitions and they are sensible. I don't need a guy in my life. I have never been deeply wounded by a guy. Never let him treat me as an object or someone less than he. Never would I let a guy talk down to me and in my relationships I definitely play an equal role. (the fact that I have to state these things, to qualify myself, is in itself ridiculous.)This book doesn't advocate submission or the giving over of your will to a man. It reserves that for God (remember, God is your ultimate love). But it does let you feel comfortable, in the world of today, with holding your guy's hand when you walk down that alley-- and knowing that he will take care of you, at risk to himself, willingly. I mean, wow, he IS physically stronger than I am-- and a lot more intimidating. And he gets the cutest look when I tell him I feel safe when he is near.Society has turned the word feminine into something weak, stupid, and obviously unenlightened. It is so refreshing, incredibly refreshing, to read a book where femininity and the desires therein are held up as true gifts from God to the one he loves.So, that's my own little treatise on the book. I give it four stars because it seems a bit hastily written and not well put together, though the ideas are wonderful. And obviously, it isn't the Bible nor a flawless divine interpretation."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have had this book several years now and have read it several times. Its a deep book, making one think, but in a good way. It opens your eyes to show that you are really beautiful, inside and out because that is how God created you. I have friends that are reading it too and we all are getting something different from it. I defiantly recommend this to any woman, any age. It does help you think better about yourself."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"What little girl doesn't dream of one day being swept off their feet by Prince Charming and live happily ever after? These desires are the secret that fuel the hearts of women everywhere. Even though many women dream of this life, there are very few that ever find this type of happiness. As time passes, we begin to lose sight of these dreams and begin to \\"settle\\" for what we think will make us happy. Life events leave us wounded, pushed aside, forgotten, and doubting that true happiness in life will ever be found. If you add to that the typical \\"Christian women's duties\\" that makes for an increased feeling of failure. The message of Captivating is this: Your heart, above everything, matters to God. The longing as a little girl that was once felt is how God created you to be to a woman. Just like Prince Charming who has come to sweep you off your feet, God has come to capture your heart and give you the freedom to live fully just as He created you to live.In Captivating, the Eldredges attempt to explain the very nature of what it means to be a woman: \\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\"1. To be romanced - The desire to be pursued and loved is something that is deep within a woman. It runs so deeply that no man can fill this need. This is a need that only God can fill. Although women search for \\"things\\" to replace that void, it is not truly filled until one enters into a genuine relationship with the Creator of life.2. To play an irreplaceable role in a shared adventure - Women were created for adventure and desire to be part of a team. They want to play a role in the relationship, not be on the sidelines. Women were created to be a \\"helpmeet\\" for their mate and to come alongside them to share in the adventures of life.3. To unveil beauty - All women want to be beautiful inside and out. Beauty is found in many things. Art, music, moments in time... It could be considered a vision from inside each of us that portrays our interpretation of the way that beauty should be. I believe that this perception of beauty is placed in each of us and that it reveals the true glory of God.This book deals with brokenness and wounds and goes into depth to explain how sin has impacted women. It explores the ways that women are wounded that demand activation of their defense mechanisms. I believe that this book is a very insightful read and can lead one to a path of healing and wholeness."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a truly incredible book that so carefully and fully explains what is lacking in most relationships today. This book is so well written that you will have a difficult time putting it down. And it is so very deep and helpful that you will have to put it down and take time to absorb and understand all that is being presented. I so wish that I had this information about the true heart of a woman many years ago.

This New York Times bestseller is the sister book to Wild at Heart. Authors John and Stasi are a testimony of partnership, as they are also leaders of Ransomed Heart Ministries in Colorado Springs, Colorado. They have a built a life in the Rocky Mountains, pursuing their raw passion for Christ's miraculous creation with their three sons.Captivating explores the core of the feminine heart, identifying its innate desires and dreams as Christ's very own treasures. It is written as an invitation to women to join in an infinite and intimate romance with Christ. It also provides testimonies of healing and revival, encouraging the broken and scared to start fresh with a new perspective, that of our creator. For those seeking and attempting to understand the complexity of the woman, Captivating offers fulfilling and joyful explanations. Most intriguing, it defines man and woman's relationship as a chase. Each is driven by this thrill of pursuit, where the man desires to pursue and the woman desires to be pursued.As a nineteen-year old woman, just beginning life on my own, Captivating instilled a new confidence within my spirit. Stasi writes, \\"The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you still feel as a woman--they are telling you of a life God created for you to live.\\" That said, I encourage you to not only purchase, but also share this work with those you cherish, including men. I pray it will enrich your relationships with others, yourself, and Christ."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I really liked this book. It is my 2nd/3rd favorite book. Initially I hated it. I suggested it to several women who had personalities that were similar to mine...strong, lioness-like...We all had a similar reaction \\"hated it!\\". But as I continued to read with a open mind and prayer it was quite revealing. Using the word of God and by being honest about what is truly in my heart (things mentioned in the book) I have been transformed. To the women who said \\"hated it\\" I advised them to continue reading and they have all come back to say \\"I loved it!\\". In order to appreciate this book you must have an open mind and honest heart. There were some things I didn't agree with such as salvation/who are true Christians (Act 2:38, Romans 6:3-6, John 3:3-6).

The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you still feel as a woman are telling you of the life God created you to live. He offers to come now as the Hero of your store, to rescue your heart and release you to live as a fully alive and feminine woman. A woman who is truly captivating.In the book, Staci, along with her husband, John, author of Wild at Heart, states that \\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\" Each of these longings are discussed in detail with appropriate and timely scripture references that give a good biblical foundation for understanding the longings that women experience.My favorite section of the book deals with the friendships of other women and the importance of those relationships in a woman's life. \\"Women friends become the face of God to one another - the face of grace, of delight, of mercy.\\" Though female friendships may hold disappointments and hurts, an inevitable fact in our broken world, deep friendships are so important, it's the way God designed us!I love the idea in this book that God is inviting us to a great romance with him.

Yet, we suffer in our lives because we are kept from fulfilling this destiny. By destiny I don't mean actually being princesses and knights but there's a longing in each of our hearts that a \\"princess\\" longs for, namely: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.

There are a lot of references from movies and pop culture, which is interesting and goes along with the focus points in the book.Learn how to set your heart free, to realize that there may be things in your life that you don't like and want to change to better yourself. If your hurt and need healing this book is very helpful. This book may not be for every woman, everyone has their own opinion on what they need. This book holds a message and that message is that God will always be there to care for us, to heal us, and to lead us in the right direction.

Some of the reviews are positive and some negative, but I personally believe that it was definitely worth the read. The book was easy to relate to. Women of all different personalities and backgrounds still have the same yearning, to be loved and be called beautiful. John and Stacie Eldredge write with a passion to provide information to answer the call of women. Their information is backed up with verses provided from the Bible that show the reasons why God put women on this earth.The only thing that I had a hard time liking in the book was the beginning. I felt that the beginning was very hard to engage myself in. Once the reader moves past the opening, the rest is very informative and enjoyable to read.I recommend this book to all young-adult women. Reading this book applied to my life in many ways."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I just finished rereading Captivating by Stasi Elderidge, and was again reminded of how great it is, and what a needed message it has for women. If you are a woman then I think you might need this book. Here's a snippet:\\"Every woman I've ever met feels it --- something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does. An underlying, gut feeling of failing at who she is. I am not enough and I am too much at the same time. Not pretty enough, not thin enough, not kind enough, not gracious enough, not disciplined enough. But too emotional, too needy, too sensitive, too strong, too opinionated, too messy. The result is Shame, the universal companion of women. It haunts us, nipping at our heels, feeing on our deepest fear that we will end up abandoned and alone...\\"If any of this quote resonates with you then I think you'll get something out of Stasi's book. Her premise is that: every woman's heart longs for three things: to be romanced, an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil. She spends the book unpacking these three things driving home the point that God loves us deeply, something I think we always need reminded of! I left this book with a sense of God's love for me and new insights into what womanhood is all about, even on the second time through!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"Captivating\\" is a beautiful book. It's not really terribly well written, but the themes it discusses are very true and very important. It isn't gooey, doesn't try to placate female suffering with cute phrases. While John and Staci do sometimes generalize about the nature of women, and while many of the hurts they describe are far more extreme than those I myself have experienced, still something in everything they say goes straight to the heart. Don't be turned away if you get to the \\"Wounded\\" section and find that you've never had such horrific experiences as they women they detail. This is definitely not just a book for severely traumatized women. I've a had a good life, and a good family, myself--but still, there are wounds. And I found myself crying over each section that touched some hurt, with just the right Scripture, just the right word of hope and encouragement. It's so powerful because it does speak right to the feminine heart, applies story and Scripture in a way that women need. Over all, it's a really good book, and you should buy it even if you don't think you have huge issues. If nothing else, it's a beautiful reminder of the loveliness of a woman's soul, in an age which always seems to make no difference between men and women."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I would have never picked it up otherwise. I would have never really come across it if it weren't for it being recommended to me since I don't venture into Christian nonfiction too much. With that being said, aside from a few reservations, this book was actually really pleasant and beautiful in many of its parts.I think you have to be a practicing Christian to really appreciate this book, more than I did anyway. I am a Christian, but I haven't considered myself a 'practicing Christian' in a long while now, even though I am a very spiritual person and I have my own personal relationship with God. In this sense, some of the scripture passages went over my head. Even so I was still able to realize what the authors were getting to in some parts of the book.One of the reservations I had when I started reading the book had to do with rhetoric. I was fond of some of the words being used, and some of the notions being talked about. Things like how women were Unseen, Unsought, Uncertain and they had to be Romanced and Rescued. Once you strip away some of the rhetoric in this book, you realize there are some meaningful and substantive fundamental concepts about us, women, and our femininity worth reading about.My next reservation was with the roughness of the concepts. I felt the book was stochatic in many ways. It didn't really flow easily from one part to another. It sort of jumped like a rabbit from one pasture to another... grazing on the surface of each one but not really getting to the nutritious depth of it all. I think even so I was still able to gain some insight into what the authors were trying to explain.So what did John and Stasi Eldredge accomplish with this book? What is the authors gain from reading this book? Well first and foremost, I believe they realized an image of a woman's feminity. How does our culture, society, and the rhythm of our daily lives tame and even at times destroy a woman's femininity, a woman's captivating soul? And how does a woman regain her sense of beauty, captivating soul, and a calm secure sense of self back?First, through a woman's beauty and mystery, both of which lie at the center of her captivating soul. This is what the authors say about these two. See for yourself. While on the surface, these statements might appear a bit mocking and sarcastic even, there's something of use in them, something deep down true about them.'A woman knows, down in her soul, that she longs to bring beauty to the world. She might be mistaken on how (something every woman struggles with) but she longs for a beauty to unveil. This is not just culture, or the need to 'get a man.' This is in her heart, part of her design.''One of the deepest ways a woman bears the image of God is in her mystery. By 'mystery' we don't mean 'forever beyond your knowing,' but something to be explored.Not something to be solved but known with every-deepening pleasure and awe. Something to be enjoyed. Just like God, a woman is not a problem to be solved, but a vast wonder to be enjoyed... She years to be known and that takes time and intimacy. It requires an unveiling. As she is sought after, she reveals more of her beauty. As she unveils her beauty, she draws us to know her more deeply.Whatever else it means to be feminine, it is depth and mystery and complexity, with beauty at its very essence.\\"Secondly, I believe the authors touched on very real dynamics of a woman's soul (as well as a man's). Towards the end of the book they talk about what curses women and prevents them from acheiving their true captivating soul. That plague is 'loneliness' for women, and for men is futility.The book, though, is much more broad than what I have just mentioned here. If you are a woman with a curious mind on how Christianity sees women and if you want to see a fresh perspective placed against that, this is a good book to read. I am a woman and I have a curious mind, and I am glad I read this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved Captivating because it helps you understand what God thinks of you. We often evaluate ourselves by how successful we are or how other people treat us. But God doesn't care what we look like or how well we perform, he just loves us and thinks we are beautiful. Also, that we have beauty, and how we share that beauty...very insiteful."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I would not be doing this book any justice to try to explain it or put into words how good it is.

Will pass this on to others since it was so helpful to me."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating comes with a very nice cover that has a layer of vellum acting as a book jacket, but also acting as a veil for the photo of a beautiful woman underneath. The copy I received was an updated version of the original book with the same title.The authors of this book repeat their main point several times throughout: as a woman, you are created to be beautiful from the inside out. There are several key points which the authors say will keep a woman from showing her true inner beauty, including fear and wounds from others.This book includes several ancedotes taken from the lives of real women, and if it weren't for these being inserted throughout the book, it would have been much too dry to get through. There were also numerous references to movies, but I haven't watched most of them so the references were pretty meaningless.There were things about this book which made me feel uncomfortable. I would recommend that if you are going to read this book, you have your Bible open to check the authors' interpretations of the scriptures against what the verses actually say. I cannot actually fully recommend this book to anyone for this reason.It was also a bit confusing to read this co-authored book because at times I didn't know which of them was doing the writing--and knowing would have been helpful. Perhaps two different colors of ink, or two different fonts, would have solved the problem.Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me with a free copy of this book for review."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm sure the author(s) could've gotten their point across in a 30-page book. It seems like they make a good point, but then they hammer on it for 20 more pages, then move on to the next chapter and go over it some more. Ugh. I'm bored already, but I'm gonna hang in there to see what blows up!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Extremely thought provoking! I'm still mulling it over. The book was easy to read but at times hard to accept. The concept of women's power being in her femininity is a hard one to swallow in today's culture after years of fighting for women's equality and at a time when most women identify their worth with their accomplishments. BUT the longer you think about the books assertions and let them sink in, the more you see the TRUTH in what she writes! Are women today happier and healthier working themselves to exhaustion? I don't think so. Do women feel more fulfilled in their relationships with men and other women? Again, I don't think so given the divorce rate and the unspoken tension between women as they seek validation for their decision to either raise a family, build a career or both. Despite all our efforts to be seen as people not objects, we women spend more than ever before to look young and stay beautiful. Perhaps this book re-awakens a reality that we tried to bury years ago; women bringing grace, beauty, love and live into this world. Their very presence can bring calm and rest to a weary world. When women started focusing on things by striving for success, those wonderful things started to diminish in our culture. You may not agree with the book but it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have been through a lot in my 40 years of life. I always thought that I had to be strong and just carry my sadness with me like a backpack I would pick up every day--it just became a part of my routine to deal with the overwhelming pain and sadness.A friend of mine suggested I read this book. I went into it skeptically because I have read so many Christian-based books that encouraged me, but never helped me to get \\"over that hump\\" of going back to dwelling on past hurts.I am now getting this book for a few of my girlfriends for Christmas. I believe it will help them as it has helped me.I read another review on this site that said the book did nothing for her. Well, to be honest, I believe that God reveals things to you when the timing is right. I have read books that I felt did nothing for me and then an event will take place in my life --and lo and behold the book I felt was useless did in fact prepare me for the event. So I don't limit God's teachings or Word. As the Bible states His Word does not go out void.I suggest reading a chapter or two and really reflecting on what it's said, how it relates to you and then prayerfully asking for God to help you get a deeper understanding from the book.I am still in the process of reading the book, but each chapter has brought me to a higher level. I no longer think the negative thoughts that once plagued my heart and soul. I no longer wake with dread of \\"what's going to happen to make me sad today.\\" I am renewed, I am cleansed and I am free of picking up that backpack of sadness."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have to say I absolutely LOVED this book. I read it last year and then did the DVD series with a small group with my church. I got a lot out of the book itself, but even more so when I was reading it with my group and watching the DVDs. I think this is a very relevant book for women of any age and really encourages women to dig deep and discover your wounds and allow God and God ALONE to heal you. It is very Biblically based and focuses on bringing these issues and the core of who we are to God (not men, money, etc). I have highly recommended this book to many people. A lot of women in their 20/30s that I know have enjoyed it, but my mom couldn't get into it. I think from what I have discovered is that sometimes my mom's generation and older are a little more private, and Stasi does put it all out there, which I appreciated. I think anyone with an open mind seeking God will enjoy this book though regardless of age. Just my opinion though :)"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I don't know why I was drawn to read Captivating. I almost always avoid this type of book-- like I need one more person pointing out more shortcomings in my life as a Christian woman. Thank heavens, it was not another woman saying \\" I have a long way to go but look how close I am to becoming the Proverbs 31 woman---\\"I have to say that Captivating has helped me to gain a new perspective on my own life as a Christian woman. No, it wasn't extremely deep (although I have yet to do the in depth study). I found the book to be insightful and validating. I actually found it to be somewhat calming. God loves me as a woman. It was neither judgemental nor condescending. I also found it to be hopeful. At 50+ years of age, I am not, nor do I have any hope of ever becoming, the Proverbs 31 woman. I have failures, God does not see me as as beyond hope.One more note. The book was written in somewhat of a conversational tone.

I was one of them, once upon a time. Underlining was my way of rereading a passage and imprinting it in my brain. Trouble is, I would have to underline nearly every sentence of Captivating, because nearly every one resonated with some deep hurt or desire from my life.They should sell this in a gift pack with a box of tissues...or perhaps a dozen lace-edged hankies would be more appropriate.The question on the lips of every girl or woman is \\"Am I captivating?\\" Am I pretty? Am I beautiful? Do you want me?It's the reason little girls (and even full-grown women) twirl their skirts.It's the reason there are whole aisles of \\"beauty\\" products at the corner drugstore.It's the reason for face-lifts.For eating disorders.And breast augmentations.It's the reason a battered woman will go back.But it's a question that often is never answered, never even really heard, here on earth.So many women are in a world of hurt, broken by their lack of self worth.But God hears the question.And answers, if we only open our hearts to the sound of His voice.Lest you think this book is about exterior \\"beauty,\\" it's not. It's about how we tend to look for love in all the wrong places. And how to repair the holes left by our past hurts by turning to God.It's a powerful book.

This review reflects my honest opinion and I received no compensation."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating is about the beauty of women who are true followers of Jesus. Written by John and Stasi Eldredge it is a discussion of how they believe that at the core of a woman's heart God has instilled a need to live a life that develops the beauty in a woman's soul which shines through her physically and spiritually. They continually focus on the fact that God loves each woman and that all of God's creations are beautiful. At first I was reluctant to start to read it, I have read so many Christian women's books that seem only to intensify the guilt that I am not 'perfect' and have really no chance of following their instructions to become 'perfect'. However right at the beginning Stasi addresses that feeling by confessing that she also hates those books so, hope begins. I like their take on the phrase \\"ezer kenegdo\\". That God created Eve not as an afterthought but rather as a crowning glory, or final touch, to his creation of the beauty and marvels of Earth. That as an ezer kenegdo a woman is essential and irreplaceable in a man's life. I found that my mind was engaged with this view and all it's substantial ramifications. Although there were some areas of the book that I found I couldn't relate to like some of the chapters of different areas of problems for different women all in all I definitely learned a few things and will read it a few more times for I am sure that I will learn something new each time. I did have difficulty with the many referrals to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" which I haven't read but they didn't really detract too much from the gist of the message. Although the prayers at the back of the book have some relevance, I can't see someone actually getting all the way through the Daily Prayer for Freedom more than once. This book would be good for a woman's group and a study guide is also available. I think 4 stars.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

Booksneeze let me have two books to read this past month, and I loved the books they sent me. Today's book is for all of you ladies out there looking for the divine purpose in your femininity (and for all the guys trying to figure it out.)John and Stasi Eldridge's book Captivating is a landmark book, in my opinion, on the female soul. In poetic, flowing style, the Eldridges unravel the complex design of a woman. I've read numerous tomes on the characteristics of males and females, yet never have I encountered a book that treated the subject so well that I ended it with a passionate admiration of my wife and all the women in my life.John and Stasi show how society and the Church has tried to regulate the role of a woman to simplistic terms and chores, thereby limiting her. By revealing the core desires of every woman--every personality and kind--they prove that women are much more than what they have come to believe about themselves.Every woman wants to be fought for or romanced, to share in an adventure and to have their own, unique beauty to unveil. These desires cannot and should be delegated to social stereotypes, but should be liberated and allowed to be expressed. Than, we will see women as God intended for them to be--captivating."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Stasi Eldredge truly poured her heart and soul in Captivating: Revised and Expanded. With the aid of her husband John, Stasi wrote in this book how all women feel at some point in their lives and how they just want to be loved. She made me think at my own life and why I might feel about certain things now that I do. At the same time she wrote of all the trials she hade been through and how she had to deal with them and still to this day struggles with the pain of her youth.For Christian women this is a must read. It is a guide to show us how God wants us to feel as women, that we are all beautiful and that he truly loves each and everyone of us. That we as women do matter and that we should feel good about ourselves.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it was hard to put down, but at times it was also painful to read. It is sad to know that some women go through life not knowing what true love is, especially God's love.I highly recommend reading Captivating but be prepared to uncover something about yourself you didn't know.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

The publisher has in no way influenced the content of this review, and the views expressed are solely my own. This is a book I've had on my wish list for sometime, so the opportunity to acquire it through the BookSneeze program was seredipity. This book was also recommended by Dave Ramsey, along with many other authors I am reading at present.SUMMARY: Captivating is all about the soul of woman as created by God. Starting with Eve, the authors describe the heart and soul of women, including the fictional characters found in age-old and modern day stories, and the author's themselves. Weaving in references from Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Sound of Music and Cinderella, John & Stasi describe how every woman is built to be romanced, to be an irreplaceable role in an adventure, and to be beautiful. The authors also describe how these qualities affect a woman's relationships with their husbands, parents, siblings, and children.REVIEW: This book is intense, full of material both scriptural, personal, and pop-cultural. It will challenge your view of yourself and how you relate to the women in your life. The few pages the authors use to translate ezer kenegdo from the Old Testament have already improved my relationship with Dawn. As with the other Edlredge book I've read [Epic], Captivating is full of drama, describing modern day, earthly experiences as taking place within a larger context on the spiritual plane. The book is full of adventure and romance as Satan has a particular hatred for woman, God's image bearer for relationships and closeness, and God seeks to return the hearts of His fallen daughters to Him. This book is challenging and eye-opening, but comforting and healing as well. I highly recommend Captivating.Reviewed at [...]"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have always been told to never judge a book by it's cover. Sometimes it is not easy for me to remember those words. Although, Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge has a beautiful cover and beautiful words. As quoted from the back of the book \\"Every woman was once a little girl. And every little girl holds in her heart her most precious dreams. She longs to be swept up into romance, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, to be the beauty of the story.\\" Those words are so true. As soon as I read the back of the book I knew Captivating was for me! At first it was hard for me to get into this book. I don't know if it was because I had a lot going on around me or because I was not in the right frame of mind. But, after the first two chapters I could not stop reading it. I spent the next few chapters nodding my head and saying to myself \\"Yes, I do feel that way as a woman.\\" It was so amazing how John and Stasi put everything I was thinking and feeling into words. They helped me to better understand why I felt the way I do. The second half of the book I spent crying. There were many parts of this book that hit so close to home and I know that I will have a different outlook on many things from now on.

The book talks about how to overcome the lies we've been told and the wounds we've suffered to become to women God desires us to be. You can choose to live the life you were born to live.I enjoyed reading this book. It kept my attention.....what woman isn't interested in becoming more beautiful? I was very interested to read the author's suggestions on how to obtain the life that God has planned for me - how to become closer to Him. I do feel that this book is written more for women who have suffered under the weight of abusive fathers, rough husbands, and even mothers who didn't care for them. I think this book can help provide great healing for them. I was very blessed to have parents who answered my Question with the right words. They adored me and my siblings, did their best to lead us along the correct path, and didn't have a problem showing their love for us. This book was a good thinking book for me. It presented several topics in a way that I had never heard them presented. I also enjoyed the brief insight into a man's life, what his Questions are, and how they pertain to women. The authors have also written \\"Wild at Heart\\" about men - I think I would enjoy reading that, as well, since I am the mother to 3 men-in-the-making. The only thing I really disliked about the book was the constant references to books and movies. I'm not much of a movie watcher, so many of the movies I had never seen and therefore the point they were trying to make was rather lost on me. They did attempt to explain each scene, but I think if I had actually seen the movie it would've been a much clearer picture. I didn't agree with everything the authors had to say, but I would recommend this book to a friend (I actually have a few in mind that I intend to loan this one to).This book was provided free of charge from Thomas Nelson publishing.

'To be spiritual is to be busy. To be spiritual is to be disciplined. To be spiritual is to be dutiful.' No, to be spiritual is to be in a Romance with God. The desire to be romanced lies deep in the heart of every woman. It is for such that you were made,\\" (129).That's right-- to be a \\"woman of God\\" means to let God romance you. And that's just part of what the Eldredges (mostly Stasi) talk about in this book. Throughout the entire book, the Eldredges talk of how God wants women to live out those three basic desires we have as little girls: to be romanced (to be desired), to be part of a great adventure, and to be beautiful.No matter where you are as a woman in life, God sees you as beautiful. He is captivated by your beauty. He desires you to live the life you were born to live and designed to live-- to take part in the great adventure he has planned for you (whether it's motherhood, starting a business, traveling, being a missionary, volunteering, continuing your education, etc.). For those women who are married-- it's no coincidence that these desires line up with the desires most men have as little boys-- for a battle to fight, for adventure, and for a beauty to rescue. One of the things my husband told me when we first got married was that he'd always fight for me, for us (he'd just read John Eldredge's book, Wild at Heart).I love the way these desires fit together when a man and woman are in a relationship. In Stasi's words, \\"A woman in the presence of a good man, a real man, loves being a woman. His strength allows her feminine heart to flourish. His pursuit draws out her beauty. And a man in the presence of a real woman loves being a man. Her beauty arouses him to play the man; it draws out his strength. She inspires him to be a hero,\\" (19).And if you're not married...not to worry. Married or not, God fights for you every day. He wants you. He wants to rescue you. He wants to be a part of your great adventure."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge is essentially about uncovering the deepest desires of a woman's heart. I can remember many of my friends and classmates going crazy over this book when it first came out a few years ago, so I was excited to finally check it out for myself. Maybe my expectations were too high going into it, but I had a hard time making myself finish reading Captivating. It really didn't grab my attention like I thought it wouldIn my reading of Captivating, I was actually surprised to find more popular culture references than Biblical ones (I'm not saying this is a bad thing - I just wasn't expecting it). It also seemed like there were a lot of generalizations. Overall, I thought it was ok - nothing more, nothing less.(Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me a copy of this book to read and review.

Another \\"girl\\" book telling me how to act pretty? Having read parts of Wild at Heart, I knew there would be something more to it than that. What I found is that this book is about the feminine heart - the most important part of a woman's being. It's about why God made women and the glorious purpose He has for them. The authors explore the deep significance of beauty in the heart of a woman, how to recognize and reveal that beauty and then give it to others. However, in this fallen world all is not beautiful, and the feminine heart often sustains many wounds. So the authors carefully guide you through steps to heal the wounds of both personal sins and the sins of others. Finally, the purpose of our femininity is revealed in the irreplaceable role of women in the kingdom of God.As I read this book, although I didn't agree with everything the authors said, I found myself both inspired and convicted to further explore what is in my own heart and to value the inner preciousness of womanhood. I think this book will be understood best by grown women who have some life experience and recognize how different their femininity makes them from men. The authors don't address every aspect of womanhood in their book, but in matters of the heart they do have some excellent wisdom to share.Disclosure: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

I loved the book, but it may be due in part for the same reason I love food cooked with organic and fresh ingredients - the book itself became captivating because of the allure of it's subject. There is a lot of honesty in these pages, and it is presented in a graceful eloquent way but still retains the raw emotion - much like the treasures it is describing.The duo set the scene where the Bible sets it - creation. God creates alongside man an ezer kenegdo, which has been translated from Hebrew to mean a \\"helper\\" or \\"companion\\". But John and Stasi point out that when ezer is used elsewhere in the Bible, it is in reference to a very necessary lifesaver in desperate times. She is hope for the man. And, as a man reading this book, I was spurred on by the message that I don't need an ezer to be a couch potato living a stagnant life; I need an ezer if I am living out a wild faith which throws me in the midst of adventures. I found this book to be a great insight into the hearts of women whom I admire. There are examples of hurt as well as triumph and I have been able to see some of the women I interact with in those stories. I can see this book being a tremendous tool to help understand the whys and hows of these majestic souls.However, I do know that this book, like Wild at Heart, does not apply specifically to every woman. I found when reading that there are some very general statements made which some women I know would not be able to relate with. There is a statement in the introduction which I think is good to keep in mind while reading; \\"So, is a true woman Cinderella or Joan of Arc? Mary Magdalene or Oprah? How do we discover essential femininity without falling into stereotypes, or worse, ushering in more pressure or shame upon our readers?... And that treasure is your heart, your priceless feminine heart. God has set within you a femininity that is powerful and tender, fierce and alluring. No doubt it has been misunderstood. Surely it has been assaulted. But it is there, your true heart, and it is worth recovering. You are captivating.\\"I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their rad book review bloggers program.

John and Stasi Eldridge do a fabulous job of delving into the mysteries of being a woman and encapsulating the true desires of women as pertaining to self-image, relationships, and the way we are viewed by others.One of my favorite sections in the book expounds on the common lie that women have bought over the years: that we are simultaneously \\"too much\\" and \\"not enough\\". We feel we are too needy, too emotional, too weak, too much work for guys to really get to know us. On the other hand we never have enough time, never enough grace, and no matter how hard we try at whatever we do, we won't feel that it is good enough.I love how the Eldridges embrace the natural femininity that so many of us have squelched over the years, and encourage women in every stage of life to rediscover the hopes and dreams they once held, before the harsh realities of \\"real life\\" caused us to store them away for safekeeping.I highly recommend this book. It is a well-written and interest-catching book, and you will come away encouraged to be a stronger, more empowered woman of God!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book written by a Christian couple is based on the premise that a woman longs for three things; to be romanced, an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil. Although, in summary, it sounds quite cheesy, Stasi and John guide the reader on a journey through scripture, literature, and real experiences that tend to lack empirical and statistical evidence yet resonates within the recesses of the mind.That God created man, both male and female, in his own image is an accepted Christian doctrine. The authors take this doctrine a step further by expressing the divine nature of womanhood. He specifically blessed us with qualities that are feminine; relational, beautiful and seeking validation. It is their goal to assist the female reader unveil her femininity and connect with God and her man.Validation is found within the books pages as the authors reveal that God is beautiful and glorious. He seeks to have an intimate relationship with His children. He seeks our honest hearts and implores us to seek Him.It is easy to assume that every woman carries with her wounds that have not healed. Most pop psychology books provide ample fodder that our parents have wounded us. I tire of this mentality. It quickly establishes that our parents are the enemy rather than part of a support system that shaped our diverse personalities and independent selves. This mentality also relieves the grown child of any responsibility to respond differently to stimuli.On the other hand, John and Stasi Eldredge offer compelling arguments for accepting our Divine Nature and infinite worth as Children of God. A God who reserves a piece within His heart that only we can fill. A god who can validate our existence and provide shelter and peace.This book will not appeal to every reader. While reading it, I found gems of truth that resonated within my soul. In my attempts to articulate these truths at a later time, they sound sloppy and cheesy.Bottom line: We possess divine matter. The qualities that are belittled and squelched for the perceived lack of strength are really our divine nature. It is the woman who seeks out relationships and deeply connects to those around her. It is the glue that holds society together. We are the ezer kenegdo, a beautiful Latin word that can not be directly translated into the English language and is erroneously penned as \\"help meet\\" to our husbands, conjuring utilitarian images. In a more accurate picture, we are the part of Adam that he lacks. Together we complete each other and hold a healthy and vital balance of who God is.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] &lt;[...]> book review bloggers program.

This is a book about restoring the heart of women to live full, beautiful, captivating lives as God created them for. It's a book about femininity and God's specific design for woman. It delves into the wounds and lies that steal hearts and reveals the freedom that can be found through God. It's a great book and I would definitely recommend it.I was a little skeptical of Captivating before I started reading it because I knew it had been popular a few years back and I tend to be weary of \\"popular\\" Christian culture - feel good ideas with very little biblical Truth behind them. I also thought that a book about \\"being a woman\\" was going to be overly cheesy and sentimental. I was very pleasantly surprised by Captivating. While there were a few moments in the book I thought were a little over-dramatic, the majority of what I read was biblically based and rang true to me. I especially liked the way they described womanly beauty in this book - as a reflection of God's beauty and coming from a heart at rest in God. So good.

Captivating shows us a woman's relationship with Jesus and how woman think, feel, react, and more. It was a truly an amazing read and I would recommend it to anyone. I am very tempted to read the book written by the author's husband, Wild at Heart. It depicts a man's point of view about his relationship with Jesus.

It starts with Adam and Eve, conveying the importance of women and their role in God's eyes (NOT as a servant of Adam, by the way, but our importance in relationships) It then talks about how living in the world has ruined this, through a variety of striking examples of wounded women. I have no doubt that any woman who reads this book could relate to at least some of them. The authors gently show us how our wounds keep us from our potential, but then show us how God can allow us to reach it in our relationships with him and with others.One main focus is how women have an inherent beauty, the world does its best to ruin it, but with God we are allowed to be beautiful.

I know that I had many dreams as a little girl, dreamed about what I wanted to be when I grew up, wanting to be married, have kids, and many more. As I got older I longed for romance, for a guy to sweep me off of my feet, but yet to get to that my heart, my desires got trampled and pushed aside and it left me wondering, do I deserve the desires that I once had as a little girl?

The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you feel as a woman are telling you of the life God created you to live.

As a young woman who was raised in an abusive home and without a father this book spoke VOLUMES to me. Even to just be able to read that I was NOT the only little girl afraid and hiding in the closet completely changed my world.I have read reviews by some who claim these views are \\"new age.\\" I'm sorry ladies, but they aren't. This book is entirely about how God made every girl to be loved and cherished by her earthly father as a reflection of the beauty she holds in the eyes of her heavenly father. It also points out a few things about the adam and eve account in scripture that I was unaware of. At first I was cautious but looked it up myself. The Eldredge's are entirely correct. They never claim women are blameless. They never claim that women are perfect. No where do they say those things are what make a female child of God beautiful to her heavenly father.This couple is speaking volumes to a generation of girls who have grown up fatherless and without any real identity as women. I'm not a traditionalist and or a feminist. I am your average young woman. It seems to me that these are the two groups that are \\"offended,\\" \\"bothered\\" or \\"outraged\\" at this book. If you are the average young woman, this book will speak to SOME broken part of your heart and will bring you closer to God, your heavenly father. I promise this to you. I have already recommended this book to several friends and plan to continue to recommend it to anyone I meet. I have already seen the amazing things it has begun to do in others lives and I am definitely NOT the same after having read it.I received a paperback copy for Christmas (like I said) and I just downloaded the kindle version so I can always have it on me. Chapter six, alone, I read five times before being able to move it. That was probably one of the most powerfully profound things I have read, aimed directly at my heart, by God, second only to the bible. My hard copy had a million notes in it already and I definitely cannot wait to go and add those - along with many more - into my new kindle version.I can see where this book may not be for my grandmother's generation, but it is certainly for mine. My mother's father died when she was six and I can see a lot of her woundedness from that in her personality. I am working diligently to get her to read it now. The woman I got it from (who loves it as well) is only two years younger so I really feel this book could speak volumes to my mother. I really hope I can get her to read it. Even if you think you don't need to read this because you had wonderful and loving parents, give this book a shot. You may be surprised at the broken places in your heart that it speaks to.READ THIS BOOK!!! There is nothing more I can say to you Open your heart to God's message to you, through this book and enjoy!!! I hope you can learn to bask in your heavenly father's love the way I have.Jo"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In Captivating, John and Stasi Eldredge reveal that Eve (woman) was the culmination of God's marvelous creation. They express the great love and appreciation that God has for each individual woman and speak of the important roles that only women can fulfill. John and Stasi reassure women that they don't have to compete with or act like men. God has a specific purpose and plan in creating women, and He loves them just the way they are. Women can relax and enjoy their femininity and quit striving to be someone they are not. Most importantly, the Eldredges encourage women to sit at Christ's feet and to let Christ woo them--to feel His love and to be complete in that love, as they listen and learn of His purpose for their lives.I am so thankful that this is not another book for women written by some woman who has obviously not served in the trenches. Stasi is very real and admits to some of her own failings as a woman. This is not another book that will make women feel guilty if they are not Martha Stewart, Mother Teresa, and Marilyn Monroe wrapped into one.I highly recommend this book with my only reservation being their unbiblical view of spiritual warfare and their failure to mention baptism as God's plan for putting us into Christ.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their book review bloggers program.

I only wish that the book would teach these through usage of more scripture and less emphasis on beauty although I understand the author says that it is more about inner and outer beauty.I know that between most of my female friends and I, women today are truly simply \\"tired\\". Tired of trying to gain acceptance in the work place, tired of carrying the burden of the family without full support of the spouse, and tired of trying to please everyone in general. It is through these experiences that women feel broken. The cup at times feels like its running low. It is my hope that parents would educate their daughters in value of their existence on this earth. That we are not simply here to rescue everyone else. We too have souls that need nourishment."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Hello!! Jesus came and died for our sins. We have been released from the curse of sin and death, this includes the curse issued in the Garden. I believe that this book should be read in conjunction with Wild at Heart for we can not understand our roles as men and women unless we understand each other.John has taken on an incredible task - to understand a woman's heart. He did the only thing that he could do, he asked his wife to help. They have taken modern culture and showed us the desires reflected in unsaved and saved humanity. Then they showed us how to meet those desires - to pursue a romantic relationship with God.In order to give ourselves permission for this romance, they had to first show us that God needs us - no one else on earth can fulfill the purpose that God created us for. Then they showed us that God can answer our needs, he is the only one that will never leave us, never let us down, he is the deffinition of Love in all of it's forms.Romance and intimacy are not the same as sex. Sex can offer a false intimacy and it can help to keep intimacy in a relationship, but it is not the same as, nor a substitute for intimacy or romance. To confuse this fact is to misunderstand the basic human need for God, because God is capable of intimacy and romance (not always represented by flowers), God knows us and knows our needs - he meets us where we are.I found such a release of pent up frustration when I read this book. I felt such a desire to pursue God and to have with him the relationship that I was created to have. I felt at peace with my role as warrior - to stand over my husband's woundedness and to allow him to stand over mine.The ones who deride this book are by in large narrow minded and short sighted. There is much to be had here - with prayerful hearts and knowledgeable minds, this book is a path to fullfillment. You can not expect to be given everything, you must seek in order to find. It's like the person who comes to church expecting to be filled with the holy spirit compared to the person who comes to church already filled and overflowing with spiritual gifts.Obviously, you must make your own decision about any book, but if you come with an open mind and an open heart - God will fill them both."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The truth must be told! We are many ways different. I mean man and woman. Not only physically but also mentally, socially and spritially. There are many people who wants that women should act like a man. Women can try it and survive very well for that role. Unfortunately, then they will lose their feminity. If you want to keep your job then you should be a hard-working and efficient woman. When you go to home, you should make food, take care of children, wash clothes etc. Very important thing is your looks! You should sacrifice a lot time for make-up and other things which makes you look better. If you are not satisfied your body, you can go to plastic surgery(you need a lost money for that...) There are so much pressure for women.Of cource, men has many difficulties to meet but now I talk about women. Many women are totally lost their inner needs because they only trie to be what beauty magazines, media, Internet, friends and other sources tell them.Allright, I am not going to tell that Captivating book will tell every secret of women soul but it clearly shows some very meaningful things. Captivating is sequal for Wild at Heart which told us secrets of masculine soul. It showed the real place for men to be brave, prepare to fight for right things, save princess etc. This time John asked his wife Stasi to come help. Luckily, she wanted to write(her first book ever) because women can understand much better mystery of their souls. Stasi tells some own experiences on this book which really cut deeper on theme.If you don't believe in God and Bible. You will lose a lot things in this book which use many biblical themes, places and has written on through a view of spritual eyes. Back to Eden, when people lived on paradise everything were perfect. Relationship between man and woman worked well. They lived in respect, peace and harmany. Also God was a very close person for them. Then they fall! Snake betrayed them! Everything changed! Man started to fear and doesn't want to use his power and strenght in positive way. Woman took control, started to use her beauty wrong purpose(prostitution, wilthy magazines etc.) They disconnected with God!Captivating book helps woman to come back a source of their souls. God has created woman which is a crown of creation and represents the femine part of God's heart. There are many things that helps women to find their real desires and heal their wounds. This book is only aid for that. I belive that with help of God, prayer, other women(who has find their hearts back), brave men, other books for this topic and processing yourself, you will find your feminene soul.My women friends are really liked this book which has touched their soul very special way.* I recommand to read book if:* You are not satisfied the model of women what you have seen or living through.* You want know some reasons for that why you're woman* Are interested in healing your wound of femine soul caused by many factors(father, mother etc.)* You are willing to live a real life listening your femine heart what The Creator has offered to youAuthors has made a great work when they have written this book.This really shows many parts of woman reality. There are also chapter for warrior princesses. Good book also for men! Read this and you will get a little more understanding for women's soul. For me this book really give a lot and I cried many times when read this. Captivating is a fascinating and interesting reading experience.Finally, One of female friends told me this sentence that mirrors very well the spritit of Captivating:\\"We(women) are in accordance with the beauty ideal of God!\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In my opinion, Captivating is a 220-pages-too-long version of Smile--Jesus loves you. It has poor biblical references, as has been noted below, and atrocious choices in other references, as well as poor research. They cannot even take the time to be sure to spell properly the names of the characters whom they hold up as examples, even, as with Toula from Greek Wedding, when the name is on the back of the dvd case! In addition, whether deliberately or through ignorance, the Eldredges neglect to point out that many of the movies they cite as such perfect examples (Sense and Sensibility, Little Women, Lord of the Rings) are, in fact, BOOKS, real books, written by people who understood human nature; clearly the Eldredges do not. For instance, I agree heartily with those reviewers who make the point that all women do not, of necessity, share the \\"fairy princess\\" longings the E's propose. Jo March never had the slightest notion that her life should revolve around waiting for her \\"prince\\" to come some day--if she had, she'd have found Friedrich exceedingly disappointing! I think that there are many books, both religious and secular self-help books, and many GOOD novels, such as those the Eldredges didn't read, favoring videos instead, which could give a woman a clearer and healthier view of herself and her place in creation."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I started the book and immediately sighed and said, \\"ah, she understands me.\\" Ultimately, I agreed with their deduction of the basic-level desires of a woman (and man).I am so totally and completely blessed as I had an \\"uncomplicated\\" childhood and adolescence... free from the horrors of abuse and traps of bad (physical) decisions. (Too) much of this book, I felt, was spent talking about how to break free from those pasts and how to not let the past color what God created women to be.I appreciated hearing about how womens' base desires went hand in hand with how God created mens' base desires. It is a testimony to God's amazing design. It was encouraging to read about how we can glorify God as a married couple by embracing our God-given differences and loving one another.I didn't really like the way that they referenced so many movies and stories, although I guess I can see the reasoning - they were pulling examples for the way that the world portrays men and women. However, they were also using those examples as descriptions of our makeup as a woman. I am not much of a movie/tv-watcher, so these references didn't appeal to me.Unfortunately, the book was also missing a certain depth - no challenge to go deeper. It seemed to stay on the surface level.I guess, bottom line is, that the book was ok, but not one that I will keep in my \\"reference\\" library for ministry use."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"To say that this book is excellent does not do it justice. Captivating is well written and is indeed a book that is hard to put down. A book of this caliber,that addresses this much needed subject matter, is a rare find and long over due. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The next book I reviewed for Thomas Nelson's BookSneeze website was \\"Captivating\\" by John and Stasi Eldredge. This book is the female counterpart to the popular, \\"Wild at Heart\\" book for men. Upon first seeing the book, I was pleased with the aesthetic quality. It was a hardcover with a picture on the front, accompanied by a transparent dust cover. It was appealing, and would gain my attention among other books. I wasn't sure what to expect from the book, and while it didn't completely disappoint me, it also didn't leave me feeling like I gained a lot of new knowledge. The book discuses the essence and heart of a woman, what hurts and wounds women may have received along life's path, how we can find healing, and a variety of other topics. It also has an appendix at the back with several prayers, including the prayer for salvation. Although I found some parts of the book to hold new concepts, much of the information seemed like material that I had heard many times before. At roughly 230 pages, it is fairly long, and some of the information seemed repetitive. A few parts of the book that I really liked discussed God's Word and how we can apply it specifically to our lives as women. I also liked the overall theme of realizing who we are in Christ, and focusing our attention on becoming the woman that He would have us to be. Overall, I can't recommend this book, but I think it had several points that were worthwhile."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Enjoyed this book immensely. It validates and gives strength to women everywhere without attempting to change anyonw. The authors direct the reader's attention to our inner selves through biblical references, stories and history lessons. Some of the focus on religion as \\"cure all\\" is too intense, however, the overall message; that the beauty within each woman should not be veiled is powerful and soothing. This book is a meditation for the soul."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a very interesting look at the life of a Christian woman after the Fall of Adam and Eve."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book arrived in great shape and in a very timely fashion.

Attraction is a normal part of life, but I wanted to know how to deal with it as a godly woman.I ended up throwing this book away after the third or fourth chapter! The author gives terrible advice, such as telling the reader she should do things and say things to all the men in her life that will make them feel manly. Ladies, you should not be trying to flatter and make men feel manly who are not your husbands!She also advocates praying with and praying over men who are not your husband in a setting alone. This is unwise advice! If you find a man in a situation where he needs immediate prayer, get a man to pray with him! If you follow the advice in this book, you're setting yourself up for emotional and sexual affairs. Don't be as prideful as this author who seems to think she can fawn all over men and still stay pure!If you want a book that will help you to be a real woman who builds up those around her, check out Shannon Ethridge's \\"Every Woman's Battle.\\" That book will help you, \\"Captivating\\" will hurt you, your family, & the men in your life!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I won't take up much space because so many before me have thouroughly covered about every point, however a group of 3 of my friends and myself decided to read this book and do the study guide, not one of us could finish it - I almost feel bad donating it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a great book for women to discover their purpose and the place where God has ordained them to be.

It is a must read!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book has a christian bent to it but it relevant for the secular and non-secular folk. If women are hard to figure out ... it may be because people focus on the personality of someone rather than the soul. The soul knows the truth and it speaks from the heart and not the head. Dissecting the mystery of a woman's soul is heart-centered, honest, and unabashed in revealing the vulnerabilities underneath."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It is not theologically sound at all. It uses very few scriptures, and when it does they are taken way out of context. It looks at things more through the lens of secular psychology than a Christian viewpoint. It's scary to think that this is being used as Bible study material for young women at churches when it is not based on the Bible at all.

They simply don't understand literary devices used in Proverbs 31. They understand that saying a fool's way is full of thorns doesn't LITERALLY mean that a fool will encounter spiky vegetation in their path.The language used in Proverbs 31 is hyperbole. It's like saying: Bill is as big as a mountain. You exaggerate to make a point. I absolutely believe that it is valuable and great to study Proverbs 31, and we should strive after that example. However, I think the reason is depresses women because they think \\"I can never do all that!\\" Well, Proverbs wasn't portraying a woman who existed. It used deliberate hyperbole to create an example.It depresses women as much as it would surprise people if they actually thought there was a mountain-sized man called Bill!So, you should neither reject Proverbs 31, or accept \\"Her\\" as an actual woman who lived. You need to understand literary devices, especially when we're talking about literary devices used in the Bible."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I hated this book!!

It would maybe be interesting if John Eldridge's research went deeper than the local cineplex or a focus group. There is no research that shows that women desperately desire \\"to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty\\". There is only John's (and in this case, I guess to lend it some weight, Stasi's) insistence that this is so. This is just a rehashing of Eldridge's men's books, this time he is trying to get into the women's checkbooks. This is just another example of a 'Christian' writer that is only trying to move product. Need proof? Why is the book not released as a paperback so as to be less expensive, and so that it would be more affordable to people. That would even be good stewardship of resources (both financial and environmental, as it takes more resources to print a hardback book). John's other books are not available in paperback (except in large print editions). Skip this and read the Bible instead, do not play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure of helping the \\"Christian publishers\\" make money hand over fist while rehashing a story that has already been told in other books."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Slow start...lot's of depth.

As a Christian I watch very few secular movies so the comparissons and references to fictional characters is lost on me. Besides do I want to strive to be like a fictional character? NO. Whatever tidbits of truth are here should of been aligned with TRUTH. I believe the authors have written so many books of fantasy they've lost touch with their God.

If you, like Stasi Eldridge, are tired of reading yet another book that tells you to \\"do these 10 things and then you'll be a 'good' Christian woman,\\" then this book is for you. Stasi keeps it real, and writes with refreshing honesty. After you read Captivating, you'll understand your heart in a much deeper way (why you do the things you do and how to be transformed into Christ's image) and you will feel such a lovely sense of freedom!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating is one of my favorite books. It's a deep an honest look into the heart of a woman and into the heart of the God who made her. If you're looking to understand women from a Biblical perspective, then this is the book for you. And to be sure, this is not a list of rules or a blanket condemnation of women. This is humble exploration of what womanhood is, means, and why so many women seem so broken. This book can also be a bit touchy-feely in places and probably lacks the solid evidence that some readers will be looking for, but if you read this book with an honest interest and a pinch of humility, it will certainly change your life, or at the very least the way you view women. I think everyone should read this book.That being said, however, this book IS written from a Biblical perspective and not everyone will agree with its foundational beliefs and therefore its overall arguments. Though I wish I could recommend this book to anyone, if you're an atheist or really anyone who doesn't believe in the Bible, you'll probably spend more time disagreeing with Captivating's base assumptions than really reading it to learn. However, if you're the sort of person who can entertain an idea you disagree with, I would highly recommend this book as it is a good, easy read and an insight into what Godly femininity really means and where we Christians are getting all these crazy ideas from in the first place."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book came promptly and in great condition.

The creation of Eve is so beautifully described, you can't help but be in awe. It helped me see the things in my childhood and past that have shaped me into the woman that I am today. It also helped me see the areas that I need to give special attention in my own daughter's childhood, so that she may have stronger confidence. Things that I had never even thought of. I also learned to stop and see the gifts that God has given me in an ordinary day. This book helped me to understand that a simple thing such as a sunset is a gift from the Father because He loves us and wants us to delight in such beautiful things. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are a woman recovering from an abusive childhood. You will forever be changed."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was truly an eye opener for me.

Captiving sheds light on the reasons why I felt like I did as a child and why I expected more from men as an adult. I just got out of a relationship that began with this love of my life calling me his queen (which I thought was odd and uncomfortable at first but then grew accustomed to it and was somehow comforted by it -- however, it didn't last, because the first time I questioned him he stopped calling me queen). This man reminded me of Jesus (somewhat) physically and he attests to Christianity and works in a mega-church. Intially, I thought this was it. It wasn't. This book Captivating is an eye and heart opening book. Don't listen to those women who have put this book down -- they are wrong.

It is helping me understand why I have the desires in my heart to look and feel and be beautiful. It is revealing to me thought patterns that I've had since I was a little girl and how they are skewed compared to the way God views me and desires for me to think and live.

This book was one more helpful tool on my path to healing from an abusive marriage. It gives women with low self esteem possible explanations as to how our spirit becomes injured in the first place. It offers ways to overcome that and see ourselves as captivating and see our own beauty once again. This is only two peoples' opinions, mind you, but their personal accounts and references to friends' and acquaintances' experiences give credence to their claims. It didn't hurt that I felt that I had LIVED this myself. I personally liked that the authors also use biblical scripture to support their points.

It made me remember that being feminine is my God given gift and right. Reminded me of the longings I forgot in the midst of trying to \\"serve\\" and being exausted by trying to keep up with the \\"religious\\" views of others. It was freeing and not condeming in anyway. I have felt hopless and like I would never measure up to the figure most religious spiritual women and men will try to tell you to be like. This set me free of guilt and condemnation from those things and reminded me that the Lord thinks I am beautiful and lovely and He loves me, sin and all.

I have several of John Eldrich's books, and have found his powerful insights helped me to better understand myself, so when he co-authored this book for women, I took a step out to see if this could be helpful, in this oft-confused culture, for the ones I care so much about.The response was way beyond my expectations...they all have come back to ME, telling me how they REALLY like the book (not an easy response for MY daughters!) explaining how closely the pages reflect what they feel and have felt - but were so afraid to accept and allow. They are all new in the Faith, and the book has offered the doorway to conversation and prayer together with them. And, I have had the blessed opportunity to help encourage them in their Walk here as a result.The book has helped me, a single dad, better understand the needs of those around me as well. It is solid, Scriptually based encouragement which ALL women need to hear, and men need to understand.

It has done wonders for me. I began doubting God and just about everything I have ever learned (Catholic school girl) once I came to college. I was reaching out to God to come speak to me in some way, and thankfully He sent me Captivating. This book describes why women are the way we are-- we are BEAUTIFUL and DESIRED and STRONG. The authors are NOT saying that we are weak or submissive. Don't get the message mixed up! I think the people on here who are giving the book poor reviews did not quite understand the message fully.This book describes how we, as women, need to be loved by God just as we should love him. We are meant to be feminine because it draws out man's masculinity. This book is NOT saying that we are supposed to be dropping our hankerchiefs for boys to pick up for us. It's saying that we are WOMEN! We like pretty things and nuturing people because it is our very nature. Of course, not ALL women are called to motherhood or want to play dress up every day, but it is true that all women yearned to be respected, cared for, and admired (not for pride, but for qualities). If you disagree with this, then maybe you should look a little deeper in your heart and make yourself VULNERABLE for once! Bring down the walls and let God into your life. I cannot stress this enough, I cannot stress this enough."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I too am baffled by any negative reviews concerning any of John Eldredge's books. The proof of his and Stacey's ministry is in the ever growing 'harvest' of the fruits of the spirit produced by their ministry all over. For those who \\"just didn't relate\\" or think this in ANY way is \\"out of context with God's word\\" or \\"not of God\\" I encourage you to, first examine your hearts,then RE-read it with and open HEART and unbiased mindset and IN the Spirit ( ie. out of the critical, fleshly mindset- that mindset is NOT the Spirits' gift of Discernment) because it in every way IS truth and the books' only goal is to seek out and repair the many broken hearts and grow women THROUGH an intimate, pure, relationship with Jesus Christ. Every woman I have met who \\"didn't relate\\" or \\"disagreed\\" were the exact women who are wounded, stuck in LEGALISTIC religous belief systems and totally NOT real with HIM; women who walk around hiding their true hearts. This book shares how to GET REAL with Our Savior so you can truly Co-Labor with Him. Also, before anyone feels critically toward the book or the ministry,need I remind you: WE ARE ONE and ON the SAME TEAM. (Romans!)Don't get lost in legalism especially when this world is so up-side-down! Again, the proof of how Godly this ministry is will be found in the many, MANY wonderfully changed lives as a result of the Eldredges ministy. For those who think there are \\"few scriptures\\" read again! To those who are uncomfortable with the examples John uses from maintstream movies: Where are you living? HOW are we going to reach a fallen world and broken women if we cannot reach OUT to them with something they can relate to first? If you cannot reach a broken person on some level that they can understand/feel, you will be wasting your time. I PROMISE you, if you are 'truly' seeking an INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP with Jesus Christ, maybe stuck in hurts, wounds that are forgiven but may not be healed,if you are unsure about what it means to BE loved and held by our Savior Jesus Christ then this book is a MUST read as is only the beginning of a wonderful journey with Him-'Cloud 9' 24/7! AND, I know Beth Moore, Stormy Omartian and Joyce Meyer would all agree! Read the book Sisters!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I really liked this book, not because it was written more eloquently than others, not because it revealed to me mysteries of which I didn't understand before, but because it was affirming. Much of what is said in the book you will know in your heart if you are in touch with it. However, after hearing what many churches say a woman's role should be, it is a breath of fresh air to be appreciated and affirmed and have it backed up by scripture and written by both sexes. If you are in need of hearing how precious you are as a woman, or you are a man and would like to better understand the women in your life, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I picked up this book with a bible study group and we got through the third chapter before giving up."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A great book for women (or their men) searching for some meaning and revelation in their lives.Whether your beliefs are in Christianity or not, there is alot to take away and make you think twice at how women view themselves and their relationship with the outside world; And hopefully this will give women everywhere some hope for their future regardless of their past, where they are in their lives or their age."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating was a wonderfull book that opened my eyes to many aspects of women's lives that I didn't know exsisted.

For example, they taught that a woman should seduce a man (in a non-sexual way?) to lure him into a relationship. Then, they used Ruth as their example because she slept at the feet of Boaz before they were married. Then, they blamed anyone who disagrees with them as not believing sex should be enjoyable and that the Song of Solomon is not about sex. What they don't understand is the historical and cultural context of the time of Ruth; that servants slept at the feet of their master. Ruth was stating that she was no longer Naomi's servant but she was giving her life to Boaz to serve him and be under his care; this gave him the right to marry her or give her in marriage as she now belonged to him. It was not a sexual gesture because Ruth and Boaz were both righteous and would not have tempted each other to sin.Another example they gave was to trick your husband by making a great dinner, having sex, and then the next day set up the same dinner atmosphere but when he wants sex, refuse him and say, &#34;Why do you want me? Is it only for my body...&#34; THAT IS UNBIBLICAL COUNSEL! Spouses should talk about their problems and issues and feeling, NOT trick their spouse into understanding what they are perceiving and feeling.They also used the unbiblical belief that bipolarism and depression is a disease caused by a chemical imbalance. This has never been proven medically, if you pay attention to all the documentation for the medical field it all states MAY BE, BELIEVED TO BE, THOUGHT TO BE, COULD BE .... There are no medical tests that can be administered to diagnose a medical correlation between depression or other related EMOTIONS as &#34;chemical imbalances&#34; related to any illness. They are diagnosed by symptomatic anecdotes. They are real emotions that stem from real problems that both can be overcome by Biblical counsel without the use of drugs. Drugs do not address that problem that the emotion is coming from, they only numb you from feeling the emotion. God gave us emotions so we could feel there is a problem and then solve it. Read anything by Jay E. Adams or Elyse Fitzpatrick.Another annoying factor from this book was their constant use of movies as examples- I don't want to read about what this fictional character did or that actor did in whatever movie- I read Christian books for Biblical references and examples- those were few and far between.Therefore, if you have really studied the Bible, you may want to throw the book away. If you have only a partial knowledge of the Bible, you may be lead in the wrong direction. And, if you have no Biblical understanding, you will get a wrong impression. I would not recommend this book to anyone.The authors are well intentioned but give their advice."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is for every woman who has been wounded by life, people, and the church - which covers just about all of us.

It got to the very root of the wounds and how to begin the road to true, lasting, healing.

As if it isn't bad enough to contribute to the dumbed-down and reactionary nature of mainstream American Christianity, Eldredge's work presents an incredibly destructive version of gender relations. Many women want a mate and a companion, not a knight in shining armor, and it is unhelpful for Eldredge to reproduce the chick-flick party line that all a woman needs is a good man to save her. Not only does that idea distract women from searching for fulfillment from the only being that can ever give it to them--God--but it causes them to have unhealthy expectations of men and of relationships. Personal problems that get taken into marriage aren't going to be solved by the mere fact of marriage but rather exacerbated. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book: there's nothing in there that you wouldn't be better off NOT knowing."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Little girls play dress-up and want to be princesses.

It exaggerates the issues about women.I would say, it does have a few good points. Definitely, I have read better books than this."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I read and review a book I attempt to do so as objectively as possible. After all, each book should be taken on its own merits. It is not entirely fair to cast presuppositions gained from previous books onto an author's later works. It is not unusual for an author to come to better or worse understandings as his life progresses. A person whose theology once seemed rock-solid, could, unfortunately, write a book later in life that seemed to be anything but orthodox. I say this to preface my review to John Eldredge's latest book, Captivating. I attempted to be as objective as possible when reading the book, but found it to be nearly impossible. The book was clearly designed to ride the wave of Eldredge's previous success, and most notably his best-seller Wild at Heart. Wild at Heart is mentioned on the front cover (\\"Best-Selling Author of Wild at Heart\\") and the back (\\"What Wild at Heart did for men Captivating will do for you\\"). It was mentioned again in the second sentence of the introduction and was often quoted, even at length, throughout the book (as was The Sacred Romance). There is even an 8-page excerpt of it at the back of the book. While this may provide credibility to those who enjoyed the first book, I found that it cast a shadow over Captivating.John Eldredge has gained prominence within Christian circles as a leading author who addresses issues of concern to men. He has written several best-selling books. Wild at Heart, the most popular of these, is also the most controversial. There have been extensive reviews and examinations of the book and many have expressed concern that it contains consistently poor theology. Captivating marks a new stage in Eldredge's ministry, as it is written specifically for women. The back cover tells us that \\"What Wild at Heart did for men Captivating will do for you.\\" It promises to \\"unveil the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" This book is co-written by Eldredge's wife, Stasi, and represents her first publication.I have little doubt that in a short while we will have many detailed, critical analyses of this book available to us - reviews that will be far more detailed and insightful than any I could write. I do not intend to write an extensive review, primarily because of the subject matter. I could address the theology of the book, but would have no comparison to the subject matter. After all, I do not read many books geared specifically for women. Perhaps I should. Regardless, this book is so closely tied to Wild at Heart that many of the criticisms levelled at that book will apply also to this one. In Fool's Gold, edited by John MacArthur, Daniel Gillespie writes a lengthy critique of the book and levels four main charges at it, saying it has an insufficient view of Scripture, an inadequate picture of God, an incomplete portrait of Christ and an innacurate picture of man. Those all apply to Captivating as much as they did to Wild at Heart.Like Wild at Heart, this book is built around three premises. Every woman wants to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures and to display beauty. The book is roughly divided along these lines. \\"The longings God has written deep in your heart are telling you something essential about what it means to be a woman, and the life he meant for you to live. Now we know - many of those desires have gone unmet, or been assaulted, or simply so long neglected, that most women end up living two lives. On the surfce we are busy and efficient, professional, even. We are getting by. On the inside women lose themselves in a fantasy world or in cheap novels, or we give ourselves over to food or some other addiction to name the ache of our hearts. But your desire is still there, crying out to be set free, to find the life your desires tell you of. You can find that life - if you are willing to embark on a great adventure\\" (page 19). The adventure is written on the pages of this book.In place of an overall critique, allow me to express a few of my concerns with this book:* As with Eldredge's previous books, this one relies heavily on stories and, in particular, movies to express teaching. I counted the movies and arrived at a list of thirty-eight that are mentioned either implicitly or explicitly. Many of them are mentioned multiple times. There were also many references to novels and songs. While there were also numerous references to the Scripture, these were most often drawn from only a few passages and were often used outside of their proper context.* I was surprised to see that the book paid scant attention to those passages of the Bible that particularly address women. I do not recall any attempt to interact with Paul's epistles; Proverbs 31 received only one mention, and it was only in the context of sneering at the church's fixation with that traditional role model. In fact, the only passages that received any significant attention were Genesis 2 and 3. The authors rewrote Genesis 2:18, which most translations render similar to \\"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\\" They turned to a commentary and translation written by Robert Alter and suggested a better translation of the verse is \\"I will make a sustainer beside him\\" (page 27). Strangely, though, they later seem to indicate that a man does have some sort of authority over his wife.* Eldredge's emphasis on extra-biblical revelation has carried over from his other books. In this one, for example, he writes aout a time when the Holy Spirit told him to buy an Emmylou Harris CD for his wife (page 120). He also indicates that the Spirit will tell us when we need a bubblebath, a movie or a run (page 145), if only we listen to Him.* Eldredge rehashes the worst of The Sacred Romance, drawing extensively from Hosea and Song of Solomon and using sexual terminology. He says that God has a deep, fiery, passionate love for women and that He wishes to romance us. \\"Think of one of the most romantic scenes you can remember, scenes that made you sigh. Jack with Rose on the bow of the Titanic, his arms around her waist, their first kiss. Wallace speaking in French to Murron, then in Italian: \\"Not as beautiful as you.\\" Aragorn, standing with Arwen in the moonlight on the bridge in Rivendell, declaring his love for her. Edward returning for Elinor in Sense and Sensibility, and professor Behr returning for Jo at the end of Little Women. Now, put yourself in the scene as the Beauty, and Jesus as the Lover\\" (page 114). This clearly goes far beyond the biblical metaphors for God's love.* The authors tell us that the women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus are mentioned because of their vulnerability (page 155). The ridiculous teaching about Ruth, first printed in Wild at Heart is repeated here.* Ironically, while God is presented as a wild Romancer, He is also presented in an emasculated form. We are told that God has been wooing you. We are told that \\"you are meant to fill a place in the heart of God no one and nothing else can fill. He longs for you\\" (page 120). This almost seems to indicate that God needs us to make His joy and satisfaction complete. There are often several references to our need to minister to the heart of Jesus through our worship. All of this portrays an inaccurate understanding of God.* There is a strange emphasis on spiritual warfare. Stasi writes about dizzy spells which she felt were caused by Satan. There are multiple references to binding Satan and casting him and his minions away.For sake of brevity I will cease. While some of these are only minor concerns, others are clearly more significant. Overall, this book is little more than Wild at Heart rewritten for women - with a soft, feminine cover in place of the harsh, masculine one. Like its predecessor it contains far too much poor theology and draws as much from popular culture as it does from the Word of God. While there was some benefit for me in reading about the hearts of women, there must be better resources available that would do this in a more biblical manner. Despite the risk of stating the obvious, I would caution Christians against reading this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"great book for women, and for men who want to understand women. very affirming, uplifting, and encouraging. one of the most important books for Christian women out there!!!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was a gift for a group of pastors wives, I personally have not read it but they were all pleased to receive it!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a great book to help you understand why you have certain struggles as a woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"NO stars!\\"Every woman's three core desires are: to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures and to display beauty.\\"I am apparently not \\"every woman\\", as my core desires are: to be taken seriously, take the LEAD in my own adventures, and to display competence.This book does a grave disservice to every woman in this country who is trying to lead a full and rewarding life on her own merits.

It is, in my opinion, a poorly written jumble of pseudo-theology, self-help, and woman-bashing.This book is an appalling product of the patriarchy, with no other purpose than to subjugate women.

For us, it is disturbing that Christians are eager to jump on the historical bandwagon of spiritualizing patriarchy. In reality, almost all the so-called \\"natural\\" characteristics of women and men are socially developed over time. It wasn't too long ago that Christians twisted God's message found in the Bible to justify slavery and racism as well. I encourage Christian readers to delve into history and see how much adventure, leadership, and agency women have had in early centuries of the faith and throughout history, as well as how institutionalized Christianity conformed to Roman society's fervent patriarchy, just as it seems to do today. Why is John and Stasi Eldridge's and many others' message of Christian patriarchy so seductive? For many men, it is comforting to hear that they deserve, by divine decree, the priviledges and authority society has granted them. For many women, it is comforting to hear that they can cease struggling and succumb to the existing patriarchy around them (even and especially if this is a benevolent, Christian patriarchy). I admit I'm being harsh in my treatment of this book, and I concede that the chapter on recovery from traumas such as sexual abuse is moving. However, the main argument that men and women are spiritually different in their needs, capabilities, and destinies contradicts history, science, the world around us, and above all, Jesus' life and teachings."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"After reading some of the reviews I'm a little saddened by this.

Some of my friends have really enjoyed it, but I don't think this book is for everyone.What turned me off to it was the writing style, the redundancy, lack of depth, and misused bible references.Chapter 7 starts off asking us to picure our favorite love story/movie and put yourself in the girl's position and God as the guy. She used quotes from Song of Solomon throughout the chapter to illustrate our relationship with God. I just thought she wasn't careful enough. I think it's important to have a loving relationship with God, but should we really think of him as a lover? It just has implications that need to be qualified. Also, Song of Solomon is a book in the Bible that's about a real, literal man and woman's relationship as it progresses from the start to marriage and sex. Should we really use that book to talk about our relationship with God?Ultimately, the 3 main ideas of what women desire (to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventure, and to display beauty) are right on and should be embraced by women.

I picked it up with some reservations, but then I couldn't put it down. I've been in evangelical churches all my life, and the extent of the teaching that \\"God loves me\\" has always been limited to Christ's death on the cross, and God's desire that I live according to His commands. Both of which are priceless and absolutely true, but only part of the truth.THIS is the God I never learned about growing up - and oh, does it open up wonderful possibilities of walking with Him. To those who claim the Eldredges take Scripture out of context, I say that this is the first time I've heard many of those verses IN context - the whole context. And I love their use of so-called \\"secular\\" movies and music - I instantly understood, in a way I'd never understood before, so many principles. Whether I liked the movies or not.God has taken me on a journey for the past several years of teaching me His voice, and showing me far more of His character and His very personal love for me than I'd ever known. I've learned that His interests and care for my moment-by-moment life far exceed anything I would have dared to dream. It's been an amazing journey - and it was an incredible experience to see it all summed up in this book.Do I agree with every single point of view in Captivating? No - at least not yet. But it brings together, in an absolutely unprecedented way, all that God has been teaching me. Yes, it challenges much of the traditional, and quite honestly impersonal, aspects I've always been taught about God. And it's about time someone took us further and deeper...To those who hate the book, I simply ask - what if it is, indeed, so wonderfully true?"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Are you tired of being let down time and again? Want to know why you long to have that need met? Want to know where it came from and how to truly fill it? You can't get it from people on this earth, but this book will lead you to know where you can find it and why you long for the truth.This book has helped me realize that my husband is not the source of my happiness. My children will not make me happy. My friends will make me cry. But there is one Person who needs me just as much as I need Him, if not more. It makes me want to fight for what's right and what I need in my life instead of letting the emotions of the day guide me to whatever the outcome will be. Granted, I still have my times, but at least I can fight back for the truth.I hope this book will teach you how to live instead of letting live. It will make your family happier in the end. AND you will see the fruits of your labor. I guarantee it, if you follow Him."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read many of the reviews concerning captivating. Personally I found it to be a great read and very good bible study. I was able to study this with over 200 women and saw many face challenges and things they had allowed to be buried for years. Some who had endured rape, molestation, bad parenting and other types of relationships were able to connect with a part of their femininity they had lost. There was a deeper understanding of the cresendo of creation concerning woman....well written throughout the book. The book ties scripture, everyday life experiences and even movies to help with application. I do realize while many embrace this book, many do not. I think it is difficult sometimes for us to admit that we are missing something, difficult to come to terms because facing truth sometimes can be painful and many of us find comfort in status quo or the reality that we have made for ourselves for years. I truly believe this book was a gift to women in so many ways. I had given it to friend who after reading the first three chapters was angry saying the writers were generalizing all women and that she didn't feel any of that. She wanted to throw the book out of the window...she was so angry with me for book. I allowed her to vent and suggested she not read it if it is not for her. Well about a week later she called to say she was sorry. She really did not want to admit some of the things from the book because it would cause her to make some changes, admit some things are wrong, and confront some issues in her life. I would challenge any woman to read this book with an open mind and not from a critical standpoint.There is so much in us women that needs to come forth and again Captivating in a biblical view ministers to the heart of a woman!!! For those who like my friend wanted to throw it out the window or get a refund I challenge you and admonish you to pick it back up again and feast on this gift.FSATAT!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"WOW! This book not only gets to the heart of what I often feel it reminds me that the only antidote to feeling alone, unlovable, unwanted and... is to find my answers in my Savior, Fiance, and Lord. It gives real life examples from the authors' lives as well as other people. The Eldredges cover a lot of territory in these 200+ pages. They touch on issues of identity, Spiritual warfare, wounds from dysfunctional birth families and many other areas. This book only skims the surface in many areas as its main purpose is to help women see more clearly who God intended us to be in a general sense and for us as women to understand the role God designed men to play in our lives and us to play in theirs. I think this book could also help men to get a deeper glimpse at the things that we as women often keep buried between ourselves and hopefully God because we feel that the men just don't get it.Maybe they do, maybe they don't but one of the points in the book is that we need to look to God, our Creator, for the true answer to our nagging questions regarding our worth as a man or a woman. The following quotes illustrate some of what the authors have to say on this topic.\\"A man's deepest question is, \`Do I have what it takes?'.... A woman's is, \`Am I lovely?'....We can't wait until we feel safe to love and invite.... God calls us to trust Him and offer our true selves.... He wants us to entice, allure and invite others to Jesus by reflecting his glory in our lives. He will give no guarantee that others will respond well.... God's invitation is to bring our sorrow to Him. To keep our hearts open and alive, and find refuge and healing in His love.\\"This book also reminds the reader that God is ultimately the source of validation and fulfillment that we try so hard to find elsewhere. If our focus is on Him and the relationship He desires with us and built us to desire with Him then many of those feelings will be eliminated.There is so much more to this book and it has created a hunger and thirst in me to pursue the more intimate relationship with my Lord that I have been neglecting. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly. I can't even begin to put down here all the gems and wealth the authors have managed to fit into this short span of pages. Read Captivating to get the full picture of what these authors have to say and how it can be applied to your own life."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think every man ought to read this and get a glimpse of what goes on in a woman's heart - it will take them to a different level spiritually.

According to what season you are in your life will determine how you relate to this book. Just like the bible, certain stories and messages are more meaningful to you because it relates to what you're going through. This book is for any woman who feels alone, undesired, or hurt (single or married). Captivating shows you how God desires you. It reveals the venerable side to every woman's heart. If this is something you are not seeking (at this time) then it will not appeal to you. But at that moment or season when you feel alone or abandon and you want to understand the why's, when's and how's of your heart's desires then allow this book to be an instrument of God's undying love for you."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There wasn't much theology in this book. Unless you consider movie quotations and situations as theology. And what they did take from Scripture, much of it was taken out of context, like the passages from Song of Solomon. But in the end, it did kind of make me feel like I, a woman, could be used just as much by the Lord. I just don't agree with how the Eldredges came to achieve that end result."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"One of the most wonderfully freeing and inspiring books I have ever read! I am a very strong woman to begin with, had a wonderfully loving up-bringing, have strong self-esteem, etc. and still I have found myself struggling with the all-too-common things that other women struggle with--loneliness, wishing for more romance, questioning who God wanted me to be as a \\"woman\\"...this book is one to be savored, underlined!! and re-read. It is definately not for anyone--I believe it can best be appreciated by a born again Christian woman who is open to what and who God wants her to be. Probably best read by someone over 30 but just my take."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm not surprised that Staci's favorite childhood game was \\"kidnapped and rescued\\" where the only role she could imagine for herself was the passive victim of abduction and then the passive recipient of rescue. That's the theme of this entire book, which probably should be titled 'Captivity' instead. Waiting and following and being looked at are apparently what the Eldredges think are the most important things in a woman's life. They seems to believe that male attention is the guiding light of female existence (Please look at me. Rescue me. Fight for me.)So, let me say that Staci doesn't speak for me and I doubt if she speaks for any of the women I know. I gotta wonder if Staci even speaks for herself, since John does so much of the talking and since this book is just the cookie-cutter reverse of Wild at Heart. She defines her role only in response to what John believes men need. John says that men need to fight, so Staci compliantly agrees to be the pin-up painted on the bomber. I want to ask her \\"Honey, can you think for yourself?\\"Unlike Staci, I didn't spend my childhood in twirly skirts desperately seeking Daddy's attention. Forget playing dress-up, I was building volcanoes and radios and exploring the woods and building forts from chopped logs. My dreams weren't of weddings, they were of being an archealogist and a deep-sea diver and an astronaut and a Wimbledon champion. My heroes were Joan of Arc -- women who did things, not women who waited for men to do things for them or to them. I admired Robin Hood -- I couldn't care less about the passive girlfriend. Apparently unlike Staci, I had a mother and father who taught me to be independent and self-directed, not to wait for rescue; to build my own kingdom, not to wait for prince to carry me along on his idea of adventure.And did you notice how John and Staci keep telling us that men need battles. My question is \\"What are they fighting for?\\" Is there any sense these men are fighting for any real cause, to improve education, to eliminate poverty or disease, to make healthcare more affordable? No, that's the kind of fighting women and more civilized men do. What we're talking about here are men who are just looking for a fight. There's no overriding goal -- the battle itself is the goal.Staci wants women to become a collaborator in this. She wants women to be a convenient prop in the male warrior fantasy, the excuse he uses to justify his own violence. \\"Men need to fight for you\\", she claims. Really? How does their fighting help me or improve the world in any way? Does it educate my children? Does it pay for their books and shoes and dental exams? Does it create a safer, better, more just world?Just because there are some men who can't control their urge for killing and destruction does not mean I have to become a party to this. So, don't tell me these men are fighting for me.They're fighting because they lack the skills to resolve problems intelligently, or they feel real manly firing big guns at small animals, or they need to compensate for their failures elsewhere, or a hundred other little-boy reasons. But don't tell me they're fighting for me.It seems pretty obvious to me that John has some real issues with insecurity -- and Staci is merely playing the role of enabler. She's little more than the mirror for his compulsions -- which she then declares her great adventure. Of course, her idea of \\"great adventure\\" is nothing more than being the recipient of male attention or pursuit or rescue, or to be excuse for male violence. Sorry, that's not an adventure, it's a pathology. And it might be the Eldredges', but it ain't mine."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you want a closer realtionship with God this book is for you.

However, I could not put it down and I feel it is a valuable book for any woman to read (and any husband, boyfriend, brother, father or son). It truly is a fantastic book (about an awe-inspiring subject)with a message worth hearing.Edit: I wrote the above review in '06. It is now '08 and I have a different opinion of this book. I would only give it 1 star if I were reviewing it today. I have discovered that the theology is poor and the concepts basic. The authors use human emotion as a standard by which to judge God's emotions/motives. This is the wrong way to go. I again mention the book's repetitiveness, which is even more annoying now that I'm older. There are so many MUCH better books out there. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I just spent the last 10 minutes reading or skimming through the 60-some reviews on here. Interesting to note that most people either love or hate the book. Personally I love it. When I read I find myself tearing up over various issues that fully resonate with my heart. I also promise you that I am not your typical 'gushy', chick-flick watching female. To be honest, i'm much more tomboyish and struggle to be feminine instead of 'tough'. But I believe God plants in woman many universal core desires and that is what 'Captivating' addresses. I give this book 4 stars and am going to explain why by addressing issues OTHER people had with the book's content.A warning, this could be long. I love to write. I beg your indulgence.First off..the title of the book, 'Captivating'. I saw one review that claimed this title is negative and implies men being captives of women. How misunderstood! In my evening Bible-reading, I came across this verse in Proverbs(5:18.19) 'May you rejoice in the wife of your youth...may you ever be CAPTIVATED by her love.' So yes, for the record, being captivating is very Biblical.Secondly, comments about the 'over-use' of movie references and pop-culture. I've noted that much of our Christian culture has always been AFRAID of popular entertainment. I agree that there is a great necessity for discernment, but at the same time, we must address society WHERE IT IS. This book does not seek to REPLACE the Bible, but to encourage us to see God in everyday things. How many of us never go to the movies or listen to the radio or read classic literature? very few indeed. Is it really so terrible to draw truth from fiction? Fiction is not synonmous with lies, yet some still chose to believe this. God is the author of our creativity..our desire to spin tales for entertainment. We shouldn't shun that.In order to avoid writing a book instead of a book review, I'm just going to address one final concern..one that holds more reason for concern. Eldredge's books do tend to lack 'meat'. Not to say they are faulty -- the books NEVER make claim to replace the Bible or other quality non-fiction. All i'm saying is that it's true that while a huge portion of his books will be easy to relate to, sometimes one walks away being unsure of answers. And this is my main concern and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. However, if this book is studied WITH the Bible, I believe that it will be a blessing and a source of healing instead of emotional 'fluff'.This book will likely resonate with certain personality types more than others. In my experience, it touches more of the expressive/creative types than those who are blatantly practical. That's ok. There is no one cure-all book, and 'Captivating' is NOT for everyone. However it does speak great truth about hurt and healing to those who will listen. And I encourage women and their husbands,boyfriends, brothers in Christ to read this book without prejudice and to see what God teaches.God bless."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I decided to read this book because I'd been told by multiple people that I respected as Godly women to read this. And I was given the warning- you might hate it at first, but get through the first few chapters and see what you think. I was skeptical, and reading the first few chapters I wanted to chuck the book across the room. I'm far from a Bibical scholar, but I value Scripture a lot and I think we're called to be skeptical of people's interpreations.I do not think that John and Staci Eldredge have everything right. But I think \\"Captivating\\" speaks to our need for God to meet us deeply, personally and intimately. I hear many people saying- I don't relate because I don't need someone to rescue me. Well then, why do you need Jesus? I think I believe a lie that \\"God loves sinners- His grace is sufficent for sinners- sinners need Jesus to save them...but now, I'm a Christian (a saved sinner) and yeah, I still need grace and He loves me, but I'm no longer in need of rescue.\\" God wants more for us then this- read Romans 5- read 5:8 (while we were still sinners Christ died for us- AMAZING)...now keep reading- it doesn't end with salvation...Paul says \\"HOW MUCH MORE\\" multiple times in the next few verses talking about what God has FOR us after our conversion. It never stops being about God rescuing us, or our need.What I love about this book is that it does beat the idea that God loves us. And you know what- I don't think we ever really learn this lesson and need to stop hearing it. This is not a Barney \\"God loves me\\" now let's all run and give eachother hugs- it is learning that God's love is totally life transforming. HE changes us- and not because we are this problem He has to deal with (which I think is how many people see sanctification)- but because He loves us more than we can imagine! \\"Captivating\\" forces us to our continual need...that's not a comfortable place...I think that is part of why I wanted to chuck the book across the room. I don't want to need anyone- I am a strong woman, right? Oh, wait, I am broken...we all are!! This book is not for low-self-esteem women- it is for any women who is willing to consider that she is broken (and maybe more than she wants to admit).I think the Eldredges are bold, and sometimes with being bold, you miss sometimes, but I think the message behind this book- that we are ALL broken and in need of rescue, and that God loves us in our brokeness and that He cares about our redeemtion beyond our salvation because we are of immense value to Him- is a message worth being bold about. I think they lack in some theological arguments, but I think their core message is Bibical- very Bibical- but I'm not sure we always want to hear it.I advocate reading this book. Read it as a skeptic, but be willing to actually consider their argument. Don't accept everything you read in ANY book...only the Bible is God's Word. Test things. Test their arguments against Scripture- see the flaws. But don't let your skeptism harden you to also hearing a message that might bring you some amazing freedom.Sorry this is long- these are my thoughts."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"As a new Christian, the first book I picked up on godly femininity I threw across the room. I never picked it up again. In the twenty-five years since, I have only read a few I could whole-heartedly recommend. The rest drive me crazy. Their messages to women make me feel as though, 'You are not the woman you ought to be --- but if you do the following ten things, you can make the grade.' They are, by and large, soul-killing. But femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula.\\"So begins (or very nearly begins) CAPTIVATING, written by John and Stasi Eldredge. The \\"I\\" in question is Stasi, but it's her husband John you are more likely to be familiar with. He's the author of THE SACRED ROMANCE, WILD AT HEART, and a number of other books that promote an adventurous and cathartic brand of Christianity. Whereas WILD AT HEART tailored that message for men, CAPTIVATING looks to tailor the message for women and is likely to have similar bestselling results.But even though femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula as the introduction says, CAPTIVATING's premise is that there is an essence that God has given to every woman. \\"We share something deep and true, down in our hearts,\\" Stasi writes. And it's this universal feminine heart that CAPTIVATING hopes to expose, heal, develop, and celebrate.That this feminine heart needs healing is not hard for the authors to evidence. \\"Every woman I've ever met feels it --- something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does. An underlying, gut feeling of failing at who she is. I am not enough and I am too much at the same time. Not pretty enough, not thin enough, not kind enough, not gracious enough, not disciplined enough. But too emotional, too needy, too sensitive, too strong, too opinionated, too messy. The result is Shame, the universal companion of women. It haunts us, nipping at our heels, feeing on our deepest fear that we will end up abandoned and alone,\\" writes Stasi.If that statement doesn't hold water with you, don't even bother picking up this book because it's an observation (and a foundational one for this book) that's only anecdotally supported. If you don't already believe it, this book isn't going to convince you it's true. But if this being both not enough and too much at the same time strikes a chord with you, as it does for me, you'll want to read on.When you do so, you will learn that every woman's heart longs for three things: to be romanced, an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil. It's worth noting that in WILD AT HEART John Eldredge writes that every man's heart longs for three things as well: a battle to fight, adventure, and a beauty to rescue. Isn't that nice of God to pre-load both male and female hearts with desires that fit nicely in parallel three-point outlines?Snark aside, CAPTIVATING contains some truly moving stories of women, their anguish, and their beautiful blossomings into whole-heartedness. I especially appreciated a section about emotional promiscuity among young single men and women. And as in the books that John authored alone (or with best friend Brent Curtis), CAPTIVATING's imagery is steeped in nature, also something that I personally appreciate. I feel the closest to God under a West Texas night sky where the stars glitter like so many princess-cut diamonds (though admittedly, the site of Chicago's skyline under a full moon as viewed from Lake Shore Drive has been known to do a number on me too).The breathlessly romantic tone of CAPTIVATING will alienate some. But of greater concern to me is that, while Scripture is sprinkled around liberally, the real source material here for making sweeping statements about the needs of women is literature, movies, music, and nostalgia. And while all of these are beautiful landscapes to explore and traverse, given that they often offer potent glimpses of Truth, they aren't necessarily meant to be our spiritual base camps.Having said that, CAPTIVATING surely will be a balm for the souls of many women. And if you and/or the man in your life is a fan of John Eldredge's previous books, don't miss it.--- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I picked up this book in the hopes that I would find something original, something challenging, something other than the evangelical drivel that passes for \\"Christian Living\\" books these days. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.What I Liked:1. There really were some challenging ideas in this book. So often, \\"biblical womanhood\\" is portrayed as being all about homemaking, mothering, and hospitality. It's all about being \\"against feminism.\\" While I don't see anything wrong with a balanced view of a woman's role, I do think that it's easy to take these ideas to the extreme. Stasi Eldredge's book definitely does not fit the mold, at least not in the circles I tend to frequent. Mrs. Eldredge's ideas are concerned more with the heart. To her, \\"godly womanhood\\" means getting back to our roots as women, to embrace our femininity and use it for God's glory. Unfortunately, Mrs. Eldredge's ideas about femininity are wrought with their own problems. (See below). Additionally, Mrs. Eldredge's idea that womanhood and femininity doesn't always look the same between women is very refreshing and something of which I need to be reminded every day.2. The authors are clear about the God-ordained distinction between the sexes. In other words, men and women are not the same.3. The chapters, while lengthy, were quick and easy to read. Yes, that is a plus when you're running after two children under the age of three.4. This book was easy to read in pieces.What I Did NOT Like:1. The Eldredges have a very low view of women. In their minds, all women are broken, messed up creatures who have spent their lives hurting and looking for someone to build them up and fill in all the holes they experienced growing up. There is no room for strength, confidence, industry, dignity or any other \\"Proverbs 31\\" quality in their economy. In fact, they mock and ridicule the \\"Proverbs 31\\" woman as though hers is an unattainable, impractical, useless standard to which we should strive. For them, it all boils to whether or not a woman feels she is beautiful (and while they spend an entire chapter developing this idea, I never understood what they meant- beauty on the outside? Inner beauty? What beauty are they talking about? Oh, the beauty that is completely corrupted by sin, but made alive and beautiful again by the saving work of Christ? That beauty?), and whether or not she is being properly \\"romanced.\\" In fact, I'm actually nervous about writing a bad review of this book in fear that Stasi will read it and spiral into a depression again. What if I hit a nerve, dig a deeper wound, remind her of her difficult childhood? Why not generalize this fear to all women because according to the authors, women are weak, wounded, and helpless.2. Theologically, this book is a mess. For example: \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God\\" (pg. 44). Hello! That is heresy! Jesus Christ, ALONE, is the incarnation of God. I think they must have no clue as to what they are actually saying in that statement. It would be more appropriate to say that Eve was made in the image of a beautiful, captivating God. Image and incarnation are not the same thing. They make this error several times throughout the book. They suggest that Eve was the \\"Crown of Creation.\\" In reality, mankind (women AND men) is the apex, the pinnacle, the crown of creation. They often refer to Jesus as the \\"bridegroom\\" of the Christian woman and that the woman is His bride. Actually, the Church is the Bride of Christ, and that includes men as well as women. They refer to Jesus in these sappy, overemotional, and overtly sexual terms when they talk about Him as a \\"Lover.\\" Well, were I a man, I would either laugh at this or be very turned off. Jesus isn't my boyfriend. He's my God. He's my Savior. He's my Lord. He is the Bridegroom of the Church Universal, but not of individuals. I could go on, but its late and I'm tired...3. Frequent and blatant misuse of Scripture. They take so much of the Bible out of context that its hard to know where to start in pointing it out. Their use of the Song of Solomon is a frequent offense in this regard. The book was written as a description of marital love between husband and wife, not between Christ and the Church and certainly NOT between Christ and a woman. Hosea is another example. This book was written as prophecy regarding the eventual return of Israel from exile, not as a description of the return of a woman to her \\"first love\\". They often mock the correct interpretation of several passages in Scripture, tossing them aside for their own feminized, overly-sentimental view as well.4. They have a very low view of Christ. Essentially, they suggest that He cannot act in our lives unless we let him, unless we \\"open the door of our hearts\\" where he stands knocking (yet ANOTHER reference they take completely out of context). Theirs is a neutered, powerless Christ. There is nothing said in this book about the beauty He gives us because He is IN US, living HIS LIFE through us. The reason I need to look to Christ to find this beauty for which I am allegedly seeking affirmation is because the beauty I possess comes from Him.5. There is an overemphasis on the effect that Satan/demons/spirits can have on the lives of Christians. I believe this issue stems from their use of the Neil T. Anderson's book The Bondage Breaker, a book that has been widely rebutted due to its unbiblical views of Satan and his relationship to believers. They attribute common marital and even medical problems to meddlesome spirits when there were completely natural explanations for what they were experiencing. I'm afraid that people will fail to get to the root of their problems and just \\"blame Satan\\" instead of really working through very complex issues (or seeing a doctor for medical issues!).6. Enough with the movie metaphors already! I don't want to hear about how I'm like \\"Cora\\" in \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" or \\"Rose\\" in \\"Titanic.\\" Tell me about Rachel, Rebekah, Mary, Deborah, Ruth, Phoebe, Dorcas, Mary Magdelene, the nameless women throughout the Bible who acted in faith when God called them out of their normal lives into greatness. Tell me about those women FIRST and leave the movie metaphors out of it! Instead of looking to God to learn about us, they point us to our culture and ourselves in order to learn about God. That's completely backwards!This book is nothing more than really bad pop psychology trying to be passed off as \\"biblical\\" truth. It is sappy, overly sentimental, erroneous, and, in most parts unbiblical. I had a hard time following any of the points put forward by the authors. The meat in this book would've made for an interesting article in \\"Christianity Today\\" or \\"Focus on the Family\\" magazine. They didn't need a whole book to detail this drivel. Please don't bother with it. There are much better books out there about biblical womanhood than this one."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I love this book!! First of all, it's not based on the Proverbs 31 woman. The books that say \\"Follow rules A, B, and C to be a good Christian woman\\" drive me nuts!! They make me feel so completely inadequate. This book was so different than any other book I had read. The Eldredges describe a woman's deep desire to feel beautiful, cherished, and fought-for (how we want a knight in shining armor coming to our rescue), and how that relates to our relationship with God. The book describes how women reflect the part of God that wants to be desired and cherished as well.This book really spoke to my heart, and encouraged me in my walk with God. I would recommend to any woman, and to any man who wants to understand the heart of a woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My problem with this book is the same as my problem with the book \\"Every Woman's Battle.\\" EVERY woman wants this, or ALL women want that. No. We don't.Reading books like these have always made me feel freakish. This book, like EWB, made me think there must be something wrong with me, for it was proclaiming what ALL women want, and all I could think was \\"But...I don't. What?\\"Well, according to the reviews on this site, I'm not the only one who feels differently than this book tells me I should. If I got one thing out of this book, it was coming to this site and discovering I'm not the only one who didn't feel the way the book said I did."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"To be honest, I agree with most of what the rewiewer below had to say. The authors are subpar, but that's to be expected with the Eldredges. The reviewer is also correct in calling them out on their sketchy interpretations of Scripture. In fact, they use *so few* Scripture references, you better have Bible in hand while you're reading this book so you can do your own research for their controversial statements.However, I wouldn't go SO FAR as to bash the *concept* of the book. While I agree that not EVERY woman is broken and helpless, there are a SIGNIFICANT number of women who have experienced tremendous hurts. The authors touch on some widely accepted, scientifically proven psychological issues that can develop in women at young ages.All in all, this book needs to be read with a discerning mind. THIS IS NOT SCRIPTURE so not every sentence is truth....keep that in mind! My suggestion would be to start with this book to gain some insight but if you're dealing with some of the serious issues discussed in this book, professional help is a must!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book has a fatal flaw: it depends on fluff and emotionalism, not Scripture, to draw conclusions. You may notice that the lion's share of passages from this book are not from an actual translation of the Bible... they are from a book by a man named Robert Alter wrote ABOUT the book of Genesis.I am wary of any book that tells me who I am in Christ, but doesn't think the words of Christ are good enough to communicate that.Secondly, and this is probably the consequence of the dearth of Biblical references, Captivating is not theologically sound. John and Stasi Eldredge spend several pages detailing how God created the earth in increasing measures of beauty and complexity and importance. The culmination, according to this book, is not with PEOPLE but with EVE. Page 25 says:\\"She is the crescendo, the final, astonishing work of God. Woman. In one last flourish creation comes to a finish not with Adam, but with Eve... Given the way creation unfolds, how it builds to ever higher and higher works of art, can there be any doubt that Eve is the crown of creation? Not an afterthought. Not a nice addition like an ornament on a tree. She is God's final touch, his piece de resistance... Look out across the earth and say to yourselves, 'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me. Creation reached its zenith in me.'\\"Not something I would teach the girls in my high school small group.Apart from the lack of sound scripture, the shaky theology, and the fact that these authors quote themselves in every chapter (from Wild at Heart), the other major fault of this book is that I think all 224 pages could be condensed into 20 or fewer. There was so much sugar-coated FLUFF in this book, that I couldn't take it seriously. The authors used entirely too many words, pages, paragraphs, and chapters to say, \\"You are a creature of inherent beauty, created in the image of God, and He Loves You!\\" That is not difficult to say.I started reading this book because my boyfriend cared enough to buy it in an effort to understand women better -- and because he loved The Sacred Romance. He didn't read Captivating, and now I can save him the time."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I am in the process of reading the book and enjoying it.Having skimmed many of the reviews, I'm left with the following thoughts:1. Captivating elicits strong reaction in most people. They love it. They hate it.2. I'm a life-long avid reader and I thought it was fairly well-written in terms of flow and readability.3. Captivating is not a book for people who want a heavily scripture laden reference to biblical womanhood. As several have mentioned, there are many of those books on the market. However, I do think you can be very theologically astute and still enjoy this book. You need not take all parts of it as your own. Depending on your theology, you may or may not agree with the Eldredges on every point.4. Captivating is a book that may have appeal to someone who doesn't necessarily consider him/herself religious. It is written popularly and many unchurched or otherwise unreligious people may be able to relate to the media examples better than biblical examples the Eldredges could have used. Something about it reminds me of Donald Miller's Blue Like Jazz, which chronicles his own journey to understanding who he is in relation to God.In all, I can understand why some would have objections and I can understand why some love the book unreservedly. It depends on your personal filter with which you read and process life. Of course, be discerning, as you would be with anything that you read. I believe Captivating has a place in emerging Christian literature."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book says that women need three things: to be romanced, to have an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to have their beauty unveiled. And, according to this book, men need three things: a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue. Let me rephrase those a bit more honestly. Women \\"need\\" to be the passive receiver to a man's initiative, to play a role in a man's adventure, and to be told we are beautiful by a man, whereas men \\"need\\" to be the active initiator (the one who makes decisions), to live an adventure of their own direction, and to have a woman to control and objectify. This is the premise of every so-called \\"chick-flick.\\" This is the reason women look to men to give them worth and purpose.I would offer the three longings of every human being's heart: to feel loved by others, to love oneself, and to love others. (kinda like Matthew 22:37-39) You aren't going to get any of those things by playing roles and mimicking the dominant (and secular, I might add) culture. You're far more likely to get them by treating all human beings the same way -- as equals, without boundaries imposed by stereotypes.According to this book, women were created to be submissive and if they take care of themselves rather than looking to a male person to make all their major decisions, they are being \\"emasculating.\\" This is an example of how some people choose to believe that traditions of the dominant culture are somehow natural and approved of by God, rather than checking with the Bible to see how Jesus/God behaved toward women. \\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" How then is it appropriate to tell people that they when they marry someone they are supposed to have an unequal relationship where one person makes the decisions and the other obeys without any thought or responsibility? Being \\"one\\" does not mean one person thinks and the other does not. It means both people think and work hard until they come to agreement.If you choose to read this, I urge you to also readWhat Paul Really Said About Women: The Apostle's Liberating Views on Equality in Marriage, Leadership, and Love."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Updated Review 10-9-09: I want to mention one chapter that breaks my heart because of how much it misrepresents God and true Christianity. Chapter five is called \\"A Special Hatred\\". Let me first summarize this chapter and then I'll explain why this chapter is complete heresy.The premise of this chapter is this: \\"most of the bad things that happen to you in life are because you're beautiful. Satan is jealous of your beauty and does bad things to you because of his jealousy.\\" Of course, what woman doesn't want to hear they are beautiful? But this idea is found NOWHERE in Scripture.We learn in the Bible that God allows trials in the lives of Christians is for His good purposes. One reason we suffer is in 2 Corinthians 4:8-11 \\"We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.\\" One reason God allows suffering is so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our bodies! It has everything to do with the glory of God and nothing to do with our beauty or Satan.Another reason we suffer is to give God glory in our suffering: \\" - 1Peter 4:16 -Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.\\" If you suffer, glorify God. Don't look at yourself and think, \\"I must be REALLY beautiful, for Satan to want me to suffer like this.\\"But chapter five of Captivating tells us we need to give glory to ourselves, for our beauty, when we suffer. Captivating says the reason women have suffered throughout history is because they are beautiful. (We know as Christians they one of the main reason there is suffering in the world is because of sin--not beauty.) Here are some quotes from the chapter: \\"I was terrified of men and terrified of my beauty. Beauty was dangerous.\\" \\"What is to account for the systemic, often brutal, nearly universal assault on femininity? Where does this come from?\\" \\"Who does Satan single out for his move against the human race? ...Satan went after Eve.... Have you ever wondered why? It might have been that he, like any predator, chose what he believed to be the weaker of the two. There is some truth to that. He is utterly ruthless. But we believe there is more.\\"(We KNOW why he went after Eve. \\"For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.\\" 1 Timothy 2:13-14 \\"But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ\\" 2 Corinthians 11:3. Satan went after Eve because she was easier to deceive. We have the answer to the question: \\"Why did Satan go after Eve?\\" The answer is found in the New Testament. Eve was easier to deceive than Adam.)Captivating goes on to say, \\"Satan fell because of his beauty. Now his heart for revenge is to assault beauty... But most especially, he hates Eve... She is the incarnation of the Beauty of God. More than anything else in all creation, she embodies the glory of God.\\" WHAT??!!?? Where is that verse???We know the declaration of God's glory is made by the heavens which He stretched out: \\"The heavens declare the glory of God.\\" Psalm 19:1 And then in Isaiah 40 God compares people with the heavens He made: \\"Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on the scales; behold, he takes up the coastlands like fine dust... All the nations are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness. To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?... It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;...To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.\\" (Isaiah 40:15,17-18,22,25)It looks like God Himself has answered this horrible comparison. God Himself has said, \\"to whom will you compare me?\\" Why do the Eldredges compare a woman, who is part of the human race--who is less than the dust on the scales--to God? And especially, how can anyone dare to say \\"she embodies the glory of God\\"?To quote again from Captivating: \\"Put those two things together--that Eve incarnates the Beauty of God and she gives life to the world. Satan's bitter heart cannot bear it. He assaults her with a special hatred.\\" \\"It changes things to realize that, no, it is because you are glorious that these things happened.\\" \\"You are hated because of your beauty and power.\\"Yes, women often feel alone. The Eldredges are VERY GOOD at speaking to a woman's heart and describing exactly how they feel. They certainly have this going for them. They describe a person's pain and problems and suffering brilliantly. The problem is their solutions. The solution to the abuse women suffer is not found in recognizing your glory and beauty. But I think people are so \\"captivated\\" by finding someone who understands them, who writes exactly how they feel, that they accept any answer the Eldredges give.Now, some of the authors' answers are right on. And I think this is another place people get confused. Readers can become so emotionally entangled with what the authors are saying, they can't seperate the heresy when it comes. So, if you read this book, and if it ministers to you emotionally, PLEASE realize that not all the Eldredges' say is true.Previous Review: One message this book communicates is: don't worry, you've already attained, you're already doing good. Let us show you how you are perfect, ideal, captivating; let's dig up and discover who you really are so we can see how wonderful that person inside you really is.Paul said the opposite: \\"Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own\\" (Phil. 3:12). And Romans 7:24, \\"Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?\\"(Notice: the word wretched was used, not fascinating, not enchanting, not captivating, but WRETCHED!I feel like the book might say to me: \\"Don't say that about yourself. No, you're not wretched. Don't put yourself down like that.\\" But if Paul was wretched, and he was a supreme example of someone who followed Christ, we are certainly wretched.)Though God may love us, though He may be captivated by us, it does not make us captivating. No where does the Bible say we are worthy of being adored or loved. God loves us because of His goodness, not ours.Also, the Bible says that \\"a fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself\\" (Pr. 18:2). As Christians, our aim is not to understand how worthy we are for God to love us. Our aim is to understand how unworthy we are to be loved by God so His greatness (not ours) can be exalted.The authors also say we have to conclude that a godly woman is tired and guilty. How dare they! A godly woman has entered into the rest God provides, and she has no condemnation in Christ Jesus. A godly woman isn't even that focused on herself--she's focused on the worthiness of Jesus. If a woman feels guilty, it's no sign of her godliness.Another glaring problem with this book is the criticism of the Proverbs 31 woman. In Captivating, the Proverbs 31 woman is called an \\"infamous icon.\\" Hello--the Proverbs 31 is part of God's Holy Word, given by God to us in inspired Scripture. I believe that the remarks given about this woman border on blasphemy: \\"Somehow she has sanctified the shame most women live under, biblical proof that yet again we don't measure us. Is that supposed to be godly--that sense that you are a failure as a woman?\\" So our standard for a woman is not the Bible, according to Staci; because, after all, the Bible makes a woman tired and guilty. And if the Bible proves (as Staci said, it's \\"biblical proof\\") we don't measure up, why is she taking it upon herself to say we do?Again, the book says a woman has been told by the church, \\"I am not enough.\\" Uh... Of course! The whole message of Christianity is that we are not enough--God is! Jesus didn't die on the cross because we were enough, or because our goodness is enough, or because we have what it takes to be special and holy. No, apart from Christ we we're wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. Remember how Jesus said, \\"For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked\\" (Rev. 3:17)? This book might like to make us think that we need nothing, but we do! The answer is not found within ourselves, within our own hearts, within our own dreams and desires--the answer is Christ! It's found in Him and He alone is the answer! Not some dream I had as a little girl. Not some desire I have now as a woman. If we look within our hearts, which are deceitful ABOVE ALL THINGS (Jer. 17:9), we can only expect to find desperate wickedness. We need to move away from fairy tales and back to the Bible.I understand that some women who have read this book feel like they understand God more. But if what you're understanding isn't biblically based, it's not worth understanding. Overall, I cannot even in the slightest bit recommend it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book truly opens the bible so that I could really see MY place in it--letting me see that I am more than just man's helper. My heart seemed to blossom and tears came to my eyes when I read how God created women to refect His image as well. I have studied the Bible for years and read the same scriptures--in some cases many, many times indepth--yet I was never able to see them in such light. I guess I always read them with the misguided feeling that I (women) were created only as helpers and that somehow meant \\"lesser\\". This book shows women that we were created as the \\"crown of creation\\" and how that image has been tarnished and trampled on, both over the centuries as well as in women's lives in general. I am currently reading it for the 4th time and I am still amazed and uplifted to see all His qualities within myself. I have tried to read it at least once a year because it seems like in the hustle and bustle of my everyday life and demands that God's truths about ME are forgotten and swept aside. This is a fantastic book for all women...not just those ultra homemakers with the perfect hair, but for those of us who are trying to find where we fit in God's picture of mankind.

Captivating did little to captivate me.This the kind of book that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and is just another increasing example of how I I just do not resonate much with Western evangelicalism any more - simplistic, all about me, lacking spiritual depth, and identifying Christianity with our American materialistic, consumer based western culture -On the one hand they are saying that they are not playing into stereotypes of women, or are not out to make women out to be only suited for certain roles, but they are really only describing stereotypes of women. Everything they are saying about women has to do with a western cultural mindset, point of view. That is the pair of lense they are using to set their criteria. All the cheesy \\"chick flick\\" quotes? Please! I love a good romantic comedy, adventure....but where is the depth in that? That is something I enjoy, but that does not define who I am. They are only speaking of real surfacy issues as they profess to be speaking of depth, the heart and soul of a woman. I mean, as they discuss little girls who want to twirl in skirts and be called Princess, I have to ask, what about women in Africa trying to stay alive through AIDS and hunger? What about women in Afghanistan? Somehow, I just don't think their concerns are so much to be romanced, be beautiful and long for a great adventure. I am offended that the Eldredges claim this is the heart and soul of every woman! Every woman?I do believe there are feminine traits and characteristics just as there are masculine traits and characteristics. Do I like to be beautiful, do I like to be romanced, do I like a great adventure? Yes. Did I like to play with dolls? Yes. Did I like to dress up in twirly skirts? not so much. I liked playing under the porch making mud pies. I liked my swing set. I liked building homes out of my blocks. So, yes, I agree these are some general feminine traits and characteristics, but I totally disagree that this is the essence of who I am...that this embodies my heart and soul as a woman. I am a woman, yes, but more so I am a woman following Christ and seeking to find my identity in Christ.. What really excites me and motivates me and spurs me is when I am in sync with who God created me to be, when I sense He is using ME (unique me) in the ways He wants to use me to advance His work and Kingdom. My identity is not in my husband or my marriage (and how he or it is making me feel about myself) or what I do, it is in who I am identifying myself with, and that is Christ. When men seek their identity in Christ they are inevitably going to become more of the MAN God created him to be. The same goes with women. As I seek to have my identity in Christ, I am going to become more of the WOMAN God created me to be.I think the Eldredges say nothing extraordinary. IAside from what they claim it does NOT, I think it does follow most formulaic Christian books - a+b = c (a fulfilled life!)Honestly, I am finding some parts of the book to be bearable, but overall captivating had as much depth as a cess pool of stagnant water. And we know what is going to come next. Workbooks, conferences, speaking engagements, support groups etc. that again, ties into our very western consumer, \\"me based\\" culture. But, on the other hand, if it brings people, especially women, into a deeper relationship with Christ, then it is doing some good.And I totally understand that my view is by far the minority (...)"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"For those wanting a pop-psychology quick fix to the complicated heart of a woman, maybe this book is for you. But if you're looking for biblically sound answers to the questions you have as a Christian woman - STEER CLEAR! While there are parts of the book that have merit, you have to wade through so much false teaching to get to the good stuff. You have to ask yourself - is it really worth it? The answer is \\"no\\" in my opinion, and my Pastor agreed.

Perhaps she was reviewing while wearing some strong presuppositions for protective armor.Having taken this book as an 8-week study course, I saw through Stasi's honesty the freedom God gives us to be REAL about our struggles and how we have been taught to see ourselves.It is incorrect to say that Stasi is putting down the Proverbs 31 woman--or to misconstrue what was meant by the word \\"incarnation.\\" Neither John nor Stasi would intend the reader to infer that Eve was an incarnation in the same degree that the Lord Jesus Christ was the incarnation of the Trinity.May I say a word to the woman who, because of this poor review, might hesitate to read the book? Please note that for about $5 you can own your own copy--then you be the judge. But let me assure you that you will find such validation, such affirmation in the pages of this book, such insight and understanding. You will see yourself on every page. You will begin to see--perhaps for the first time--that God does indeed see you--yes, you--as Captivating. He is captivated by you--His creation--even in all your flaws and weaknesses. He sees you through the lens of how his Son Jesus Christ has transformed you into His beloved daughter.Our lives as women are filled with daily activities that often seem mundane--unimportant--rote. We wonder if what we do has lasting impact or value. We can see our lives as hum-drum, when God has a grand adventure for us, behind the scenes of the hum-drum, when we take His hand in ours and see ourselves as HE sees us. THIS is the beauty of Captivating. John and Stasi will do for you, the reader.By far the most intriguing thought in the book--and one I have become convinced is true--is the explanation for WHY Satan, the enemy of our souls and all God's creation--has targeted women in particular. You will have an \\"aha!\\" moment as you consider the reason. Brew that cup of tea--and be prepared to have God shower you with His love through the pages of Captivating."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I bought this book because my husband really enjoyed \\"Wild At Heart\\".

Then I started researching the verses they used and found most of the verses are taken out of context to meet their examples. I strongly urge you to look up the verses in the Bible and compare them to how they use them in the book. Then there are parts where John jumps in and speaks on how/why women act.

If you are frustrated with the throwback gender roles that seem to pervade modern Christianity, do not read this book.Here are the notes I took to prepare for discussion with my book group.* Circular logic: we know that people want X because we see it represented in the media. But because X is represented in the media, people want it.* Gender essentialism: flat-out stated in Wild at Heart chapter.* Viewing children as \\"untainted\\" examples of gender differences is invalid because even very young children are socialized from birth. See: gender division of clothes and accessories even for infants, separation of toy store aisles into \\"girls\\" and \\"boys\\".* That argument also doesn't hold water in the case of children who prefer the clothing or toys of the opposite sex - who in many cases are denied access to their preferred items in an effort to \\"straighten them out.\\"* I suspect I differ from the Eldredges on this, but their argument does not consider scientific evidence of a genetic basis for asexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality - or anything that considers sexuality to exist on a spectrum.* Their linkage of sexuality with gender identity is not something I completely buy.* They note that their male children prefer to play with weapons and cars than nail polish and dolls. Have they presented their children with the option to choose \\"girl\\" toys? If not, they do not know that the boys naturally prefer what they have.* They say that boys are born warriors b/c their boys enjoy weapon toys. They discount their own role in encouraging \\"warlike\\" behavior by providing those toys.* Stasi repeatedly references experiences of herself and her friends as evidence of what girls/women desire. This is a self-selecting group of somewhat like-minded people.* They wildly misquote movies and books.* Their principles are limiting not just to women, but also to men.* The ultimate extension of their logic often leads to situations of domestic abuse.* The book does not justify its logic or observations, simply pointing out that Stasi too was once \\"misguided\\" by feminist principles. Because she felt happier when she developed a new worldview, it is assumed that readers will too.* The entire book is essentially white, western and bourgeois in orientation. People of lower economic classes do not have the option to dither about whether they should be less \\"striving\\" or seek more \\"adventure.\\" Women in the third world are more concerned about not being raped and given HIV than fulfilling their femininity.* An overemphasis on sexuality as a \\"gift\\" given by women to men compels a view of women as the sum of their sexual parts. This view, intended to set women apart from a sex-oriented culture, in fact has the opposite effect by enforcing the view that a large part of their worth is determined by the status of their sexuality. Fetishizing purity reinforces sexualization of young girls - not young boys - and ultimately creates a culture in which sex - getting it, withholding it, defining it - is the main cultural force."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The reviews for this book seem to be extremely polarized, and I can see why. Those who endorse it do so because they say it restores a sense of romance and adventure to relationship with God: and it does. Those who hate it cite the way there is little strong Biblical support, which is also true.I'll address the negative first. Perhaps in an attempt to be hip and culturally relevant, Captivating cites many pop culture examples of femininity and a womanly spirit. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this; current examples can enrich a text that deals with such an ancient faith as Christianity. The problem with Captivating is that the pop culture examples seem to replace Biblical support. I also found the book's overall message to be a little inconsistent in some places.These features did not ruin the book, though. It introduces the way you can have a romantic relationship with God well. I liked the personal anecdotes, both from John and Stasi and from other women they've talked with as well. Like I said, it's not too strong on the scripture, but in the one real place they do use scripture, it's wonderful and effective. The Eldredges highlight the way Song of Songs was not meant to just be taken literally, and they do a good job with it; it's my favorite feature of the book.Captivating may not be scripturally strong, but its heart truly is in the right place. The romantic love you can experience with God is often overlooked in books for women of faith, and Captivating can serve as an introduction to this side of God in the lives of women and girls everywhere."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"As I read this book, I became very troubled by what I was reading. I couldn't relate. I have since talked to other women about this book and they said the same thing, they couldn't relate and were troubled. I had my husband read the book because he had just finished Wild at Heart, by John Eldredge and thought that it was a good book. He was so troubled by this book that he is no longer reading any other book by Eldredge and plans to return the two he just purchased. I will not get into all the details about why this book should not be read be Christians (because I think the other reviews do an excellent job of this) but would like to warn leaders of Women's Ministries not to use this book. Scriptures are taken out of contact (what few they use)and it uses negative, sinful examples from movies and pop culture to explain how Jesus longs to have a relationship with women. This was very troubling! I think that new Christians will be harmed by this book. I have three young daughters and the thought of them reading this book when they are older compelled my to write this book review. There are many great books out there written for women that will help women grow and have a personal relationship with Jesus. If you are looking for books with sound Biblical teachings, read books by Kay Arthur and Beth Moore, who are in my opinion, mature, grounded Christian women with much to share about the heart and soul of a women."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I read this because I had a bad relationship with my mother and wanted to be a better mother to my daughters by understanding women better. I ended up learning so much about myself. I was cried several times reading this and it's helped me to allow God to heal some wounds and be more aware of how Satan tries to attack women and girls.I had my reservations about reading a book explaining women written by a man, but Eldredge seems to have a pretty good handle on what it means to be a woman and what it is that women need."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My husband of 21 years recently met another woman and decided he didn't want to be married to me anymore. Through the pain of this, I was given \\"Captivating\\" by a friend who had also gone through a similar situation. God used the encouragement in this book to set me free from \\"needing a man\\" to validate me as a person. I felt God's love flow into me and out to others while reading the book. The more I read, the more love I felt for myself, for God, and for others. This is just my personal experience. I recommend this book to all my friends who suffer with insecurities.My husband and I have recently reconciled, and he is now reading \\"Wild at Heart.\\" We are both dependent on other people to validate us. I'm hoping the book helps him get past that and enables him to be the man he was meant to be without fear. At this point in our lives, we need all the help we can get to help us be healthy individuals in order to have a healthy marriage. We both love the Lord and want His will for our lives, but there are underlying issues from our past, particularly our childhoods, that have created two dysfunctional, hurting people.

I am 54 years old and I lived my entire life searching out there in the world for something or someone to fill this gaping hole in my heart. I've been through bad relationships after bad relationships, even those that looked normal on the outside on the inside I felt unloved, unappreciated, and undervalued and ultimately I was deceived by the man. I have always felt unsettled until I read this book. The words in this book connected me with God in way religion had not been unable to. I have always loved Jesus and claim him as my savior but this book helped me understand my value to God. It spoke directly to my soul and I have been changed since reading it. I am a stronger and more confident woman after reading this book because it helped me to not only understand my value and where it comes from but to claim it. This is a must read by every woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Why I hate this book:Women are individual humans, not a category you can fulfill with stereotyped roles. And I don't want to prized for being beautiful and be part of a hero's story. I AM the hero and don't need someone else to provide my adventure. I have a lot of positive characteristics besides beauty, and want to be recognized and appreciated for ALL of them. And I am beautiful whether or not it is recognized by a man.This book is great to use in your Bible study/reading group if you want to foster women's dependence on men. Horrible if you want to attract a respectful man who wants an autonomous and powerful wife, like himself, and to get to know you for who you, individually, are."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\" After the success of Wild at Heart, it was inevitable for Eldredge and his wife put together a book about the heart of a woman's journey through life and faith.Brokenness and restoration are the two common themes you find in all of Eldredge's books. Since the fall of Adam and Eve, man and woman have been broken. We have spent the entire story of history trying to recapture a former glory by a means necessary. Our fruitless endeavors have left us broken, and that brokenness is very evident in woman today.For years, religion has pushed women to the sidelines. They have been told they are not fit to lead a church or organizations. Captivating, however, paints a different picture. Women are beautiful, the crowning jewel of God's creation. Women are strong with a tender protective touch, an attribute of God we see in the Bible. This is a great book for all young women. My wife and I both enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read Wild at Heart and Way of the Wild Heart many times and even taught them. When my first marriage died due to infidelity, my children were devestated, most especially my daughter. She no longer had a role-model to fashion her womanhood after. I bought the book and read it. I was amazed at the insight into a woman's heart it gave me! I am not a woman so I had no clue. I find myself buying this set; book, study guide and journal, for woman who I see struggling to find their identity as women. It has yet to let me down."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I read this book a few years ago and I was really blessed by it. I love the idea that God \\"Romances\\" me. I have never forgotten that part of the book.

What a blessing.I see the book is revised and updated..so I will buy a second copy and reread it with pleasure."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think it is so sad how people get so wrapped up in specifics and miss the heart of what is written in this book. Yes, they use many personal examples, because people share best from their personal experiences. Stop getting so wrapped up in how your pastor says to interpret a certain scripture, they are simply giving another perspective. I have recommended this book to several women, and I do not know anyone who read it with an open mind who did not feel an intense closeness with God after reading it. This book is very healing for any women that has been an insecure teenager, an abused child, a lonely wife, or questioning her place with God. The fact is God made women to be a glorious unique reflection of himself on earth, not to be forever beneath men as often Christianity likes to say, we are beside men. This book was beautiful and affirming. Rather than feeling ashamed for feelings of inadequacy, as many women do (probably all), this book gives a reason for those feels and scriptures to combat them. If you read this read this with your heart and your bible open, and pray that God shows you what he wants you to see when you read it. This book changed my life."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm reading this book for a second time. The first time I read this book was in the summer of 2007 and through this book and a lot of prayer, I came to know Christ. I was very lost, thinking that I was actually saved. While reading this book, I realized that almost everything they wrote was true about ME and how I was actually a bad person-no one is good. From that, I laid myself at the cross, begging for His grace and mercy. With that new beginning, I have had confidence like never before...a confidence that wasn't in how I looked, who I was dating, how skinny I was.... it was a confidence in my Jesus-the King who loves His unworthy daughter.Of course this book isn't perfect-it's not written by Christ. HOWEVER, just like ALL of us, God uses imperfect people. I will testify that this book God used to change my life. I've taught several classes on a women's heart (based on this book) to teenage girls and teenage boys, and I can't even begin to describe the e-mails I've received from 16 year old boys who repented from the way they've treated girls their age and the way they've viewed themselves.I say read this book with an open heart and open mind. This book is a good guide to seeing yourself, and I mean REALLY seeing yourself in who you truly are, all in the light of Christ."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I first heard about Captivating, from the author of Wild at Heart John Eldredge and his wife Stasi, my sarcastic tinged thoughts were something like \\"the boys get to be \`WILD' and I get to be \`captivating', oh boy.\\" But I hadn't gotten far into the first chapter when hope flared in my heart that this would be a different type of what-you-are-as-a-woman book.Captivating's authors make it clear from the introduction that this book is not another, what you are doing wrong and ten things you can do to fix yourself book. HOO-ray! What it sets out to be is a re-discovering of the richness femininity was meant to bring to our lives and the way it speaks to us about the heart of God.I liked that this book explored things other than having babies, serving, and being helpers to men. It talked about those issues but didn't stop there, as many books do, as if to say that's all there is to being a woman.For example, some of my favorite topics addressed were a woman's desire for adventure, being a part of something epic, and doing battle and how these things are part of the essence of femininty but have a different flavor than our male counterparts.\\"There is something fierce in the heart of a woman...A woman is awarrior too. But she is meant to be a warrior in a uniquely feminineway.\\" pg 11Some of the chapters didn't apply to me but I found myself thinking of people who could really benefit from reading them.There were a few times when I wished they had included more scripture, but other than that I found my view of what being a woman means broadened and enriched by this book. Yay!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was lovely. I received a free copy of Captivating to review from BookSneeze and I'm glad I did- I probably wouldn't have bought it on my own but feel enriched having read it. The premise of women as wonderful, special daughters of God is refreshing and enjoyable. Although my person beliefs aren't quite the same as the authors, I loved how clearly they described Christ waiting at the gate- just waiting for us to come unto Him. I also found myself agreeing with their ideas of what women want from men and our innate, God-given differences. This was uplifting and inspiring- a great read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In the book Captivating; Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul, Stasi and John Eldredge peel back the layers of those superficial ideals that seem to define woman today. Captivating is a book that tells the fairy tale from its original, God breathed perspective(aka: Adam and Eve). Then, reexamines a woman's truest desires and intimate needs. Everything from our relationship with our own mother and father, our children, and our Creator God.I found Captivating; Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul to shed light upon the truth. It helped to confirm my growing realization that becoming the Proverbs 31 woman is not a course I will master in my lifetime. Strive for, yes! Conquer, no! In the book, I appreciated the three characteristics that women tend to fall into; demanding, desolate, and alluring. I felt that these depictions really helped me to step back see times when I have been one or the other, then analyze what triggers contribute to myself being one over the other.Captivating is a must read for any woman needing a fresh perspective. A new way of seeing yourself. One who longs to shed guilt and stomp out rules that bind us into a life of fear, ultimately keeping us from ever reaching our full potential. This book is a beacon of truth and light."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Every woman's soul asks the question-\\"Am I lovely?\\"Women seek answers to their question and self-validation in everything except God- whether that be food, fashion, the affirmation of people, or something just as harmful. The book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge delves into the heart of a woman. The theme of the book is discovering a love relationship with God and how God made us uniquely captivating for His greater glory. It seeks to emphasize the great adventure to be found in a life resting in God.I greatly enjoyed this book. Although the text started out choppy, it evened out into beautiful, conversational prose. I liked that the authors sought to use familiar movie characters as a source of analogies, as well as including lovely quotes and real-life stories. I also appreciated that the authors discussed the heart of a woman as something gentle, but equally \\"warrior princess\\" fierce. I personally dislike the doctrinal harm that has been done toward what it means to be a woman, including the misapplication of verses pertaining to femininity. This book restores Biblical truth and displays godly femininity in an amazing, adventurous way. I should note that some may mistake messages in the book about how God loves and values women as flawed humans taking pride in themselves, but in fact the book only serves to portray Biblical truth about just how much God loves us in spite of our flaws, to the point where His dying on the cross seems a scandalous, incredible act of sacrifice. The book shows that God desires to completely restore women and to help them live the purposeful lives He created them for.The book also addresses women's heart for relationship as well as the feeling that one is \\"too much\\" or \\"not enough\\" all at the same time, which as the authors say, is \\"crazy-making\\". I appreciated that the book was not a list of \\"how-to's\\" to fix (if how-to's were all that people needed, everyone would be rich and skinny), and that it didn\`t focus on doing good things, but instead on being romanced by God, from which good can flow; but only as a secondary, and not a primary focus of life.The language of this book will probably appeal most to artsy and idealist-oriented personalities as opposed to realists and the especially analytical, but as I am an \\"INFP\\", the style of writing made the book all the more appealing. This book has the potential to impact many women, especially those struggling with understanding their value, combating spiritual difficulties, or those having difficulty realizing that they have an irreplaceable role in God's adventure.~ Lady HannahDisclosure: Book Sneeze provided me with a free, complementary copy of the book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge.

I'm glad that I finally got the chance to read it.Captivating is the celebration of women. There is no better way to explain it. Most Christian books for women that I have read are all about Mary and Martha, and they leave you feeling like even though Jesus said Mary made the better choice, you sure are a slacker for not being more like Martha. They always have a chapter on how to make yourself beautiful for your husband, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is less about women and more about their husbands. There is always a list of things that you should be doing....or not doing.....or doing better! Captivating does none of those things. I found that to be refreshing.This book is more about life and the adventure of being a woman. Not a doormat or a servant, but a vital piece of the puzzle. The celebration of the romantic, beautiful side of God that He passed to on to us women.I leave this book with a renewed sense of adventure and a desire to embrace my romance with Jesus, because He finds me captivating.I recieved a free copy of this book for review from Thomas Nelson. I did not receive any monetary payment and I was not required to say nice things about this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"CaptivatingBy John and Stasi ElderegdeCaptivating is set around the premise every little girl asks the questions, \\"Am I lovely? Am I beautiful? Am I captivating?\\" Throughout life we go on with the daily grind but deep inside our hearts we are still asking ourselves these questions and looking to external things to answer them. Captivating explains how God places these desires into our hearts and how \`looking time' can help answer the questions and what it takes to become truly captivating.John and Stasi Elderidge talk candidly about how we all can easily fall into a fantasy world of the way we think things should be. When our lives don't play out the way we thought they should many women escape to mindless movies, romance novels, food, or whatever else brings comfort. What many of us miss is how all our struggles and longings stem from the fall of Adam and Eve.As the pages are turned, Captivating doesn't promise if you do A and B you'll get C but explains how we are beautiful because we are made by Christ and everyone's shortcomings stem from the fall of man. The chapters are filled with thought-provoking questions of where we stand in certain areas followed by a prayer asking God to help us turn to Him and away from the lies we have believed.I first heard of this book a few years ago when it was newly published. Friends of mine had talked about being captivated by it just as the title says. So that's exactly what I expected - to be drawn in and unable to put the book down by the way it explains the questions all women ask. I wasn't as captivated by this book as I thought I would be, possibly because all had I heard previously about it. However I do think there are many good points scattered throughout the pages, they just seemed hard to find. It is definitely a book to read when you want to sit down, really digest each chapter and ask yourself tough questions."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I recently received a copy of the revised and expanded edition of Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge from BookSneeze, a program that provides bloggers with free books in exchange for honest reviews.New York Times bestseller Captivating aims to unveil the mystery of a woman's soul and is to women what its predecessor, the bestselling Wild at Heart, was to men. The description on the back cover of the book begins like this: \\"Every woman was once a little girl. And every little girl holds in her heart her most precious dreams. She longs to be swept up into a romance, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, to be the beauty of the story. Those desires are far more than child's play. They are the secret to the feminine heart.\\"Never having read the original, I cannot comment on what has been revised and expanded. However, I can give my review of this particular edition, which I thought was wonderful. Throughout the book, John and Stasi Eldredge give examples of why and how women may have pushed their childhood dreams aside. With stunning insight, they map out the all-too-common road of a modern woman's life and show that just because those dreams have been pushed aside, does not mean we can't find our way again. The path, of course, is through Jesus Christ.Although the book can be a little \\"cheesy\\" at times, it will certainly awaken the heart of any female reader to her own longings and desires to be the beauty, even if they are long forgotten. Men who read this book will gain a whole new perspective on the women in their lives, and I would certainly recommend it to any man struggling to win a woman's heart.

It's one of those books that, if you open yourself up to it, hits a chord somewhere deep inside of your soul. It allows you to realize that there is no set mold for who and what you need to be as a woman. That mold is cast by society, not by God.

Chapter six was for me like being in a counseling session and laying bare all my hurt and pain which is something I believe I have been avoiding, but we know healing cannot begin without.

It was a beautiful book and yes some of it made me really question the meaning of what the authors were trying to say or just plain uncomfortable but I chose to seek Him in prayer when I felt uncertain while reading this book. By doing so I found that this book and the meanings- the message I got out of it was amazing and enlightening- no not Jesus as weak or a \\"lover\\" in that way...none of that stuck. I got a message of love, comfort and that we are special to God and Jesus as in we are not \\"an afterthought\\". Yes I was somehow lead to believe that woman's creation was more for Adam's whim and pleasure then as an important role for Christ as one- man and woman as one in their roles but bringing different characteristics- man and woman are different. This book helped me to see this and since that women do have special roles as the companion of man as one- both for Christ. I do not chose to trust just any word written or otherwise with out first consulting Jesus, to ask for clarity- something everyone should learn. To much is wrongly construed and wrongly \\"translated\\" in this world. The only voice who can guide your search is Christ's! Last, I have to say that I saw on other reviews that the \\"heart\\" kept coming up. Our hearts are sinful yes but we are told to guard them in scripture over and over. The heart is referred to so very much in scripture it would do some good for people to look at this and meditate with Jesus on our hearts role! Because of so many bad messages out there you can trust only Jesus to show you the right one. I say the book is great and the message I got from it was so wonderful but I put Jesus in charge of \\"translating\\" it for me...not everyone else's reviews on here or anywhere else!

This book is the complement for women to understand their intended femininity. Complement is a just description as these books together reveal the theological view of complementarianism that implies different roles and responsibilities bestowed unto women and men by God.

On the following pages, you'll find several package designs (mostly paper/cardboard), some simple and practical, others fancy or sophisticated and a few very complex and intriguing. Each design has a small description of its possible applications and modifications, with brief directions of the materials to use, etc. The included CD-Rom has many of these designs, ready to use and modify. Obviously, this book can only serve two purposes: first, to inspire your creativity; second, to allow full-scale plagiarism of what are, for the most part, patented packages (patent information is discretely printed on the inner-margin of each page). With this in mind, this book should be of some use to people who want to create quick packages, hopefully, for non-commercial purposes, or to students researching different packaging designs. If you are looking for books with more in-depth information on packaging design, look elsewhere, this will not be a very useful book, as \\"Packaging Prototypes\\" features just that, prototypes. A bit of criticism is needed though, concerning the assembled photographs of some of the more complex package designs, which aren't always very clear.

The only downside is that if one is expecting The Field of Dreams to be replayed on paper, they will be slightly dissappointed.

Ray Kinsella, a wannabe Iowa farmer, receives a vision telling him to build a baseball field; if he does, the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson will return from the great beyondto play ball. Crazy as it may seem, Ray takes everything in stride and eventually builds a baseball field, and scores of dead ball players begin to appear, just for the enjoyment of playing the game. Thankfully, no explanation is given for this miracle, and Ray and his family form an excellent, grounded anchor around which all this wonderfully goofy nonsense takes place.What prevents &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; from being merely a sports novel is that W.P. Kinsella has transformed Ray's quest to build his dream baseball field into a search for the magical in everyday life. Miracles can occur even today, the author says. And in finding his dream, Ray Kinsella finds himself.&quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; makes for heartwarming reading."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"\\"Shoeless Joe\\" has lots of great ideas, and the central theme is nothing short of amazing. However, Kinsella's writing style is so \\"unique\\" that it can be extremely difficult to read. The dialogue is awkward, the characters are flat, and as has been mentioned before, he basically describes every person, place, thing, and action in this novel through an endless series of analogies. Excusing poor writing gets tiresome, and it detracts from the overall enjoyability of the novel. This is one example of a story that Hollywood elevated from its original source material. And this review is not coming from a high school student who read the book as part of a class assignment, as a previous reviewer has suggested for anyone with less than a 5-star review of the book. Overall, reading this novel is like tolerating a poor imitation of your favorite meal cooked by an inexperienced chef at a poorly managed restaurant. Its heart is in the right place, and it does in fact resemble something you love; but it's impossible to enjoy because the taste is so appalling."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"This is the WORST book I have ever read.

I have read a great deal of books and know that some are not for everyone. This book was not for me. The description is amazing, but the content is a bit lacking excitement and 'page turning anticipation.' I would read 'Jane Eyre' 5 times before reading another page of this book.

This journey includes tracking down healing \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson's nostalgia for baseball after being banned from the game, tracking down the elusive JD Salinger, and reconnecting with long lost family members.\\"Shoeless Joe\\" is more than a baseball book. It is a book about a place where innocence can be maintained. Unlike, Holden Caulfield from the \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" by JD Salinger, Kinsella has found a way to hold on to innocence, at least in a certain area. Like glass cases in a museum, Kinsella's baseball field breaks the conventions of time, bringing the past and present together.This book is at its best when read as a sequel to \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Its multiple allusions to the novel and similarities offer a literary perspective of baseball. Baseball has the power to heal nostalgia for it is a game unchanged since its creation. When at a baseball field in Seattle, you could very well imagine being at a field in Boston. \\"The one constant through all the years has been baseball,\\" Saliger tells Kinsella. \\"As America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers - it's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again - baseball has marked the time.\\""},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Easily the most ineptly written (published) novel I've ever encountered.

In fact, the movie this novel inspired, \\"Field of Dreams,\\" succeeded in three-dimensionalizing and transcending this awful source material, and is well worth seeing. But whether you've seen the movie or not, skip the book.HOWEVER, if you like to read unintentionally hilarious prose, if you like ridiculous similes liberally sprinkled over every page, if you like lifeless characters behaving bizarrely without reason or motivation, you might get a kick out of this thing.

The book starts off with Ray Kinsella, the main character, hearing a voice saying, &quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot; This meant that if Ray built a baseball feild, Shoeless Joe Jackson would come.

Kinsella. This novel was made into the famous film FIELD OF DREAMS, perhaps the greatest film about baseball (or was it about America?)ever made. I prefer SHOELESS JOE to FIELD OF DREAMS. I saw the film first, and when I read the book, I was impressed by the increased depth to SHOELESS JOE. The novel blends fantasy and reality in a story that is simple yet complex. It tells the tale of Ray Kinsella who plows down his crops because he hears a voice that tells him to. Shoeless Joe Jackson, his Black Sox teammates, Ray's father, and other athletes mystically arrive on this makeshift playing field. The reclusive (and we assume dreamer) J.D. Salinger also becomes involved in the plot. In SHOELESS JOE, W.P. Kinsella takes an inventive story line and uses it in support of the strongest of all possible themes. This novel is great. Order it--it will come."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"At first glance, this book looks like a baseball book, but it is more about a man's quest for J.D.

In this case, they're both well done. The only drawbacks to the book are it's overly descriptive - and I prefer descriptive detail - and too many similes, a favorite figure of speech of mine, one I use often in my writing. A few of the characters are flawed (e.g. Annie is too agreeable when Ray says he's going to cut out some of his farm land &amp; build a baseball diamond or when he says he's going somewhere because a voice told him) but overall, it's an easy read and the visual imagery, though overdone, is good. And the idea of using baseball as a conduit for redemption between father &amp; son and the way it is achieved, was excellent. Definitely a good book, especially if you're a huge baseball fan."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"It was a quiet friday with perfect weather on a splendid midsummer night. The Mets had completed their evening game with yet another loss to the Braves at Turner Field, and nothing was on the other 81 channels of overpriced cable TV that was at all bearable to watch. What's a baseball fan to do?I sat down with a glass of iced tea in a quiet room and placed my 10-year old VHS copy of &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; in my VCR. This, as you may remember, was film #2 of 3 of the &quot;Kevin Costner Didn't Play In The Majors So He Does it On The Screen&quot; trilogy.&quot;Bull Durham&quot; is of course the classic first movie in this series, with &quot;For The Love Of The Game&quot; bringing up the rear as the most forgettable of the 3 entries.)&quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is a rare baseball movie: both men and women should enjoy it as it is not a hardcore baseball film, rather a touching and moving story about one man's personal inner journey to peace and satisfaction thru building a baseball field. There isn't much action, but the story, as mythological as it is, makes you want to run out to the local sandbox with your mitt and a smile, and makes you forget those killer millionaire salaries that these overpriced performers of today make. No matter how many times I watch this movie, tears still well up in my eyes at the end, when Costner's character Ray Kinsella meets his deceased father John in the middle of an Iowa baseball cornfield and they proceed to have a traditional father/son baseball catch, healing many years of hard feelings between the two. Does it get any better than that?Baseball has its share of fictional movies, and besides &quot;The Natural&quot;, this is probably the best there is for making the case that baseball is the true national pastime. Baseball transcends communication; look to the scene when Shoeless Joe arrives at the field, and they play ball before they even speak. Baseball binds families together; Baseball heals emotional wounds.It is based on the 1982 book &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; by W.P.

The voice says, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" After hearing the voice say this, Ray's life is flipped upside down as his priorities are changed from life at his farm to mending a field and listening to a voice that he doesn't even know is real.What I liked about the book was the fact they gave about Shoeless Joe and the rest of the 1918 White Sox, a.k.a. Black Sox. You also got to see what it is like back then and the book gives you a view from Shoeless Joe's point of view. I felt great reading this book. Shoeless Joe is great book for people who love sports and/or have a great imagination. It is not too hard, so it can be read by an 8th grader and above. Though through some parts of the book, you may get lost and become confused, it still turns out to be a great sports book because of the way it portrays a belief in magic and the belief that wishes do come true."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella; Mariner Books, 1982:If one is patient, persistent, and has faith, even the wildest dreams can come true. This is captured in the magical novel, Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella, about baseball where anything goes. The first publication was in 1982 and was adapted in 1989 into the famous movie, Field of Dreams. \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" These are the mysterious words Ray Kinsella, a farmer from Iowa, hears from a baseball park announcer that leads him to make a baseball field in his cornfield. Ray, a White Sox fan, hopes his hero, Shoeless Joe, will give him the honor of playing on his field. Unbeknownst to Ray, the mysterious words also refer to his father and brother. Ray's following missions lead him to meet a host of characters which include J.D. Salinger, Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham, and the oldest living Chicago Cub, \\"Kid\\" Scissons. I find the story to be farfetched, but if you let go of reality, you will find an interesting, compelling novel of a dreamer.Ray inherited a love for baseball from his father, a person he wishes to have known better. He grew up with baseball and of course, the White Sox. \\"Instead of nursery rhymes, I was raised on the story of the Black Sox Scandal, and instead of Tom Thumb or Rumpelstiltskin, I grew up hearing of the eight disgraced ballplayers.\\" There are two other loves in Ray's life. One is his family, which includes his wife Annie and daughter Karin. The other is Iowa. This is how Ray describes his beloved Iowa: \\"Moonlight butters the whole Iowa...Clover and corn smells are thick as syrup. I experience a tingling like the tiniest of electric wires touching the back of my neck, sending warm sensation through me.\\" In W.P. Kinsella's intricate writing many memorable characters are woven in.The second time the ballpark announcer speaks to Ray, he says, \\"Ease his pain.\\" Immediately, Ray knows that the announcer is speaking of J.D. Salinger. Ray travels across the country to find the reluctant writer. This then leads to helping \\"Moonlight\\" Graham, a player who only played one inning in the major leagues and wishes for one more game. Eventually, Ray takes Kid Scissons under his wing and helps this passionate baseball lover. Ray is able to fulfill a life long dream of Kid Scission's. Kinsella's writing is fluid, imaginative and depictive.W.P. Kinsella is a master story teller whose stories are deceptively simple. He takes a simple farmer with a love for baseball and makes an interesting plot of magic and family ties. This book is about family relationship just as much as baseball. Ray is able to learn the truth and resolve his own problems through baseball. The story is not one easily forgotten but it was hard for me buy in to the magic of the book.The author knows the ins and outs of America's favorite pastime. He relates compelling facts and a give the reader a genuine feel for the game. A person with no preconception of baseball could understand and become interested in the sport. This book could make anyone want to cheer on the home team. Here is one of many passages that gives an aurora to baseball. \\"Take in everything!.. Look! Look at the yellow neon running up the foul poles. You won't see that anywhere else in the majors. Watch the players, white against green like froth on waves of ocean, Look around at the fans, count their warts just as they count ours; look at them waddle and stuff their faces and cheer with their mouths full. We're not just ordinary people, we're a congregation. Baseball is a ceremony... a ritual.\\" The magic of this novel and of baseball is something that will stick with the reader long after finishing the book.-C.

These few words change Iowa farmer, Ray Kinsella's life. From minimal instruction Ray tears up a part of his precious corn crop on a hunch. In its place he builds a baseball field for his long dead idol. Shoeless Joe brings together the love a son has for his father, and the power of belief in a legend. The book also has a movie that was introduced in 1989, and it stars Kevin Costner. Although the movie definitely made history, the book brings a lot more things to the reader's attention. For example the movie never says anything about his long lost twin brother Richard, who left home early in life never to return until Ray builds the field. The wind like voices and the baseball field are on the beginning to the real adventure, and I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who wants to return to their pastime."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"The prose may be over the top at times, but what a preposterously brilliant, creative book: can one even conceive there would be a book where two of the principal characters were JD Salinger and the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson? As absurd as the plot is on its face -- an Iowa farmer is ordered by a &quot;voice&quot; to build a ballfield so the tortured soul of Shoeless Joe Jackson can play once more -- we are gladly swept along in a willing suspension of disbelief, as this marvelous, mystical, beautifully told tale unfolds. As much as I loved the movie Field of Dreams, the book is much much better, and is a true work of literary imagination, not just a book about baseball, although it is that too."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I had the idea of reading this book with my class and watching the movie. The book is awesome. I loved it. If you have seen the movie, Ray in the book is a little more psycho. Kevin Costner makes him seem like a regular Joe. In the book, he is more edgy. With a high school class, this book would be appropriate. Of the 265 pages, 99% of the ideas expressed are wholesome, life-altering, and clever. It's the one percent that will not allow me as a professional educator to read this book with my sixth grade class next year. I would recommend this book if a student asked me about it, but I would not assign it. There are a few questionable passages that are unnecessary to the plot, yet help us understand the edgy Ray. The movie is pretty true to the book. The book is satisfying to read, whether you enjoy baseball or not."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"If you heard a voice speaking to you, what would you do? Would you run away? Would you go to a doctor? Or would you listen to the voice and interpret what it was saying? In W.P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe, Ray Kinsella, an ordinary farmer from Iowa, hears a strange, but mystical voice. The voice says, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" After hearing the voice say this, Ray's life is flipped upside down as his priorities are changed from life at his farm to mending a field and listening to a voice that he doesn't even know is real.What I liked about the book was the fact they gave about Shoeless Joe and the rest of the 1918 White Sox, a.k.a. Black Sox. You also got to see what it is like back then and the book gives you a view from Shoeless Joe's point of view. I felt great reading this book. Shoeless Joe is great book for people who love sports and/or have a great imagination. It is not too hard, so it can be read by an 8th grader and above. Though through some parts of the book, you may get lost and become confused, it still turns out to be a great sports book because of the way it portrays a belief in magic and the belief that wishes do come true."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"This book Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinnsela is a magical book about dreams and baseball. It is the that Field of Dreams was based on. In the book the main character, a farmer that lives in Iowa named Ray Kinnsela, is called to by a magical voice in the cornfield saying, \\"if you build it he will come.\\" He knew right away that \\"It\\" was a baseball field and \\"He\\" was shoeless Joe Jackson. So he proceeds to cut down some of his cornfield and create a baseball field. He continues on fine-tuning his field and getting more messages from the magical voice in the cornfield. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone that likes baseball and wants to read a good book."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I read this book in a few days over the summer for a class I was taking. Out of the seven other books we read in five weeks this one really stands out in my mind. I am not a fan of baseball either I don't watch or play it, but I was able to follow and understand this book completely. The story line was very different and effective. It is more about a son looking for closure with his father than baseball. Ray's experience in the novel takes on an almost religious quaility. Every time I think about this novel I feel good and want to read it over."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"After reading all the reviews of Shoeless Joe, I think the title I chose for this review is perfect.First, let me state the obvious: most of the people who panned this book outright had to read it for school, and write a report on it. I can honestly say that, in my opinion, this book is not for your average high school student. The ideas and themes in this novel, not to mention the ideals and dreams, are very difficult to comprehend if you're still in high school. Some of the life experiences, that are are required to understand what Mr. Kinsella is saying, are still years away. It's a shame that these students are forced to read something that, in my opinion, they are not yet ready for. If they waited until they were older, they would understand. And they would love the book.This is not Field of Dreams. That movie is the result of Hollywood taking this story, clipping here and editing there, and coming up with a screenplay that, while outstanding in its own way, is severely lacking in the substance of what this book is about.It's about life. It's about dreams and realities. It's about injustice and redemption. But most of all, it's about love and family.Ray Kinsella is an anomaly in today's society. He is a 1960s dreamer in a world full of pragmatic realists. He sees things that most people overlook. He remembers things that most people consider insignificant. But, most of all, he hears things that others cannot hear.\\"If you build it, he will come.\\" A raspy, baseball announcer's voice in the middle of an Iowa cornfield says those seven words, and Ray Kinsella knows exactly what they mean. Build a baseball stadium, and Shoeless Joe Jackson, the falsely accused and disgraced 1919 Chicago White Sox star, will return to play again. If that sounds hokey, or corny, it's because, to most people, it is. But not to Ray. Shoeless Joe Jackson was the favorite player of his father, John Kinsella. Ray grew up hearing stories of the 1919 White Sox, and Shoeless Joe. As the story progresses, the pure love Ray feels for his father becomes more and more evident. While the movie makes it something different, in the book it is all about love and memory.The love between Ray and Annie is as close to a perfect love as humanity can get. And if some find that unreal, it's because it is so rare that it seems unreal. This is the love we all dream about. This is the love we feel we all have. But in reality, this love is the ideal love. And though in many ways it is hard to believe such a love could ever exist, in some very rare and special circumstances, it can, and it does.Why does Ray follow the voice he hears? Why does he plow under his cornfield, risking his farm, his home, and possibly even his family? Because Ray knows that sometimes you have to follow the voices you hear. He knows Annie will understand. Or if not understand, realize that he has to do what he has to do. From the first time Shoeless Joe appears in his field, Ray starts to dream. He dreams of seeing his father again. Seeing him in a way he never knew him: young and playing baseball, the game he loved. Shoeless Joe tells him to finish the field, to make it possible for all of the disgraced White Sox to come and play again. Then, and only then, he promises, will they consider having his father on the team.So Ray begins his long, slow journey, finishing the field, learning the tricks of the trade from the experts, creating a perfect ball park. And still he waits.And then the voice comes back. And Ray is off on a journey to take one of the most famous reclusive authors of our time to a baseball game. He plans his trip carefully, preparing himself so he will be ready to share his dreams, to open his heart and soul to a man who he is convinced needs him to come take him to a baseball game.Along the way, we also meet Eddie \\"Kid\\" Scissons, the oldest living Chicago Cub (or is he), and learn the short, but poignant tale of Dr. Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham. The playing out of these stories, and the love of baseball, and all things pure and simple, tug at our hearts, and make us want to believe in the dreams.And we do. And when Ray finally comes back to the farm, accompanied by a ghost from the past, and a mystery from the present, he discovers his long-lost twin brother has shown up, confusing Annie and their daughter. The differences between the identical twin brothers are enormous, but slowly, they begin to disappear as the dream, Ray's catcher, his father, finally makes his appearance.The threats of losing everything to Annie's scheming brother, and his business partner, the reality of \\"Kid\\" Scissons, and the tragic heroics of Moonlight Graham bring the book ever closer to its climax, as we realize that some dreams, no matter how precious, are sometimes less important when the glare of reality blinds us, forcing us to make choices we thought we would never have to make.This is a story of love, dreams and life that is worthy of any book collection. Read it. You will come away better for having done so."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"W.P Kinsella. Shoeless Joe. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1982. 265 pp. $22.95.When was the last time you tumbled onto cool, moist grass, looked up at the robin's-egg blue sky, and imagined that the clouds were forming shapes of various animals? Or the last time you felt total freedom while lifting yourself skyward on an old tree swing, back when summer never seemed to end?These and many more childhood memories will come alive while reading Shoeless Joe. W.P. Kinsella's fictional accounting centers on baseball legend Joe Jackson, one of the Chicago \\"Black\\" Sox 8, who was permanently banned from baseball. Joe's magical appearance in an Iowa cornfield initiates a journey for main character Ray Kinsella, to not only fulfill his dreams, but those of many extraordinary characters, too.At first glance, the book is about baseball and Ray's journey to fulfill the request of the voice, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" But as Ray ventures across the country the reader begins to sense that, as in The Wizard of Oz, anything is possible, simply by believing. As the plot develops, Ray's acceptance of the mystical, almost religious aspects of baseball, allows the reader to revisit dreams from his own past, too. Ray says, \\"Your secret dreams grow over the years like apple seeds sown in your belly...sprout through your skin, gentle and soft and wondrous, and they breathe and have a life on their own....\\"Though most of the characters are as refreshing as a Popsicle or as rich as a Fudgsicle on a summer's day, Ray's wife, Annie is far too loving and weak. Female readers, in particular, may have difficulty connecting to Annie's life, with her lack of protest when her husband plans to plow under their crops to construct a ball-field. But, many readers can relate to Ray's efforts directed toward repairing his relationship with his dad, and may realize how profoundly this book mirrors their own relationships, too.Upon deeper reflection, a reader realizes the importance of Moonlight Graham's statement that \\"hardly anybody recognizes the most significant moments of their life at the time they happen.\\" While reading this book, a reader may experience a deep desire to turn back the hands of time for a chance to relive his childhood, or to take back words spoken in anger, or to reawaken in the arms of a love from long ago.The story rides on dialogue, rhythmically slow like baseball, as Ray tiptoes beyond the realm of this world. Threading the timelessness of baseball throughout the book suggests immortality to the reader, as Ray tries to answer the question \\"Is this Heaven.\\" The reader is drawn in and realizes that looking at this world is not the same as seeing it. Miracles happen everyday and can be taken for granted when viewed only with the eyes, and not appreciated with the heart, as well. Sacred events of planting and harvesting fertile farmland, the changing seasons, and the glorious birth of children are connected to the repeating cycle of baseball.Author W.P. Kinsella's strength is mastery of the metaphor, with similes stunning our senses with vivid descriptions, conjuring up precise, almost tangible images. He writes, \\" Moonlight butters the whole Iowa night. Clover and corn smells are thick as syrup.\\" A reader can almost taste a big stack of pancakes. W.P. Kinsella draws in the reader with the familiarity of baseball, while challenging him to rekindle his dream. Each time a batter is up in Shoeless Joe, the renewal of hope hangs as crisp and fresh as sheets on the line to dry. When Ray's twin brother, Richard, returns to the family, and J.D Salinger is reunited with his first love, the reader comes away believing that it is truly possible to start over again.Like meeting an old friend at a favorite ballpark, the reader can escape the routine of schedules and deadlines, while enjoying this book based on a summer ritual. W.P. Kinsella satisfies the reader with a significant amount of baseball facts, sifted through the Chicago scandal. He successfully concludes when the reader's nostrils are filled with nostalgia of glove oil and leather, freshly cut grass, and home-baked apple pie. Kathie Mueller"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"For those of us who love baseball, who love the history of baseball, this book explains ourselves to ourselves. You will have complete and total empathy with the majority of the characters populating this tale.If you don't &quot;get&quot; baseball, this book may provide some insight.Mr. Kinsella has written a highly original story, written so well some passages seem to sing, that addresses such human conditions as parental loss, unreserved trust, unquestioning love.And baseball.The line between reality and fiction is playfully drawn. The author and the protagonist have the same last name. J.D. Salinger and Shoeless Joe are real people.The action such that it is centers around a magical ballfield created in the midst of a small Iowa farm.The book is filled with so many wonderful moments that listing them would be insulting to the book.If you're familiar with the film, &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, then you know the story...but the book is so much fuller. Richer. They actually complement each other well.This is a perfect book to read during this time of year..."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"&quot;Never judge a book by its movie,&quot; they say, and in this case the adage holds true. &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; has been around since 1989 and is not merely a baseball flick, or a Kevin Costner starlight -- it's the depiction of a spiritual journey for both Ray Kinsella and the audience. The book &quot;Shoeless Joe,&quot; on the other hand, provides more food for thought and additional storylines. If you simply see the movie, you'll miss out on meeting Kid Scissons, the oldest living Chicago Cub, who rented his farm to Ray and Annie. You won't know that Ray has a twin brother Richard who left home at 15, never to be seen or heard from again, until the time that Ray built his baseball field. And though there are times when the novel's characters share the same script with their movie counterparts, there are many more instances when they don't.If you are the kind of person who has to watch &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; at least once a year, then you should jump back a step and read &quot;Shoeless Joe.&quot; Better yet, you should make the trip to Dyersville, Iowa, where the field and the farmhouse still exist and look just as they did in the movie. If you can stand on that baseball field without any emotion or without a chill moving along your spine, then someone better check your pulse."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"There is a famous quote floating around out there that conveys the essence of baseball and this novel: &quot;Many attend, but few understand.&quot; Put simply, this book is a work for true lovers of the game. If you heart doesn't skip a beat on opening day, or you don't appreciate the smell of old leather and fresh cut grass, then this book is not for you. If you look down upon people who are oversentimental and nostalgic, then this book is not for you. But if you do understand the game and how it is a symbol of America and of youth and memory and peace and beauty, then buy a copy of this book. There are passages in &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; that continue to amaze me. Prose in the form of poetry. The best baseball novel ever written. No contest."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"It was in the summer of 1987 that I wandered into a bookstore in Rockport, Mass. To this day, some 17 years later, I have no idea what drew me to the second floor of that bookstore. There, among the stacks, I found a fantastical book called the Iowa Baseball Confederacy by a W.P. Kinsella. It was summer outside and yet, I was drawn to this obscure book. I read it and fell in love. Two years later, Field of Dreams was released and it was based on Shoeless Joe by this Kinsella fellow. And I feel in love with that movie too. Life moved on and I never read the book, Shoeless Joe. I read a few Kinsella stories, but never had the chance to read his only other novel. THen, I was finally drawn to the book. Perhaps it was the 15th anniversary of &quot;Field of Dreams.&quot; Nevertheless, I read Shoeless Joe in a single day (and what a pleasure it was). The book is indeed different from the movie. And that makes it a pleasure. The movie stays close to the spirit of the book, and works beautifully as a motion picture. The book is deeper, sweeter, and more magical. J.D. Salinger, Ray's twin brother, and others populate the cast. Annie is sweeter and more dreamy than in the Amy Madigan's protrayal. Enough about the film though. This is a story about life, love, dreams, and baseball (although baseball is indeed all of those things). It is, as Salinger says,the one constant in our lives. The books explores Ray's mania a bit more. The magic of Kinsella will touch anyone who reads the book. While I'm sorry I took so long to read it, I'm sure as heck glad I did. I read somewhere that Kinsella is no longer writing. I respect that of course, but we sure as hell miss him."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Daydreams, visions, and hopes all come together in the magical novel Shoeless Joe, written by WP Kinsella. In Kinsella's compelling novel, Ray Kinsella, an Iowa insurance agent turned farmer, is changed from a dreamer into a creator. At first, he is a dreamer, hoping to keep his farm while not making enough money off of it to pay off the mortgage. His brothers-in-law constantly attempt to buy his farm from him in order to complete a scheme to make them a load of money. Regardless, he keeps his farm and hopes for a way to pay for it. There, he enjoys life with his wife Annie and his daughter Karina. Annie and Karina support Ray throughout the book, giving him good advice and lifting his spirits when he needs it most. His love of baseball, dreaminess, and determination send him on a journey to both past and present to search for the greatest baseball game that he will ever see. It starts when, one summer evening, Ray hears an incorporeal voice say, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" Ray immediately knows that \`he' is Shoeless Joe Jackson, a man banned from baseball for life as a result of the infamous Black Sox scandal of 1919. The \`it' is a baseball field, to be constructed in Ray's cornfield. With care and diligence, Ray builds a stadium, with left field (Shoeless Joe's position) a veritable heaven. He waits for Shoeless Joe to appear, and in time he does and plays ball there every night. Then Ray perfects the rest of the field, and the other members of the Black Sox come to play for him. The fantasy appeared perfect, but it didn't last. Then, \\"Ease his pain.\\" Ray hears those words from the immaterial voice after his completion of the stadium. Instinctively, he knows that the \`pain' is that of JD Salinger, the famous yet hermit-like author of Catcher in the Rye. He realizes that he must go cross-country and get Salinger to come with him to a baseball game, getting Salinger to stop being a hermit and go back to loving baseball. Ray effectively kidnaps an unwilling Salinger and takes him to Fenway Park for a game. Though at first stubborn, Salinger comes around, finally agreeing to go with Ray back to Iowa to see the magical field. On the way back to Iowa, other characters are encountered. They are Archibald \`Moonlight' Graham, a baseball player for the New York Giants (albeit only as a defensive replacement for an inning), Richard Kinsella, Ray's twin brother who has not been seen by Ray for many years but has been drawn back to Iowa by some freakish coincidence (or is it a coincidence?), and Eddie Scissons, an old man who loves to tell tales of his \`baseball days' with the Cubs, and how he will be buried in a Cubs uniform (although he never played for them). Both Scissons and Graham are former ballplayers who succumbed to everyday life, and all of the above men have something that they need to do; something that only Ray's ballfield can do for them. Through Ray and his field, they can regain a bit of the past, and part of their lives is reopened to them. From Salinger's invitation to visit with the phantom ballplayers to one of Ray's lifelong family dreams coming true to the revealing of Eddie's secrets to the transformation of Graham, each character has a unique and important role. Kinsella writes in detail about the characters, their problems, journeys, and successes. He mixes in trivial details with the important information and makes the book seem shorter than it really is. With clever imagery and a gripping storyline, Shoeless Joe is wonderfully written. It reads like a true story that happens to have some elements of a novel. This book is one of the better ones that I have read, because of both the great characters and the plot. Ray's dreams and journey stick with you after you have finished reading. One scene that captures the feeling of the book is this, at the end of the story; \\"On the porch, we turn to look at the silent, satiny green of the field. I press the switch, and, like a candle going out, the scar of lights disappears. Above the farm, a moon bright as butter silvers the night as Annie holds the door open for me.\\" It shows how Ray loves the field, and how Annie has been a strongly supporting member of his family for him. The passage also shows how WP Kinsella describes with words (the silent, satiny green of the field) the beauty of the field and without words (as Annie hold the door open for me) how Annie has supported Ray throughout the book. By reading Shoeless Joe, one can understand what true baseball fandom is about, and how dreams can fade into reality."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"There is an element of perfection W.P. Kinsella captures in his book Shoeless Joe. Remember the scenes in the book as being vivid? The players in the field, the rustling of the corn stalks, the fans on the left field bleachers and Annie on the porch swing on a beautiful Iowa day? Kinsella captures all that.It was tough reading the book after seeing Field of Dreams, but I still enjoyed it. Kinsella captures both the zen of baseball and its mystique and the strive for perfection.How many of us would shuck the responsibilities of a farm/home mortgage/job etc., to follow our heart? Not many. Kinsella did and the book is a testament to the heart. A great book; read it just before baseball season opens in April to get the full flavor."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"At first glance, Shoeless Joe appears to be a book about baseball. However, as you read on, you realize the author is using baseball, a game of magic to describe the beauty of everyday life. The way Ray Kinsella describes his family, his baseball field when its completed, baseball itself gives you a sense that the world is a beautiful thing. It is a book about magic, love, and realizing deep down who you are. Ray feels guilty about his fathers death and it is very emotional when they meet at the end. Even though it seems fanciful and all that, you still feel that it is real and the book allows YOU to believe in the magic of miracles. I recommend the movie, Field of Dreams as well because you can actually see everything happening as it becomes more real. My favorite part of the movie is when Ray says &quot;Dad, do you want to have a catch?&quot; and Ray and his father throw the baseball to and fro. Baseball is a game of legacy, a game that has lasted through the generations, that loves to be passed on from father to son. The book should definitely be read!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I'm not a baseball fan. I'm not even a sports fan. But I am a Shoeless Joe fan, and for this book I go to Red Sox games, and for this book I cheer on my dinky little highschool team, one of the few fans beside a field without bleachers. This book is beautifully written and paced, and wonderfully lyrical. It catches you at odd moments and makes you cry. And you're not sure why or how, but you're glad it did. This book is about baseball. Can you believe that?"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I am a big fan of this book--find there is more there in the book than the movie, which I also thoroughly enjoyed (and saw first).In reading the 1-star reviews of the novel, it seems that most are from students who were \\"forced\\" to read it. This brings to mind some concerns:1. Since reading the book wasn't a choice, you are probably not the best judge of it's quality and merit.2. I would guess the reviewers are, then, younger. It's possible the book is beyond them. But if these reviewers are representational of their age group, it is sad that young people do not have the capability of understanding it and appreciating it.And, by the way, while the book is about baseball at one level, it is about much more than that (and its even about more than making your dreams come true)."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Imagine listening to Peggy Lee singing \\"Is That All There Is\\" and feeling like you need to sleep for a week to escape the inane, predictable world. And then imagine youself feeling inspired by a short but magical novel that seems to say that just about anything is possible. If you're in the doldrums and tempted to become a cynic, read W. P. Kinsella's SHOELESS JOE. Peggy won't sound so convincing after you're finished.Yes, of course, the plot is slightly different from the movie's, but not by much. A few scenes from the book are omitted for the sake of pacing, and Hollywood made J.D. Salinger into bestselling writer Terence Mann for legal reasons in case the recluse got his shorts all bunched up. But the storyline of FIELD OF DREAMS is quite faithful to the novel. So why read the book, you ask.First, Kinsella's style is quite poetic. Although it becomes a bit saccharine in spots, it nevertheless has an easy feel to it. The paragraphs flow with a descriptive grace that is a bit magical in itself. There are some very long digressions, but even these are interesting as they slip nicely into Kinsella's tale of baseball as the saving grace of America--and one man in particular: Ray Kinsella.The best reason to read this book, however, is to have the author's original words, as opposed to the resulting screenplay, sink into your soul so that you can feel the magic of the prose-poetry at a deeper level, where it can take root.Kinsella manages to do two things in this novel: he speaks of the importance of the simple things in life: a farm, a pitcher of lemonade, a kiss, baseball. Simultaneously, he implies that there is a magic woven into the very fabric of reality, a magic that can happen to anyone. Paradoxically, it is this magic that ultimately makes the simple things accessible to us. Maybe that's why kids can have fun with rocks, sticks, and carboard boxes--kids who also believe in magic and baseball.So \\"is that all there is\\"? No, Peggy. There is a mysterious world in the cornfields of Ray Kinsella's farm, a world that can touch our own if we allow ourselves to once again believe in dreams and possibilities."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"There is a real special place in my heart for this book and always will be. It's just one of those stories that grab you and take you for a ride, although a very quiet ride. Kinsella's style is soft and melodic and by the end, even those of you who know next to nothing about baseball will find it enthralling. When discussing the book, the movie \\"Field of Dreams\\" invariably comes up and I suppose it rightly should seeing as how it is based on Kinsella's novel. I enjoyed the film version but have to say I prefer this book. Movies can sometimes really hold the spirit of the book but in this case, I think your own imagination is best. There's less Iowa society politics and more magic in the book. All in all- I'd say grab a copy of this whether you are into baseball or not. It's not a requirement to enjoy this fantastic, magical novel."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"A great book, and a real page turner, similar to any John Grisham read.

This book signifies the love and passion of baseball. I liked this book for many different reasons. First, the author was very accurate in the content of this book. He talked of real players at their exact time. This book was also well planned out. The structure is really easy to follow. The book was written in a \\"modern\\" type language, so there was none of the old english or hard to understand language in the book. Another point I liked was how the author explained the characters. He would write about a character to their exact description.So what is the truth and how do you know it? In this book, you have to follow the storyline very carefully. This book is historical fiction so most of it is made up, but the truth does lie in the book if you find the persons, places, and times the event took place.Do the times shape you or do you shape the times. In this book, for instance, the author shapes the times on you, and you on the times. I don't want to give the book away, but there is an instance where it is clear time is not a big factor.

In Shoeless Joe, after Ray completes the stadium, two men named Mark and Bluestein keep trying to buy Ray's land and bulldoze the stadium and have the land be farmed by computers. So Ray is trying to save his farm throughout the whole book.

Ray Kinsella is a very strong man. Not physically but mentally. He hears an announcer make a statement fo which ray follows. When Ray Kinsella built it, Shoeless Joe came. As he worked harder, more and more people came. This book is a great book about how if you follow your dreams, and the voice of a baseball announcer, you might end up with an amazing finish."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"The 1919 Chicago White Sox form the backdrop of this mystical book about bringing dreams to life. Shoeless Joe is much more than a book about baseball, it is about having a dream and pursuing it with a passion.Of course, baseball fans (like myself) will love how Kinsella uses the game to bring to life the characters and the truth of living life fully, without hesitation. Kinsella's use of language creates grand pictures within the reader's mind and is an absolute joy.I highly recommend this book for baseball fans and students of life."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I first picked up this book about 15 years ago, and just recently read it again (I believe my third or fourth time overall).In Shoeless Joe, Kinsella has managed to capture all that baseball means to so many people. Anyone who has been touched by baseball at any level, whether watching little league, AAA or a major league game - or just having a catch - will be able to appreciate the messages found in this book.Read it in a shady spot in a park during a few long lunch hours with kids playing a game of baseball nearby. You'll begin to understand what Kinsella meant by &quot;finding yourself in shirtsleeves on a perfect summer day with a reserved spot in the grandstands&quot; [para]."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"A truly gripping novel. A little different from \\"Field Of Dreams\\", but still very good. One really steps into \\"Ray's\\" shoes when he talks about baseball. The author really feels for this sport and makes us feel it as well."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"After seeing Field of dreams and knowing about Joe Jackson for over 40 years, I had too get this book by w.p kinsella to find out more about shoeless Joe.Gives me something to do on cold winter nights and maybe gives me information about why things went the way the went."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"If you're like me, reading Shoeless Joe by W. P. Kinsella for the first time after being a long time fan of the movie, then you're in for a treat. Of course, if you expect it to read like a novelization of Field of Dreams, then you'll be disappointed.The story is a deliberate and passionate journey of a man following a crazy voice in his head to build a baseball field in place of the crops on his Iowa farm. He risks his family's livelihood for the sake of a dream, and because he loves his wife, daughter, Iowa and baseball. The writing is leisurely as if stretching back across the 20th century from the very time of Shoeless Joe Jackson. Give yourself time to get enveloped in this one."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Just as there is comfort food, there is comfort reading. And for me, there is no better comfort reading than W.P. Kinsella's classic baseball fantasy, Shoeless Joe. I re-read this one every few years to remind myself why I fell in love with the game in the first place - and why that romance has lasted for over 50 years now. What is not to like about a novel about baseball, family and second chances? Keep in mind that this is not Field of Dreams, the great Kevin Costner movie based on Kinsella's novel. Shoeless Joe is better.Ray Kinsella, an accidental farmer, lives with his wife and little girl on a rented Iowa farm. Ray is still learning on the job, and things are not going well. But despite the family's financial problems, Ray is willing to plow up a substantial portion of his cornfield when he hears what seems to be the voice of a baseball announcer saying to him, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" Weird as that is, Ray instinctively knows that he is Shoeless Joe Jackson, one of the disgraced Chicago White Sox players accused of throwing the 1919 World Series (and his father's favorite baseball player). So build it, he does.Building the stadium, though, is just the beginning of Ray's quest, a quest that will lead him on a cross-country road trip to the hideaway home of reclusive author J.D. Salinger. Ray knows that he needs to bring Salinger back to his little Iowa ballpark, but he does not know why - and Salinger is having none of it, so Ray kidnaps him. On the way back to Iowa, Ray stops in Boston to deliver on the promise he made to Salinger to bring him to a game at Fenway Park if he would just get in the car. Late in the game, Ray's personal announcer makes another appearance to give Ray and Salinger a hint about what they need to do next.Shoeless Joe is, especially for hardcore baseball fans, a thing of beauty. It is primarily a novel about the beauty of second chances. Shoeless Joe Jackson and the Black Sox get to play baseball again; Ray reconciles with the twin brother he lost track of years earlier; old men who barely missed out on the opportunity to play major league baseball get a chance to see their younger selves compete with and against ghost players from the past; Ray gets to see his father as a young man. And Ray gets a second chance to save his farm from his scheming brother-in-law.This is a book about following one's dreams, taking chances, and joyously living the only shot at life any of us will ever be blessed to have. When I need to remind myself of these principles, I reach for Shoeless Joe. It has done the trick for three decades - and I hope there are still several more re-reads in my future."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"When I first discovered this book, I immediately bought 10 more copies to give to everyone I knew who needed to dream or believe in their own dreams. And it's on my shelf of \\"books for the desert island\\", those to read and reread again after they've been sufficiently forgotten to be fresh again. Surfing through Amazon's baseball books has reminded me that it's time to reread this marvelous book, for the joy of the reading and to determine what my new dreams are. If you love good writing and words, forget the movie (good in its own way), forget the audio version and just sit down with this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"The game of baseball placed a lien on my heart when I was very young. Anyone who has been reading the pages of The White Rhino Report for any length of time will not be surprised to learn this fact. Family legend insists that at the age of 2, I could recite quite accurately the entire Boston Red Sox line-up. Yet it is not just the Red Sox I love, it is the game of baseball - its pace, its angles, its colors and smells and sounds, its history, its legends, its heroes and its goats. I love the subtle movements of the fielders between pitches. I love the arcane tactics and many possibilities that may unfold whenever the ball leaves the pitcher's hand. I love the poetry and literature and films that the game has inspired down through the generations.These have been difficult days and months and years for lovers of the pure game of baseball. The steroid era has tainted the game in countless ways, and has spoiled the fun for many of us. The recent revelations (illegally leaked to the press) that David Ortiz - my beloved Big Papi - had tested positive for a banned substance in 2003 saddened and disappointed me. The Red Sox six-game slide - going 0-for-Tampa-and-the-Bronx - swept through me like a chill east wind.So, it was very timely last week when my sister, Diane, handed me a copy of W.P. Kinsella's classic baseball novel, \\"Shoeless Joe.\\" The novel was the inspiration for one of my favorite films of all time: \\"Field of Dreams.\\" The novel and the film that it spawned are, in a word, magical. Reading Kinsella took me back in time along with his homespun characters to a simpler era of baseball and American life. The book and the film have injected into American dialogue phrases that are wonderfully and instantly recognizable as having been whispered by the disembodied voice in the sky:\\"If you build it, he will come.\\"\\"Go the distance.\\"\\"Ease his pain.\\"Re-reading this simple, elegiac and phantasmagorical story scrubbed my sullied baseball soul clean again. I am renewed and ready for the pennant race. Maybe there is a little bit of Shoeless Joe and his grace in Jacoby Ellsbury. Go Sox!I now plan to read some of the other baseball-themed writings that Kinsella has produced over the years - \\"The Iowa Baseball Confederacy,\\" \\"The Thrill of the Grass,\\" et al.Enjoy!Al"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"In all seriousness, Field of Dreams is an excellent movie adaptation and this is an excellent book. Both of which can stand on their own and provide good experiences no matter what order you watch/read them in.I found the book to be a very pleasing, almost in a fantasy style. There are no wasted words which makes for a quick read, but one that delivers.If the other reviewers had not pointed out the overuse of similes, I never would have noticed it.There are subplots and characters in the book that are not included in the movie that make reading this a rewarding experience. The description of the baseball field (and stadium, with a ghost crowd and vendors) is fantastic and paints a very different picture in your mind than the movie version portrayed (at least for me, anyway). The relationships between the characters are much deeper and you feel love/pity/sympathy/hate for the different character personalities.Negatives: Ray's daughter seemed to act/talk/behave well beyond her years. She's a good character and plays an integral role in the book, but she should have been older. As a parent of kids, I kept thinking: \\"No 2 or 3 year old is going to talk or act like that!\\" But that's just nitpicking something.Positives: I loved the fact that J.D. Salinger is in the book and is explored so deeply. Made me curious how the real J.D. Salinger felt about his portrayal and if he really is a baseball fan.The way the book is written makes it seem almost like a dream and every word has it's place.The characters are deep, creating a strong emotional bond. Read it for yourself and see if you don't get a little emotional about Moonlight Graham, even if you know what's going to happen!Overall, a good book. A quick but very rewarding read!"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"There are a few claims to fame in the literary world that I obnoxiously hold on to, meaning I read the book long before the movie adapation made the book famous. This is one of them. Being a sucker not only for a nice, sentimental story but one involving baseball, this book looked interesting to me on the shelves right after it came out in 1982. I wasn't disappointed.The odd thing was that someone changed the name of the field to \\"Field Of Dreams,\\" so I was shocked when I began watching the movie. \\"I know this story!,\\" I said, a bit too loud at the movie theater. Anyway, this book is very interesting and the movie is one that can bring a tear to a man's eye. As the years have gone by, I have retained interest in both and last year, re-read this book. Both film and novel, I think it's safe to say, will appeal far more to men than to women. It's just a father-and-son guy's story.If you're like me and have seen the film a lot more than you've read the book, you're in for a few surprises......both good and bad. I don't want to get into specifics because I'd spoil it for those who haven't read this.I still like the movie better, to be totally honest, but the book offers good stuff, too. The only problem I had with Kinsella was his political agenda which he seems to push on the reader a lot more than was shown in the film."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Somewhere along the road the phrase 'if you build it, they will come' has come to signify a sort of brainless reassurance. In fact, the message of the book is that if you build something with a clarity of vision and purity of heart, there will be results worthy of your effort.Reading this beautiful book about baseball (and make no mistake, it's really about baseball)will liberate you from the power of that cliche. It will also give you a haunting, beautiful model from which to build your own fields.Lynn Hoffman, author of the novel bang BANG"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"For anyone who loves baseball, and good lord I do, and for anyone who values the history of baseball, this novel holds a mirror up to us and explain to us why we love this game the way we do. The reader cannot help but feel identification and empathy with all of the wonderful characters Kinsella creates. Even those who do not really understand this whole baseball fascination will gleen an insight or two into why that is.Mr. Kinsella has crafted a unique story, written in eloquent prose that speaks to the reader's heart. All of the facets of the human condition are explored in conjunction with this snapshot of baseball love.The book is filled with so many wonderful scenes. It is much better and more fulfilling than the film, \\"Field of Dreams.\\"Baseball season or not, this is a perfect book to read when you have some free time."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"One of my life pleasures is to read the book good movies are based on. Shoeless Joe is the basis for Field of Dreams, a movie that I give 5 stars. I give this book 3 stars - the movie is better.That said, this is a worthwhile book to read, especially if you like the movie. It has elements of spirituality, family, baseball, fame, sex, and mystery that make it a good read. Kinsella's transitions don't always work.There are substantial differences between the book and movie. The screenwriter did a great job of picking pieces of the book to make the movie. Things in the book you will not find in the movie:- Ray has a twin brother named Richard, who he has not seen in 20 years, and who shows up in Iowa working as a barker for a third rate carnival (I am not making this up)- Annie is portrayed in the movie as cute, in the book she is a sexpot- Ray is a real dope when it comes to basic stuff like farming, mechanical things, and finance.- Travelling to find Salinger, Ray stops at several ballparks along the way- Ray frequently has borderline violent thoughts in many circumstances- Ray confronts his father in an awkward and incomplete manner."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I REALLY enjoyed this book. I thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book. There were some character changes and some additional characters in the book, but I don't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there. I read the book after seeing the movie - I always wondered what the movie had been based on. I love baseball, and I think the book was great."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Shoeless Joe Jackson comes to Iowa in the movie Field of Dreams. This audio book is the basis for that blockbuster movie, and what the movie leaves out you'll find in this recording.The audio book is far more detailed and in some cases different than the movie, and it would be better if you have not seen the movie at all. I thought this recording was far better than the movie.Over the course of the six tapes I was treated to a story that starts off grabbing you and never lets go until the last minute. I enjoyed the way the reader brought to life the characters of Joe Jackson, Ray Kinsella and others.What I enjoyed most was the way the author ended the book, leaving you with a sense that maybe a sequel would be in line. It was my listening privilege and I have recommended this to so many baseball fans already."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Like most, I saw the movie prior, and it is one of my all-time favorites.On the positive side, the book is very well-written, semi-deep, and resembles the movie enough to make it interesting and definitely not boring, as others somehow found.On the negative side, it's 50-100 pages too long and very preachy. Kinsella (author & main character) is clearly a Marxist who hates religion, ordinary folks and businessmen. He is so condescending in some of his cliche and naive commentaries on religion and his wife's family. This detracted from the book big time. It is a fiction book, after all!Also, one person noted \\"It seemed like every other word was a figure of speech.\\"True. And while, as a writer, I appreciate some of this, I can see how having myriad similes and analogies can also be irksome.The book could have been better. It's rare for me to admit this, but stick to the movie."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I thought I ordered a paperback novel!!! What I got was a book on cassette tape. The box is in very rough shape. The reason I give it 2 stars is I just happen to have an older car that has a working cassette player in it."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"\\"Shoeless Joe\\" was the basis for the 1989 movie \\"Field of Dreams\\". I'm sure my book review is a bit tainted since I saw the movie again last year with my family. It almost felt like the book started too fast with the mysterious voice, and it was hard for me to recapture the mystique and awe that the movie voice inspired whenever it gave directions to Ray.I did enjoy the book, and it introduced me to some characters that weren't in the movie such as Eddie \\"Kid\\" Scissons, and Ray's twin brother Richard. I thought these characters added a little more to the overall story.I highly recommend the book to anyone that loves the game of baseball. There is a speech from Kid Scissons that puts baseball on par with religion, and I believe that is probably true for some diehard fans of the game."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella is a riveting book, not just about baseball, but also about a journey to meet a dream. Ray Kinsella, the main character who is a farmer and baseball lover, goes out to collect people for his majestic field. I believe that this book is well written because of its first person narrative and descriptive writing. Although this book seems like something for a sports fan, but anybody who loves to read and be amused throughout a book, this is a perfect read. This book is a page turner and I truly believe that everybody who reads it will be pleased."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Baseball is something sacred, especially when shared between fathers and sons. And \\"Shoeless Joe\\" is centered around that very thing - a lost son searching for the ghost of his father, chasing dreams and hearing voices in his head.And of course there is the romance of the game, something that could turn an otherwise normal cornfield in the middle of Iowa into a sacred gathering place for ghosts of the game's past.And it's a love story between Ray and Annie as well.It's a beautiful book, one that I've enjoyed many times. Before my dad died, we even made a detour to Iowa to see the cornfield they carved up for the movie \\"Field of Dreams.\\"There's a reason baseball inspires so much poetry, literature and art, and Kinsella is one of the best at capturing it. If you love the game and great storytelling, then this book is for you.-- John Nemo, author of the baseball novel The King's Game"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Shoeless Joe is an inspirational novel about a baseball fanatic from a small town in Iowa. Ray Kinsella the main character, is a struggling farmer economically. One night Ray hears a voice while on his farm saying, \\"If you build it they will come\\". Ray the dreamer he is, decides to knock down his valuable crops and build a baseball field, in hope of bringing back his favorite player Shoeless Joe Jackson. So Ray follows the voices and goes on a long journey from Iowa to Boston to Minnesota in search of answers to finally find the answers to his dreams and his economic problems.If you are a fan of dreaming and hope then this book is for you. This book is very similar to the movie, Field Of Dreams. However, in the novel W.P. Kinsella elaborates a lot more on the settings and it is a lot more enjoyable. If you are a fan of non-fiction I do not reccomond this novel. The events in this book are farfetched but really inspiring.The theme in this book mistaken by most is not baseball. Kinsella brings up the idea of hope, father-son, and to not give up on your dreams."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Like some of the people that rated this book, i am also a student. I had to read this book for my final Gr. 11 English ISU. I found this book really confusing due to the fact that it does not have a clear timeline. The book was good only because it showed pride, love, and passion for baseball, which reflected well with the main theme. But it was really hard to understand what was real and what was not. The book was less enjoyable as i thought it would be since my teacher recommended it. I'm more into the mystery or thriller books, so this book seemed pretty boring to me. I think i am being generous for giving it a 4 star rating. Too bad you can't give it .5 ratings here."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I love Field of Dreams and baseball so I was excited to read the book it was based off.

A very good sport book, though as a regular read, it stands alone."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this book, and like many of the best sports stories this really isn't about the sport as much as it is about family, dreams, America, and what really matters in life. The book is a bit different from the movie (Field of Dreams), as expected, but is still close enough so that it adds something to fans of the film.Someone commented that this book is read by high school and college students, but really is best enjoyed by some older, with more life experience.

I really enjoyed the story as it related to the father and son."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"My overriding reaction to reading Shoeless Joe is how different the story is from the movie, Field of Dreams. The film was very much on my mind as I read the story. This is the rare instance where the movie proved to be more satisfying than the book. I am a lover of baseball and, like the protagonist in the story, Ray Kinsella, I can get overly sentimental about America's Pastime. The author waxes poetic and writes lyrically about the game. His prose is, at times, elegant. But, in the end, things get a bit too lyrical. I found myself saying enough already. Less flowery soliloquies and more action. And I found the ending to be unsatisfying. Nonetheless, if you love baseball, it's worth the read. You'll probably enjoy Shoeless Joe more if you haven't seen the movie."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"This is one of my favoite books. I cringe inside at the negative reviews. The language is beautiful, almost poetic, but so accessible to every reader. I read this when I was much younger, basically because I love baseball and I thought it was, ostensibly, a book about baseball. But it is so much more. It deals with life and regrets and love and allowing yourself to dream as you age even when you think dreams are only for the young. It is about taking chances and trust and leaps of faith and confidence in the face of doubt. The book is a poignant insight into what it means to love and dream against the odds.Although this book was the basis of the Field of Dreams movie, the two works diverged. Each is special in its own way, and I feel they complement each other quite well. I love both the book and the movie for different reasons, and I have both seen and read each many, many times.My hope is that each and every person reading this review will give this book a chance to be one of your favorites, too."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I was going to present this review as an analogy between a well-cooked and a gourmet meal or a competent musical performance versus one of genius. That would be like lecturing on the value of silence.As I get older I find myself paying more attention to the writing quality of what I read. If I don't notice it, if the writing itself doesn't get my attention, it's professional and competant. When it does stand out it's usually because the writing is wooden, journalistic or lacking in flourish, like an unseasoned steak. It's edible but missing something (I had to get that one in).Every once in a while I notice writing for it's own sake. I find myself rereading sentences or paragraphs not for what they say but how they say it. It's what made Jack London and Joseph Conrad great writers, not just Boy's Life hacks. I remember One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for how the language hit me. I'm not sure how much Kesey's pure talent was aided by an LSD enhanced pallet but Jack Nicholson never entered my mind.I'm a fan of baseball, baseball literature and Kevin Costner. I even liked Water World. When I ran across the Kindle listing of Shoeless Joe at an acceptable price I jumped at it. It was nothing like what I expected. At first I thought it was an anthology. The first chapter reads like a short story, somthing that would inspire a longer and more involved screenplay. When I realized the movie follows the book pretty closely my respect for the movie increased. The story is hokey and profound at the same time, weird and whimsical, well plotted, fast paced, plodding and digressive, populated with stock characters that are as real as your annoying next door neighbor. You'll get it if you're a baseball fan.It's the writing that binds plot, setting and character together like cement binds sand and pebbles into concrete. Like cement the language stands on its own. In a dozen places I reread paragraphs just for the feel of the words. As I seek out and read other works by Kinsella I know they won't, can't, measure up to Shoeless Joe. That's OK. Meddle and Wish You Were Here are pretty good albums. (got in another!)"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Shoeless Joe is by far Kinsella's best work as an author. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Inspiring the famous and popular movie \`Field of Dreams', Kinsella spins a magical adventure that permeates throughout the American spirit. Baseball becomes the enchanting weave of nostalgia that is carefully woven to express all that is good in life and can be again. Magnificent dialogue between wonderful characters bring this story to life and hits a home run right into the heart of Americana. There are more characters in the book than those that appear in the movie, and makes for wonderful mix personalities. You will love how Kinsella involves well known author J.D. Salinger in this story, and the light touch of humor surrounding difficult situations. This story is about believing and following your heart, and achieving your dreams. It is about all that is good in life and imploring you to take a look at it. It lifts the reader above the day to day problems that face us all, and carries you off into a world of imagination. Shoeless Joe the talented Left Fielder who had his career ended because of the Black Sox scandal leading to permanent ejection from the game by former baseball commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis is allowed to return at Ray Kinsella's newly crafted Iowa baseball field surrounded by a corn field. Ray had heard a voice that instructed him to build the field, and he followed it. The magical story unfolds from there, and grows to become a masterful blend of inspirational characters who join together to travel a journey of hope and faith in themselves and their dreams. A simply magnificent combination of past, present and future that only Kinsella could spin. This will certainly become a favorite of any baseball fan. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Shoeless Joe by W.P.

Although he's called crazy by the rest of the town, his daughter and wife stand beside him.

I was in high school at the time, deep into my obsession with baseball books (the Mets were having an off-year). I pounded through W.P. Kinsella's novel in days, then moved on to \\"The Iowa Baseball Confederacy\\", which freaked me out a little, and I never read Kinsella again.Flash forward 13 years. I chanced to see \\"Field of Dreams\\" on TV (the TBS \\"Dinner and a Movie\\" version) while marooned in a hotel during a business trip -- it was that, or watch Monica Lewinsky's \\"Mr. Personality\\". I hadn't seen the movie in a few years, and was struck by how passionate it was about the 1960s. The film's Kinsellas are hippie-era college protestors, and the script is drenched with '60s radical authors (the film's Terrence Mann) and a very lively debate about book burning.None of that's from the book.The novel's central idea is the same -- an Iowa farmer hears \\"a voice\\" (a PA announcer, not a dreamy whisper voiced by \\"Himself\\", as the film's credits have us believe), plows under his corn and builds a baseball diamond from the Earth. The diamond remains derelict until Shoeless Joe Jackson and the rest of the disgraced 1919 World Series-fixing Chicago Black Sox come to play ball. Add to the mix a small-town doctor whose major league career lasted 5 minutes, and a famously reclusive writer lured out of his shell by a love for the game.But then also add into that mix an identical twin who's a carnival barker for circus freaks, and a senile farmer whose life is built around the lie that he once played baseball for the Tinker-to-Evers-Chance era Chicago Cubs... here's the stuff not incorporated into the screenplay. Neither are Kinsella or his wife '60s revolutionaries; they're just dreamers in their 20s.It's Kinsella (the author)'s writing style that grates, more than anything else. Try as I might, I could never warm up to Kinsella (the character)'s penchant to think in dreamy Earth metaphors, or to speak in poetic paragraphs. His wife is described almost entirely by her bedroom habits. \\"Shoeless Joe\\" is as much about family as about baseball, but by the time the identical twin brother shows up (and there are still 50 pages to go), I found myself flipping ahead to hurry up and get to the point.\\"Field of Dreams\\" is an excellent movie, with a focused message and lively dialogue. \\"Shoeless Joe\\" I will call an acquired taste, because you'll need to make a mental adjustment to the writing style, which is more syrupy than \\"literary\\".One historical sidebar: Kinsella convinces J.D. Salinger to go to a Twins-Red Sox game at Fenway Park. He describes the game in convincing detail -- who played, who homered, who pitched for Boston (Mike Torrez, who after 1978 also became a mythological figure, whose ghost will one day populate a baseball movie filmed in the year 2050). And it's all fake! No game like this was ever played in 1979, the year Kinsella sets the novel. This has no signficance to anything but I was impressed by the effort. We never learn how that game ends -- Kinsella slams his head into a concrete beam, and spends the final innings in the infirmary. \\"Shoeless Joe\\" may be a spiritual fantasy, but I'm quite certain that this is the one scene in the book based on actual fact!"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I sincerely admire SHOELESS JOE by W.P. Kinsella. This novel was made into the famous film FIELD OF DREAMS, perhaps the greatest film about baseball (or was it about America?)ever made. I prefer SHOELESS JOE to FIELD OF DREAMS. I saw the film first, and when I read the book, I was impressed by the increased depth to SHOELESS JOE. The novel blends fantasy and reality in a story that is simple yet complex. It tells the tale of Ray Kinsella who plows down his crops because he hears a voice that tells him to. Shoeless Joe Jackson, his Black Sox teammates, Ray's father, and other athletes mystically arrive on this makeshift playing field. The reclusive (and we assume dreamer) J.D. Salinger also becomes involved in the plot. In SHOELESS JOE, W.P. Kinsella takes an inventive story line and uses it in support of the strongest of all possible themes. This novel is great. Order it--it will come."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"I've only owned it for a year and already I have read it four times. It should be shared with friends, read aloud on cold winter nights and when your lonely or sad, open the pages and swallow the context for what it is.

A small farmer struggles with the death of his father and the timelessness of a game."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"Don't get me wrong...I love Field of Dreams, but it doesn't compare to Shoeless Joe.

This notion was powerfully expressed throughout W. P. Kinsella's moving novel, Shoeless Joe. Driven by a mysterious voice that said, \\"If you build it, he will come\\", Ray Kinsella sets his ambitions on building a baseball diamond in his corn field in honor of his hero, Shoeless Joe Jackson. Ray Kinsella, a normal farmer from Iowa, ultimately achieved his dreams and ambitions with his baseball field, while seeing the mysterious Chicago Black Soxs play. Ray Kinsella, a baseball fanatic, wandered to New Hampshire to find the novelist, J.D. Salinger, the man the mysterious voice had instructed him to find. Salinger, a retired novelist, did not trust Kinsella, a strange farmer from Iowa who was going to take him to a Red Sox game. Kinsella had got orders from the mysterious voice to take Salinger to the game where they would get their next instructions. Throughout their travels, Salinger and Kinsella try to solve the riddles of the mysterious voice and go to Kinsella's baseball field. W. P. Kinsella induces a world of mystery and tensions between Ray Kinsella and J. D. Salinger as Salinger tells Kinsella, \\"I work alone. I have my own assignment to complete. I'm the only one who knows how to do it.\\" The mysteries of their assignments are not discussed openly between themselves. Although Kinsella and Salinger are secretive, their loyalty and commitment is most admirable. W. P. Kinsella's writing style is intriguing, expressive, and passionate. While a fictitious novel, it portrays a man's passion for the game, going to all extremes to attain his dreams. This novel deals with the problems one encounters when trying to attain a goal so lofty that only the most determined and lucky people can achieve. Although this book is about baseball, it is about dreams, magic, and life. The images portrayed of the ghostly \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson are riveting! A most interesting and captivating novel, Shoeless Joe provides hope to people's dreams that are most unreachable. A depiction of Ray Kinsella's baseball field will stay with you long after you have finished the last page of the novel. The magic of Kinsella's baseball field is exemplified in this passage: \\"The stars seem to float like flowers in a bowl only yards above our heads. I wonder how much of it is his own joy, and how much is for me. The White Sox taking batting practice, players throwing along the first-and third-base sides. Shoeless Joe in left field, and Eddie Cicotte warming up in the corner, his fastball whapping into the catcher's mitt, sending up a small explosion of dust each time it hits.\\" By Kyle Jell&eacute;y"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"If you're a dyed-in-the-wool baseball fan, you'll probably relate well to \\"Shoeless Joe\\". It's the tale better known as \\"Field of Dreams,\\" in which a wistful young farmer carves a baseball diamond into his financially strapped corn field in Iowa. The voice which tells him to do it also sends him to New England to fetch the reclusive JD Salinger, then up to northern Minnesota to connect with an aging doctor whose major league career amounted to just a single inning with the NY Giants. Anyway, it doesn't make much sense. But that's the beauty of it. Devotion to baseball--manic devotion to baseball--is irrational at best. Diehard baseball fans will have an easier time surrendering to Kinsella's version of reality than the casual fan. But regardless of your persuasion, you'll have to suspend belief for a few hundred pages in order to enjoy this quirky little book.I have to confess that I read \\"Shoeless Joe\\" twice, and the first time through was a lot more fun than the second. The writing is solid through and through. But the sappiness of the story grated on me the second time around, perhaps because I knew the outcome, or because I had aged 15 years. In any case, those who have seen the movie might enjoy reading this book. But I suspect that the greatest enjoyment comes to those who have yet to discover the story. And it probably wouldn't hurt if you had more than a passing interest in the game of baseball."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"If you like baseball, read this book. If you like history, read this book. If you dream, read this book. If you are human, read this book.Shoeless Joe is a novel about life's miracles and fulfilling dreams.

Along the way, the readers learn some esoteric baseball history that any fan of the game would find fun.A good novel."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"America's past time is baseball. This wonderful game has influenced millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. The novel, Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella, is a memorable story about America's pastime. This novel is inspired by the famous 1919 \\"Black Sox\\" scandal. The \\"Black Sox\\" scandal occurred when the 1919 American League champions the Chicago White Sox threw the series because they had made wagers on the game. America was shocked, and the entire team was banned from baseball for life. One of these eight was the \\"Black Sox\\" left fielder, Shoeless Joe Jackson. Ray Kinsella, the protagonist, thinks Shoeless Joe was innocent and hopes because he was his childhood hero can keep the innocence in baseball. Ray builds a baseball field because he his is told by his idol growing up, Shoeless Joe, \\"If you build it he will come\\". Another person who wishes to keep baseball innocent is Moonlight Graham; a former New York giant who became a doctor but played only one inning in the big leagues. He decides to play with the other \\"Black Sox\\" in the baseball field. Ray also thinks Moonlight Graham is innocent. Archie (Doc) Graham is called by Shoeless Joe to play baseball with the Black Sox. J.D. Salinger who published Catcher in the Rye a book that also heavily emphasizes innocence, is a character in Shoeless Joe. Salinger discusses the days growing up when he and his father used to watch baseball games at the Polo Grounds. . Salinger eventually leaves to another world to go play baseball at the Polo Grounds. The Polo Grounds are symbol for innocence for Salinger because he was a child then. \\"I don't have to tell you that the one constant thought through all the years has been baseball. America has been erased like a blackboard, only to be rebuilt and erased again. But baseball has marked time with America has rolled by like a procession of steamrollers. It is the same game the Moonlight Graham played in 1905. It is a living part of history, like calico dresses, stone crockery, and threshing crews eating at outdoor tables. It continually reminds us of what once was, like an Indian-head penny in a handful of new coins.\\" (pg. 213) Innocence is the main theme in this metaphorical novel.Shoeless Joe, a historical fiction novel, is written with many alternate meanings to baseball. This novel discusses that you lose your innocence when you grow up. It also shows what crazy things people will do to follow there dream; in this case to watch his child hood hero play his favorite game. No one or anything can destroy Ray's dream of watching the \\"Black Sox\\" play America's pastime not the people that think he is crazy not that he is on the verge of losing his farm. You do not have to be a baseball fan to enjoy Shoeless Joe because of its many alternate meanings. This riveting novel of following your dream is suitable for all ages but I think it will have more meaning to adults because they will know what it is like to lose their innocence as a result of growing up. This informative and moving novel I highly recommend reading Shoeless Joe."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"To be honest, Kinsella could have done much better with the wonderful story he had to work with. Some characters seem to have no purpose in this story(especially Eddie Scissons. Give credit to the movie Field of Dreams for leaving him out.)

Since the Kindle version is only $3, I decided to buy it, but it is nothing close to the movie.The baseball facts and romanticism remain in the novel, but the writing style is impossible to deal with. Was there an editor? Each page is riddled with unnecessary simile and metaphor as though this book was written for an English-speaking alien from Venus. Kinsella describes details of life that are really unnecessary. Over the first half of the book, these really pile up and the narrative fades away as a mere backdrop to whichever odd simile is next.Let's see some examples:\\"...muscles as taut as cowhide stretched over a baseball.\\"\\"...jealousy, green as a worm, wiggling deep in my center.\\"\\"It was as certain as a brand burned into my arm.\\"...and these are all within two pages of each other.Language like this is cute for a little while, but it is too frequent in this book and really detracts from the plot.

I have a book report due for this book tomorrow, and I'm only 3/4 way through the book. I have lost interest in it and have only made it as far as I have because we have to read it some days in engilsh class. Even then I have a hard time keeping my attention pointed to the novel.

As in poorly written, mostly boring, and largely kinda dumb.I don't know who the Field of Dreams screenwriter is, but Kinsella should be on his knees kissing the guy's (or girl's) feet every morning. He turned this largely unreadable mess of a novel into a moving, funny, classic movie.One example? In the movie, the revelation that the main character is REALLY building the field for his father doesn't come until right at the end, setting up an improbably emotional moment--even for most men who've seen the film. In the book, it's on about page 10. Shoeless Joe appearing is practically an aside--even though it's the dang title of the book!Don't waste your time reading this book...and definitely don't waste the money.

For WP Kinsella to write about something as trival as baseball (which i have loved from the moment i was born) baseball which in a society like ours should be the least important thing on a very long list, and for Kinsella to write about a baseball game in a cornfield and for it to stir such emotions even in the blackest hearts of some people is quite a feet.

Kinsella's mystical tale about redemption and one man's fulfilled dream. Ray Kinsella is the Iowa farmer who decides to build a baseball field for the long-deceased ballplayer after a strange voice speaks to him. After building the field among his crop of corn, the voices persist, and Ray soon finds himself on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, Ray forces himself into the life of the reclusive writer, J.D. Salinger, while Shoeless Joe and other members of the legendary 1919 Chicago White Sox, who were banned from organized baseball for throwing the World Series that year, play out their games on the field. Kinsella's story is a sweet tale unfolding like a slow-paced ball game on some country field of a simpler America. Perhaps no other story successfully captures the myth and legend of baseball as does \\"Shoeless Joe.\\" This book, of course, later spawned the hit movie, \\"Field of Dreams.\\" Those who have seen the movie will be able to note some of the changes.

The book contains several different characters, has a somewhat darker tone and has a sufficiently different plotline.On the other hand, the book, like the movie, is a lovely ode to the strength and character of the human spirit.

For half a century, from 1903 to 1953, baseball survived unscathed by modern day chaos; with the same 16 major league baseball teams playing in the same American cities. This stability along with the calming, pastoral effect of the game helps to answer readers' questions as to why baseball is so severely cherished. The book's strength is its lush description that gives the reader's imagination no limits; whether it be envisioning ghastly White Sox players in a perfect Iowa cornfield or running their fingers through a delicate patch of left field grass. The book's only weakness is that the plot sometimes get lost among the detailed travels of the main character. While chronicling a man's journey from building a baseball field in his corn crop to his realization of why he was selected to hear the voice that started it all, the book manages to bring its theme home. This is not just a book about an extraordinary person but rather the story of an ordinary person (perhaps like the reader) with a love for his family, a love of memories, a respect for the land, and a long regretted mistake. While the story revolves around baseball, it is simply a metaphor for the larger picture of a person's unrealized dreams, or unrealized life in general. The reader comes to understand that a love for ny sport or hobby, not just baseball, can give way to dreams and a stable calmness, even a oneness. In the second to last chapter when he gathers enough courage to talk to a catcher on the team we realize why Ray, the main character, was selected to build the field. At the same time readers must face their own journey.

Ray Kinsella hears a voice that tells him, \\"If you build it, they will come.\\" As he builds the baseball field, Shoeless Joe Jackson and other members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox begin appearing to play baseball on the field. The voice also sends him on a cross-country trip to collect J.D. Salinger and \\"Moonlight\\" Graham. The trip also serves as a cross-categorical trip through baseball history. As the baseball aspect of the story develops, the Kinsella farm falls into greater financial jeopardy.Some of the conflicts I perceive include the presence of J.D. Salinger. While he is one of my favorite writers, why in the world was he incorporated as one of the main characters in this book. Additionally, the author gives the impression that Shoeless Joe was the leader of the 1919 White Sox. Shoeless is actually know to have been both quite shy and illiterate. I suppose creative license allows these traits to change in a work of fiction. However, I saw it at as being too great of a divergence from reality.Baseball fans will love the sense of history in this book.

It was a good movie, but they cut a lot of the book out and the film (obviously) loses the writer's wonderfully descriptive and gentle style.'Shoeless Joe' is, simply, an incredible book."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"The book Shoeless Joe, by W.P. Kinsella is in my opinion a literary masterpiece of fiction. The book is about a man named Ray Kinsella who is a farmer in Iowa. He has a wife named Annie and a daughter named Karin. The book takes place in Iowa, in the 1980s. When Ray is in his cornfield one day he hears the voice. It says to him &quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot; Ray does not know what to think when he hears this. Then he sees an image of a baseball field. Ray decides to plow under his corn to build this baseball field so that old-time baseball players including the great shoeless Joe Jackson will come and play on the baseball field. In his search for the real meaning of building the baseball field, Ray hears two more messages. &quot;Ease his pain&quot;, and &quot; Go the distance.&quot; In the end of the book, Ray finds the meaning of the messages and building the baseball field. To see his father again and to heal the wounds they had in their relationship. They do this by playing catch. I thought that part of the book was extremely meaningful because it's a boy having a catch with his father that they never got a chance to do. After Ray plows under his farm and builds his baseball field he goes broke because he does not have enough crops to sell. At the end of the book his daughter Karin tells him that people will come to see the baseball field because they will get bored in Iowa and will need something to do so they will buy a ticket to see a game. This way Ray will have enough money to keep the farm. I think that all the characters in Shoeless Joe learned that dreams can come true if you really believe. People can learn from this book that you must have hope for some things and you have to believe. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves baseball, and that has a great imagination. I think that W.P Kinsella's purpose of writing Shoeless Joe was to not only entertain the reader but also to tell the reader that dreams really can come true."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"This is not a baseball book. It's an amazing piece of literature about a man trying to reconnect with his father. This is the book that Field of Dreams, the film starring Kevin Costner, was based on. The story is essentially the same. There are a few interesting characters in the novel who are left out of the film. The writer Terrence Mann, played by James Earl Jones, is instead J. D. Salinger. I do not know why the film changed the author to a fictional one, but they did.Unlike so many of the reviewers below, I loved the similes. They were delightful. They made me smile. This story was just so danged pleasant and charming. It was like a warm summer's day, sweet tea in hand, out in the midwest. Yikes. See that, even I'm writing in similes.Absolutely fantastic though. Very compelling. I typically like edgier things. I typically like things that are aggressive and challenging. This isn't like the other books I love but I enjoyed it just the same.If you liked Field of Dreams, reading this will be a more or less positive experience. If you hate baseball, this has considerably less baseball in it than you'd expect. Baseball, by the way, has got to be the most offensive thing about this book."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"First of all, let me say that Field of Dreams was one of my favorite movies as a child, and it cemented my love for baseball. I'd probably watched the movie a dozen times before reading this book, and I was immediately taken aback by how much more descriptive, interesting, and DEEP the book is over the movie. I agree with the previous reviewer that stated that you have to be a little older to understand this book. I think that most high schoolers living with parents that are still working and in their primes would never be able to grasp the desire that Ray has to just have a normal adult conversation with his long-deceased father. But as I've moved into my 30's and my parents have started to age, I can totally understand the passion that Kinsella was able to put down on paper. Also, the movie completely glossed over the twin aspect of the book, which I believe was pure genius. What Kinsella is explaining is an alternate duality of man. Ray has a serious, \\"grown-up\\" side that has moved on from childishness like baseball games, magic, etc..., yet he still has the other side that wants to believe. Richard doesn't truly \\"see\\" the field and the players until he is allowed to let go, just like Ray is not able to truly converse with his father in an adult manner until he is allowed to give up his childishness and move on to adulthood. It's pure literary genius! I think many of us have experienced that as we've grown up. Think about it, how friggin' hard is it to talk to your aging parents about wills, medical expenses, giving up driving, etc... Kinsella has managed to convey the frustrations of \\"tweeners\\" in a way that was truly ahead of its time. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I totally \\"got\\" this book. I understood what he was trying to say about wanting to hold on to your teenage years, while at the same time knowing that life isn't going to wait for you to grow up!"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"The movie Field of Dreams has been my favorite movie of all time for about 15 years now. And it now tops a list of about 380 films that I have compiled. I am from Iowa, and for a period during the 1990's I attended about 2 Atlanta Braves games per year. I have since become a bigger Nascar fan and don't attend Braves games in person anymore, but I still follow the Braves in the newspaper.I just now bought the book \\"Shoeless Joe\\" and love it. The movie has magic and the book has even more magic. Some plot points are the same between the movie and the book, and of course the book goes into more detail and has additional story threads (Kid Scissons, etc.). I attended the Field of Dreams Movie site near Dyersville, Ia for the first time in late July 2010. It is in pristine condition. The corn is high, the grass is green and mowed, the bases are white and puffy and the dirt is brown and soft. If re-takes of the movie needed to be filmed today, they could. It is preserved that well.I may never have a moment of pure joy and magic than when I sat on the bleacher near left field at about 6pm the day I visited the field. I had my book with me and at the time I was about half way through. I jumped ahead to when Ray and J.D. pick up Archie Graham hitchhiking on their way back to Iowa and then their final approach to the property. It was perfect. Quiet, sunny, breezy, and the sights, sounds, and memories profound. I plan to return early and often and stay much longer.As far as the book goes, I cannot be a passionless reviewer. I love the movie, and the book has provided more detail and variations on what was presented in the movie. It's been truly a delight. I'm about finished with the book and I am stalling so it will not be over. I may just start reading the book from the beginning again.I remember reading somewhere that this book wasn't that good. Not very well written and presents a more dreary Ray Kinsella as far as his journey East to pick up the author (J.D. Salinger). They couldn't be more wrong. I'm guessing they just didn't \\"get it\\".If you are a fan of the movie, or a fan of baseball, or just like a good story, I'd highly recommend this to you."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Georgetown, Colorado","review":"\\"Shoeless Joe\\" is a sports story unlike any other. Rather than focusing on baseball it focuses on a character (who's name is strangely similar to the narrator's. Coincidence?) chasing after his dreams, which began in his cornfield when he heard a voice whispering that line everyone is now familiar with, \\"If you build it he will come.\\" These dreams he has throughout the book are kind of bizarre, and there were times when it seemed like the safe thing to do was to give up chasing his dreams and go back home to his family and his farm, which is now struggling because of the baseball field he built in it (that was what the first dream was telling him to do). Instead he continues pursuing these dreams because he believes in them and he knows that the clues in his dreams will lead to the answers he seeks.The narration is very poetic and free-flowing, filled with similes that really add perception to the story and its characters. It's a very fun, unpredictable, and uplifting novel. There's a popular movie based on this book called \\"Field of Dreams,\\" which is a decent film, but it's not as engaging and not as strong symbolically as the book.Overall, this is a great book that anyone can enjoy. It's very well written and it's a very unique story. You really don't need to be a baseball fan, or any kind of sports fan for that matter, to enjoy it. I know that sounds cliched, but it's very true for \\"Shoeless Joe,\\" because baseball isn't the core of this story. It's about a man pursuing his dreams and bringing them to reality, which is an important lesson for all us to understand. Also, if you've seen the movie, then you definitely need to read this book regardless of your opinion of the movie."},{"Title":"Vintage Aircraft Over America","review":"This is a great book. Not just your average coffee table picture book, this book selects 37 of the most popular vintage aircraft and gives a complete write up and history of each individual aircraft. Unlike other books of its type that select only the authors favorite models. Before I realized it I had read this book from cover to cover. One of the nicest aspects of this book is that not only does it have great narratives for each aircraft but it also has well over 100 pictures of some of the most beautifully restored aircraft in the country. Making this book also a great coffee table picture book for those without time to read but who just want to look at the pictures.

A lot of the heavy lifting has been done for you in two modules - GD and ImageMagick. The chapters on those expose you to simple subroutines that you'd expect in any graphics package.But Wallace extends the scope to the usage of Postscript and PDF modules. Some Perl developers recognised the need to output in these formats, for compatibility with much professional documentation. So here too, you can take advantage of a lot of prior sweat.For completeness, the book also has a section on supported vector graphics and animation. Specifically how to use SVG and Flash in Perl. This is perhaps a more specialised need than the previous modules. But good to have here, for some of you.It should be noted that the book is not really about teaching graphics programming, per se. Wallace assumes you're already up on this. Rather, the book is about the modules and subroutines that give you the elementary graphics implementation vocabulary."},{"Title":"Perl Graphics Programming: Creating SVG, SWF (Flash), JPEG and PNG files with Perl","review":"I have decided, this is the last book on software tools I'll ever buy.

Amy George's account of life in the Soviet Union during Stalin, and of living with her mother hand to mouth as a &quot;war slave&quot; under Hitler was extremely eye-opening. Her account of life in an extremely hostile environment reminds all of us fat, lazy and overly comfortable American Christians just how complacent we've become in taking our political and religious liberties (not to mention our enormous riches) for granted. Amy's account of her gradual introduction to God in the midst of her suffering, and of her eventual conversion to Christianity is most uplifting and inspiring. I thank Amy for writing this most touching and memorable autobiography. Read the book. You'll be most glad that you did."},{"Title":"Goodbye Is Not Forever","review":"Finally, a WWII memoir on par with Ten Boom's immortal classic.

She was born in the Ukraine. I have heard her testimony and it is touching indeed. Her gentle manner comes through in her writing and her speech and her demeanor.When Goodbye Is Not Forever was first published, I bought one and later bought multiple copies to give to friends with whom I taught school. Even now--some 12 or 13 years after it was published, I still am giving away copies to friends.The most awesome example in the whole book for me related the story of Amy's father who had survived labor camps in Siberia. They were reunited some 40 years later. I will not totally give away the results of that meeting, but I will say that I cried, and I thanked God for His faithfulness and mercy to us.I read this book several years after my husband and I lost our 12 year old son in an accident.

The father befriends a black man and has a showdown with the local KKK. Busch captures the boy's despair and father's anger excellently. He has a unique writing style in the way he relates the story. The very ending is unsatisfactory because Busch is just too cryptic in telling what happens, but all in all the novel can be highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sometimes I Live in the Country (Plume)","review":"Yet another Fred Busch novel under my belt. And SOMETIMES I LIVE IN THE COUNTRY may quickly become a favorite book, one of those I beat people over the head with until they agree to read it. No, not really; honest.What sets this book apart from many of Busch's other books is its 13 year-old protagonist. Petey is a very troubled kid, still reeling from his parents' bitter divorce and his sudden move from his Brooklyn home to Upstate, the land of the \\"cornheads,\\" as he refers to the locals. Harboring secret suicidal thoughts and 'practicing' for that final exit, Petey is torn, because he loves his ex-police officer dad deeply and doesn't want to leave him alone. Plagued with all the usual hormonal problems of the average eighth-grader, Petey misses his mom and has trouble fitting in, mostly because he's sensitive and just a hell of a lot smarter than most of his cornhead classmates, who rank armpit farts and deer hunting as cultural activities. He finds solace in the office of the school guidance counselor, Miz (Lizzie) Bean (yes, the same one who played a major role in Busch's earlier novel, ROUNDS). Petey's dad, referred to only as \\"Pop\\" throughout the narrative, also notices Miz Bean and things begin to get better for Petey.Equal parts Holden Caulfield and Scout (yeah, I know Scout was a girl, but the comparison actually works, especially since Petey admires and loves Pop as much as Scout did Atticus), Petey grows up a lot. Perhaps one of the most surprising elements of the story comes in a small cell of local cornhead KKK, which adds a sinister overtone and some pretty ugly characters to the mix. And the final 20-30 pages are as riveting as any you will find in modern fiction.What didn't I like about this Busch book? Nothing, except maybe the fact that it was the last one in my library. Fortunately there are still probably a dozen I haven't yet read. Time to start looking for those books. And hey, if you love good writing and you haven't read Fred Busch, time for YOU to start looking too. You won't be sorry; I promise.- Tim Bazzett, lover of Fred Busch books and author of the memoir BOOKLOVER"},{"Title":"Harrison Birtwistle: Man, Mind, Music","review":"This book by Jonathan Cross is of tremendous value for anyone interested in the music of the British composer Harrison Birtwistle. Finished in 1999, and published in 2000, it remains one of the main sources. Cross, who was a Lecturer of Music at the University of Bristol at the time of publication, and is now Professor of Musicology at Oxford University, is obviously immersed in Birtwistle's music.The book is organized into eight chapters. The first, called \\"Origins, Contexts, Models,\\" is mainly an extensive discussion of Birtwistle's influences, including the painters Cezanne, Picasso and Klee, and the composers of the Second Vienna School, Varese, and above all Stravinsky. Six chapters cover 1) Theatres, 2) Myth and Ritual, 3) Pastoral, 4) Verses and Refrains, 5) Pulse, and 6) Line, Melody, Tonality. This is the bulk of the book, and consists of close readings by Cross, illustrating the structural and symbolic character of the music with many examples. I found the bulk of it to be quite fascinating and readable, though I did wear out toward the end under the onslaught of example after example. I was most intrigued by Cross's extended discussion of \\"The Second Mrs. Kong,\\" one of Birtwistle's operas that has yet to be recorded. The concluding chapter focuses mainly on \\"The Last Supper,\\" which as of 1999 was Birtwistle's latest and forthcoming opera.Cross nicely summarizes the nature of \\"Birtwistle's Modernism\\":\\"...Birtwistle's art is firmly rooted in early European modernism. The primitivism of his music, its formality, its concern with ritualized, anti-narrative structures and with myth, its interest in rhythm and in constructing new kinds of temporality, are all indicators of his engagement of that modernist tradition\\" (14).I have come to consider Harrison Birtwistle to be one of the best late 20th Century composers. It took me some time to appreciate his music, partly because so much of it is vocal and operatic, and it took me an extended period to overcome my folk/rock bias in vocal music. Now I have heardPunch and Judy,The Mask of Orpheus,The Minotaur, andThe Fields of Sorrow, among other vocal and operatic works, and can properly value Birtwistle as a result.Since this book, Cross has written an entire book onThe Mask of Orpheus.He has also writtenan excellent book on Stravinsky."},{"Title":"Mother Love","review":"This is a terrific story about a woman who after the death of her husband, takes charge of her life, reconnects with her children, and joins with the peace corps.

And even if you can't master the basic rudiments of joinery, because, like me, you have clumsy hands and the artistic ability of a one-eyed fruit fly, you can at least get an idea about how to use the basic hand and electric tools used in cabinetmaking. True, you most likely won't be building a boat, but Mr. Bingham has simple projects in his book that even a simpleton like me can manage, plus if you have a lot of wood on your boat, or you are one of those who is forever changing and improving your floating home, than this is a handy book to have on board."},{"Title":"Boat Joinery & Cabinetmaking Simplified","review":"This is actually a quite useful book.

As a psychiatrist, Dalrymple practiced in a prison and at a hospital in Birmingham, England. Nearly all his patients are from what can be fairly considered the \\"lower class\\" in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries.These are the people who have been destroyed by the well-intentioned, but intellectually empty theories of the socialists and social reformers who believed they were delivering people from want, but in fact created a true dystopia. By making sure everyone could have a roof over their heads, food on their tables and changes in their jeans without lifting a finger, but by taking from the fewer and fewer productive people in English society, an underclass was created. With no reason to exert themselves and a popular culture that literally urges an endless regime of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll (or its equivalent), Dalyrmple has witnessed the destruction of English character.Rampant alcoholism and drug use; increasing illegitimacy; children raised without any form of parental supervision or guidance; the destruction of traditional mores and respect for law and more; a refusal to see the dangers of failing to insist upon the assimilation of foreign, even hostile, immigrants and more are contributing to the deterioration of English society. By implication, Dalyrmple makes it plain that this same kind of social destruction will soon infect and ultimately destroy all the Western nations.Dalyrmple offers no nostrums, no cures or panaceas. He is a reporter, not a reformer.Some of the twenty-six essays here are puzzling as they wander a bit too deeply into Shakespeare and the application of his words to modern times. But other of Dalrymple's essays are simply searing indictments of the foolishness of intellectuals, socialists and those who are blind to their own ignorance.Dalrymple's critiques of D. H. Lawrence, Virgina Woolf, Kinsey and other empty-headed intellectuals should be required reading. Virgina Woolf, for instance, saw no evil in the Nazis and urged people to do nothing to fight them, an attitude mirrored in today's England in those who see no evil in terrorist bombers who destroy innocent people.Most people have never heard of Stefan Zweig, one of the most famous writers in pre-war Germany. Dalyrmple uses his 1942 suicide to brilliantly illuminate the death of what was once considered culture.His commentary on an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art called \\"Sensation.\\" Sensation was considered by many to be simply a display of bad taste. But \\"intellectuals\\" considered it a demonstration of free expression and artistic license. Here Dalyrmple contrasts the lionization of a female killer of children with the poignant pleas of the mother to remove a disgusting \\"artwork\\" of the murderess from exhibition. The smug words of the director of the Royal Academy once again drive home Dalyrmple's message: the intellectuals are stupid. He illustrates this with a single utterly fatuous quote from the director: \\"All art is moral. Anything that is immoral is not art.\\"Dalrymple examines the phenomena of Princess Diana, noting that at the time she was being killed in a Paris car accident, the presses of the liberal Observer newspaper were rolling with a story stating that if Diana's IQ were five points lower, she would have to be watered daily. Within days, of course, the same Observer and other liberal organs were falling over themselves in praising Diana as the \\"people's princess\\" and other adulations. Dalrymple's musings of the exchange of depth for shallowness not only in British media, but in British society are fascinating and all the more disturbing because they are clearly true.Two of the most stiking essays deal with what happens when Islam breaks down, a perceptive observation of what happens when Islam encounters both the West and modernity, and a forecast of the recent riots in Paris.Overall, Dalrymple is not happy reading. As noted, he offers no nostrums, no cures; frankly no hope. He is an acutely sensitive observer to what is wrong with the times and how it came to be. Perhaps, suitably depressed after reading Dalrymple, the ordinary citizen will do what he or she can to rip the blinders off people who are comfortably listening to the know-nothing intellectuals who would rather see the world destroyed than admit to their blindness.Jerry"},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Theodore Dalrymple is widely traveled with an incredible exposure to other cultures. One of his essays concerns the problems of Africa and is the best thing I have read on that sad state of affairs.I am also a physician and have a good acquaintance with city hospitals in America. Things have not got so bad here but some of the trends are not good. My British friends do not believe that it is as bad there as Dalrymple describes but one, a famous surgeon in London, has expressed alarm at the number of young women medical students who are converting to Islam. These are not the children of immigants. What an educated women would see in Islam is a mystery to both of us.This book of essays has already predicted the subsequent riots in France. His picture of the inner cities of England is worrisome. These children who are living such self-destructive lives are not the great grandchildren of slaves. They are the products of progressive education and the welfare state. Some of the same pathology he sees can be found in \\"blue state\\" cities in the US where wealthy progressives live in guarded enclaves while violent slums occupy most of the rest of the city.Other reviewers have complained that Dalrymple does not offer solutions. We in America have an advantage here. We are still the most religious society in Christendom. Traditional values hold sway in \\"red states.\\" We have an active conservative movement demanding school vouchers for poor children trapped in hellish schools. Some trends here are reversing the pendulum from license back to sanity. Rudy Giuliani used the \\"broken window\\" theory of civic governance, mentioned by Dalrymple in one essay, to get control of New York City. Home schooling and vouchers offer an alternative to progressive education.His book is a warning to us. This is what can happen if the social customs of millenia are discarded. It may be too late for England, a tragedy, but it is not to late for us to see the future and avoid it."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"It is difficult to write a review of this book without appearing ridiculously gushing. It contains some of the most profound literary, cultural and political comment that exists, and is rooted in extensive experience as a prison doctor in the UK and elsewhere which most left liberal pundits would avoid like the plague. Extreme independence of mind, sharp observation and deep humanity all combine to produce a truly indispensable book.Addendum: Mr Bourne in his review grabs the wrong end of many sticks. Perhaps he should play fewer computer games (see his other reviews) and get out more often. He claims that \\"penury and depredation\\" existed before the welfare state: so what?Contrary to what Bourne says, Dalrymple does not blame modern art for the failure of civilization. However, he does link the nihilism of Brit Art with the dominant cultural ethos of modern Britain, which is hardly controversial, an ethos which is apparent throughout popular culture, all the universities and even the dumbed down BBC. Dalrymple understands, on the basis of his experience of the world, and his profound knowledge of the cultural and scientific heritage of the West, now routinely denigrated in...the West, that culture is all important. Once that's gone, we are lost.Dalrymple is criticised for relying on \\"personal experience\\" with little data. This criticism is often made of Dalrymple by people who have no or little experience of anything, and therefore do not value experience. It is also made by people who seem to think that only pseudo-scientific sociologists wearing white coats and armed with meaningless charts and graphs, can offer an \\"objective\\" view of society. This is a deeply philosophically illiterate view. Presumably they think that Sebastian Haffner's memoir of the early years of Nazism, in which he described the mass yobbishness and dumbed down idiocy engulfing large sections of German society, is \\"scientifically\\" worthless because not backed up by \\"data\\" but is only based on \\"personal experience\\". Indeed, how did Shakespeare manage without \\"data\\"? Well, maybe he was just very intelligent...Further addendum: Wudhi states that \\"a strain of sexual disgust or at least extreme discomfort\\" is to be found in Dalrymple's writings. In \\"Sex and the Shakespeare Reader\\" it is clear that Dalrymple doesn't object to human sexuality per se. It is, rather the \\"All sex, all the time\\" attitude that he rightly finds disturbing. One need only see very young girls being sexualised, in their dress and attitudes, to agree -- provided one actually cares for their welfare. The phenomenon of premature sexualisation is the result of the kind of psychobabble that Wadhu clearly finds very profound, the view that one must \\"express oneself\\" no matter what. As a widely accepted theory of the good life, this leads to a race to the bottom, to the violence and pre-mature sexual activity that is an all-prevasive feature of life in large section of British society. If Wadhu doesn't find this disturbing he is either innocent of the ways of the world, or just stupid. Or possibly both."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"As soon as I finished reading the preface, I knew I was hooked on this book and its controversial author.British physician/writer, Dr. Theodore Dalrymple is an unapolegetic critic of our post-modern times, offering insight and accusation to the guilt ridden political Left and its allies in the Arts and Academia for their trashing the ethics of restraint and responsibility.Dalrymple has worked many the manmade hells of Africa and Asia, many of the people he encountered in the most destitute of these places still struggled to maintain some sense of stability and order in their homes. They refused, in spite of war and disease and oppression, to surrender their human dignity. Ironically, back in the technological and constitutional UK, Dalrymple finds the opposite.What was once the land of civility and propriety, England has increasingly become a nihilistic mess of criminal perversity and selfish hedonism. People of the West are abandoning family bonds, forsaking traditional roles and modes of identity. Sadly it's those most in need of familial love and duty, those at the social and economic bottom of society, who are being encouraged down this path by a welfare state no longer so much a neccessary safety net but moreso a useless security blanket.Working the hospitals and clinics for those on the lowest rungs of the working class, Dalrymple encounters the daily freaks and victims of our self-destructive society. Men without an inkling of self worth, drug addicted, surviving as criminal parasites on chocolate bars, fathering child after child literally without a thought of concern. Women suffering the abuse of these men, allowing them into their homes. Children physically and sexually abused, then tossed out onto the streets as soon as possible. Even the ultra-conservative British Muslim community is collapsing. The grandchildren of immigrants remain in a cultural limbo between the secular West and the Muslim East, seething with spite and rage for a society which not only tolerates but often encourages them in its self-hating dreamquest for \\"diversity.\\"In addition to writing a column for the London Spectator for the last thirteen years, Dalrymple has also contributed many essays for the City Journal (published by the Manhattan Institute). OUR CULTURE, WHAT'S LEFT OF IT... is a collection of 26 of these essays from the years 1996-2004 (including \\"When Islam Beaks Down\\" named by David Brooks of the New York Times as the best journal essay of 2004) and is divided into two themed sections: Art and Letters, Society and Politics.Dalrymple peoples this book with almost every facet from the fringe: combat photographers, mass murderers, addicts, fashionistas, iconoclast-chic intellectuals and artists, communists, gangsters, [...], even criminals who use the British penal system as a poor man's health spa and retreat. He writes on and references some of the giants of politics, art and literature and society: Shakespeare as psychological as well as literary genius, Orwell's and Huxley's dystopian prophecies, Castro and his desecration of Cuba, the nitwitted neurotic Virginia Woolf, an emotionally stunted D.H. Lawrence, Turgenev vs. Marx, the media's creation and perpetuation of the cult of Princess Diana whom Dalrymple has the rare courage to rightly call out as one of the most overrated pop cultural personalities.The only drawback to OUR CULTURE, WHAT'S LEFT OF IT... is that there is plenty of criticism yet not a hint of an idea of resolution. Dalrymple suggests nothing, unfortunately hopes for nothing. On talk radio's The Dennis Prager Show, where I heard him being interviewed, he mentioned his giving up on England. He feels the situation there is hopeless. However, in my opinion, all is not hopeless. Otherwise, this book is a must read for anyone who is concerned for the well being and future of our civilization, whether Left or Right."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Theodore Dalrymple is a top-notch English commentator and a gifted essayist. The articles featured here represent some of his best and most recent writings. The volume is divided into two major sections: arts and letters, and society and politics.He introduces this collection of essays with this line: \\"The fragility of civilization is one of the great lessons of the twentieth century.\\" The line between civilization and barbarism is very thin, and needs to be zealously protected. Yet many of our intellectuals, argues Dalrymple, are either ignorant of the dividing line, or are doing their best to abolish that line altogether.Generally these intellectual and political elites are of the left. But the right is not immune from such characters. \\"There has been an unholy alliance between those on the left, who believe that man is endowed with rights but no duties,\\" he argues,and \\"libertarians on the right, who believe that consumer choice is the answer to all social questions.\\"While civilisation must have its critics, it must also have its defenders and preservers as well. Dalrymple takes on the many critics of civilization, especially those of the utopian variety, who believe that an untried ideal is always better than a flawed but tried reality.The cultural despisers and civilization corrupters are many within the field of literature and the arts. From Virginia Woolf to Versace, Dalrymple examines a number of leading figures who have left a legacy of destruction and despair. Much of what passes for art, fashion or literature today is simply an exercise in bashing the West and the championing of hedonism, nihilism and barbarism.His chapters on society and politics are especially of interest. He covers topics as diverse as the problems of Islam, the sexualisation of society, the death of childhood and mass murderers. Most of these chapters are minor classics in their own right. His chapter on the folly of legalising drugs is a small masterpiece of social commentary, logical thought and fluid prose.Part of the reason for Dalrymple's accurate and acute observations of the decrepit condition of much of modern life is the fact that he also a doctor. He has worked for many years in hospitals, prisons, and other social hot spots. He has witnessed first hand the tragic results of our social engineers and their distorted vision of reality. Both in the UK and overseas, he has encountered first hand the bitter fruit of dying civilizations.His incisive and clearly penned assessments of the decline of Western culture are a much-needed antidote to the utopianism and elitism of so many of our social spin doctors. His writings are as important and prophetic as they are skilfully crafted."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Theodore Dalrympe has spent much of his working life as a prison doctor,seeing the very worst of human nature, and this collection of essays discusses various aspects of British society, and society in other countries. The conclusions that he reaches are mostly depressing, he sees British people as hoplelessly debased and vicious, coarsened by the permissive society, ignorant and un-educated, with neither manners nor morals.Some of the essays in this collection are quite fascinating, there are two enthralling essays on Shakespeare which clearly show his 'relevence' to the times we live in, and a savage critique of Virginia Woolf. 'The Distopian Imagination' which discusses 'Brave New World' and '1984' is fascinating, and contains one of the most touching passages in the book. Visiting North Korea, Dr Dalrymple is surreptitiously approached by a young Korean:An electric moment: for in North Korea, unsupervised contact between a Korean and a foreigner is utterly unthinkable, as unthinkable as shouting \\"Down with Big Brother!\\"\\"Do you speak English?\\" he asked me. \\"Yes\\" I replied.\\"I am a student at the Foreign Languages Institute. Reading Dickens and Shakespeare is the greatest, the only pleasure of my life.\\"It was the most searing communication I have ever received in my life. For him, Dickens and Shakespeare (which the regime permitted him to read with quite other ends in view) guaranteed the possibility not just of freedom but of truly human life itself.Inevitably, there is an essay on the death of Princess Diana, the public hysteria following her death is invariably pointed out as a sign of the deterioration of the British character. However, the mourning at the death of Diana pales into complete insignificance when compared to the outbreak of public grief and hysteria on the death of Princess Charlotte, daughter of the Prince Regent (later King George IV), in 1817. Compared to the lavish displays of public grief and mourning on that occasion, the mourning for Diana is quite a minor incident. Mourning over the death of popular public characters is not a twentieth-century invention.One of the most ineresting essays in the book deals with the legalisation of drugs, something Dr Dalrymple is implacably opposed to. Previously agnositc on the subject, I have to say that his arguments convinced me entirely that drugs should remain illegal. That people will continue to take drugs even when they are illegal is not an argument for legalising them, any more than it is as he points out, a reason for legalising any other kind of criminal behaviour:\\"If the war against drugs is lost, then so are the wars against theft, speeding, incest, fraud, rape, murder, arson and illegal parking. Few, if any, such wars are winnable. so let us all do anything we choose.\\"'The Uses of Corruption' contrast Italian society with British, and comes out firmly favourable on the side of the Italians. The reason why Italian society is flourishing while British society is collapsing, is, Dr Dalrymple concludes, because of the corrupt nature of Italian beuraucracy. Because the Italians know that their beuaracracy is corrupt, they do not rely on it to help them, and so remain self-sufficient and enterprsing, whereas the British, beleiveing their beauracracy to be benign, depend on it passively for everything.All of the essays in this collection are interesting, and most of them gave me a different perspective on whatever subject they discussed. However, I have no first-hand experience of the worst of human nature, having lived all my life in mostly pleasant suburban areas rather than amid the bleak squalor of the inner cities, I have not seen as Dr Dalrymple has, the very worst that human beings are capable of. Most of the people I know, including the much-demonised single mothers, are decent people leading decent lives, and trying to raise their children to be decent people too. I retain a hope that society is not quite as squalid and irredeemably vile as Dr Dalrymple believes.The best line in the book is in the essay 'How-and How Not- to Love Manking' which is this:\\"The victory over cruelty is never final, but, like the maintenance of freedom, requires eternal vigilance.\\"Reading this book induces depression, but also sharpens your vigilance."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Let's face it: most essay collections suck. Especially those loved by the New York Times.Dalrymple's \\"Our Culture, What's Left of It\\" is the exception. Dalyrmple worked as a British physician in prisons and hospitals in the poorest parts of England. He knows the underclass well, and has not one politically correct word to say about their problems.A perfect example would be the 25 year old man Dalyrmple treated for swallowing packets of cocaine. This man had just abandoned his latest girlfriend, who had recently given birth to his chilld. This was only the man's most recent child. He had produced a grand total of five, none of whom he saw or took care of financially. \\"I know. Don't tell me\\" (p 12) was his response to Dalyrmple's disapproval.\\"The words were a complete confession of guilt.\\" (P 12) Dalyrmple says he's treated hundreds of \\"men who have abandonded their children in this fashion, and they all know perfectly well what the consequences are for the women, and, more important, for the children\\" (P 12).Yet somehow the establishment doesn't seem to make the connection. Dalyrmple knows he's the sole voice of sanity in a society gone mad. As recently as fifty years ago the country had little crime and one of the best educational systems in the world. Today, the elderly fear leaving their home after dark. Marriage is fast disappearing. And the school system is so awful a vast chunk of the population can't read--in Shakespeare's green land.You need to buy this book for the essay on Virginia Woolf alone. He nails her perfectly with his comment that, \\"No interpretation of events, trends,, or feelings is too silly...if it helps to fan her resentment\\" (p 69). No kidding. The woman whined more than any human being in history. And then there's this: \\"Her lack of recognition that anything had ever been achieved or created before her advent that was worthy of protection and preservation is all but absolute, along with her egotism\\" (P 70). Students trapped in feminist courses all over the world must be weeping at hearing the truth for once.Go buy this book."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This book of essays is crucial, brilliant, relevant, and thought-provoking. The author is a British medical doctor who has been everywhere and seen the worst that humanity has to offer in his travels and work in prisons and slum hospitals. He does not mince his words, which are cutting and merciless but highly intelligent and perceptive.The book is divided into two broad sections; Arts & Letters, and Society & Politics. While some pieces serve as insightful analyses on such topics as Shakespeare, Stefan Zweig, Havana's decay and the 'cit&eacute;s' in Paris, a broad theme undergirds the totality of the essays: the recognition that civilization is slipping away, including all the cultural and ethical standards that go with it.Dalrymple attacks both the increasingly amoral society in which he lives, and the deconstructionist post-modern intellectuals who not only stand non-judgmentally in the face of evil, but seem to bask in it, exploiting all that is depraved and destructive. He writes what he feels, and calls it as he sees it, unafraid of being assaulted like some of the people he describes.Parts of this book are really upsetting and at times, emotionally difficult to read, but that is exactly what Dalrymple wants to elicit in his audience. If we find the rape, abuse, neglect and murder of children abhorent, perhaps there is hope for us after all."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This book is a collection of 26 essays published by Dr Dalrymple since 1996. While the essays cover a range of different topics, the unifying theme is culture or, more broadly, civilization.One of my favourite essays, \`When Islam breaks down', was named by David Brooks of the New York Times as the best journal article of 2004, and is still well worth reading 4 years later.Some of my other favourites include:What's wrong with Twinkling Buttocks?;Why Havana Had to Die;The Goddess of Domestic Tribulations;The Starving Criminal; andThe Man Who Predicted the Race Riots.These essays are easy to read because they are so well written. Whether the reader agrees with the views expressed, the issues raised and points made are all worth careful consideration. I read this book slowly: one essay every couple of days. While the quality of the writing would have enabled me to read the essays more quickly, my own thought processes could not have integrated the information fast enough to have done justice to the messages they contained.The essays may have a predominantly British grounding and focus but the underlying points and associated learning apply far more broadly. The issues raised by Dr Dalrymple should, in many cases, feature in public policy debates around the world.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Every year, statistics show how the gap between rich and poor is widening, with the attendant bromide that more wealth should be redistributed. Theodore Dalrymple is not indifferent to the economic underpinnings of our cultural divide, but he concentrates on the cultural gap dividing people, many of whom come from the same economic class or ethnic group.This book shares the premise of his previous on the underclass, namely that the hedonism of the cultural elite has trickled down to the underclass with horrific consequences. These consequences are illustrated not with statistics so much as personal anecdotes or famous headlines in the British newspapers (famous at least in Britain, since I hadn't heard of them before.)While the book does not present any normative arguments, nor suggests a return to religion, it does suggest a return to something that Dalrymple only vaguely alludes to and hints at. This something may be characterized in a number of ways, such as, an appreciation of Shakespeare, emotional restraint vs. self-expression, preservation of the old-fashioned idea of a mother and father, married, raising their children.Dalrymple's Burkean conservatism charts how a nation's sustaining ideals are transmitted from a generation to generation. He is less interested in transforming individuals into conservative superheroes.Extremely well-written and gripping, especially if you are not familiar with the social decay gripping Britain."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"The first half was tough for me as each chapter was a different book which Dalrymple compared to the present and I wasn't up to speed on some of the books.

They are very well written, with an accessible style and a flair that is absent from the majority of modern literature.These essays are not for the faint of heart either. Those whose minds have been skewed or warped by public education will take great offense at the honest and articulate portrayals of many modern public icons. Marx, Dewey, Freud and all the other revolutionists attempting to build the tower of Babel on the shifting sands of modernity are shown no quarter here and I can well imagine the gnashing of teeth, the clenched fists, the shrieking for retribution by those who do not tolerate \\"intolerance\\". Those who drool the mantra of diversity will cringe at this truly diverse work. Though Dalrymple speaks with an appropriate empathy for humans, the unwitting socialists will chaff. Yet while Dalrymple proves himself an excellent literary critic, the university English professor will surely think him a barbarian. Still, the good Dr.'s work is brimming with common sense and proper order, the msnbc/cnn viewer will vomit the title misanthrope in characteristic misunderstanding.If you have the stomach for it, or rather the cultivated mind and character of a human not disconnected from the truth about the 7 virtues, get this book. It is a feast in a literary desert."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"An erudite, informed assessment of what ails our British culture.

An intense read."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Our Culture, What's Left Of It--The Mandarins and the Masses, by Theodore Dalrymple (2005).Dr. Dalrymple is a writer and medical doctor that has practiced in third-world countries, worked in prisons and inner-city hospitals, and has generally seen a good bit of life's tragedies \\"at the bottom.\\" His more famous book was titled, Life at the Bottom--The Worldview That Makes the Underclass. (2001)In Our Culture..., a collection of essays, the author writes of the necessity of maintaining boundaries if humanity isn't going to descend into barbarism. He blames, in part, the modern intellectual's attitude that being \\"unconventional\\" or \\"breaking taboos\\" are considered high virtues; and they are what is rewarded within the inner circles...without ever questioning the consequences of the unconventional. In the preface he says, \\"And the prestige that intellectuals confer upon antinomianism [heretic Christian view that one is released by grace from the obligation of observing moral law] soon communicates itself to nonintellectuals. What is good for the bohemian sooner or later becomes good for the unskilled worker, the unemployed, the welfare recipient--the very people most in need of boundaries to make their lives tolerable or allow them hope of improvement.\\" In other words, the selling that all morality is relative in meaning and application, has broad negative implications.Dr. Dalrymple regards \\"intellectual and artistic life as being of incalculable practical importance and effect.\\" He quotes economist John Maynard Keynes: \\"Practical men might not have much time in theoretical considerations, but in fact the world is governed by little else than the outdated or defunct ideas of economic and social philosophers.\\" Dalrymple agrees; except that he would \\"now add novelists, playwrights, film directors, artists, and even pop singers. They are the unacknowledged legislators of the world, and we ought to pay close attention to what they say and how they say it.\\" (Emphasis mine.)Since all of these essays were published by City Journal from 1996 through 2004, they can be found in the archives of the Internet."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Insightful and exquisitely written, with enough interesting references to keep you busy for weeks.I lived in the UK for a few years until '94 and when I return to London each year the changes are remarkable and in many ways not comfortable. I read about therace riots in the North, the daily violence and I wonder , what has happened here. Well here you will find a very interesting explanation.I rode the double decker one day in central London and 2 young kids were running up and down the isles swearing and terrorizing everyone at the top of their lungs.I spoke up and was surprised that every other passenger looked down and did not support me. They were afraid. This, in a country that stood together bravely when bombs fell daily just decades ago.IN this book we find some answers to the questions many of us have. How did things change , why did they change .Dalrymple's breath of experience gives weight to his \\"take no prisoners\\" tone and I found the book riveting from the first word to the last.This will not be the last of his books I read."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"I will not write a long review, since the odds of people reading it are tiny.

I just happen to agree with most of his conclusions as well!"},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Dr. Dalrymple is a lucid thinker and great commentator.

His penetration into art and writing as well as his devastating critiques are some of the best in modern writing. Well done...This is one of the few books that I would rate \\"a must read.\\""},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"When we are going to enjoy a fine, delicate meal, we don't do it standing neither do we eat from paper dishes. We try to arrange our best silver ware, porcelain dishes and a fine glass of wine to accompany it. The same idea works with this book: find a quiet place, put your cell phone in airport mode, get a cup of cocoa and enjoy Dalrymple's superb thoughts on every aspect of modern culture. Practically every page will make you stop, think and recognize parallels in life around you. A book with this deep profile is expected to be hard and monotonous, but Dalrymple provides us with a fun, enjoyable text that one can't put down.Even though I live in Brazil and most of the facts Dalrymple describe take place in Britain, the effects of modernist and marxist ideas are so pervasive and universal that they can be applied anywhere. They come from marxism's basic need to destroy anything that came before it, in order to justify its proposition of total power and control in order to create a \\"perfect society\\". It is what they call criticism. Unfortunately, much of what is old is also good, proven and tested by thousand of years of civilization. When the arsonists set this house on fire, often they find themselves living in the gutters, instead of the palace they thought they would find.Dalrymple is not an academic, and thanks God for that. He is a man of the world, who travelled and lived around several different countries and who, as a doctor, dealt with real people, especially the poor. Most marxists live in a Fantasy Island, where they pat each other in the backs and never feel the obligation to confront their theories with the real world. Dalrymple, in the other hand, and maybe because of his training and practice as a physician, shows real compassion and familiarity with people.But this is no sentimental book. Dalrymple's great intellect does what most people can't do today: he finds the causes behind the facts. Most people today complain that crime is on the rise, that TV only shows despicable things, that kids don't respect the elders anymore, like this is just something that \\"happened\\". Dalrymple, however, uses examples from real life to show the readers that these problems have roots in ideas, and that their effects should have been predicted if the intellectuals were just minimally honest. Instead, the intelligentsia just looked for their own interests, for tenure, for fame, for political advancement, and now don't take any responsibility for what is here.In summary, the book is more than a list of events that show our moral and intellectual decay. It should be read as a call for serious meditation about what we see in our environment. The conclusion I take from the text is that we will never see change for the better if we don't learn how ideas can have consequences and try to deal directly with these ideas, instead of only with the effects."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This is a great collection of essays by an insightful British doctor, Extremely engrossing, even on topics that I'm not particularly interested in."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Mr. Dalrymple writes an incisive indictment of our modern society, of Europe in general, but specially of Britain, with the intellignece of a psychiatrist's mind, and the fine expression of a cultured -but never uppety- journalist. A masterful story-teller.He exposes the irresponsibility of the self-righteous liberal media who pander to the most depraved basic instincts of the poor, the working-class, expecting to be paid back with the recognition of their ill-earned status, their privileges. The social landscape of Britain is more than appalling, it's totally gone mad, deplorable, sickening. The funny thing is, as the author says, Britain's sin is its sexual hypocrisy (France's is its economic hypocrisy). Britons cultivate early sex, irresponsibility and hooliganism, but then they are appalled at the results: sex offenders, child abuse abound; women are used as napkins by pampered youngsters... kids who don't know who their parents are, who have sex with their parent's bed-fellows. And it's all real. Dalrymple talks by experience: he has had to listen -as a psychiatrist- to thousands of testimonies.\\"No betrayal is too trivial for the Quislings of civilization\\". Dalrymple is not a Christian, but he sure got his heart in the right place.Laugh at Conrad's \\"the horror, the horror\\". This is the real horror. Right here in Europe."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Excellent. Should be a must in every Sociology class in every university. Ah, but that won't happen in any Govt run school. Too bad."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This books basic theme is that Western liberalism and the non-judgemental welfare state has created an under-class of people that live an unrestrained life without any moral compass, a life where they are both dependent on the state but hate it at the same time!The liberal policy makers who preached tolerance, diversity and equality have not yet realised that this has resulted in the loss of any moral standpoint whatsoever as everything becomes valid in its own light ie. criminals becoming \\"victims\\" of society that has made them bad, or immigrants not having to obey western laws as that would be oppressing their culture.The author has tried to make a grandiose work of this book however the end result is a collection of often waffling essays, after reading for the 6th time that his Jewish mother fled Nazism in 1934 it gets rather tiresome especially as he doesn't clearly relate it to anything in modern Britain. It is hard to believe that someone as well read as Dalrymple does not know that most of the voiciferous promoters of liberal art and relaxed social morals that he derides as shallow thinkers were actually Jewish, which was part of the reason the Nazi's banned them.This book could be edited down by 100 pages and still cover everything worthwhile it has to say. I recommend getting his other book \\"Life at the Bottom\\" in preference to this."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Though undoubtedly Dalrymple would disapprove of such implicit debasing of Christianity :)I bought this book after reading several of his exemplary essays in National Review. Now after reading it I am convinced there is a no more lucid examiner of the cultural manifestations of the ideology of liberalism anywhere. His insightful examinations are a real eye opener for anyone regardless of political bent. Devoid of political-speak, his analysis cuts through common preconceptions using plain observations of real human activity he has experienced over many years. What is most remarkable about his writing is that it utterly transcends the genre of cultural and political commentary... and achieves the qualities of Great Literature. My greatest testimony to his skill is that I now find the work of his contemporaries largely boring in comparison.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Theodore Dalrymple is a social critic, but a very special kind. He approaches his subject like a travel writer, the old-fashioned adventuring travel writer, who goes on a dangerous expedition to report back to the rest of us what we didn't already know. In his case, he travels to the bleak immigrant suburbs of Paris, to prisons, to psychiatric wards in provincial inner-city hospitals, and reports back to us--the respectable classes. What he tells us is frightening, thought-provoking, dismaying; it's new information, and it resonates with us, because Dalrymple's view of civility and his outrage at what he sees are so in accord with our own values. But perhaps we mostly pay attention because he's an extraordinarily gifted writer, capable of producing the pithy sentence that precisely sums up an ironic episode of social life."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"The first part of this brilliant collection of essays deals with art and literary criticism, whilst the second explores politics and the state of society. The thread that binds them is the cultural and moral decline of Western civilization.The wide ranging topics encompass inter alia Princess Diana, Shakespeare, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, DH Lawrence, the crassness of popular culture, the underclass in the UK, the legalisation of drugs and Muslim communities in the West.With breathtaking eloquence and impressive insight, Dalrymple analyses these miscellaneous but interwoven subjects. His observations are interspersed by anecdotes from his experiences as a medical practitioner.He blames the intellectual elites for much of the decay in the quality of life, arts and culture. In no small part this flows from their moral relativism and their denial of the existence of good and evil.These liberal elites are quick to hail all forms of transgression while worshipping a twisted concept of tolerance and denying vice. Their hysterical insistence on \\"understanding\\" is becoming increasingly loud, but their relativism is remarkably selective. In extreme cases, it results in the total inversion of good and evil.Thus we get the absurdity of political correctness. But PC is not only absurd, it is sinister too: assenting to untruth is to condone evil. It is easy to control a society of powerless liars.The author's comparison of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell on the one side (constructive), with Virginia Woolf and DH Lawrence (destructive and foolish) is particularly thought provoking.Dalrymple points out how an eerie silence results when for example, the feminist piety meets the piety of multiculturalism, like the reaction of Western Leftists when confronted with gender apartheid in the Third World. They simply ignore it.He identifies the cause of much of the present mindset as an unholy alliance between libertarians who claim consumer choice as the ultimate answer, and leftists who believe that people have rights but no responsibilities.Although the book deals with many unpleasant subjects, Dalrymple's insights are original and phrased in awesome prose. The book left me with a feeling of sadness, and a line fromLeonard Cohen'ssong The Land Of Plenty came to mind: \\"For what's left of our religion, I bow my head and pray ...\\"Having digested this gem, the interested reader might also wish to investigateThe Dragons Of Expectationby Robert Conquest,West and the Restby Roger Scruton,Intellectual Moronsby Daniel Flynn andThe New Thought Police: Inside the Left's Assault on Free Speech and Free Mindsby Tammy Bruce."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This book is in two basic parts. The first 1-2 chapters set the stage, followed by a few difficult but tremdndously powerful chapters focusing on arcane philosophy or individuals. Then, in the second half, things become magnificent.There are observations in thsi book which are humbling; there are quotes which are devastating, there are anecdotes which are representative of the entire morass the 60's and Communism have bequeathed us. Many of our policy makers, senators, representative, and journalists should read this book. I only fear that they do not have the basic intellectual infrastructure to understand it, especially as it points a very incriminating finger at them.One can only hope that our western culture will survive enough for another renaissance; it is clear we are entering a very terrifying time."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"While it's a confluence he'd likely be more than happy to forgo, it's entirely fitting that Theodore Dalrymple's latest collection of essays came out just as Britain was rocked by the bomb blasts of 7/07 and the realization that the perpetrators were British, educated, and middle class, not foreign, ignorant, and/or poor. Others are certain not to welcome the timing, for where Mr. Dalrymple's prior book, Life at the Bottom, had the comparatively easy task of explaining how liberal secular attitudes and intellectual trades had contributed to the creation of a permanent underclass, he here moves on to the more unpleasant task -- unpleasant for us* to realize how right he is, anyway -- of explaining how the same rot has spread to the great middle class and left a shambles of British culture in particular. Multiculturalism may have seemed rather silly to most of us all along, but when it seemed a fairly harmless silliness it was at least tolerable. But being brought face to face with the damage we've done to ourselves by not fighting it...that's a whole 'nother matter...Mr. Dalrymple--who also writes under his own name, Anthony Daniels--is ridiculously prolific and a favorite of bloggers, so you may have read many of these essays, or, like me, may have missed a goodly few in the onslaught. Most (all?) of the pieces included here come from the excellent City Journal and while there's a mix of literary criticism and social analysis, the focus is very much on how our refusal to defend what is best in Western culture has led us to accept what is worst about not just our own culture but a whole host of others. Several of the most chilling essays concern Europe's inability to assimilate its immigrant populations, especially Muslims. But Mr. Dalrymple does not blame the \\"them\\", as would be all too easy, but confronts \\"us\\" with our failures. Here, by way of example, is a bit from What We Have to Lose, written shortly after 9/11:Recently, I went to a soccer game in my city on behalf of a newspaper; the fans of the opposing teams had to be separated by hundreds of policemen, disposed in military fashion. The police allowed no contact whatever between the opposing factions, shepherding or corraling the visiting fans into their own area of the stadium with more security precautions than the most dangerous of criminals ever faces.In the stadium, I sat next to a man, who appeared perfectly normal and decent, and his 11-year-old son, who seemed a well-behaved little boy. Suddenly, in the middle of the match, the father leaped up and, in unison with thousands of others, began to chant: \\"Who the f-k do you think you are? Who the f-k do you think you are?\\" while making, also in common with thousands of others, a threatening gesture in the direction of the opposing supporters that looked uncommonly like a fascist salute. Was this the example he wanted to set for his son? Apparently so. The frustrations of poverty could hardly explain his conduct: the cost of the tickets to the game could have fed a family more than adequately for a week.After the game was over, I saw more clearly than ever that the thin blue line is no metaphor. Had it not been for the presence of the police (whose failures I have never hesitated to criticize), there would have been real violence and bloodshed, perhaps even death. The difference between an event that passed off peacefully and one that would end in mayhem, destruction, injury, and death was the presence of a relative handful of resolute men prepared to do their duty.Despite the evidence of rising barbarism all around us, no betrayal is too trivial for the Quislings of civilization to consider worthwhile. Recently, at the airport, I noticed an advertisement for a firm of elegant and costly shirt- and tie-makers, headquartered in London's most expensive area. The model they chose to advertise their products was a shaven-headed, tattooed monster, with scars on his scalp from bar brawls-the human type that beats women, carries a knife, and throws punches at soccer games. The advertisement is not ironical, as academic cultural critics would pretend, but an abject capitulation to and flattery of the utmost coarseness and brutality. Savagery is all the rage.If any good comes of the terrible events in New York, let it be this: that our intellectuals should realize that civilization is worth defending, and that the adversarial stance to tradition is not the beginning and end of wisdom and virtue. We have more to lose than they know.It's so facile to express shock and horror at the barbarism of the terrorists who attack us and of the Islamicists we're fighting in the Middle East, but isn't it the barbarism in the very midst of our own culture that we should be doing something about?Here though we arrive at a rather curious fact, for while Mr. Dalrymple quite openly recognizes -- see, for example, The evil that men do and Bad and bored in The Spectator -- that the solution to Europe's cultural problems lies in a resurgence of the Judeo-Christianity that was at the center of its lost culture, he is not himself religious and he announced last year that he is retiring to France, of all the godforsaken spots on Earth. America is in the midst of what some have called our Third Great Awakening and no one would gainsay the idea that religion and morality have resumed a central place in American politics and culture, but is Britain really in such dire straits that its best and brightest not only no longer believe in God but no longer believe in England? If it's the nature of things to come in three, one is downright frightened to imagine what the next volume of Mr. Dalrymple's essays will bring with it. In the meantime though, we'll surely keep reading him, compulsively. He's one of the very best social critics of our age."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This amazingly well written collection of essays does an excellent job of connecting the dots to identify ideas that have led to the degradation of British (and other Western) cultures. This is not a scientific/statistical treatment of cultural trends but a canary-in-the-mine warning of the grievous danger that failure to take responsibility for cultural standards poses to Western Civilization.Dr. Dalrymple's long exposure to the pathologies of the underclass and their interesting evasions of responsibility again (his \\"Life at the Bottom\\" is a must read) lend substantial credibility to his claims of idea transmission from the academic, literary, and arts areas to the bottom economic layers of British culture.Dr. Dalrymple pulls together a large number of threads to give flesh to our cultural problems, now it is up to the statisticians to follow the pointers and provide the numbers.Reading \\"Our Culture, What's Left of it\\" is a reminder that writing on a depressing topic need not itself be depressing. Dr, Dalrymple's erudition and apt turn of phrase shine forth from every page. He does not set down prescriptions, but readers can not fail to identify the steps necessary to avert cultural/economic suicide."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Our Culture, What's left of It-The Mandarins and the Masses by Theodore Dalrymple is a great book for anyone concerned about whether or not civilization will continue much longer. In the traditions of Edmund Burke, Oswald Spengler, Ayn Rand and more recently, David Horowitz, Mr. Dalrymple has unique insight into the decline of most societies. This is from the perspective of a doctor while in Africa and England. After socialism destroyed 100 million souls, he notes \\"(t)he fragility of civilization is one of the greatest lessons of the twentieth century. \\" He relates case after case of \\"the consequences of going too far,\\" where \\"(m)en commit evil within the scope available to them...They do what they can get away with.\\" We are allowing too many of us to get away with far too much, and we are, thus, allowing civilization and our culture to come apart at the seams. Mr. Dalrymple covers the \\"conditions for the perpetration of evil (which are) now complete.\\"He discusses art and literature as Ayn Rand did - as a barometer of the goodness or corruptness of a society. The respect people have for each other is another barometer. The Left's full fledged demands that everyone be allowed to do anything without limit is destroying the heart and soul of what is remaining of Western civilization. One can only conclude that destroying the West is their real goal. The collapse or all moral restraint always leads to chaos and tyranny.Politically, Mr. Dalrymple discusses the evils of totalitarianism, socialism and the Left's good intentions. \\"(N)o mass murder takes place without its perpetrators alleging that they are acting for the good of mankind...\\" \\"The attempts to put utopian ideals into practice invariably resulted in the effort to eliminate whole classes or races of people.\\"He has watched with dismay as England in particular has descended into \\"chaos and anarchy.\\" If we know so well what the welfare state does to society-destroying families, productiveness, and individual responsibility, while never curing poverty-why does the Left insist on continuing it? The welfare state has not been so much a war on poverty, but rather has become the war on the poor. And the poor in turn have turned on civilization.Chapters on \\"The Man Who Predicted the Race Riots\\", \\"When Islam Breaks Down\\" and \\"The Barbarians at the Gates of Paris\\" written in 2002 are ironic juxtaposed with the current burning of France and Islam's global war on the rest of the world.The only problem with this book is that although Mr. Dalrymple describes in detail the evils now present in society and what causes them, he only hints at what will save us. These ideals are reason, limited government, the rule of law, individual freedom (but not license), individual responsibility and capitalism.Give this book to your \\"liberal\\" friends who think they are trying to help their fellow man.Ragnar11/15/05"},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Length:: 6:27 MinsI'm always been a huge Dr. Dalrymple fan so it was a pleasure to read this book a second time for the purposes of review."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"For starters, I'm an American and I think I speak for the whole country give or take a few cranks who must admit we love that English writing style. It is the mother tounge after all (and although Dalrymple may have come to it late, he came to it with a relish), and they certainly can wield it well. Wry and dry and pulling no punches, Dalrymple reminds us (again and again and again), that culture isn't quite what it used to be and gives a slightly different take than most people do on why.The again and again and again part is the one weakness of the book, and why I give it four instead of five stars. It is a collection of essays, and while he or his editor try to vary them and they are all well written, you can't help but feel a bit bludgeoned by the negative worldview after a while. I mean, I live in the U.S. and we're hardly know for refined manners, but outside of a few pockets in large cities do I ever run into the day in day out callousness that Dalrymple describes. I'm certainly not saying that he imagines it, just that all that doom and gloom probably works better on a case by case basis. In a book form you begin to feel like Lot must've felt in Sodom and Gomorrah. Then I've never been to London, and for all I know it's full of godless heathen running amuck.Secondly he is an eloquent and fine storyteller, and gives a very logical presentation of the facts. He always admits the anecdotal nature of his observations, but makes a very compelling case for their considerations nonetheless. It is a sociological masterpiece, in my opinion, and gets as close to the nub of some of the problems of modern western society as one can get without divine revelation.It's weakness, like the other work that I have read by him, is that it is basically a collection of editorials, and thus there is overlap and often a continual drumbeat of the same few themes. If I imagine reading 30 Maureen Dowd stories in a row, I can generate sympathy for the agony that the other side who have genuinely read through the book must feel. Even for a social conservative it can get a bit tedious, but by and large Dalrymple takes enough fresh perspectives and uses enough varying examples to support his contentions that this is mostly a minor complaint.In all, a very, very good analysis and as succinct and vivid a glimpse of the Thomas Hardy-like irony that has brought us to this point that one is likely to encounter."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"\\"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses\\" is a collection of 26 essays by Theodore Dalrymple the pseudonym of Anthony Daniels a former English prison doctor and psychiatrist.If you read and enjoyed Dalrymple's \\"Life at the Bottom\\" published in 2001 you will find much to enjoy here.Dalrymple is a \\"compassionate conservative\\" deeply concerned about the devastating consequences that liberalism has brought to society.Dalrymple's basic thesis is the the changes to society brought about by progressive intellectuals has devastated the working classes leading to the social problems we have today - single mothers, social welfare dependency, social dislocation, drug use, etc, etc.Dalrymple also rails against art intellectuals who automatically equate \\"shocking\\", \\"disturbing\\", \\"breaking taboos\\" as good. He makes the point that once you start breaking taboos you have to keep going further to continue to shock.The highlight for me was \\"How to Read a Society\\", which discusses a series of letters first published in 1843 written by the French aristocrat the Marquis de Custine on his experiences in Russia.Dalrymple explores how the insights in these letters on Russian society do so much to explain how communism could take root in Russia, and how closely the tyranny of communism followed on from the tyranny of the Tsarist era.Altogether this is a stimulating and entertaining collection."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Theodore Dalrymple is big in Holland. Now what does that tell us? That we Brits are in serious decline and that the Dutch psyche, powered by psychedelic mushrooms, can easily slip into reveries of heightened sharpness when in the presence of a true intellectual like Dr Dalrymple. This heightened sharpness the average Hollander carries within their clever heads, has the power to dissolve the prickly magical spells cast by Simon Cowell's flabby breasts, and his army of angry mannequins, who are forever trying to convert us all into dribbling morons.Hollanders, you know, are not so stuck in politically correct toilet blockage as we worried puppies appear to be, that they cannot appreciate a brilliant wit. We Brits have gone the other way; we have blown intelligence right out of our waters; to the detriment of our brains. Our frontal lobes, which engage in critical thinking are diminished as we relax and unwind in front of the X Factor or the National Lottery. How long are these flabby troths of culture to insult our patience? How long! Hoi polloi feed and indeed worship at the foot of the machine, which is a flabby troth for the people to digest and excrete. Being in awe of the flabby troths of culture is a mild form of hypnosis you see, as we are overly engrossed and focussed on the bright lights and so filter out the dark messages thrown at our ears from the intelligence quarter. These dark messages are the antidote to the flabby sleep of reason. But only educators such as Theodore Dalrymple practice the dark arts of truth writing. Thus we find it harder and harder to engage with the truths that we hear because we are seduced by the mystique and charisma that Simon Cowell and Wayne Rooney. Sadly, this is analogous to handing over our brains executive function to another person, or handing over our car keys to a stranger.Theodore Dalrymple is not like this and so he is ignored in Great Britain. He is very brilliant you know, but sophistry doesn't come into it and it's to our collective shame that we ignore this man. The BBC won't touch him with a long stick and so we are indeed driven mad before we are destroyed.Dr Dalrymple peddles watertight logical arguments that torpedo the politically correct fluff peddled in the Guardian; he's that smart. Well, smart in the fact that he is not blinded by the prevailing orthodoxy of the day. Dalrymple does not mince his words, nor does he play around with politically correct wishful thinking; oh know; but only the menacing truth. Dalrymple is unrelenting in his picture of our disturbing world and we are made dizzy by his menacing world view. This menacing world view would be fine coming from a gutter snipe from the tabloid corner but it isn't. I say menacing, because it is indeed menacing to be reminded of our state of civilisation. It is time to lift our collective heads above the sanctioned flabby play-pen of self gratification. So with a caustic wit and fierce eye for good sense, coupled with very funny insights into the menace of the masses; this towering Cassandra of a writer is great fun to digest; indeed he is a Dickens for our hard times.It's only stupid people who will complain that the good doctor is somehow \`racist' or \`elitist' or some other meaningless mantra! It's also saddening that some reviewers have accused Dalrymple of working himself into a weird corner and if he wasn't such a great writer he would be bracketed in the hysterics corner.Surely Theodore Dalrymple has been driven mad by the British Underclass, we hear them cry? Or he is bitter and out of touch and so holds a fuzzy perspective? It was the philosopher Wittgenstein after all who said that the world of the sad man is different from the world of the happy man. However, this psychobabble opened the gates to cultural relativism and he haven't been the same since. (I doubt Wittgenstein had this in mind, but look at the entire New Age \`you make your own reality' industry!)Alfred North Whitehead once said that no matter how we approach a subject, there are always \\"stubborn facts'. No matter how post modern we try to be, there is no escaping stubborn facts. So the guilt ridden Eurocrat, the destruction of the British education system and other terribles all happened before Dalrymple put finger to pen. Semi-literate mothers who worship Simon Cowell (check), a growing underclass that wasn't there before (check), football worship (check), ferocious hoodies (ok this bits for his Daily Mail fans), portly proles (check), and an entire host of benefiterati; these facts are all griss for the Dalrymple mill.Dr Dalrymple is a pessimist then; so what of his pessimism. The time to tell all is now! After all, the better the insight, the truer (pessimistic) it must be! Isnt it obvious that optimism is to fantasy what pessimism is to realism?Just check out Theodore's biography. The man worked the merry courts of bedlam for 20 years and harassed the cinder block pavilions of council estate England before he emigrating. As a doctor he tried to get sense out of stinking addicts, the wife beaters who were a bit dim, with smashed teeth and sexy tattoos, and babies who hadn't a clue. No wonder he moved to Holland!"},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"I read this book in three days for it was so well written, articulate and interesting. As an American, I had envisaged England to be a land full of poets, ladies, gentlemen and good manners...boy, was I in for big disillusionment when I moved there! I agreed with nearly every single word Dalrymple used in this heartbreakingly accurate analysis of modern day England. Streets are full of criminal-looking youths, debauched natives out partying and living decadent lifestyles, apathetic masses that revel in bad behaviour, a cruel undertone to society, a welfare state that shouldn't exist, Islamic fundamentalists allowed to incite hatred in the streets without arrest, children following the same vicious cycles their parents had. This is today's UK and this ex-prison doctor knows full well about it all. It is a shame that very few people understand the extent of the social decay taking root there. I found myself angry, despairing and yet still hopeful by the time I had finished reading this work.

I was showed an excerpt of this book to \\"prove\\" to me the flaws in Islam. The author's argument was extremely ethnocentric and unoriginal. His arguments against Islam could be disproven with any basic knowledge of Quran and Hadith, and were nothing that hasn't been repeated time and time again through the media (and by that I mean Fox News). He essentially argued the reason Muslim culture (referring almost exclusively to Muslims from Iran and Afghanistan - even though there are over 1 billion Muslims worldwide) is oppressive and generally unsuccessful is because Muslims have failed to conform to Western standards.Perhaps the rest of the book contains something enlightening, but I assume the other chapters are more of the same (as tends to be the case with a book written by a single author). However, based on the reviews I've read it seems that most people are reading this book to reinforce their own right-winged biases.

I don't know that I am so willing to drop rose petals at the feet of our past without holding first holding it to the same level of scrutiny as we do our modern times.I appreciate that this is one person's perspective - how a Mr. Dalrymple chooses to view the world.

It was like spending time at a party talking to someone I don't necessarily agree with, but that still tells a good story."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"I first came across the writings of \\"Theodore Dalrymple\\" (not his real name) in City Journal, some of which are reprinted in this book. I haven't followed either him or his fans too closely, nor have gotten around to reading any other collections of his work. While I often agree with much of Mr. Dalrymple's points, I found this book ultimately to be somewhat disappointing for a couple of reasons. I would recommend \\"Our Culture, What's Left of It\\" primarily for a handful of essays - \\"A Neglected Genius\\" and \\"The Uses of Corruption\\" were amongst my personal favorites.To begin with, Mr. Dalrymple's essays in this collection are divided into two sections: the more politically based, and the more literary (or arts) based, although for Mr. Dalrymple politics tends to be rather central or close to central no matter the topic. What initially drew me towards reading more of his work was one of the essays included here, \\"A Neglected Genius,\\" on the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. While critical of Zweig, especially in his failure to strongly condemn or protest the Nazis during their rise to power (Zweig, who was Jewish, at first dismissed them then felt a direct response would only legitimate their rhetoric as something worthy of response), Dalrymple's treatment of Zweig and several of his works is pretty fair and insightful, and it didn't take long to come across a perception of the author held dearly by many of his fans: that unlike other cultural commentators, Mr. Dalrymple speaks simply from his experience as a doctor in British prisons and slums. Where other current writers bluster and rage according to their ideological fancies, Mr. Dalrymple is presented as someone whose checked every argument against the undeniable facts of how life is lived in a modern, liberal, welfare state, and in particular by those very people (the poor, the immigrant) that everyone else claims to be defending and helping.Unfortunately, the qualities I have mentioned in Mr. Dalrymple's treatment of Zweig cannot be said to be fully universal for the rest of his writing, where he often succumbs to the apparent temptation on his part to blame everything on the liberal elite and take every resultant pot-shot that he can muster. To start with the \\"Arts and Letters\\" section of this book, Mr. Dalrymple's primary shortcomings are, in my opinion, twofold: firstly, one never really gets the impression that he \\"learns\\" much from the works of art he discusses, even when he quite obviously approves of them, and secondly, he often comes across as indeed being more interested in waging an ideological war than in having a genuine engagement with the subject at hand.Regarding the first point, his tone and arguments often come across, at least to me, as if his criteria for what constitutes a \\"good\\" work is that which already agrees with him: I never sensed any of the works he discusses as having ever truly having a profound effect on him. I have to assume he has had such interactions with art, so I can only guess that Mr. Dalrymple's literary writing is, in general, motivated more by ideological reasons - to attack those with whom he disagrees - than to really comment on the works themselves. This is both frustrating and disappointing, as such a treatment of art isn't really that different from the destructive politicizing of art he accuses liberal academia of committing. An ideological use of art is still ideological, regardless of which side it agrees with, and throughout these essays, Mr. Dalrymple can often make quite insightful and thought-provoking comments when he isn't busying himself with hatcheting one strawman or another.Regarding the second point, his routine essay structure (and theme) of stating the topic, outlining the liberal view, and then immediately blaming it for all manner of contemporary social ills says to me that Mr. Dalrymple is indeed more concerned with producing idelogical readings from a work of art than with having the kind of interaction that I suspect most people have. Few people I know, myself included, read to have our personal opinions confirmed; most people, I think, read for the aesthetic enjoyment of art and the often engaging (moral/political/social/etc) issues raised by a work's plot and characters. Perhaps, sadly, these days more people do indeed read in order to have their personal, and petty, ideologies confirmed and nurtured, but if this is so then I weep for the future of literature.Regardless, as essays like the aforementioned \\"A Neglected Genius\\" or \\"Why Shakespeare is for All Time\\" demonstrate, Dalrymple can be quite insightful and persuasive in his literary criticism when he's willing to drop the ideological axe-grinding. Unfortunately, it's a willingness hard to come by in the essays collected here. An example of this can be seen in \\"How - and How Not - to Love Mankind,\\" an essay that primarily focuses on Marx's Communist Manifesto and a much-celebrated short story by Ivan Turgenev, \\"Mumu\\" (which must certainly be considered one of the greatest works of literature). The problem isn't so much in his separate readings of either work - it's hard to argue his basic assessment of either - but with his premise that something valid or useful comes about by comparing the two. Marx' manifesto isn't a novel or short story, and Turgenev's story isn't a political document. Mr. Dalrymple's compare/contrast work here is done for quite an obvious reason: to show Marx, and by him Marxists, and by them all Liberals, as having none of the genuine warmth and compassion towards humanity (especially towards the truely poor and oppressed) that Turgenev does.This apparent \\"discovery\\" that a view of people in a short story is somehow more \\"humane\\" or \\"true\\" than in a political document doesn't strike me as a particularly stunning or insightful one. It'd be like comparing Huckleberry Finn to the US Constitution and then criticizing the latter for only discussing people in general terms of how they relate to the state instead of Twain's focus on individual lives. Marx' writings and arguments can be attacked on their own (lack of) merit, or in comparison to other political doctrines; furthermore, it strikes me that Marxism has been a dead horse for quite some time, and as such I wonder why Dalrymple feels compelled to keep beating at it with a well-worn stick, other than perhaps the fact that it remains much too valuable a rhetorical crutch for conservative ideologues to abandon.The centralness of ideology to much of Mr. Dalrymple's writing carries over (not surprisingly) to the essays dealing with \\"society and politics\\". Much of what I've already written about his art criticism applies, in some form, to this section as well, with the addition of something that isn't quite as strong in the first section (although it does surface in his raging broadside against Virginia Woolf) but felt much more present in the second: a tendency to seemingly engage in the very thing he criticizes liberals of doing (or condoning, or encouraging, or...).The best example I can think of this can be found in the essay \\"All Sex, All the Time.\\" Dalrymple is not unlike most conservatives (and most people in general, liberals included, I would bet) in arguing that we'd all be better off if sex was understood as being something a little more important than a mere pleasure choice, and as such became treated with a bit more dignity, reserve, and discreteness, particularly in popular culture. Mr. Dalrymple has seen enough patients to know that \\"free sex\\" leads not so much to liberation as to unwanted pregnancies, unfit mothers, indifferent fathers, and neglected children, an entire generation or more within England's ghettos alone, by his account.Despite this, in the aforementioned essay, Dalrymple has no qualm and, really, wastes almost no time in reporting on - how should I put this? - on how the \\"sexual revolutionary\\" Havelock Ellis \\"got off\\" (you'll have to read it yourself if you're dying to know). He does so despite Ellis' personal inclinations having no bearing on examining his public arguments and writings - which Mr. Dalrymple goes on to do. As I've said, I've noticed this before in the general conservative body of writing of late - the obsessive detailing of Clinton's sexual escapades in conservative columns, books, and online forums comes immediately to mind - and I can only assume this \\"puerile\\" facet (to use Dalrymple's judgment of most sexually liberating writings) of modern conservative writers stems from one of two reasons: either most conservatives are hypocrites and enjoy the filth (by disguisng it as some kind of mere journalistic detailing of the facts) just as much as the heathen liberals they denigrate, or modern conservatives have fully accepted the very same liberal identity politics they publically loathe: what other reason can Mr. Dalrymple have in describing Ellis' personal fetish than by believing that \\"the personal is political\\", and that by exposing him as a personal degenerate, Ellis' public arguments become immediately null and void?Mr. Dalrymple's tendency to reframe his subjects in a way that best suits his critical agenda can similarly be seen in one of the 'arts and letters' essays, \\"A Lost Art\\". At one point, Mr. Dalrymple contrasts Japanese and Western art, noting that the former didn't start displaying until after 1945 the kind of \\"disenchantment\\" with beauty and realism that had already dominated Western art for at least half a century by then. Dalrymple would like to believe that this delay in artistic cynicism on the part of the Japanese has something meaningful to say (that, it exposes the artificiality of) regarding its dominance in Western art. While I can't claim it to be necessarily the sole factor, there's an important historical fact that Mr. Dalrymple seems to conveniently leave out: until 1945, Japan was dominated by a military junta disguised as a empire run by a divine monarchy. When one thinks of how similarly fascist governments of the 20th century banned \\"degenerate\\" modern art in favor of more \\"traditional\\" forms, it shouldn't be terribly surprising that Japanese artists held on to the woodblock printing tradition as long as they did. Was it a truly delayed disenchantment, or merely a delayed freedom to express it?Despite all these criticisms, and my general disappointment with the collection, I would argue that most people will find at least one or two essays, if not more, to be enjoyable, or at least thought-provoking. His art criticism often deals with neglected or lesser known artists and works, and anyone can score points easily enough when criticizing the excesses of modern academia; on social issues, the utter failure of many modern government programs is something we can continue ignoring. My personal disappointment stems mostly from the fact that the voice Mr. Dalrymple tries to invoke - as that of a prison and ghetto doctor who has come to champion traditional British mores and values out of the gritty, first-hand experience of seeing up close the failures a liberal welfare state has on its poorer charges - is not the one he actually employs, which is more that of a reactionary ideologue who often struck me as little different than those he attacks. Many of Dalrymple's basic points - that \\"liberational\\" beliefs and values can often be more functionally oppressive than the restrictions they abolished, that many modern \\"liberal\\" notions (especially regarding sexuality) are simply unfeasible and downright harmful, especially if you're too poor to afford abortions or single parenthood, and so on - are quite spot on in my humble opinion. Unfortunately, such truths get sidetracked or saddled by his ideological cheap shots and trash talk.I suppose some may be quite fine by that: with every passing day, American politics becomes increasingly embracing of ideological correctness over moral and ethical truth (on both the right and the left). However, it saddens me that a man like Theodore Dalrymple, who has the gift of being a well-read, well-experienced man who can craft, at times, very direct and illuminating arguments, routinely chose the route so many of his fellow hacks (such as Bernard Goldberg and Coulter on the right, Moore and Franken on the left) take, where scoring points against strawman opponents has come to be seen as a legitimate and meaningful form of cultural and political discourse.As a sort of PS, in regards to the comments at least one other reviewer has made regarding Mr. Dalrymple \\"abandoning\\" England for France out of some sort of \\"giving up\\" on British culture, I would humbly suggest that Mrs. Dalrymple being French likely played a much bigger role in this matter."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Dalrymple is a great writer and he uses his power as a writer to create horrifying and sobering illustrations of the welfare state and what's left of morality among the poor.He blames much of this on the \\"liberal elite\\" and the welfare system of England, but ignores the fact that penury and depredation existed before both. Blaming, along with other elements, modern art for the failure of a civilization is a stretch. Indeed, the elites who are liberal are horrified by the modern world and its factories and pollution, and their art reflects this.His criticism of the welfare state is another issue, and his objections to it deserve to be recognized. His work with poor of all nations gives him the right and experience to do so.But this is the pattern throughout the book - personal experience with little data, and his deplorable stories are not often backed up with trends. And who's to say life was any better in the 19th century, anyway? Alas, his political orientation has led him to a problem we have here in the states, too much revelation, not enough research; too much romanticizing the past, not enough appreciation for the present."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Just a word of warning. The subtitle of the book suggests that its overarching theme is the relationship between well-meaning theory and disastrous real-world results. Since this is a collection of discrete essays the 'theme' is much more a leitmotif. The essays themselves are superb, but they are ultimately freestanding. What links the pieces and unifies the book is (as always) the personal vision and deep experience of the essayist. This particular essayist happens also to be very well read and a highly-skilled writer. Five stars for the essays qua essays, but don't take up the book expecting a rigorous, detailed argument on the relationship between cultural theory and cultural catastrophe (though Dalrymple is doubtless capable of writing such a book)."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"I found the first part of this book quite hard going, however that is due to my own intellectual limitations. It's a book which needs to be pondered and reflected on and I intend to return to it with that aim in mind. If you want to be stretched then this is the book for you. Theodore Dalrymple is a man who does a lot of thinking and it's very sensible, obvious stuff."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"I am one who is deeply concerned about the destruction of western civilization. Much of my reading the last 3 years has been on the subject. Perhaps Dalrymple has made the best of the bunch. He far easier to read than Alexander Boots' \\"How the West was Lost\\". And far more scholarly than works by Michael Savage, Neil Boortz and Oriana Falluci. Dalrymple also mixes personal experience with research to sell his point in easilu digestable chapters. Although much of his writings are in regard to England it can easily be related to america as well. My only regret is that the book was not longer, even 500 pages wouldn't be enough. I am anxouisly awaiting his next book."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This is a brilliant and highly original analysis of the cultural ills of the modern world. The author sees our Culture as having lost its basis in discipline, and consideration of the others. He sees modern Britain as a society in which people live selfishly for their own individual pleasures without thinking of the good of others, even the good of other family members.He indicates for instance that in less than half of contemporary British homes there is a 'dining table' He says eating has become for most people in England a continuous individual affair. There is no need as when sitting with others to show a modicum of respect and patience. It is one bit of junk gratification after the other.Darymple in pointing to the trend toward ' lack of responsibility' and increasing childishness in the modern world notes how people no longer use the word ' unhappy' They instead use the concept ' depressed' which implies that their condition is a medical use which can perhaps be cured by taking some kind of drug. Saying that they are ' unhappy' might require of them real effort to deal with their own problems and change their life for the good.This fleeing from responsibility also relates to the ' premature adulthood' seemingly given young people today, who may seem to have adult experiences at a young age but who according to the author remain fourteen forever.As one who recently visited England I must report that my experience does not confirm the brilliant analysis of the work. I was there it is true mostly in a geriatic ward of the hospital where most of the people were unfailingly courteous and considerate.But in other places also I found the English to be in general competent and considerate, especially on the road.I of course however know England only superficially. It seems to me that the author's analysis does say a great deal about the modern situation also in the United States and other Western societies.I would also add the originality of many of the ideas here make this work especially delightful to read."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Theodore Dalrymple is one of the best essayists in the English language.Anyone familiar with his work will not be surprised by the riots currently sweeping the UK. In this collection of essays, written years before the August 2011 riots, Dalrymple examined the blighted conditions in the UK and the misguided government policies that encouraged, if not actually created, those conditions, and asserted in no uncertain terms that the UK was in serious trouble. If you had read Dalrymple and taken his comments seriously, these August 2011 riots would be no surprise at all.Dalrymple is characteristically blunt about the succesive UK governments' failure to ensure basic educational standards, the creation of a large uneducated underclass, the perverse incentives of welfare policies, the tolerance of crime and anti-social behaviour and a host of other ruinous policies that have essentially led to the breakdown of civilized standards among a large segment of the British population.Dalrymple writes beautifully and the litany of government failure, years of damaging government policies and their potential for promoting the UK's decline as a nation are presented with concise and impeccable logic.The August 2011 riots have already happened. Read this book with the knowledge of hindsight and you'll see that Dalrymple predicted all of this mayhem years ago. And if Dalrymple is right, these August 2011 riots are just a symptom of the rot that has infested and permeated British society with the full encouragement, connivance and active participation of successive British governments.In short, this is a brilliant book."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Dalrymple's essays are wonderful to read - erudite, amusing (yet horrifying), witty but deadly serious. His musings are much more than curmudgeonly rants, though that element is certainly there, as in the writings of that other highly articulate, erudite English conservative Roger Scruton (The Uses of Pessimism: And the Danger of False Hope).Like George Orwell (see, for example, hisDown and Out in Paris and LondonandThe Road to Wigan Pier), Dalrymple brings to bear on his writing a wealth of experience in different countries and among the least respectable elements in them. His perspective is different - it reflects, among other things, a lifetime spent amid the demoralizing effects, as he sees them, of the postwar welfare state.As with Scruton, there is the same distrust of the reforming, utopian elites who, with the best intentions, wreak havoc in the lives of those they purport to help. Of course, the book will please curmudgeonly conservatives, but it deserves to be read carefully also by those it targets for criticism. The book is a powerful warning to those like me, who have spent most of their lives in the 'helping' professions like social work or advocating for social policy reforms that strengthen the bureaucratic-professional state while weakening the capacity of the poorest and most vulnerable to care for and control their own families and neighborhoods.The essays are not at all as predictable as this description might suggest. There are many surprises, delights, and unexpected insights. His essay on an exhibition of the work of photographers who died while recording their experience of the Vietnam War is thoughtful and profound, drawing effectively on the author's own experience of being drawn to danger in foreign parts.His essay on the uses of corruption offers a surprising explanation of why Italy has thrived in the post-war period while Britain, from a much more favorable starting position, fell into a \\"degradation and lack of self-respect that is so obvious in the streets of Britain but so absent from those of Italy\\" (p.196).The challenge for Dalrymple is that the Italian state absorbs far more of the national economy than the British and so appears to validate the statist dirigisme that Dalrymple generally deplores. His answer is that the Italian state is openly corrupt and inefficient, so people have to fend for themselves and their families and to bribe their way past bureaucratic obstacles to get things done (like building permits, installing phone service, and so forth). In Britain, in contrast, bureaucratic probity ensures that people expect more of the state, which therefore acts as a real brake on economic progress and a blight on people's lives. It is not reliance on the state, but the fact that people know they cannot rely on it, that gives Italy its comparative advantage. Whether one is convinced or not, it is an ingenious, thought-provoking argument and a pleasure to read.Dalrymple, like Scruton and (on a different level) Orwell, shows how much we can benefit from reading the articulate, intelligent work of perceptive social and cultural commentary that challenges our own assumptions and biases."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"I have enjoyed everything that I have read by Theodore Dalrymple(Dr. Anthony Daniels)and find \\"Mandarins and the Masses\\" a true pleasure.

Dr. Dalrymple has been unafraid to tell the truth, a dangerous and unpopular thing to do. I admire him for it. Courage and wisdom are rare qualities in culture were the one great sin is to mention that the emperor is naked, let alone ugly and deformed.John Castleberry"},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"This collection of evil covers disparate topics but what unites them all is the author's search for the foundation of culture and civilisation coupled with his observations as to how Western Civilisation, particularly the UK, has gone off the rails, the foundations having been undermined by the intelligentsia.Thus we get a vast range of topics: the downsides of the benefits culture, Shakespeare on evil, what was wrong with Virginia Woolf, the moral decline evidenced by the acceptance of DH Lawrence as a writer of literature, Art losing its way, Paris and its no go zones, Havana and the evil of communism - Marx and Turgenev are nicely contrasted. But we also get treated to contemporary themes - the mass hysteria over the death of the Princess of Wales, Drugs and why they ought not to be legalised and the crisis in Islam heralding its downfall rather than its revival and the eating habits of the poor across different cultural communities in the UK and two very unpleasant chapters on the Wests and Ian Huntley (not recommended for the squeamish).Common themes reflected in the essays are:i) man's freedom - we are not predetermined we have choices - the all too easy substitution of depression for simple unhappiness i.e. treating everything as medical rather than accepting that the choices one makes in life affects one's well being. But, as we all have a right to do as we please, this right supersedes the making of any judgement whether acting in such a way is a good or bad thing.ii) Related to i), we are not determined solely by our materiality: \\"Those who think that an understanding of the double helix is the same as an understanding of ourselves are not only prey to an illusion but are stunting themselves as human beings, condemning themselves not to advance in self-understanding but to a positive retrogression\\".iii) the elevation into our society of non-judgementalism as the gold standard of morality: \\"When young people want to praise themselves, the describe themselves as \\"nonjudgemental\\". For them the highest form of morality is amorality.iv) the line separating good from evil goes right through every human heart.v) it is only by becoming civilised that men become fully human and yet even the notion of civilisation is rejected by the intelligentsiavi) the vulgarisation and unbridled hedonism now prevalent in UK society - lives lived in the shadow of immediate gratification and coarseness - \\"a life devoted to instant gratification produces permanent infantalisation - \\"Adolescents are precociously adult; adults are permanently adolescent\\" - hospitals \\"where the dying usually depart this world to the sight and sound of drivelling television soap operas\\". As someone who is dying I found that a particularly harrowing thought.vii) the more man controls nature the less he controls himselfviii) the loss of Art's foundations and \\"the romantic cult of the original artist, divorced from his predecessors\\" leading to the nonsensical notion that change equals progress. \\"the deliberation adoption of ugliness and bad taste which characterises British popular culture\\"ix) the damaging effect of political correctness - \\"the violence that it does to people's souls by forcing them to say or imply what they do not believe but must not question - we have willingly adopted the mental habits of people who live under a totalitarian dictatorship\\"x) the state as patron giving us pocket money after taking every thing in taxes - the degradation and lack of self respect engendered by the benefits culture.xi) the burgeoning of the celebrity culture which is a \\"disguised worship of our own, generally uncultivated, tastes and desires\\"xii) the loss of stoicism and self-deprecation by the Brits and the replacement by sentimentalism and coarse shallowness.xiii) \\"Evidence of sexual chaos is everywhere\\" and \\"gross precocity followed by permanent adolescence and a premature world-weariness\\" - \\"personal whim\\" determining sexual conduct.xiv) the tensions within Islam due to the fact that Islam was founded on the basis that spiritual and secular authority would be one, inevitably leading to tensions for adherents in the West where there is a clear divide between Church and State. The unwillingness of muslims to take on board criticism of the Koran or of Islamic culture. The author notes and this surprised me that muslims are more widely represented in British jails than are Hundus and Sikhs. Curiously the author sees the upsurge in violence as the beginning of decline in Islam rather than its growth.Anyway, I would highly recommend this book - the author is a deep thinker and apparently has no axe to grind -for one, he is not a theist and this, in my view, makes his comments more important as the represent an objective analysis of the state of the nation."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"I usually do not mark in my books out of respect for, almost veneration of, books.

Told in a series of vignettes, Dr. Dalrymple has an incredible ability to make profound observations and express them in clear, concise statements of fact. I commiserated with the author on numerous occasions, myself, a teacher in an urban public high school. Over my last 14 years in the \\"hood\\", I've witnessed first hand the erosion of family and civility, replaced with the escalation of violence and profanity. The reasons for this decay are obviously manifold, which is why Dalrymple approaches the problem with a series of witty and truly insightful essays on a variety of topics. If you are a person who actually works with and tries to help our society's lower class- not merely \\"theorizing\\" about them from the safe confines of our nation's universities and suburbs- you will really take this book to heart. It is also excellent reading for anyone wanting to get a good look at the ramifications our current social programs and the degradation of much of our culture in general."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Good points:1. This book can be read out of order, and that's great. If I'd started on the first half of the book, I would never have made it through the other chapters.2. In some ways, with his good and careful use of words, Dalrymple reminds me of what Eric Hoffer might have sounded like if he had written much longer books.3. This is the last Dalrymple book that I'll read. So, the secondhand price on this book was enough to make me not regret the mistake of purchasing this book. A relatively cheap lesson.Bad points:1. His musings on art were just a bit......babbly. He's made the same mistake that a lot of environmentalists make when he elevates matters of preference in art to matters of morality. So, some people are not interested in Shakespeare, but I don't believe that that symbolizes the moral decline of a whole society.2. Come to think of it, his moralizing tone gets a bit annoying all the way through the book. Something that he has not considered (in his chapter on the case against legalization of drugs) is that the precise reason for legalization would be that a cost-benefit analysis (i.e., the DIRECT OPPOSITE of a moral analysis) can demonstrate that the benefits would exceed the cost.3. The fact that people can write books like Eric Hoffer and write them with many fewer words shows that this author could have done the same.4. A lot of the genesis of the things that he says has made the world ready to come to an end have started in academia. But then, the author sounds just like an academic. (\\"Everything 'out there' is so much better than everything 'in here.'\\") Could it be that the logical end of all the complaining that intellectuals from past generations did now is the extant circumstances that the author is complaining about now?5. A lot of stuff, he REALLY doesn't know what he is talking about. Um, Italy cleaner than Britain? Page 199 he babble on about the British trade deficit being because British people can't manufacture anything of quality. Um, trade deficits occur because of an excess of investment over saving.6. The author shows his true colors as a pompous jackass when he attacks Elton John's performance at the Princess of Wales funeral (phrases like \\"lugubrious booby\\" and \\"bathetic dirge\\" were the anvil that broke the camel's back). It was just a funeral and it was just a man performing a song as a tribute to his friend. No more, no less. Sorry, I know that you want to whine about Britain, but can you find something that might actually be relevant to whine about?7. The author offers NO solutions of any of the problems that he whines about, ad nauseum.8. There is just too much overlap (both in content and in tone) with the last book of Dalyrmyple's that I read (\\"Life at the Bottom\\").Bottom line, save your money. If you want to read a better book about the theme of social decline, then I recommend that you read Heather MacDonald's \\"The Burden of Bad Ideas\\" or \\"The Quest for Cosmic Justice\\" by Thomas Sowell. Those books are a lot better written and engaging."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"It's true, and Primo Levi & Dalrymple share the same shortcoming..."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"On p. 64, the author refers to Virginia Woolf as a \\"thoroughgoing philistine of the most revolutionary and destructive type, quite prepared to bring the temple crashing down about her ears that her grudges might be paid back.This probably captures better than any review his relationship with and understanding of our culture. He gets it wrong in just about every way possible.Later, in pointing out the undeniable shortcomings of Lady Chatterley's lover he is on common and well-trod ground. When he dismisses Lawrence as a writer on the basis of these faults, and completely ignoring works such as \\"Sons and Lovers\\" and \\"Women in Love\\", his credibility disappears.Even with Kinsey, who can be legitimately criticised for many faults, to dismiss him as one who discovered that \\"all orgasms were created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights\\" is to trivialise what might have been valuable commentary with a cheap gibe.Through much of his writing a strain of sexual disgust or at least extreme discomfort persists, as when he likens the legalisation of marijuana to legalising public displays of necrophilia, on the grounds that neither harms anybody.When, too, he characterises John Money, a defender of pedophilia, as the multiculturalist of sex, I have to presume there is an assumed sexual monoculturalism which is not perverted.Does he in fact believe there is only one \\"right\\" way: say, uncontracepted, heterosexual, missionary-position sex, carried out by white couples, quite literally, in the dark.His essay on Macbeth, however, and his image of the line of evil drawn, not between races or peoples or neighbourhoods, but through the centre of every individual, was by a long way the most powerful of the collection, and his choice of telling anecdote throughout is often brilliant, but the overall impression I have of the author is something of a cross between Cassandra and Curmudgeon, with a strong admixture of Chicken Licken."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Yes, his prose is very good, but one rather gets the suspicion his thesaurus is dog-eared, tattered, and otherwise very much in use throughout the writing of this book. I do like the format of varied and numerous essays, on a broad array of issues; it makes it perfect for submitting to measured doses of Dalrymple's screed, whenever and how often one chooses. Reading this in just a few sittings would be far too depressing and laborious, I feel. Good addition to the conservative portion of one's library, however."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"Who wants to bet that the author's favorite word used to describe members of the lower classes is \\"oiks\\"?I think I'll win that one.As I have noted before in reviewing other polemical tracts that toss around the words \\"liberal elites\\" a lot, just replace that phrase with \\"Jews\\" and see if you still like what the author has to say.To blame social welfare programmes for \\"The Decline Of Western Civilization\\" is just really, let's admit it, a little silly."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"While somewhat engaging as a personal essayist, what we have here with the author is demi- \\"failure to communicate.\\" Put simply, he outputs, but the input is misinterpreted. Like so many other examples to cite -- see the movie The Last King of Scotland, for example -- Dalrymple is a typical \\"No Nothing\\" whose personal experiences negate any semblance of \\"liberal/humanist\\" philosophy and replace it with \\"oh me, oh my, give me discipline or give me death.\\" So many contemporaries flip from one extreme to another, crying in their private wildernesses (which they interpret as The World, or Life As We Know It) that everything is going to Hell in a handbasket. Either \\"liberal\\" or \\"conservative\\" extremists get their switches flip to the opposite extreme when their personal experiences make them detour off the chosen path. Usually, it's the same old tune of \\"if we could only go back to the solid values like band concerts in the park, everyone going to church on Sunday morning, and giving those lazy 'kids' a hard smack (or tight hug), then everything would be nice again.\\"Relatively cogently written though these essays may be, they are skewed with \\"preaching to the choir\\" polemics and a failure to escape the \\"let's flog the future because the past is innocent\\" adolescent reasoning. Sorry, Mr. Dalrymple, you receive neither cigar nor Kewpie doll for your effort. I recommend instead readers check out the far more inciteful \\"Volataire's Bastards\\" by John Ralston Saul."},{"Title":"Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses","review":"It's rare you see such gushing praise for an essay collection, more impressive is the average length of these Amazon reviews.

Sure, sometimes it is good but these lopsided views.... he is as focused on discontent as he is verbose.If that sounds good to you, buy this book..... most people have stuff to do."},{"Title":"Jamming the Media","review":"In his book, Jamming the Media: A Citizen's Guide Reclaiming the Tools of Communication, Gareth Branwyn writes about an alternative media, a Do It Yourself (DIY) media, where everybody can produce high quality messages from their desktops. He talks about every kind of medium from zines, which are noncommercial amateur publications, to the most modern multimedia technologies. In every chapter, he provides a \\"starter kit and resources\\" section to encourage the reader to experiment with the making of zines, music recordings, multimedia CD-ROMs, WebPages, TV, films, videos, radio and other kinds of bizarre media.The media, as an institution, have changed their role to an interactive, public access space where everybody can participate. With passion and a particular writing style, Branwyn gives the recipe, step by step, of how to design, produce, package, distribute and promote written, audio, visual and even animate messages. Moreover, he opens the reader's mind to create a new kind of message full of feelings and expressions that crosses the barrier of conventional and commercial media. Talking about media pranks and art hacks, Branwyn affirms: \\"Anything that's out of the ordinary or worthy of a sound bite will find its way into the local and national media (albeit shoved into a little suffocating compartment)\\" (p. 248).The author introduces his book giving an explanation on how the development of new technologies has contributed to the creation of powerful personal computers that can now be used as \\"a full-color publishing house, a broadcast-quality TV studio, a sound recording studio, or an island in the digital oceans of the cyberspace\\" (p.13). He then talks about zines, as an easy and funny way to get on the bus in this DIY media. Starting with a brief history of the print media, he tells some anecdotes about how \\"Factsheet Five\\", the mother of all zines, started as a two-sheets zine, distributed among twenty-five people, and converted into a nation-spread zine that can also be found over the internet. But Gareth Branwyn not only lays in theory. As in every chapter, when talking about zines, he develops \\"The Zine Hacker's Starter Kit\\", where he teaches many different ways of how to create a homemade a zine or other types of media with a very low budget. Other interesting sections are \\"Words of Wisdom\\", where specialists about each topic give advice on how can you communicate a message in a properly way, and \\"Resources\\", a practical guide with books, directories, catalogs and net sites, where the reader can learn more about each subject.But DIY media applies not only to print or visual media, but also to the audio. \\"Never Mind the Music Biz\\" is the chapter where the author discusses DIY tape recording as an accessible way of self-publishing music productions. Musicians can now stop their search for big record companies to finance their projects. Instead, they can not only produce but also distribute their recordings by mail and by on-line sites (Web Pages with downloadable samples). Furthermore, he introduces other kinds of unconventional audio recordings as audio zines, which are compilations of music, rants, poetry, essays and other sounds.Talking about audiovisual media, the author also has the answers to how to make high-quality multimedia, like CD-ROMs and broadcast media, like TV, video and film. To combine interactive text, sounds, video, animations and images, Branwyn proposes the CD- ROM. \\"It's like touring an art gallery\\" (p. 130), he affirms. Thanks to the use of multimedia technologies, an art multimedia publication, can become a fascinating documentary about the authors life, with video or audio interviews, entertaining games, an original soundtrack and even an interactive paint program. In addition, the CD-ROM technology \\"is moving into hybrid media\\" (p. 129), where the disc's content can be combined with on-line data. TV, video and film production, is another type of affordable media for the public. There is a big movement of amateur artists who are proud of making great movies with very low-budgets. Branwyn can convince anybody with some interesting ideas to communicate, to become one of those. One more time, he has all the answers to jump into the visual medium.Finally, \\"Media Pranks and Art Hacks\\" is an interesting chapter were for Gareth Branwyn, the art and different ways of communication have no frontiers. As an example, he talks about \\"mail art\\", a kind of noncommercial art that consists in sending a letter to many diverse regions, allowing \\"people from diverse cultures and walks of life to share art, ideas, and information through the postal system\\"(p. 270).I consider Jamming the Media a powerful handbook that should be read by anyone both in and out the communications business. Branwyn theory about how today's technology is reshaping traditional media culture is completely right. People can now open their minds in order to change their role from passive receivers, to active communicators. At least it was able to open mine. My next step is to install an old computer in my room in order to have a server where I can have my own Web Pages and distribute my neighbor's music band over the Internet. Moreover, it encourages me to continue producing short documentaries and enriching my experience in the audiovisual field. Furthermore, I particularly enjoy the author's writing style, with a clear use of the language, a particular bizarre vocabulary and a really attractive design."},{"Title":"Jamming the Media","review":"Jamming the Media is packed with concise, useful information. The format of the book is designed to treat media types in a consistent fashion. At the end of each chapter, Branwyn offers starter Kits and Resources. The information is invaluable. An excellent writing style, cool format, and great references make this book a nice addition for anyone with an interest in media.Topics covered: zines, music, multimedia, broadcasting (&quot;pirate radio&quot;), shortwave listening, media pranks -- this is a funny chapter, and electronic publishing.The book was nothing like I expected. I expected a traditional treatment of using the media. Instead, this book has helped open whole new avenues of media expression. The book is not a how to manual; it is a how to think manual.

Instead of focusing on only one technology, Branwyn steps back and shows how people are remaking the culture by using all the newly cheap technologies to wrest control of the media from corporations and governments. This is no left-wing rant. Real economic realities underly the changes that we are seeing. When you add the fact of the one world economy and the glue of the Internet/email/Web you have a prescription for a phenomenon that will transform the world radically in the coming decades. Just like cheap and loud electric instruments helped change world culture, so cheap media of all kinds are the tools that people will use to remake the world. Branwyn saw it first. This book will go down as one of those prophetic texts that will be studied in school - not just for the subject matter, but for how an anylyst makes sense of a rush of events that seems to many disconcerting. Branwyn, like MCI, proclaims: Is this a great time, or what? This is the first book you should read - before Dyson, Negroponte and all those blatherers the mainstream media has chosen to put in the digerati pantheon. They have great marketing machines. Branwyn has the goods. Particularly recommended for management people in all large businesses - in a world in which ATT recently bought out 15,000 managers, you need to know why.

Dreams of success, selling out, conspiracies on drugs and assault, these are just few of many crazy things that occur from the characters in 'dis Amerimanga, characters consisting of playaz, playa'-haters, wannabes, cops, a foreign mafia, and plenty of Bs and Hs to go around. Man, I'd never realize that it was such a shallow and down-in-the-gutter city the people live in, if it wasn't for 'dis GN.I kinda have mixed feelings with tha' art style of \\"@large\\". I do love the graffiti style that Ahmed did with 'da characters and the whole thing, it's a fresh style of its own, I got no problems with the look. It's just that because of the graffiti style, at certain pages in the book, it's kinda hard to tell if I'm looking at a brotha' or a brick wall; comparing a background to the character is a rap battle that's just too much for one guy to take part of comprehending.Y'know, as much as I love hip-hop music and Hoke's concept on life on the streets, \\"@large\\" doesn't really make much of a breakthrough on anything. Sure, this is the start of 'hip-hanga', but \\"@large\\" is as inspirational as 'The Wash'. My beef with this GN is 'dat there's nothing fresh in the depth of the story. All the characters are categorized, but not as ubiquitous as real-life civilians dealin' with L.A. I mean, where's the hot 20-sumthin' selling herself to support her child? Where's the teen dealing with abuse from his/her father? Where's the white guy wantin' to be a rapper? Where's the guy who cares nothing more than to do his best to keep his small business alive?

Who determines this?Is sex performance/genre any more or less ethical than other performance style? Is it less or more powerful?Why is Western society so uncomfortable with its own sexual expression and choices?Desire is desire is desire...the hierarchy of desire......at the top, of course is the most accepted form, heterosexual monogamous coupling. Below this and in declining order resides queer desire, desire expressed in S/M, masturbation, desire aided by pornography or sex toys, promiscuous desire or more than one partner at a time, desire for partners from different generations, and desire expressed or fulfilled via commercial sex (Lockford 61).Lesa Lockford explores the physiological, psychological, sexual, and social feminine identity today's Western culture within her dissertation. Lockford interweaves humorous stories with first hand accounts in an academic method known as autoethnography, which breaches the line between feminist verses patriarchal points of view. She explores the social and cultural paradigms of feminine behavior as a result of women's physiology, and sexuality.\\"To be a feminist, one has first to become one\\". Commonly referred to as \\"consciousness raising,\\" this process of profound personal transformation\\" entails self-reflexivity and the development of solidarity with other women [regardless of sex or gender]...this transformative experience \\"goes far beyond the sphere of human activity we regard ordinarily as \`political'\\": indeed it manifests itself in everyday performances of self: In the course of undergoing the transformation to which I refer, the feminist changes her behavior: She makes new friends: she responds differently to people and events; her habits of consumption change; sometimes she alters her living arrangements or, more dramatically, her whole style of life. Becoming a feminist then is the embodying of the maxim \\"the personal is political\\" (Lockford 32).The social implications and expectancies constructed by our predominantly patriarchal and sexually inhibited culture renders women sensitive to issues of appearance, identity, and sexual confidence. She explores the most baring of feminine issues: from the humbling system of weight loss...to the allure of make-up and a girl stuffing her bra...to the public politeness of sexless/fearing academic circles... to the independence of a confident stripper and exploration of herself as a performance artist.The subordination of women by men is pervasive, that it orders the relationship of the sexes in every area of life, that a sexual politics of domination is as much in evidence in traditionally private spheres of the family, ordinary social life, and sexuality as in the things we do in the traditionally public spheres of government and the economy. The belief that the things we do in the bosom of the family or in bed are either \\"natural\\" or else a function of the personal idiosyncrasies of private individuals is held to be an \\"ideological curtain that conceals the reality of women's systematic oppression. (Lockford 32-3)By society's everyday actions and words, women are dictated on how they should behave: by what we have been taught and how we are expected to behave, determines our power and the way we are perceived in society and our culture. When a woman undermines the primary social power's expectations, she becomes an outcast, a renegade, a delicious forbidden fruit.The persuasiveness of objectification...time to start the music...Lockford explores how \\"we women experience our agency and constitute our subjectivity given the persuasiveness of objectification\\" (x). The most extreme objectification situation she discovers and experiments with herself is inside sexual performance. She then discovers that society underestimates the true power of the sexual performance, and that the labels of objectification are misplaced. She then questions society itself and the labels we place upon ourselves as a result of other's expectations and \\"moral\\" implications.Claiming space and giving voice to our perspectives was and is a vital touchstone for the development of empowered being and for revalorizing what traditionally has been considered important in the world (x).I think we are approaching a time where the emphasis of the individual is becoming the forefront of intellectual and social accpetance. Perhaps this makes me idealistic, a liberal feminist, etc. I choose individualism, and this book definitely breaks the ice on feminist theory and sexual performance."},{"Title":"Adjacent Lives","review":"This is a very beautiful book. A translator takes an evening class in art history forsix years in a row. She and the professor fall in love. The book is very beautifullywritten and very realistic."},{"Title":"One Minute Scolding","review":"This was one of two books that made a big impact on me as a parent. (The other was \\"How to Talk So Kids Will Listen.\\") I was determined not to go down the path of screaming and smacking, but that is easier said than done. When I lose it, it's generally because I feel like I'm in a corner and have to do SOMEthing--even if it's wrong. With \\"The One Minute Scolding,\\" I always knew what to do. I wasn't tempted to keep threatening instead of taking action, since it only took one minute.You need to follow the directions--there's a joke around my house about the \\"10-minute scolding,\\" because sometimes we would get carried away. But believe me, one minute is longer than it sounds--long enough to make a real impact on a child. It also forces you to pay attention and \\"catch\\" your kids doing something right, so you can mention it during the next One-Minute Scolding.The best thing about the One-Minute Scolding is that it never makes things worse. Sometimes it works like a charm; other times, it has less impact. However, it never escalates things. That in itself is a blessing.Buy a used copy if you can, and I hope this book goes back in print, because it's much needed. I see the author has some newer books out (\\"The One-Minute Mother\\" and \\"The One-Minute Father\\"). I haven't read them, but if it's by Spencer Johnson, how bad can it be?Good luck, parents!"},{"Title":"One Minute Scolding","review":"Very effective. I used it on my daughter when she was 4 y.o., now 8, and it has really worked. I liked that it got the point across of why she was being scolded and at the same time it ended in a very positive way. In such a way that I even became closer to my child and she felt better about herself. Come to think of it, nowadays, I hardly even need to scold her."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I first read Alice's Adventures when I was about nine or ten years old, and you know what? I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book. The edition to get is one with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"'The Annotated Alice' with annotations done by Math and Games writer, Martin Gardiner may be the first, and is certainly the best known annotated edition of a popular classic, followed by annotations of other major popular classics such as the complete Sherlock Holmes and 'The Hobbit'.It is especially interesting to compare the Alice stories with Tolkien's novels, as both series of works are enhanced by their authors' love and professional involvement with language studies. The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you long to be carried away to a world of nonsense and magic, talking beasts and flowers then Alice is the best tour guide you can employ. This is a book that will find a place close to the heart of a reader of any age that has a place inside reserved for whimsy and childlike wonder. As Alice travels through Wonderland and meets many unexpected characters your imagination will soar. Run a race with a dodo bird. Have tea with the doremouse and his friends the mad hatter and the march hare. Thrill at the &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. Alice proves to be a very level headed young lady indeed as she encounters things that become &quot;curiouser and curiouser!&quot; The story meanders through forests and chessboards that are life size never ceasing to amaze the reader with charm and wit. Lewis Carroll completed a masterpiece of fantasy and social comentary in this classic tale. The book is truly a gift to any one who hopes to hold onto childhoods magic."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful, lovely dust jacket, interesting illustrations, it is almost too big to casually read and is more of a coffee table book. It was bought as a companion to a collectable given as a Christmas present. The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have grown up watching Disney's Alice in Wonderland, and knowing what liberties Disney is known to take in their movies, I wanted to read the original story for myself.And I'm glad I did. Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk? Because it can produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front. That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares. And those monstrous ear worms.-carli"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

It can be read and enjoyed by all ages, but I think the subtleties can be best enjoyed by those who are a bit older e.g. the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, the croquet game featuring the Queen of Hearts etc. I was reminded of how much the tea party reminded me of a previous job that I had involving a variety of board members.I guess there is only only one word to describe this classic, 'timeless'."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"THIS IS A BOOK WICH ONE SHOULD ANALYSE FOR ONESELF!And NO, one cannot overanalyse this book, the symbols in it are like the branches of a tree.

As she comes across each of the weird and wonderful creatures - like the White Rabbit, the Duchess and Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the March Hare, Mad Hatter and Doormouse, the Gryphon and Mock Turtle, and the Queen and her court (as the Gryphon reminds us: \` It's all her fancy-that-They never executes nobody you know'.),creatures which are indeed rather argumentative and none too helpful to Alice's confusion, there is also a new story, a new song or game.We learn that the real wonderland is the mind of a child, and the happy carefree long, summer days of innocence in which Alice dreamed her dream."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"completely imaginative, creative, and individual.. there are so many signs and contexts that i originally as a child completely overlooked that are funny, serious, and inspirational! and you got to love the riddles!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This was a remarkable book. Truly amazing. It has inspiried so many people, and even those in my acting school who didn't see much more than the Disney movie were moved by it. And to those who say it was confusing and full of nonesense, I have an explanation. The story was made up by Carroll on a boat ride to Alice Liddell and her other two sisters. Alice wanted to hear a story with lots of nonesense, and that's what Carroll did. If you still do not get it, I can't put it any more clearly. If you need help understanding the books, buy volumes such as the Annotated Alice and other books that explain Carroll's work. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It's difficult to critique a classic, especially one as well-known as this one, so I have decided to take a different path and strongly recommend this work to all aspiring fantasy authors.Rather than becoming absorbed/obsessed with the works of Tolkein or Jordan, take a long and critical look at this masterpiece.A fantasy, first and foremost, must be fantastic, and Lewis Carroll evokes the fantastic and surreal beautifully without sacrificing that centerpiece of drama known as characterization. The novel's constructs are mind-bending and dizzying; the novel is truly fit for Wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is genius (in a nonsensical sort of way).

It's so magically written, I recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh or perhaps likes everything that makes no sence what so ever!!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an extraordinary book that mixes the world of imagination and the world of reality. It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body. Carroll also included illustrations of the important scenes of the story, so the reader would be able to understand them better. This story perfectly explains the racing imagination of a child in a light-hearted and imaginative way."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The pink flamingos are adorable, which makes it all the more disappointing when they start rubbing off from the second you remove the price sticker."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews.Alice is an inquisitive, and very brave girl, who observes the world around her, and attempts to understand what is happening and how to handle it.

That said, I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan and certainly don't have a lack of imagination, even at 27. Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M.

Frank Baum, Beatrix Potter, Roald Dahl, the Grimm brothers, etc."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I just finished reading \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There\\" in two days. There's a reason why these stories are considered classics.

A smoking caterpillar and a disappearing cat may be absurd, but they're really imaginative. And I do believe that \\"Wonderland\\" and \\"Looking-Glass\\" are open to interpretation, since the word play and the riddles found here are too silly to be scientific.I don't mind Hugh Haughton's annotated texts, as long as just enjoy reading these two children's tales peacefully.A"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a complex book disguised as a childrens book.

It's not cleverness - its just randomness disquised as cleverness. It just tosses a bunch of nothing together, shakes it up, mixes in a curious and rude little girl who's rudeness pales next to the characters she encounters in Wonderland. Those thousand monkeys at typewriters would produce something along these lines before getting to Shakespeare. For some reason, I never read this when I was discovering Narnia or Oz. Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to. Wonderland isn't even a world much less a persuasive daydream. Nothing there matters. And Alice just skips off at the end, leaving her sister to forecast a bit of standard drivel about the day when they will be grownups but always have their childhood inside. Meh."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking glass are two interesting stories. When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story. I found both stories a challenging read, and was relieved when the book was finally over!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I ordered the Penguin Classics version of this book, and the seller shipped me the Signet Classics version."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Ugh, I found both \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" & \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" to be thoroughly frustrating and painstaking to read.

There were several times that I had wanted to stop reading each novel, but persevered only because I wanted to see why these two novels are such beloved classics.However, I don't understand why these two novels are so beloved.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me. The only point I got from it was an internal conflict of whether to take one road or not, like whether to take and drink certain things and what she should do with the moment."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S. Lewis on cheap drugs. The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth. I know it is considered a classic but I just do not see it, and if I did not have to read it for school I would not have bothered to finish it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)Through the Looking GlassThough this book is not much better than Alice's Adventures, the chess motif and theme does make the book much more interesting. With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure. I also appreciated the linking of the cat at the beginning and end of the story.It does still feel like Carroll did way too many opium pipes in his time.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am sure this book must be beautiful but I never received it from this seller.

Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence!

The book was also in very good condition and I will deffinatly be ordering from here agin."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alices' adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass written by Lewis Carroll and is illustrated by John Tenniel is a story that has lived on and is enjoyed by both young and old. The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows? If you haven't read this book yet then pick it up and read it no matter how young or old you are in age."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I thought it was funny and entertaining, but to be honest I was expecting something in the line of a masterpiece and I'm a little disappointed. The story is amazingly childish and crude and the worthwhile parts are very distinct and separate from the rest of the lackluster story. Still, the wordplay is ingenious and the book is an all around treat."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Believe it or not, there was a time when the world was seen as a place where imagination had no place. It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns. A good read if you're tired of the machinization of any age and need to have some good old fashion unpredicatable fun!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I must confess I had never read the account of Alice's adventures before. As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before. This is the sign of marvelous talent and proves that he is one of the best authors and story tellers ever."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book ''Alice in Wonderland Through The Looking Glass'' was an interesting book. I liked the book because it had neat words to learn and also the pictures were very well in illustration. My favorite part in the book was when she met the catipillar. That was my favorite part because he was so calm the way that the author wrote, and he also described the catipillar's actions very well. The ending was nice because it was just good to know she got what she wanted.

Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around.

Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland. As I got older, I realized that I truly did not know much about the plot line or the author of these stories. My cousin gave me this book for my birthday and I recently finished both the tales.

I was not happy with this book, and would not recommend it to anyone if you enjoy \\"normal\\" size print. This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Oh, how I long for those days of innocence, when I could trust in all that I held dear and holy. When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really. Um... so... anything you want to tell me about \\"The Jungle Book\\"?[The review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine, Issue 2.]"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I'm going to assume that we've all read and loved Alice's Adventures, and focus instead on reviewing this gorgeous edition. The design of this novel is exquisite. I ordered Alice as a test case - I desperately want to own the entire Coralie Bickford-Smith line for Penguin, but wanted to ensure the books are well made. From the outside, they're stunning. It feels good in my hands, the color is fantastic, and the graphics are so well-selected. My gripe is with the spine of the book, which is almost too tight - these aren't the most comfortable editions to read without cracking the spine.

The imagination used to create this story is genius, if you are going to see the movie than take the time to find out what made this classic story timeless."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a literary classic which has had a vast influence on many writers after Lewis Carroll's time. One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel's classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice's adventures there."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Of course the story is fun but I don't like the way the ebook is formatted and there's no Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a book that seems to stay with what Lewis Carroll wanted these books to be.

There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter. Buy this book for yourself, or for your child, or your friend, or whomever...anyone with a sense of humor and fantasy will delight in these two classic, unforgettable tales."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book in my opinion. I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself. With all of the facts that I just stated, my conclusion is that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book and I would recommend it to any readers that would like to know about a little girl and her bizarre and exciting adventures in wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in wonderland is a great story for all ages. it is full of adventure.

Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues). The drawings by Tenniel are brilliant and add the right flavor to the story.

Whenever as an adult I'd hit a snag and couldn't read, I would always pull out this one and it would put me back on track again. Another I will treasure for the memories of sharing it with my kid."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was an interest in my eyes. It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics.

The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up.

Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading. AIW and TTLG are must-haves in anyone interested in fantasy/sci-fi, along with Chronicles of Narnia and other great classics."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll. The book itself is not worth your money. The text and margins are very small and do not seem well centered on the page. The font is simple and ugly. The spine of the book is completely white and doesn't have the title of the book or author listed. It may be superficial, but how do you recognize this book on a bookshelf? Overall, the book is very cheap and thrown together. Get a nicer version that also has the original illustrations by John Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book.

My review is about this specific Hallmark Edition book.It's difficult to find a nice hardcover version of both stories complete with the original illustrations. the illustrations are either poor quality, or are reduced in number. This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at. This book is bound nicely and will make a great addition to any library or collection."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are probably some of the most famous children's books in the English anguage. There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet.

I think that it is a perfect book to read to children. The language was clear enough for me to understand, and I am not a native English speaker, so it would be easy for a child to understand.

Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent.

Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her.

I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought. It may be that Through the Looking Glass was a better dream narrative (it certainly seemed a good example of the kind of play young children engage in), but I still had a hard time reading it."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have an avid young reader in my family and it is not always easy to guess what kind of book she may enjoy.

Originally published under the titles Alice's Adventures Underground and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, these books were the work of an Oxford mathematician named Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, using the pen-name of Lewis Carroll. According to Charles H. Sylvester (editor of Journeys through Bookland): \\"One day . . . he took three of his little friends, Alice and Edith and Lorina Liddell, for a trip up the river, and on that afternoon he began telling them about Alice and her Wonderland, continuing the story on other occasions. He had no intention of making a book, but the story pleased little Alice and her sisters so well that they talked about it at home and among their grown-up friends, who finally persuaded the author to have it printed.\\" Note: Songs are composed by Field, although the opening poem \\"All in the Golden Afternoon\\" is missing from this recording.

This latest version is ok, and it's brand new but not what I was expecting, what I was expecting was there there would be the usual 19th drawings of Alice, the rabbit, and all the other characters would be there, but unfortunately there are no drawings. It's sadly missing a good part of the charm of the other editions I read and have owned. I currently have a lovely complete works of Lewis Carroll leather bound which includes Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass, with the original drawings which I've had in every edition I've ever had including other paperback versions, but sadly not this one, if I'd realized that this one was missing such an essential ingredient as the drawings, I wouldn't have bought this particular edition. I bought it with the assumption that it had the usual charming Victorian drawings that every other edition hardback or paperback has it, but as my other copies of Alice have disappeared, and the leather bound edition is too frail to sit down and read, I'll make do with this one, but I'm not happy with it.I think may well send it back, and get another with the drawings."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fun and pleasant reading. The book allows the reader to enter into Alice's mind and travel along with her through the worderful and mysterious Wonderland. Alice is a curious and questioning little girl traversing a land where nonsense is the common-sense, where right is wrong and where wrong is not always right (but can be sometimes!). This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book. Moreover, all this is presented by the most unusual characters in a rich text, often mixing prose and verse and sometimes toying with typography in a e. e. cummings-like nature, which makes the book quite unique."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice in wonderland starts when Alice finds a white rabbit.

I could read it many more times because the author paints a vivid picture in your mind that places you in Wonderland along with all of the delightful characters including Alice. The description in the book starts out strong and ends up even stronger. The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far.

It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a classic that all young spirited people should read. It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him. I always saw the movies but this was the first I actually read the book. I thought it quite better than any of the movies. The fact that it inspires my nephew to read is a wonderful achievement.For those who love adventure books with very little sex, profanity or graphic violence, then I'd reccomend The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This book was another of my nephew's favorites as well as some teens that I'm acquainted with. I liked it as well. He's a new author, but writes a good tale."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This was a wonderful book for all ages to enjoy. Alice is certainly a girl everyone can relate to. She is curious, well educated, and will always be remebered be anyone who reads the book. Alice's adventures are tons of fun, the wonderful pictures tell us exactly what is in wonderland and what it looks like. The characters created be Lewis Carroll are fantastic, you can see people of all shapes and sizes. You can see many people such as the King and Queen of Hearts and the Duchess, but mostly you see many creatures roaming around. There is the white rabbit who wears a waist coat, or the caterpillar who sits on a mushroom, or the beloved Cheshire Cat: a cat who causes mischief wherever he goes, he also has the talent of dissapearing and reapearing. This is a beautiful book full of of magic, fun, laughter, mischief, and of course wonder."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"You can't go wrong if you're on a budget and want this absolutely delightful classic for all ages."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This masterpiece is one of those brilliant books that keeps your attention the whole way through, and you never want it to end. I have read many books, and very few have had the impact on me like this one has. The book has an obvious connection with drug use, but that is not what the book is all about. It is like a beautiful and enjoyable nightmare that you will always remember and adore."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I thought Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was what the Disney movie was based on, and Through the Looking Glass was another adventure she had. But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again. I am glad to have read them, though, as Alice's tale is a classic one."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have been reading some chapter books with my preschooler and she has really enjoyed it. I thought I would try this one since she was interested after meeting Alice at Disney. She loves the pictures and the book is very nice, but it is a little hard for her to follow at this age. I think we will put it away and try it again in a few years, when she can get more of the humor in Alice's dialogue with herself and understand the characters a little better."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's adventures in wonderland. Alice was getting tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, when the White rabbit with pink eye's runs by saying \\"Oh Dear! Oh Dear! I shall be too late\\" and as most know Alice follows him down the rabbit hole and curious adventure ensues.The story was ok but obviously geared towards children. I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader. Either that or all of the underlying things were topical and with the book being written in the late 1800's most of those things would have been lost on me.The Good: It was an easy read the characters were quite unusual and Carroll definitely had an imagination.The Bad: besides my thinking it was going to be better than it was not much. It was somewhat confusing at times.Overall it was an Ok read however with all the hype and rumored greatness surrounding the story I was slightly disappointed.Through the looking Glass. The less known second story about Alice is which she enters a looking glass (Mirror) world where you must move in the opposite direction to get where you desire to go. The world is divided into a grid like a checkers or chess board with the ultimate goal is to make it to opposite side of the board and to become a queen.The Good: Same as the first, lots of imagination and unique characters.The Bad: not too much, like the firs it was a little confusing at times.It was Similar to the first with regard of craziness and characters however slightly inferior to the first."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure. I also appreciated the linking of the cat at the beginning and end of the story.It does still feel like Carroll did way too many opium pipes in his time.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained. It did make me appreciate the job Disney did in adapting it to a movie however. I believe he (Disney) captured the images perfectly."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"One of the best books in the world!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I had to read this book for a classic book report. My teacher said it would be a great one to read. If it wasn't so confusing, it would be a great book for younger children. I really didn't enjoy it though, because the lot seemed a little too young for me. Anyone over the age of twelve, might not be interested in it. Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing. On her adventure, she walks through a series of rooms and can't find her way out. Will she ever make it out? Read the boook to find out."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was required reading for one of my present classes, if this had not been the case, I'm certain I would not have finished it for the sake of enjoyment. I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I bought this edition because I was so horribly disappointed with the free version, which had no poetry. I wanted to be able to read the wonderful poems, like The Walrus and the Carpenter. However, this edition has no table of contents, and no index, which means I am unable to search for and go to the places in the book I am interested in. This makes it useless to me.

It's funny, ridiculous, weird, confusing, and VERY much on drugs. I'm sorry... Did you just ask me to eat a mushroom? The many drug references, however, are extremely amusing, and add to the story very much.Alice is asleep and dreaming up a crazy world. The characters she meets are all eccentric, strange, and frightfully funny. Whether we're thinking of the Mad Hatter, the rabbit, or the Queen of Hearts herself, this book is truly a child's happy adventures through a completely ridiculous fictional land (unless you are firm in your belief that this book is completely about drugs, but even then it's still funny and ridiculous).Even though this book is known as a children's book, it is hilarious to all who read it. Enjoy! I just hope you remember to breathe while gasping with laughter."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was so enjoyable! I think that anyone, young or older child, teen, or adult would love every page of it. I felt that it went by fast most of the time, but some parts were repeatable. I almost wish it were a little shorter, like each story only 100 pages so it would go by faster, but it was still very enjoyable. I actually have to say I like 'Through the Looking Glass' the best. I had always thought these were just short childrens books, I was surprised when I found out how big they were! I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'. The end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland' was better because: 1. I read it first, and 2. It was just better and I was very surprised by it (guess I haven't seen the movie \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" in a while!). However, they are both very good stories that anyone would love and I will recomend it for everybody. PLEASE rate if this review was helpful to you. THANK YOU!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is the ultimate children's book. From the beginning when Alice falls down the Rabbit hole and leaves Dinah, it captivates the reader and enchants the reader. Carroll was a master of outlandish and imaginative fiction and this statement is proven when you read this book.Dont listen to any of the 'nonsense' that Alice in Wonderland is based on LSD trips etc. This is nothing but people trying to take away Carroll's genius from him.Great Book."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"'Alice in Wonderland', by Lewis Carroll, is an excellent book for both adults and children. It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read. If you you're read it already, why not read it again?"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Nice presentation of the two books with the classic illustrations.

My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths. These are not so well known."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Its hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this brilliant book. Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

She incounters many people and creatures along the way. She is told many stories and riddles while she travels through wonderland. My favorite thing throughout the story, was when Alice kept saying that she would have to write a book about this place when she got home. Even though it was a dream, Alice still loves her world of non-sense."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll provides us with a twisted view of our worldthat provokes hours upon hours of thought. This novel may seem like anovel for children, however, it is filled with more literary devices than a truck-load of Hawthorne! Beautiful imagery, puns, malapropisms, possible drug innuendoes and grammatical devices make this a masterpiece to be reckoned with. Be prepared for deep thought upon a close examination of this seeming children's novel, because it is certainly a work for the more experienced reader. By far my favorite book!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel! This edition includes all of them and the quality of the reproductions on the pages are excellent. Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This threadbare bargain-priced edition may seem like a deal, but consider before purchasing that it has no table of contents, no introduction, no forward, no illustrations, and no bibliography. Adding insult to injury, the layout of this edition is easily one the worst ever for a reprint, with all words that originally appeared in italics for emphasis printed here in big block caps, as if the typesetting was done by an abrasive kid trying to get attention in an on line chat...IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN.If you really want to explore and experience Lewis Carroll's classic, getThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition-- for the price on Amazon, it's the real bargain.

Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book.

Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age.This particular edition (2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin) also contains several extra \\"goodies\\" in addition to the text of the two books. There is a brief biography of Lewis Carroll, a timeline of his life and career, a fascinating and insightful introduction (well worth the read!), information on various film adaptations, a short story by Carroll - \\"What the Tortoise said to Achilles,\\" commentary on the text by various individuals and publications, and a set of questions designed to aid the reader's thought and analysis of the text. The book also contains all of the original illustrations, which are indispenable to a full enjoyment of the story. Highly recommended to any reader."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When Charles Ludwig Dodgson first began to tell the story of Alice's adventures underground to the three Liddell sisters, he had no idea whatsoever the impact that his work would one day have in the cultural history of humanity. Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. All the poetry was missing from it. I didn't realize it right away until I got to the chapter with the Mock Turtle. So, I came across this version and it was very appealing because I thought I was getting both books for just 99 cents. At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words. Also, this download only has Alice in Wonderland.

But the book is 100% better than any movie.As a writer myself, I can only hope to write a book half as imaginative and charming as this one."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is my favorite book, and it has the sequel Through the Looking glass. This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book. So if you like fantasy and like to have a few laughs, this is the book you have to read!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book. It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting.

One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book.

The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

The order came in time and was brand new as I expected it to be.If you havent read it, you should do so."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll's Alice stories are two of my favorite stories of all time. I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The Constitution does not apply in Admiralty Law and this is where Alice takes us...

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page. Overall this book could use a better plot, but it keeps the reader interested with great characters and odd twists."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"i think this book is very good for girls in my age..because sometimes i also would like to flie out of this stressy world and alice is able to.."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Puchased for my teenage daughter who loves the classics.Book as described - good seller"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school.

If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing.

Recently, I stumbled upon the book and started skimming it and I was completely blown away!!! There are so many brilliant layers of wit and humor between the lines which I never noticed as a kid. There are twists and turns and endless puns and word games with every turn of the page. This is as much a novel for adults as it is for kids, maybe even more so!

When I first read this novel, I wanted to go through the same thing Alice went through in the story.

As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are. Do not miss it, as this is a timeless piece of literature that everyone should definitely read at least once."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion.

I just LOVED the characters that Alice encounters on her adventures and I also loved the story's word-play and witticism.Out of the two stories, Through the Looking Glass, although less famous, is the more linear and I think entertaining but both are amazingly creative and bizarre stories and are both short enough so that they should be read together."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I really like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel because it is so whimsical. The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time. Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original! Truly a classic for the child in all of us!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I would argue that this text offers more than WONDERLAND.

To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work.

I reread this with some trepidation as I remembered reading and enjoying it several times as a child, but was pleasantly surprised to find it just as magical as I did then.I won't bore anyone with the details of the story as I'm sure that most who are reading this review are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed. Those who wish to read a delightful children's story that will enchant and entertain readers young and old need look no further.ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS have very little in the way of plot - little Alice is thrown into a strange world where nothing seems quite right. She changes in size, is confronted by the imperious Queen of Hearts, has tea with a number of quirky characters; each new situation she encounters is \\"curiouser and curiouser\\" than the next. What the stories lack in plot, they make up for twentyfold in character. Carroll created a whimsical world for his young readers, and its charm spills over to entertain even the old.

And I have re-read it at least once a year since.I'm not interested in why it was written or what deep, dark psychological quirks of the author underlie its imagery. It's enough that, from the time I fall down that curious rabbit hole, swim through the sea of tears, dance the lobster quadrille (Can you walk a little faster?), I seem to be retracing every step of my life. Every one of Alice's adventures has its echo in the real world, and they aren't hard to match.So, my much-worn copy sits comfortably on the shelf nearest to hand, and my grandchildren-to-be can expect to find a copy of their own in their very first Christmas stockings.

There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story. Are you willing to go tumbling down the rabbit hole?"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Everyone has been rating this book as a children's book... It was written by an astute mathmatics doctorate Oxford professor. It is a fantastic book for adults to understand the mind of a child."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glassis a FAIR choice - 3 stars. This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland HTML Editionis a POOR CHOICE - 2 stars. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice. Her travels through Wonderland are still lots of fun."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My son stayed at home \\"sick\\" and I said he couldn't watch TV or play computer but he could listen to this audio book.

The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago.

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts. To find out what actually occurred pick up the book and read it. Alice is a young girl who wishes there were more things in life and one day when she was out side with her sister she spots this white rabbit with a coat on and a pocket watch.

Alice has quite an imagination, infact it's her imagination that creates the mad world of Wonderland. It is completely weird, funny, and entertaining. Alice meets with many classic &quot;mad&quot; characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and the mad hatter. this isn't only for children, it is for anybody. it has such a strange story and strange characters it makes Star trek look like Full House(just kidding). This is kind of freaky at some poinys seriously.This also comes with through the Looking Glass(the reason why I took out a star). That was really Dodgsons cry ofr money. (Dodgson was reall lewis Carrols last name. his full name is Charles Dodgson). I would give &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; a 3 out of 5 because it asn't realy as good as the original. The Story of the second one was very thin and stupid...I would reccomend this.~Dan~~~~~~~~~~"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book I read was Alice In Wonderland.The book was about a girl named Alice who had a lot of wonders.Then she went a long,exciting adventurein a world of wonders.She met and saw a lot of interesting things on her journey.I would only recommend this book only to little kids or to people who like fantasy boooks.If you are the ages between one and ten you should read this book.If you are older,this is really not a good book to read."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This marvelous book has become such a part of our culture that it's impossible to separate the phenomenon from the actual work. And perhaps it's folly to even try.I grew up with a hard backed copy of Alice in Wonderland and remember going through the pages countless times, gazing at the magnificent pictures--especially the Jabberwock--and giggling at the poetry. \\"Father William\\" and \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" still occupy parts of my brain as snatches and shards that want to pop out at awkward moments.That battle worn, orange backed book, handed down I'm pretty sure from my Dad, and read by him with equal enthusiasm when he was a kid, is long gone, and now that I'm armed with a Kindle I downloaded a copy to enjoy a fine book from my youth. If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself. As an eco-friendly Kindle purchase, however, I strongly recommend it, and if you've never read it before, well, what are waiting for?"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"So glad to have this book for my library - not sure if I ever read it as a child, but I'm looking forward to reading it this summer at the beach!"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I think this book is very imaginative and fun to read. In the first part where she's in Wonderland she goes through a world of nonsense and is trying to find a way out. In Through the Looking Glass she goes through a mirror into a backwards world. I would encourage anyone to read this book because it encourages people to use their imagination and to learn that stuff happens you just have to find the correct way to deal with it.My favorite character was the Duchess in the first part because she was very annoying and didn't even know it also she has a very comical cook who's obsessed with pepper.

Very irritating.There is really nothing positive to say about this edition, the formatting is about par for a cheap kindle book. It's manageable but disappointing. If I were reviewing \\"Alice in wonderland\\" then I may have given it a 3-star review but as it is was inappropriately titled the entire experience is a disappointment.I wish there was some way to preview Kindle editions (screenshots etc) before purchasing them.

A little girl falls asleep on a hot summer's day and dreams all the rest. I read this when I was a child and still love it. Relating it to drugs, etc., is absolutely absurd! Just goes to show how far our culture has deteriorated (no child likeAlice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glassimagination). The book should be understood \\"as is\\" nothing more, nothing less. It's a wonderfully funny fantasy I love it!! and so does my granddaughter."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is a classic that every person should read. What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life! I strongly recommend getting this version of Carroll's classic story."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass hold a special place in my heart. After my father died almost ten years ago, I purchased a copy for my mother. I suggested she read it and see that Alice, no matter what she went through, how bizarre and disturbing, always found a way to come out on top. She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source. This version is wonderful for the young or the old, as it's LARGE PRINT. I really can't say enough good things about this book. (On an interesting side note, there's a camp of thought about it actually being written by Queen Victoria...)"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It appears that many of the reviewers of this particular edition of the book are not actually reviewing the product. Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child. Taking this perpective, readers will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This Book Brings out the best of both words. It has two stories in one.

I was surprised how short the stories were, having chosen to read this book after reading the Twilight series. I haven't read the added features, just the Advenures and Looking-Glass stories, so I cannot comment on their content. The illustrations were very nice. My only complaint was that the printed text was poorly spaced on the page, the inner edges being close to the center of the book, making it somewhat uncomfortable to read."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is really cool because it has a lot of kid's stories characters like the white rabbit, humpty dumpty, and Alice of course. it would be a good story for like fourth gaders who are barely starting to read chapter books.

It's a thoroughly enjoyable must-read/classic of nonsense and imagination.This Illustrated Junior Library edition (as really all IJL editions) displays and distributes the original Tenniel illustrations awesomely. Great cover!Only one criticism - sometimes these editions don't list the publishing date of the original book which I don't quite understand. Also, because they are junior editions they don't have introductions, give author backgrounds, etc. - although I don't believe any of the IJL editions are abridged except for The Three Musketeers."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Another favourite book from childhood is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (or Alice in Wonderland as it's sometimes called) by Lewis Carroll.The novel was written in 1865 and tells the story of Alice, a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantasy world called Wonderland. Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

Rereading it made me more aware of the intoxicating dreamlike quality of the story line as well as the incredibly tongue-in-cheek writing style. BUT... I was very disappointed to open it and find it contained NO illustrations whatsoever! Reading A.I.W. without the John Tenniel drawings is like eating plain dry bread. I know the drawings by heart so I could imagine them, but it isn't the same. Also -- many many typos! Avoid this edition! I'm going to order a different one right now."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"In my english class we had to pick a foreign author and a book to read. I choose this book because I'd never read it before, I've seen the Disney version of this story but never got around to reading the actual book. I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes. I also enjoyed the poems throughout the story and when characters speak in riddles and ryhmes. The Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter would have to be my favorite characters in this whole story (besides Alice herself). Its a great book and I'd be happy to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I love the Alice books, but this was the first time I read all of them. I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover. Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover.

It is also notated throughout the book, with the explanations of each notation categorized in the back by Book:Chapter:Notation #.The thing that, for me, makes this particular pressing stand out, is not just that everything is all neatly bound together, but I absolutely ADORE the stylish new COVER! In fact, I love ALL the new Penguin Classics series of re-bound classic novels."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland, the classic, thrilling fiction book, by Lewis Carroll, is a story that has intrigued and captivated readers for more than a hundred years. In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from.

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It's amazing that many people have never read this book. After all, it's virtually impossible to find an American unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and the instantly recognizable illustrations. Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats. This is an adult fable. Carroll invites us into his dream, and we share his fantastic experience through the clarity of a writer's genius. Don't skip these books. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It was fun to read this book because so much of what is in here is now in our popular culture today.

I enjoyed all of Carrol's plays on words and grammatical structure."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll managed to get in his own two cents in this book. He wrote this book for his niece (?) but he still weaved in some of his own political beliefs.

In fact, I once tried to read a copy from the 1980's but I couldn't go on with it because the pictures were bothering me. Luckily, there's really only one freaky illustration in the original version, and that's the picture where Alice's neck is very long. It's a bit disturbing.But the book is well written and a good adventure story, too.I love the characters. They're very interesting.\\"'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\\"- \\"The Chesire Cat\\", Alice In Wonderland, by Lewis CarrollCome to think of it, the Chesire cat illustration is actually quite creepy as well. But it's not a big deal or anything.The whole book's just weird fun. Where in the world did Mr. Carroll think of all this? The Mad Hatter? The Queen of Hearts? The Duchess and her pig baby?Alice herself is a considerably strange character.All in all, aside from a couple of creepy illustrations, the book is wonderful. Everyone should read it once in their lifetime---it's worth it."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some ways, then dipped down so suddenly that Alice had no time to think what's was going on before she had founden herself falling down a very deep hole (Pg 2). Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts.

As entertaining and totally bizarre as ALICE is, I can&#8217;t help but wondering if the whole of it is structured in any meaningful way. The experience itself is like a dream, or more probably also like a drug induced high, and the story is infinitely fascinating. It seemed to me (I had never read it as a child) that adults can appreciate this more than a child can, since the child can probably find the plot more humorous than illogical.

At times, the children requested another chapter because the previous one was a bit of a &quot;cliffhanger.&quot; This book makes for a wonderful read-aloud for the 6-10 year old set, and would be enjoyable for a proficient reader to read alone, as well.

George MacDonald later published some children's books of his own including &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and many others which are fantastic and every child should read them.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

Cristeen Latham shows up at Glenpark, a ranch owned by the Donovan family. She is near death, having been shot and beaten. But it takes some time for the Donovan family to find out what happened because when Cristeen awakes, she has amnesia.The Donovan family's faith in God has seen them through a lot and when Cristeen arrives in their life, they don't think twice about helping her. When she asks, they show her the faith they hold in God, trusting in him completely. This story wouldn't be complete though without the developing romance between Christeen and Matt Donovan, the head of the Donovan family. And, how was Cristeen hurt? Is there still danger out there for her? Will her growing faith in God see her through whatever comes her way?Tammy Doherty has written a historical christian based novel that is well written and will be a pleasure for those who look for romances that don't have to explicitly illustrate love scenes to keep a reader's interest. Instead, Doherty takes the time to show the reader what thoughts, prayers and bible passages the characters rely on when faced with their dilemmas. It made these christian characters become more alive for me. Maybe it will for you too.Review by Kathy Brummond of www.BookReview.com"},{"Title":"Celtic Cross","review":"This is wonderful book.

Romance novels are not the type of books I normally read, but this story pulled me in. I finished the last few chapters while I was cooking dinner tonight. Hard to put the book down. A woman arrives at the Donovan ranch. SHe had tied herself to her horse and was near dead. She was beaten and shot, with significant blood loss. The Donovan family takes her in and the healing process begins. With love and humor the ranch owner, Matt Donovan begins to help her recover her memory and heal from her physical wounds. It will take God and a lot of love to heal the deeper wounds of Cristeen's heart. The characters are well developed and I found myself caring for them, and wondering what happened to the evil men who left Cristeen in such a state.I appreciated the way Tammy Doherty wove God in the midst of this crisis for the characters. Each main character had to find a way to come to terms with questions caused by major upheavals in their lives. The questions and concerns are ones that many can resonate with, for we all have had challenges from our past that need to be reconciled by God's love and healing.There was an overshadowing suspense that kept me turning pages and questions that kept my interest.

Her taste for torrid themes, in particular the brutal and bizarre, are well known. &quot;Expensive People&quot;, one of her early works, starts off with a bang. A more direct opening you'll not find. The scene is set. You're instantly captivated and as she reels you in, you succumb and immediately find yourself in Richard Everett's head as he unveils his life story to you...bit by bit. You know you're dealing with dysfunctionality as soon as you meet his parents. There's a seething madness underneath just waiting to get out. If the medium were film, you'll see them cast in grainy black and white. But it isn't. Sad to say, the book loses momentum midway and it becomes tedious. You keep waiting for something to happen and when it does, it's anticlimactic. In the words of Richard, life isn't fiction. Nor is it half as dramatic. Oates is a colourful and engaging writer. She's got craft but has a tendency to indulge herself and when she does, she loses focus. &quot;Expensive People&quot; isn't a conventional thriller. It's a social critique of American society at the turn of the 60s decade and about the falseness of respectable society on the brink of a social revolution that will forever shatter time tested norms. While flawed and not entirely satisfying, it's an impressive early work and Oates got much better by the time she wrote Black Water."},{"Title":"Expensive people","review":"JCO takes us deep into the mind of a child killer -- that is a killer who just happens to be a chid.

The brutality of pretension and lies that make people go on a downward spiral to their doom is very well explained in this novel.

If not, can we overcome the circumstances of our actions? Maybe.

At present I am reading her set of four books written in the 60s as part of the Wonderland Quartet, her first book A Garden of Earthly Delights is magnificent and superb story. Expensive People is a trying read. The highlights of this book are the way Oates describes people with money, and how little they give back to society...a commentary which still fits the high income level suburbs in Northern California as well, the plasticity of the individuals living in these areas, with their big houses, small yards, little interest but in jogging, going to teas, country clubs, etc...She is talking not about people with old monies, but the nouveau riche, and she does this very well. Oates uses a young overweight 18 year old as her primary narrator and character, he is the neglected son...is fixated with his mother, and his oedipal alliance creates lots of trauma for him and in the end causes tragedy and loss...In a sense the book has great images, it is written exceptionally well...might be that I did not read it fast enough, it surely was not a page turner for me, like other of her novels...I would recommemd it with reservation... it is an interesting book."},{"Title":"Expensive people","review":"I adore JCO enough to read a book like this that wanders about and somewhere just past the middle is it's own book.It's own story is right there in the middle, it lasts about 3 pages and it might have been the book.This is an uncomfortable book for any parent to read because we see our own flaws and indulgences, the ridiculousness of schooling and adulthood and the distance we create.But it's beauty makes it less shocking.A wonderful and engrossing read."},{"Title":"Expensive people","review":"I've always enjoyed Joyce Carol Oates' writing, and I thought I'd give one of her earlier works a try. I found Expensive People to be somewhat disturbing and random, but since it was written in an autobiographical format, this style is in keeping with her main character. Even though you know how the book ends before you're finished, Oates does a wonderful job making the end somewhat unexpected.

This is the reason it took such a long while before I read my first work by Joyce Carol Oates. An English professor spent an entire semester trying to convince me that I should read Oates' work, so I resisted to the point that Expensive People was gifted to me and then sat on my bookshelf collecting dust for a year before I finally cracked the spine. From page one I was hooked. Although this is not the best piece I've ever read by JCO, it WAS the biggest surprise to me, hence the five star rating. Had I opened this book expecting to be thrilled by the story and the quality of Ms. Oates' writing, my rating would be a bit lower. However, this piece forced me to seek out other works by a woman who quickly became one of my favorite authors. Although I'll admit I was wrong to avoid reading her work, I'll refrain from admitting that my college professor was right...I still believe that you can't force anyone to love what you love just because you love it.That said, read this book, don't read this book...It makes no difference to me. ;o)"},{"Title":"Expensive people","review":"Joyce Carol Oates writes so much that a reader of my generation can hardly catch up with what she's written in the past, much less with what she continues to produce, unless they were to choose to read her work almost exclusively. I walked into a bookstore the other day, and sure enough, she has yet another new book out! Having read Them, I decided I was going to read all of The Wonderland Books, and living in a suburban area, I thought that this would be an interesting one to take on next. Oates tells a story that to me seemed ahead of its time. In our generation, we look back on Columbine as having occurred 10 years ago, only to realize that Pearl Jam wrote Jeremy a whole 10 years before that. A student shot up a lecture hall at Northern Illinois University, where I got my doctorate, just a couple years ago. While Expensive People doesn't deal with school violence, it certainly begins to chip away at the psychology of troubled youth that all too often come from affluence--not poverty. And she does it 20 years before Jeremy. This book is well worth the reader's time."},{"Title":"Expensive people","review":"This was my first book of JCO's, and I'm tempted to read another. I liked her writing style although it is different and more disjointed that nice, neat and literary writing. You are taken into the head of a demented young man who not only thinks but writes strangely, and that's hard to wrap around, but interesting in that you can really identify, which can terrify you once you figure out the history of him.A few reviews here say the book is predictable, although I was almost certain of the ending once I got to it, I wasn't sure it would end the way it did. I won't give anything away (I learned long ago not to read the reviews on amazon.com before I read the book, as people are wont to give away endings) but I will say this book was captivating and worth a read. Not perfect by any means, but it certainly kept my interest up and wasn't the same old story you usually read."},{"Title":"Expensive people","review":"Darkly funny, richly allusive, Oates' satire of the upper middle class is a wonderful read.

Despite frequent assertions in the text that this is a real memoir-it isn't. She plays with the definition of memoir and the differences between it and fiction. Post-modern much?The fictional writer creates a bond with you (the reader) through his conversational tone and chaotic, drawn out plot structure that seems nothing like that of a novel. It's a super weird story about a little boy who loves his mother unconditionally, but she doesn't seem to care about him one way or another. She is incredibly introverted and self-centered, leaving her family twice throughout the course of the story. The whole story leads up to the point where the writer reveals who he murdered when he was a child; he wants you to get to know the victim. As I said: super weird story.I don't know if I would suggest reading this particular book to anyone, but I'm certainly looking forward to reading more of Joyce Carol Oates work."},{"Title":"Criminal law: Principles and cases (West's criminal justice series)","review":"I had to have this book for class.

Suzuki - it is curious to weigh the gist of this book against the experience brought by two or three decades of experimentation with 'orthodox' Zen in the West.Despite his esteem for Zen - and Buddhism, generally, Humphreys felt certain reservations about adopting the outward form of such practices in the West, arguing that it was unreasonable and impractical to expect Westerners - living in the 20th c, to adopt forms of practice devised for Chinese Zen monks, living in 8th or 9th c. China. The concern here extended to prolonged periods of formal Za-zen, and also the more formalised aspects of training with the koan. Much of the thinking here derived from the fruitful bathos of Zen workshops at the Buddhist Society. Humphrey's position was not that Zen practice per se could be dispensed with, but that it ought to reflect Western needs and circumstances - bearing in mind the Buddha's own dictum: \\"work out thine own salvation with diligence.\\" Quite independently of the Buddhist Society, London, and working far away in N. America, at least one Japanese Roshi - Nyogen Senzaki, arrived at conclusions similar to those of Humphreys, suggesting that Western Zen students might sit on chairs, rather than adopt a sitting posture they were unfamiliar with - or even unsuited to, constititutionally.In their bid to reclaim substance from style, or the living kernel from the outer shell of tradition, reformers are often at risk of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. To what extent that could be said of Humphreys, with any fairness, is a good question. The Buddhist Society had always had strong ties with the Theravada - and, as such, unlikely to foster anything flippant - in the name of Buddhism. Going by the 'letters' sent Humphrey's way from practicers at the Buddhist Society, some of which appeared verbatim in 'Zen Comes West,'a forerunner to the present text - it would be uncharitable to suggest that the letters therein reflected anything less than a genuine, focused quest for the truth.I suspect that - over the past thirty years, even the most 'conservative' proponents and adherents of Zen have had to take a fresh look at some of their practices. Still, that is another matter from declaring such practices to be superfluous. It is one thing to concede that certain Caucasian types don't seem happy doing formal Za-zen for anything longer than brief spurts, and quite another to suggest that formal Za-zen never constituted part of the daily routine in T'ang Zen temples.If anything, the tensions expressed in this book are still working themselves out. It is pretty evident that we are not going to see a kind of final triumph of the 'reformists' over the 'conservatives' or vice versa. It is more a question of levelling things out, letting them find their balance. In some areas, Western Buddhists are becoming more 'conservative' than they might once have imagined. In other respects, even the most enthusiastic members of the 'conservative' camp are finding that they have to be innovative. As such, this book is likely to touch on issues which are still relevant."},{"Title":"A Western Approach to Zen","review":"Will not disappoint and will, in a way, that is economic and amazing give you depths of insight! This is the book that is within reach and I grab when going for a ride in the car...(when I'm not doing the driving). Love it!"},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"Rush Kidder's new book, \\"Moral Courage\\" examines both the structure of a value system and the essential idea of morage courage which enables any value system to work. Kidder, the founder of the Institute for Global Ethics, and an important commentator on practical ethics is well suited to look at what makes ethics work in the workday world.There are nine chapters in the book which neatly fit into three sections. The first section which I would call \\"Basics\\" includes Standing Up for Principle; Courage: Moral and Physical; and The Courage to be Moral. The second section which I would call \\"Elements of Moral Courage\\" includes The First Circle: Enduring the Hardship; The Second Circle: Recognizing the Risks; and The Third Circle: Enduring the Hardship. The final section which I would call \\"Practical Applications\\" includes Fakes, Frauds and Foibles : What Moral Courage Isn't; Learning Moral Courage, and finally, Practising Moral Courage in the Public Square.The book uses many personal stories to demonstrate by example, just what is meant. It has a solid theoretical structure but the clear illustrations of real people applying the theory in their own lives makes it both very readable and useful as a text in courses on practical ethics.I believe this is a book that should be in the library of any person who has a sincere interest in practical or applied ethics. Its analysis of moral courage will, I believe, become a classic. I think it will give ethicists as well as others a common language as well as a common way to examine ethical situations. Since the illustrations come from a very broad spectrum of human experience and differing societies, the book should be a useful tool no matter what area of ethics an individual is involved in. It is very clear and does not resort to jargon. It will, without doubt, be an important tool for practical ethics for many years to come."},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"Our pop culture-saturated society has seen its definition of heroism narrowed to the actions of \\"superheroes\\", or at the very least to borderline impossible acts of physical courage. What this exceptional book suggests is that we can all be heroes through acts of moral courage. The book features a number of fascinating examples of everyday people who saw that a situation in their lives was wrong, weighed the risks of taking and not taking action, and overcame both the fear of and actual hardships to do the right thing.My favorite stories in the book are of those people who suffered negative consequences for taking a stand against something wrong but have experienced no regrets for acting as they did (for example, the high school student in Massachusetts who blew the whistle on some friends who she knew were plotting a Columbine-style attack but was held responsible for not acting sooner). The dilemmas in these stories are the stuff of great fiction; the fact that so many people chose to act heroically despite the consequences that they faced before and after the fact makes for very compelling reading.Some might fault the book for being a bit dry in spots, and it might sell more copies if it had the relentlessly upbeat tone of many self-help books. But the writer's journalistic training serves him well here; this is a book about idealistic action firmly grounded in the details of everyday life. It is a tremendously inspiring, truly thought-provoking book that one would love to see as required reading in classrooms and employee training sessions everywhere."},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"Take a look at your hometown newspaper on any given day. You might read about a deadly fire that could have been prevented had a city or town inspector been doing his or her job honestly and diligently. Or there just might be a story about a high ranking elected official who is abusing the public trust they have been sworn to uphold. Or maybe a group of high school students have been caught plagiarizing their term papers. How do you react when you read these kinds of stories? Are you outraged or do you merely shrug your shoulders and yearn for the \\"good old days\\" when people were more responsible and more accountable for their actions.As we enter the increasingly complex world of the 21st century, it has become quite apparent that there is a need for more and more of us to display \\"Moral Courage\\". Much to my amazement, author Rushworth Kidder reveals in the opening pages of his book that a search on the internet revealed that no one has ever written a book on this specific subject. To Kidder there are three elements to \\"Moral Courage\\"--an individual must have principles, there has to be an element of danger or risk involved and one must show a willingness to endure. As a means of illustration, the author cites numerous real-life examples of individuals who found themselves facing very real ethical dilemmas. Some of his subjects would fail the test miserably while others would respond in a heroic way. Kidder goes on to explain that the most difficult moral dilemmas are not those situations where the choices are clearly \\"right against wrong\\" but rather the situation that commonly occurs where one must struggle with \\"right vs. right\\" choices.I cannot think of anyone who would not benefit from reading \\"Moral Courage\\". Like it or not, each one of us is bound to face a number of thorny issues and moral dilemmas during the course of our lifetime. Rushworth Kidder has given us all lots of food for thought in his fascinating new book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"Rushworth Kidder's examples of moral courage by people in different walks of life are useful, instructive, and inspiring. Kidder analyses the qualities that constitute moral courage and the character of the people making morally courageous decisions in a wide variety of contexts. I don't think that there is anyone one who could not benefit by reading this book, and it doesn't need to be read through, at one sitting. In fact, it may be better to read parts and reflect on them instead of reading it cover to cover. I was moved to share it with my 15 year old daughter, who read the parts I selected with interest. Moral Courage is an ideal textbook for high school or college students as it provides real life examples and a framework of analysis that will stimulate discussion and bring attention to the issues that confront us today as individuals and as a society. Moral Courage demonstrates the great value and importance of being aware of our choices and making the tough decisions that are needed more than ever today."},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"If you are looking for a practical book on morality and applied ethics that most people can relate to, Rushworth M. Kidder's Moral Courage is an excellent choice. The book is well written, and includes a variety of examples of \\"real\\" people faced with moral dilemmas. Some failed. Some excelled.He defines moral courage as \\"the courage to be moral\\" which is living according to one's principles. Building on previous works where five universal values (honesty, respect, responsibility, fairness, and compassion) were identified, this book discusses the elements of moral courage: (1) applying the values, (2) recognizing the risks, and (3) enduring the hardship.Kidder recognizes that those who have moral courage will sometimes be taking a stand that is not popular, but is nevertheless \\"the right thing to do.\\" In other words, he doesn't take an unrealistic, \\"pollyana\\" approach to developing and exhibiting moral courage.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to develop moral courage. This book is both inspirational and educational, and is equally applicable to the classroom and the board room."},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"This is an excellent book. The examples, interviews, honesty all add up to a book that should be required reading for highscoolers, business execs--really everybody that cares about building a stronger more ethical society and way of life."},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"While this book contains many interesting and illuminating anecedotes of personal courage (or the lack thereof), it fails on one key point.Kidder argues against moral relativism, suggesting (based on interviews) that honesty, respect, responsibility, fairness, and compassion are universal values. These are just words, however, and they can mean very different things to different people. To people in a very communal culture, responsibility might be used to mean the individual's responsibility to the community. In more individualistic cultures (and in the philosophy of Ayn Rand) it would more likely mean responsibility to self. To some fairness means equality, while to others it can mean extreme discrimination. A refutation of moral relativism demands that different people agree upon the same meanings, not merely the same words.With this failure, Kidder's entire case falls down. He presents moral courage as \\"the string\\" holding together the pearls (of moral values). When those very values are in question, moral courage becomes undefinable."},{"Title":"Moral Courage","review":"It seems that ethics is the primary issue now, ethics in government, in business and in private concerns. Moral courage is described as \\"the bridge between talking ethics and doing ethics.\\" I don't think that is necessarily the moral issue.Morality has nothing to do with ethics. Morality is standing up for your rights and standing firm when others do harm to you. He asks, \\"Am I motivated by my desire to uphold my beliefs or just to impose them on others?\\" There is no way to impose anything on anybody who is not willing to accept it.Some of us fight for moral courage, which is so lacking in today's world. But is telling the truth right when it can hurt someone else desperately? Is that moral? Is it ethical to do things and say things which you know will cause irreperable harm to innocent people?Our culture is full of those who get their kicks out of putting down an old woman and making her feel soiled, even though they have not touched her physically. Emotional abuse is by far a much greater harm to the psyche than any physical abuse is to the body. I know, because I endured it for 21 years. But I am a survivor, and I have always stood up for my rights. I was praised once upon a time, a while back, as sticking to my convictions, that not so many people will stand behind the courage of their convictions.You don't have to achieve maturity to have moral courage. It just takes determination and character, no matter what your age is. No, it is not esoteric or practical, it is a necessity in today's world not to back down. That's the Scots-Irish in us Southerners.Dr. Kidder is from the East where morals are different from the Bible Belt of the South. He is highly educated and serves on many boards as a VIP. I wonder what audience he wrote this particular book for, us commoners who have to struggle with everyday problems, like a death in the family, or the CEOs who dally with other people's money. There is a vast difference."},{"Title":"Pennsylvania mountain stories","review":"If you're familiar with Pennsylvania, particularly central and north central Pennsylvania, then you ought to take a look at this book. Initially published in 1906, it contains the collected writings of Shoemaker, who traveled the region extensively in the years leading to the turn-of-century. Some of the stories are tall tales, while others are specific accounts of things witnessed in his travels. I don't find a boring story here, and its a great window to a time not really so far away, but so, so different in a lot of real ways.There's ghost stories, stories of feuds, stories of travels, and of attempted enterprises dashed by the frequent moves of a racehorse. I believe there's only one or two mentions of an automobile. There are lots of conversations with Civil War veterans, and even a hermit from France, who lived on the side a mountain just north of Clearfield, Pennsylvania (not too far from Penn State, if you're not familiar with it).Just a real enjoyable read, which continues to awe and inspire others, including a similar volume collected in the 1970-80s by a professor at Mansfield College (Flatlanders & Ridgerunners).

It also gives a good, detailed, background on how Koga developed the Martial Arts system that he still teaches to Police Officers throughout the world. The major reason I did not give this book the highest rating is the fact that there are grammatical errors throughout the text (must be the result of computer spell checkers doing the proofreading instead of a competent human). Mr. Koga told me of the book's flaw when I met him a couple of months ago.

The entire story - unabridged- is here, with all of Denslows pictures (in black and white). It also includes two essays, one biographical and one critical, about Oz and it's creator, L.F.Baum.The biographical essay by Martin Gardner is a good overview of Baum's &quot;jack of all trades&quot; life: chicken farmer, playwrite, traveling salesman, author. It includes many of the stories included in &quot;To Please a Child,&quot; the wonderful biography of Baum that is long out of print.The critical essay concerns the history of the Oz books as literature. Oz is considered by many both a Utopia and the first true American fairyland. Yet, critics of children literature rarely mention Baum along with other revered authors. Russel Nye captures perceptions of Oz over the first half century in a concise, but comprehensive manner.My only criticism is that it was not changed from the first edition (published 1957) to the second (published 1994), other than a brief introduction. I would have like to have seen a review of how Oz has changed in the public consciousness in the past 43 years.Enjoy this book, and enjoy the story at the end."},{"Title":"The Wizard of Oz & Who he Was","review":"\\"The Wizard of Oz and Who He Was\\", Martin Gardner & Russel Nye/Editors, Michigan State Univ.

Not to be overlooked is the scandalous national controversy that arose in 1957 within the Detroit Public Library system denouncing Oz books as \\"poorly written\\" and \\"unwholesome\\" etc., a very serious matter at that time, we may find it humorous.Readers will once again recall several ways to kill witches, cross rivers, cast magical spells and if you see \\"Wicked\\" on stage, it'll make the play even more memorial."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I bought this book, hoping to read some stories from a person actually working on an assembly line in a town close to me (Flint, Michigan). Maybe get some inside information on how poor management and union complicity almost destroyed the domestic auto industry, until GM was forced by the Japanese to start emphasizing quality over quantity. Ben Harper wrote a column for a local (Roger Moore's) weekly newspaper, so he must have something interesting to say (I was dead wrong). Also from reviews on Amazon, it sounded like an amusing tale.I have friends and family that worked in auto industry for GM in that plant and others in the area (both assembly and skilled trades). They have told many stories of working on the line, all better than anything in this book. Some enjoyed the repetitive nature of the job to free their minds for other problems. Some enjoy the camaraderie of co-workers. Many workers would rest up at GM, so that they could work a second job. Some relatives tried to convince me to work there for the job security and good pay (did they hate me?). I never heard of hatred of GM for making the job boring, high paying, with great benefits.Hamper writes like Roger Moore, blaming GM for trying to make a profit, forcing workers into boring jobs and then ruining Flint when high costs price them out of auto market. Ben loved his big paychecks, long layoffs and benefits, but complains about boredom and lack of meaningful employment. On the other hand, he was always glad to get called back from a layoff (he could have used that time off productively).There are a LOT of people that would like those jobs, paychecks and benefits back again. I found nothing humorous, or even interesting, in the book. Stories of boozing, drugs, lying, cheating, profanity and laziness hold no value."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"As a fellow autoworker, I thought I'd read this to get some of the funny stories he no doubt had. Instead we get a whiney tale about how trapped he is in his job. THe complaints he has are amazing considering how little he was actually at work due to layoffs and medical leaves. Although there are some comical moments and as a whole it is well written, the guy represents that stereotype that helped bring the companies down. Wow, drinking on the job not to mention being so far gone and then DRIVING HOME! Sorry, I know exactly how it was for you and you're a bad representative, so glad you could be published."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"So Detroit guys drink beer? Or cheat on their timecards? Or blame all their problems on their jobs?Nothing new here, not worth reading."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Having survived working the assembly line for five years('97 to '02), I can tell you it hasn't changed much since Hamper's early retirement. I could identify with so much that Ben had to write about in this book, except we didn't have our own Howie Makem. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. For those who work on the line, I definately would suggest reading this book!"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Something to which author Ben Hamper doesn't necessarily subscribe is the so-called \\"Puritan work ethic\\". This well-written, funny, and covertly disturbing journal of life on the assembly line makes it abundantly clear that Mr. Hamper's ambitions lay no further than that day's \\"quittin' time\\" and the subsequent stop at the neighborhood bar. It's a life which, according to him at least, was almost pre-destined upon birth and which would lead to an early grave if he'd allow it to continue as such.Booze, drugs, and rock & roll figure prominently in this life. In fact, one often gets the impression this \\"life\\" represents the rule and not the exception. His keen, detailed reportage of daily events leads one to believe that he's just \\"one of the guys\\", a cog in the industrial complex wherein if a man or woman can last thirty years then there'll be joy at the end of some north-of-Flint rainbow. But therein lies the rub.Combinations of daily repetitious routine, lack of a clear sense of purpose, and guiltless self-destructive habits can make thirty years seem like an eternity. After reading this book, I came away thinking this was not only endemic to the life of an autoworker, but also downright insane.What I found disappointing in Hamper's account was an apparent lack of discernment as to the role of his union in making the pay and working conditions as \\"tolerable\\" as they were. The book's few instances where the union local played a part were as if its presence was taken for granted as much as the plant's lifelong presence in his town; i.e. an impervious constituent of life's landscape. Ultimately, it was not to be.However, as prideful a \\"rivethead\\" as he was, I think Hamper's ultimate point was that this was not going to be the lifetime calling he had envisioned. The accounts of his serendipitous success as a column writer and the notoriety it engendered made for some great reading; a true story of redemption which has not seen its final chapter.I heartily recommend this book to everyone...not just current and prospective \\"shoprats\\"."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"This book applies to life on the assembly line or in any company in which the work is repetitive. How often do we read books to be better managers or to motivate our people in new and different ways? What do they think of our pitiful efforts? Look at Howie Makem and the other stories in this book and learn a powerful lesson. Only then can you really understand what you are up against. Then you can be a manager."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Rivethead is probably in the top five books I've ever read. In a previous review I saw that a history professor assigned it; I find that fascinating. I have been a history major and let me tell you, I found very few historians that are in touch enough to assign such an in-touch book as Mr. Hamper's (closest I can remember was &quot;One Day in the life of Ivan Denosovich&quot;). I check this page every few months to find out if Ben has anything else out, but no luck just yet. For those who are curious, I saw some where, five or six years ago, he was writing a book on The Mall of America. While you are waiting I would recommend &quot;Bound For Glory&quot; by Woody Guthrie.."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I didn't really like reading this book because I too work in a (once) major three Auto plant. I didn't feel that it properly portrayed some of the workers. It made it sound like all workers are like the author where they just really don't give a damn about anything except having a joking time on the job. It also made the workers sound like they were underachieving, undereducated, bottom of the barrel workers and I didn't care to have that stigma for all of us. I hold two bachelor degrees, like my job and take it serious!"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Its not often that I read a book that consistently makes me laugh out loud, but Hamper was able to do so for me with every passing page in Rivethead. I read it for a class assignment, but have re-read it since then, and have also recommended it to others. Its a first-hand account of how one man took the default path in life and followed in his father's footsteps, joining the GM assembly line. Hamper goes through how he came to this profession, and the steps in his life that 'messed up' his aspirations of breaking away from such a path. But more than that, it shows how in American society, we are defined by what we do from 9-5 rather than who we are in our time off work. Hamper subscribes to this belief as a columnist while working on the assemblyline, and although we may not realize it, we may also subscribe to such a belief. Ultimately, the daily grind ends up consuming Hamper, and he is forced to take time away from 'work' and recognize the part of him that exists off the job."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"This is possibly one of the best books ever written, and I read at least a book every two to three days. I fascinated by the downfall of Detroit, and this was one of Amazon's \\"You might also like,\\" they could not have been more correct!Ben Hamper is an assembly line worker for GM. How interesting can an assembly line job be? Well, if you live in Michigan in the late seventies and early eighties, pretty interesting! Ben Hamper calls himself a \\"Rivethead\\" and the assembly line was his destiny. He really had no goals or aspirations after high school and found himself making the incredible sum of over $12 an hour with lots of overtime, and time to mess around on the job. The best thing about this book is that he is possibly the least pretentious person you would ever encounter, yet he writes better than most Pulitzer Prize winners. He is an amazing story teller and the analogies he uses are hysterical! His journey through working at GM, followed by unemployment, followed by GM, over and over is brilliantly told. The people he meets there and the amount he drinks on this trip defies normal humans.This book should be required for all students high school, it gives the best descriptions of blue collar work on an assembly line. Although the story is good, he doesn't glamorize the job he does, the instability it has, or the effect it has on his health. It shows that a job you thought was a sure thing could up and disappear leaving so much uncertainty.I not only read this book, I gave it to co-workers (I work in a public middle school), sent a copy to my writer/English major sister, and made my husband, a die hard Republican, read this book that is all about the Unions.My personal favorite part? When Ben finds himself at the unemployment line... I was laughing so hard while reading this and this has been the only book to date that I have EVER advertised on my Facebook page.Only bad thing?

Anyone who enjoys reading non fiction will enjoy this book, as it talks about the monotony of factory work and being jerked around by M.N.C.

I wonder how many people had similar experiences. I also wonder how much of the problem was with the author. There is no question in my mind that much if not all of what he says took place. I have worked in environments where the normal rules do not apply - still do sometimes. I can also see why so many businesses are drug free workplaces today at least in theory. The stories he tells about how managers are selected rings especially true to me. I work in the defense industry and seldom see anybody capable promoted. There is a current reaction against that phenomenon going on right now with a rash of people starting their own companies."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"The book being reviewed Rivethead was written piecemeal by an automotive assembly line worker named Ben Hamper and put into print as a book in 1992 by Warner books. Before this, Rivethead grew as a collection of articles with copyrights in the years, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1991.The articles appeared in print in The Michigan Voice, The Detroit Free Press,and Mother Jones.Rivethead is the biographical work of an unlikely Author from the automotive boomtown of Flint, MI. This city is the once great Mecca of GM assembly factories. Hamper chronicles the rise, hopefulness and fall of his own career and parallels it to the city and corporation that dominate the lives of its denizens. Anyone interested in the reality of life inside of and surrounding a classic rustbelt factory town will enjoy this work written not by an outside observer but, one of its own, an author that was not just embedded but actually lived in the belly of the beast.Hamper effectively ties together basic human conditioning and shows in his work why people toiled in the factories for generations. It's the \\"Golden handcuffs\\" syndrome as he shows. When he was a younger man Hamper did have thoughts and dreams of leaving Flint, but the lure of a steady paycheck with no advanced education was to great. A steady good paying job until death do you part. Cursed and blessed at the same time.Hamper portrays himself consistently as a simple man, uncomfortable with the relative fame his work brought him. Rubbing shoulders and eventually collaborating with fellow Townie Michael Moore brought Hamper to an unfamiliar place. This was one of authoring for money and the industry of publishing introduced to him briefly. In Rivethead Hamper speaks of this secondary industry even though embracing of him, also not understanding that he needs to remain in the heart of darkness in order to develop his characters. This is not fiction. Hamper cannot create fiction. What Hamper does create in Rivethead is vivid scenery inside the stereotypical American assembly plant of the 1970s and 80s."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Ben Hamper brings a gift that few have ever delivered - a straightforward account of life on a GM assembly line, written by an assembly line worker (the aptly monikered \\"Rivethead\\"). Be warned, Hamper does not pull any punches with his language, descriptions of events, and the goings-on at GM. There are plenty of four letter words, vulgar descriptions, and so on - all of which contribute intimately to the pace and style of the book. Hamper doesn't use these only for crude reasons, no, he is painting the picture of the assembly line workers.I admit, coming from a manufacturing company, I was shocked to read of the constant substance abuse, heavy drinking before, during, and after shifts, and overall terrible behavior of these grown men, or, as Hamper refers to them, kids who never grew up. The latter description is probably more accurate. It would be easy to paint GM as a no-doubt failure based on this book, but that's too one-sided. The dreary conditions, lack of concern for its workers, dull work, and constant poor conditions contributed to the need to numb the minutes away and make the clock tick a little faster.In the world of the New GM, one could go back and start to identify many of the reasons this once mighty company failed. Rivethead takes on a new life given the events of the recent years."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Great book. Must read for anyone wo works in an auto factory."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I found out about this book while watching Michael Moore's The Awful Truth on Bravo. Ben did some correspondence work for Michael. My husband, my dad, and I were watching it and my dad told me that was the guy from Roger &amp; Me (a movie about Flint by Michael Moore-a must see for anyone who enjoys this book) that was in the mental hospital on Holly Rd. I got the book and read the acknowledgements and I realized that I went to school with his daughter! He hung out and a bar called Mark's Lounge and I used to work at the Sunoco gas station right next door to it while I was in college! Anyway being originally from the Flint area and working right across the street from the factory Ben worked in I knew that quite a bit of drinking and long lunch hours took place but Ben tells it is so funny. My favorite parts are when he talks about Howie Makem the quality cat. It is an easy read too. It only took me a couple of days to read it. But then again maybe that is because I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Vulgar exaggeration that is just outright fun to read is the best way to describe this book. Ben Hamper's autobiography, Rivethead, is a simple story of life on the American car manufacturing line in the 1980's. Assuming only half the stories are true, it's no wonder that the Japanese beat the American's in the auto industry.Where Rivethead falls short is that it glamorizes the destructive behavior or drugs and alcohol, especially while working on an assembly line. Hamper's amazingly funny stories about the blue collar worker keeps the book enjoyable. But at the same time, the underlying social norms of mediocracy and work avoidance with the before mentioned substance abuses is disheartening at best. In the end, Hamper never grows beyond these poor behaviors and seems to to relish the life of an alcoholic union worker.Overall, it's a fun book that leaves the moralistic reader seeking more."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Growing up in Detroit, I knew a lot of shop rats who either worked in the factories for the Big(at the time)Four, or slaved away in smaller shops that served these smokestack whorehouses. Hamper painfully describes the life of a shop rat through his own miserable experience. The misery these men dished out to themselves and each other in an attempt to survive a culture of human desecration is exactly what I watched in Detroit as young men I graduated from high school with, discintegrated around me.Perhaps that explains to some extent my own extensive drug and alcohol exploration when I went to college to escape the factories of Detroit.

Hamper touches on the powerfully inane details of life in American industry with driving and inventive prose.

Although the working conditions at the plant I worked at were not as bad as at GM, the mentality of the workers and how they deal with management is the same in a non unionized Japanese Plant. In fact even though it is thought that there is more cooperation between management and worker at Japanese Plants, I found that there was still a deep division between the two. The description of the pranks are hilarious. In summary, if anyone thinks that workers in Japanese plants are any better off than the North American plants, think again. An auto plant is an auto plant."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I grew up with people like Ben Hamper in a place which was much like Flint. For the first couple years of my adult life, I did the kind of work he did. What he describes is the tail end of a lifestyle; the lifestyle of the shop rat. It's dirty, monotonous and smelly. Many of the people you work with are either below average in intelligence or in sanity. Drugs, booze and having no concept of \\"forethought\\" are fundamental parts of the culture. It's nihilism with a rivet gun. If you come from a place like that, chances are, your only way out is via a jail cell or a career in the military. Or, you could win a workmans comp suit. Which is presumably how Ben got out.I miss rust-belt working class america. It's a hard life, and it doesn't have much in the way of rewards, but the people who make it up are genuine in ways that others are not: they have a lot of heart and spirit. Ben's book brought it all back in a great galloping rush of memories.

Bold, frank, honest and often hilarious. This book was recommended to me years ago and for some reason I never read it until now. Hamper chronicles a part of American history (manufacturing jobs) that seem to be going stateside or as Ross Perot once described in a quip about NAFTA, what's that whoosing noise? manufacturing jobs headed to Mexico. This is prose for the ages. Loved the book."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Ben Hamper, aka The Rivethead, is the one guy with the courage to tell the truth about the American assembly line. Hamper worked in the GM Truck and Bus assembly plant for over 10 years, and along the way met more characters and drank more beer than most do in a lifetime. He also wrote one of the funniest and most revealing books about the American workplace ever published. Spend an afternoon on the rivet line with Ben Hamper, and find out what &quot;Quality&quot; really means."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Ben Hamper is best known as &quot;the guy shooting free throws&quot; in Michael Moore's &quot;Roger and Me&quot;. But he was also a longtime columnist under the title &quot;Rivethead&quot;. Years of working under the hypocritical policies of GM drive him to write his scathing this book about how to pass the time and abuse numerous substances while building Suburbans for upper-middle class soccer moms. If anyone thinks that working for GM, or any industrial powerhouse, is a plum job with high pay, good hours, and loads of fun, then read this book and learn something about the way corporations value human capital."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I just re-read this and it is one of my all-time favorite books! It's so funny. Anyone who grew up in a Midwestern, blue-collar environment will relate to the drinking and dark humor and job of drudgery. I wish he would write a second book."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"This is a must read for anyone who is curious what a day in the life of a factory worker is like. Ben Harper takes you on journey through the massive bowels of the General Motors Truck and Bus factory; and lets you in on the daily hijinks, scams and booze habits of he and his linemates to help ease the passage of time and the mind numbing by-product of their job. Harper's gonzoesque sytle is fresh, gritty, real and hilarious; and his take on General Motor's bureaucratic hierarchy of authority is as funny as it is frustrating. He let's us in on everything to GM's quality mascot cat &quot;howie makum&quot; to the flashing slogan banner in front of his work station announcing &quot;riveting is fun&quot;. Ben Harper makes you want to come to work with him; but stay only for a day."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Just finished this book up in less than a week. What you have here is one man's story of life on the line at GM in the late 70s and early 80s. And it doesn't get more GM than Flint, Michigan during that time. Hamper's story is simultaneously hilarious, haunting, offensive, sad, and fascinating. Put aside your own political views, and put aside that Michael Moore wrote the forward and was one of Hamper's best friends. I can't stand Moore but I couldn't stop reading Hamper. He sure is fun as hell to read. Perhaps my strongest reaction for Hamper was empathy - he's smart, insightful, he writes well, and you realize he was meant for more in life than being a \\"shoprat\\" and therein, I think, lies the source of his inner turmoil. There's an overwhelming sense of tragedy as his life derails, and you keep wishing he'd long ago ditched the plant entirely and pursued his true calling as a writer. That might have saved his meltdown, but then again if he did so, he never would have written the book."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"A true must-read for anyone who knows of anyone who has set foot inside a factory. Hamper wields his words with the precision of a skilled riveter. It's The Catcher in the Rye meets The Jungle, only set in Buick City."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Accurate, interesting and all around great read! I can't put the book down! Hamper did fry all his brain cells."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"This was required reading in one of my college classes. I enjoyed the book then, and several years later went to read it again an could relate to it well, as I work in a factory setting. Someone borrowed my book and never returned it, so I had to buy another copy to have on hand. I enjoy Hamper's easy going writing style, and can relate to it so much. I wish there were more books written by him, as I would definitely buy those too!"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Hamper has a charming writing style that is somewhat self deprecating but really captures the grit of the modern American factory worker. He tends to zip off a lot of one liners sort of like a Catskills comedian, but he is fascinating to listen to. There is no bull or exagerration about his experience. He is truthful in all ways and especially about his own shortcomings as a human being. Of course, we all share the same shortcomings, but not all of us get laid open like a cow in a kill line at our jobs. Highly recommended for even the snootiest literary tastes. If you really want to see how the people who make all of our stuff cope and don't cope this is a good read."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"My dad started at GM in 1971 and retired on disability in 1996. I myself worked in the factory that made Chevy Baretta windows in the 80's. I say that because I don't want anyone to take this review as putting down UAW members or autoworkers.To say the least, Mr Hamper has a voice and a sense of humor that capture those noisy, smelly, overheated factories that spit out the low quality flashy junk Detroit produced in the late 70's and early 80's. He chronicles the alcohol and rock music that fueled the shenanigans that went on the parking lots and nearby bars just as well.Sadly, this book is also a tale of mental illness and the American auto industry's failed first attempts to achieve the quality of the Japanese cars that were suddenly outselling the best efforts of the \\"Big Three\\".If you ever shot a rivet on an assembly line, or loved someone who did then you'll probably like this book. It's also a good read for anyone who remembers sex, drugs, and rock & roll of the 70's and 80's with any fondness."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I've just finished the book - for the second time. The first time was 10 years ago. Hamper is brilliant, GM was his muse, but it burned him out - in another world who knows how many books he could have written? but GM drained his soul dry, for 18 bucks an hour. Read Rivethead and witness an amazing mind bang the rev limiter as it carries the story of the shoprats of GM Suburban/Blazer truck in Flint, MI.Ben, if you're out there, thanks for Rivethead! I hope you're still being paid to goof off, and for as long as you want .."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Being from a manufacturing town, I can tell you that the stories and reflections in this book ring true. It is a great book. I actually lost the book because it was passed on to so many other friends. The book ends a little weird, but these types of personal reflections on life sometimes do."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I spent four years in college reading over a hundred books for my classes, including this one. I am done now, and this is the ONLY book I am even thinking of re-reading. I have never laughed so hard in my life, and learned so much. Durkheim, Marx. Weber, Huff, I have ready some books by the greats of academia, but this is the book that sticks in my mind. Ironically, my first job out of college was working in a factory enviroment driving a forklift!! You never know where life will take you, but in this book you learn about the lives of the people who built that car you are driving through life. I drive a GM vehicle, and this book really opened my eyes!!"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I have good news and bad news. The good news is that &quot;Rivethead&quot; is still in print. The bad news is that its author, Ben Hamper, apparently isn't. As far as I know, this is the last (only?) work of his to be published. Having read &quot;Rivethead&quot; no less than 10-15 times, I can say that nothing I have ever read can touch it. Hamper's tales of his and his ne'er-do-well, misfit co-workers' escpades, set in the shadowy nether world of a General Motors assembly plant, are hilarious, sad, frightening, and fascinating. Ben, if you're out there somewhere, give us a sign. I'd consider it an honor if you'd autograph my Angry Samoans album."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I have to say that this is one of the best books I have ever read.

I can only hope for another book of it's caliber..and to all the Stroh Family members and brewery workers in the USA,i strongly advise this book as a case study in the American Blue Collar Dream, as our legacy."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"This is a must-read if you're a white collar, blue-blood, fancy suburb-living, Subaru Outback-driving, Liberal Arts educated American. Or even if you're not--. Its honesty will rattle those who presume to &quot;understand&quot; the American blue collar work force--especially middle managers sitting in some cushy office with fake plants in the corner and hot coffee in a favorite mug. It's a great companion read to &quot;Forming the Future: Lessons from the Saturn Corporation&quot; -- written by Jack O'Toole, the labor representative on the team to create the 80's upstart GM division. The fact that Michael Moore writes the preface to Rivethead should give you an indication that this is raw, off the beaten literary track, good reading. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Rivethead hammers down to the real need to assemble the factory workers of today and rework their life, both in and out of the plant. This is the autobiography of a misfit fitting parts together with other misfits in a system managed by automotive nurse ratchets(or is that wrenches?). The goal is to work less, make more, and spend it all on booze and music. Friendships are born from boredom and last until the next layoff. It's a day of drudgery, whose purpose is somewhat existential with a Woody Allen twist. Finally, in the end, life is just a panic. Move on down the line and pick up this book, you just might need it before the next order comes on down from above"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Unlike the songs of Bruce Springsteen that focus upon the working class of America, Hamper provides one with a glimpse into the life of an American factory worker. This book shows the lived experiences of people that have now become transperent voices in mainstream society. What Hamper does is provide a forum for these voices to be articulated. This book should be a mandatory reading in college classrooms. Specifically, english majors, sociology majors, and communication majors would benefit from the insight and rhetoric displayed through the harsh but real voice of Hamper. More books like this should be read by members of our society both in and out of the academic forums. In sum, I would recommend this book to the masses."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I believe Detroit has changed in the years since Mr. Hamper wrote this book, but since I don't work on an assembly line, I can't tell you. But what this book does do is help to understand the mind-numbing repetitiveness of assembly line work and why Mr.Hamper and his colleagues worked so hard at not working! Lots of different ways to get out of work or make it more bearable. Also explains why build quality for domestics lagged behind foreign cars for so long.Even if you're not a huge fan of cars, the blue collar prose the author writes is really in a class by itself. Yeah, there's cursing, but there's the occasional nugget of a really insightful truth that makes you think."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Having had a father and a brother in the auto assembly business, this book was a must read for me. Missed it when it was first published. This writer is an excellent wordsmith, which results in a very readable and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I read this book 16 years ago, a month before i hired in at GM. I laughed my butt off all the way through the book. I did a 4 month stint as a temporary employee to make extra money for college. I was heading off to school to work on the last year of my bachelors degree when i got that famous phone call, your hired. I was 24 years old at the time and hopped on the band wagon. Within the first year of working there i had experienced every single thing he wrote about in that book, with the exception of a long layoff. I tried doing everything the correct way but soon realized that if you did that the boss would be on your butt for not doing it their way, even if it made more sense, 9 out of 10 bosses i had were like this. It soon became apparent that i needed to just follow everyone else like a good little lemming. I have seen people knocked unconscious and dragged off the line so production isn't slowed down. I've seen people get fingers amputated due to the monotony of the job and becoming to complacent with it, they usually stop the line for a little while when that happens so the hazardous waste team can clean up the mess. You name it iv'e seen it. The good bosses who did things right were always let go for one reason or another. I myself took part in many years of drinking and drugging with the best of them, co-workers, and supervisors alike. This book is a no holds,bare all look into bowels of hell that we call our second home. I still work for GM and a lot has changed since then, but one thing i know for sure is that the line worker still knows more than the boss ever will. This is a must read for any fan of automobiles, auto history, comedy and nonfiction alike."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Ben Hamper's outrageous description of life on thecar and truck assembly line had me laughing out loud at the antics of both workers and bosses at the GM factory in Flint, Michigan. Hamper uses words like rivets and blasts them at the nearest human target; no one escapes his savage attack, not even himself. Hamper is a &quot;flake&quot; and he knows it, but he is an observant flake who is just as adept at turning a phrase as he is finding ways to avoid work. He seeks to please no one, not even himself, and he succeeds beyond even his expectations. Read at your own risk is how Hamper himself might caution us about &quot;Rivethead.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of one of my graduate school professors, thinking I would suffer through it. Contrary to my preconceptions that it would be a dull account of factory life, I simply could not put the book down once I started reading it. Hamper's insight into the Greaseball Mecca (GM) assembly plant culture was both entertaining and informative. I started and finished the book in the time span of one weekend and plan to read it again soon. Ben apparently hasn't written another book yet..."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I read Rivethead for a course in Michigan History at Central Michigan University. As a prospective history teacher, I plan to use Hamper's book in my high school classes. Hamper describes factory life in a manner that is both brutal and eloquant. This book helped me to understand the daily pains that so many Big Three employees and factory workers in general experience. My respect for these men and women that comprise the backbone of American life as grown expodentialy since reading Hamper's opus."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"The book title betrays the story in that it's more tangable and real to the modern day production worker than any other book written in recent times. The characters are ones which we have all seen and met..in fact Homer Simpson would understand this factory. The attempts to improve productivity are desparate as the introduction of 'quality cat'a man hired and dressed up in a tiger outfit is found after some weeks later slumped on the floor smoking a cigarette. Suffice to say the book makes some very important statements on the drive for profit and the effects it has on you me and everyone else."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I read this book the first time when I was a clerk at the Postal Service on the night shift. Apparently GM and the Post Office have a lot in common. I laughed out loud almost through the whole book, often identifying with the subject matter."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Ben Hamper shaped this darkly humorous account of his years working on a General Motors truck assembly line with considerable skill. While his engaging prose firmly establishes the mind-numbing, repetitive nature of factory work, he also reveals how he and those around him on the line maintained some level of humanity by using humor and other diversions in their never-ending battle with the clock. Hamper's take on GM's outmoded management techniques and bumbling efforts to maintain market share in the face of global competition during the 1980s (for example, assigning an employee to dress in a cat costume and patrol the factory as a mascot for quality) is especially amusing."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"Subtitled \\"Tales From the Assembly Line\\" this 1991 book is the autobiography of a worker in a General Motors plant during the late 1970s and early 1980s. There's an authenticity to the author's blue collar voice and he sometimes sounds like a stand-up comedian with the intent of keeping me laughing all the way. I loved his sharp tongued way of expressing himself, the words lightning bullets full of irony and wisdom. Ben Hamper is a likeable guy in spite of his alcohol consumption and contempt for authority.The book took me right into the heart of the factory and a world as foreign to me as that of any exotic country. I learned a lot and laughed out loud, especially when he described the hi-jinks and scams and silly games they all played. There was one part where he described management's idea of increasing production by creating a mascot. I just couldn't stop laughing during that part of the book and I'm still smiling now when I think about it.Mostly though, I identified with the author in spite of the fact that I've been gently raised and have lived in New York City all my life. Ben Hamper has a gift for writing and this book is testament to that.Flint, Michigan was going through some changes during those days, as was the entire American auto industry and this book let me feel this through the eyes of someone who worked daily 9-hour shifts at a dirty sweaty job and who was also paid top dollar for his efforts. In this author's case the money went right into an outrageous consumption of alcohol. Eventually though, it did catch up with him.The automotive industry has changed now. And Ben Hamper is obviously out of a job. But I did discover that he had a website and was still writing columns so his fans can keep up with his clever mind and his unique way of looking at the world."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"I was forced to read this book...against my better wishes, my hellish American History professor assigned this book to our class. As I read the title I remembered thinking: &quot;how in the world is an assembly line job interesting enough to read about?&quot; About the only thing I thought the book had going for it was the foreward by Michael Moore. It looked like I was going have to spend another weekend plodding though a boring book when I could have been spending it at the movies or out with my friends. It turned out to be one of the best weekends of my life. The books was hilarious -- It was real, gritty, sharp and wonderfully written. After reading the introduction, I was hooked: I locked myself in my room, unplugged the telephone and didn't put down the book until I was finished. That was ten minutes ago -- now I am online looking to see if he has written any other books...I was disapointed to see that he hasn't. Ben Hamper -- wherever you are -- I have joined the ranks as your loyal fan. Even though you no longer work for GM, I hope you will find another story out there and tell the world about it."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"How can you make standing on the assembly line in a GM plant funny? Hamper, who describes himself as, \\"desended from royality,\\" because his father and grandfather worked in the same plants, makes the dehumanizing process of the line a exceedingly humorous read.A friend and coworker of Michael Moore (TV Nation) Hamper, brings the frustration of a nowhere career to a funny light. Blue Collaring it, has a sense of hopelessness attached, but with a cynical edge style Hamper delievers a tour-de-force for all working class people to read."},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","review":"The endless monotony and idiot bosses drive anybody with an IQ above their shoe size to do something to kill the thought that, if they're lucky, they only have 30 more years of mind numbing drudgery to go before they can retire.

I feel fortunate to have found a copy in such fine condition, and must say thanks for reuniting me with an old friend!"},{"Title":"Psychedelic Prayers","review":"Come on! Ifyou like this book you either have no clue about psychedelics or a sucker to the great con-man. At the end notes of the book, Leary cites which chapter from Lao-Tzu he has adapted. Let's face it, Leary could not read ancient chinese and thus relied on other's for his interpretations.; not that there is anything wrong with Lin Yutang or James Legge. In fact Legge's translation is considered the definitve and closest to the original (even though he blew it with the I Ching).The Tao Te Ching chapters used for the \\"prayers\\" rarely have anything to do with Leary's text. Either the man just didn't grasp Lao-Tzu or he was so whacked out of his mind when writing it that it comes across as contrived and sophmoric. NOt only that, did Leary not have a secretary to keep track of his phraseology. The book is grossly redundant, repeating the same cliches, several of which came from a completely different chapter of Lao-Tzu.Leary, the self-proclaimed prophet of psychedelia, is only out to sell his drivel to people who 1) can't grasp the original, 2) are completely naive about LSD, and 3) are stupid enough not to check Leary's sources.Granted, everyone was naive about LSD in 1966, but looking back 35 years later, all you get from this drivel is Leary's perverse sexual neuroses and his wish to escape from the \\"mundane\\" world where he is not \\"The King\\". The one book \\"stinks\\" of Aleistair Crowley's megalomania, and scrambled thought processes, and idyllic sexual stimuli (in mono or stereo).Take for example Leary's I-4 (Lao Tzu #19 Returning to the unadulterated Influence). Lao Tzu's version has the essence \\"If we could remounce our sageness and discard our wisdom\\"....(trans. James Legge). There is nothing about \\"Let there be simple things During the Session\\". This is pure Leary Fantasy. The first \\"prayer\\" is about the inability to describe the Tao. It has nothing to do whatsoever with the \\"guide\\", and was obviously placed first in the collection to 1) correspond to Lao-Tzu chapter and 2) to glorify Leary as the GREAT Sage who will lead through the uncharted landscape, and how great he is at doing so. The word Tao does not even occur.Unless you are a collector of Timmy Leary's mumbo-jumbo or buy into his B.S. (belief system), this book is simply a waste of time (regardless of price).Richard alpert (a.k.a. Ram Dass), even with his flipped out ideas is a better read. But why read anything from some swollen LSD ego when you can get the real information from the real researchers. (Cf. Albert Hofmann, LSD My Problem Child - who relates that Leary attempted to place an order with sandoz for 100grams of LSD and 25 kilos of psilocybin (1,000,000 LSD hits and 2.5 million psilocybin)- THe Sandoz people thought he was \\"insane\\" and refused the order.Read Psychedelic Prayers, if you can stand 15 minutes of Leary expounding about his greatness as the High Priest of Psychedelia. Maybe you'll come to the same conclusion that Sandoz did.AT least get James Legge's copy and compare; see for yourself what kind of LSD trash literature that poor mentally deranged Leary could spew out.P.S. Nothing wrong with LSD; just stay away from people like Tim Leary, who even warns you to avoid people like him (VI-17). LSD is not for most people. This book is definitely for no one."},{"Title":"Morality and the good life: An introduction to ethics through classical sources","review":"This was a textbook in my ethics class, and is definitely a keeper. It outlines works from all of the famous ethical philosophers, and also contains a very helpful &quot;running commentary&quot; throughout. The perfect introduction to the subject, and a lifelong reference guide. I've already used it as a source for papers in other classes."},{"Title":"Morality and the good life: An introduction to ethics through classical sources","review":"I've used this book since 2006 to teach ethics in an undergraduate course and it has proved to be a useful text. Robert Solomon and Clancy Martin have put together a text that teaches ethics by introducing students to the classical sources. This book is 512 pages in length. It contains chapters on universal ethical concepts and ethical theories and approaches, Plato, Aristotle, Saint Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Hobbes, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, and John Rawls. There is also a glossary and combined subject/author index. The glossary is 18-pages long; the index is 4-pages. The text contains primary readings, then commentary from Solomon and Martin. The authors attempt to be objective, although the chapter on religion might come across as somewhat antagonistic to those who were reared in a conservative background. For instance, Solomon and Martin set forth questions about the traditional view of Hell without commending or condemning it.While I have found the inclusion of primary texts and the commentary to be helpful in teaching ethics, and the glossary elucidates the book's content, one pet peeve of mine regarding the glossary is the number of typos that pervade that part of the book. An example of an egregious typo is the definition for \\"philosophy\\":\\"in the study of 'first principles,' 'the love of wisdom.'\\"I believe that the first word of this definition should be the verb \\"IS\\" not the preposition \\"in.\\" And this particular typo (using \\"in\\" rather than \\"is\\") is repeated throughout the glossary. But aside from this frequent typo, I highly recommend Solomon and Martin. The text is engaging, informative and critical. This book is a fine introduction to morality and the good life by means of the primary texts themselves."},{"Title":"Morality and the good life: An introduction to ethics through classical sources","review":"Needed the book for class.

Also, the fact that the book contains 4 other books with real songs to play and not just guitar method is a great deal."},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"This is a very comprehensive book--not perfect, but very useful. I am a music teacher and plan to use this to teach a guitar class. I really just wanted to clear something up with some of the comments about the music being an octave too high. If you compare guitar music to the pitches on the piano, you will find that all guitar music in standard notation is written an octave higher than it actually sounds when compared to the piano. It is done that way so the notes can fit on the staff without a lot of ledger lines and is thus easier to read. The notes on the guitar actually lie on both the bass and treble clefs so writing the one octave higher allows the notes to fit more onto one staff without having to use two such as piano music requires. Someone trained to read music on a guitar would never notice until they tried to play their music on the piano and discovered the discrepency. So it is not a mistake that was overlooked by the publisher as one reviewer suggested--that is just how it is done for very practical reasons. This is a perfectly good method book."},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"This is a great book for people who have a basic understanding of music theory.

I am primarily a piano and choir teacher but have taught guitar for about 15 years as well. This is my favorite book because it is really 5 books combined, and therefore it covers lots of different concepts. In one lesson, a student can work on reading melody notes, playing chords, fingerpicking, and improvising rock riffs to the CD accompaniment. The layout is very friendly and easy to read. I am going to start requiring it for all students."},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"Very useful and helpful book for kids as well as for adults."},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"This is the book I use for my beginning guitar class - not because it is the best instruction book out there, necessarily, but because it introduces a wide variety of styles and the CDs support the student's continued learning after the class ends."},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"I just dug this book out of my closet and a bunch of memories came rushing back. When I was like 8 or 9 (im 14 now) I got a REALLY crappy guitar and this book. And I practiced for hours upon hours at a time. I mean I just would play and play. Beginners it might not be the best. But its better than a crappy guitar teacher (trust me i have had one of those). Until I took guitar lessons this book taught me how to play on my own. It was great. Though some of the transcriptons arent the best and some of the songs sound awful. It still is preatty good. Its a fun book just to mess around.And now with my new Strat and amp. When I play these songs it is kinda fun. Like blues suade shoes was so fun. I had it down when I was little. And I could BARELY play along with the C.D. And now the C.D. is too slow for me to play along.I would reccomend this book to someone who could play a bit of guitar. Mabye a couple chords or something. Because its not very helpful when it come to Technique (I cant spell) or holding down frets or stuff like that. If you have a neighbor or friend who plays guitar (In my case it was my Dad) this book is good. But if you dont know anyone I would reccomend lessons first.Oh and someone in another review mentioned that it was all one octive too high. I have to agree and it did give me trouble when I was ready to play harder stuff. But it worked out ok. Mabye beginners should have a second book to.Oh well.Peace Out"},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"I find this book to be incredible as it has in one book all the items I had thought I would need to buy individually. Also, in a day where not alll have heard of the songs before, there are CDs to listen to and accompay you as you play. From the scales to the Beetles. Th actual Beetles, not some Joe Smoe group pertending to be them.I highly reccommend this book both for teaching others and for teaching yourself."},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"Or have they corrected this book recently?First off, I am a pianist AND guitarist with over 30 years of experiance. I was looking for a book that would be a good starter for my girlfriend's son...I am NOT buying this book at this time, but I looked at the \\"see inside\\" link. Take a CLOSE look to page 12, see anything amiss?Everything is transposed 1 OCTAVE higher than what it SHOULD be!If something as simple and basic as that is wrong... what else did they miss?I would keep an eye out for this book in stores and see if they have revised it before I were to buy it here."},{"Title":"The Hal Leonard Guitar Superbook","review":"Wow this is a very good book for any good guitar enthusiast.

Well researched and user friendly."},{"Title":"The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Peripheral Neuropathy: A Revised and Updated Directory for the Internet Age","review":"This is great at explaining the basics of Neuropathy. It is a must if you have just been diagnosed. It explains terms, what happens in neuropathy, and the various types. It is written so everyone can understand it. Fast reading."},{"Title":"The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Peripheral Neuropathy: A Revised and Updated Directory for the Internet Age","review":"As a reference book, this book offers the reader many, many resources to investigate. It is up to the individual to access the resource(s) desired, most of which can be managed with a computer, to discover whether or not what is being offered by that particular resource is relevant to him/her. In short, this book does not offer any specific recommendations about dealing with PN, it simply provides a lengthy list of research options to the reader. In that respect, it is certainly a valuable tool. That said, the section of the book pertaining to 'clinical trials', while somewhat interesting, strikes me generally as material of limited value to the average PN patient. On the more mundane subject of shipping: this book is ~ 8 x 11 x .5 inches in dimension. The shipper chose to send it via USPS, packaged in a rather insubstantial bubble envelope. A book of this size, especially one costing nearly $30., should be shipped in a box or, at least, with more reinforcement in the envelope. By the time USPS finished tossing & spindling the package, the book arrived with one corner bent out of shape, literally."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Sherlock Holmes?: Detective Fiction, Popular Theology, and Society","review":"Robert S. Paul is a professor emeritus of church history and theology at the Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary. He is author of many texts on theological subjects, but one thing is clear from this particular text - he has had a strong avocation of interest in the detective story. Like many who discover the stories, he has a deep interest in Sherlock Holmes. However, despite mentioning the great detective into the title of this text, this is a broader consideration of detective stories and their intersection with ethical and moral considerations, as well as theological ideas.The better detective writers are keen observers of society, and often deal with the areas that are of problematic or ambiguous moral considerations. In the Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes on occasion would not complete a case or would overlook letter-of-the-law violations in aid of a higher ethical purpose; other detectives have been known to the do the same in their stories. Where these lines are often highlight the concerns of a society.Paul argues that the genesis of the detective story and the attendant ethical concerns comes out of the Enlightenment, and develops two different strands that come out of this beginning - those who affirm traditional community and cultural standards (Conan Doyle is the greatest of these, but others include the likes of Edgar Allen Poe), and those who are critical of society (Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, to name but a few). There are also those middle cases, such as Dorothy Sayers, who variously affirm and criticise (sometimes in the same breath) society and values around them.The second primary section of the text explore the natural of reality and how this impacts, and is impacted by, religion and theological concerns. Paul also argues that the division between the two pillars of detective fiction, once only occasionally muddled, has become more jumbled. 'Especially since World War II, the distinctions between these two forms of the genre have become markedly less pronounced. ... Whereas before World War II, classic detective habitually affirmed the reality of justice, now we are not so sure.'One can sense a great love and appreciation for mysteries, from Agatha Christie to Umberto Eco, from Charles Dickens to J.B. Priestly. There is also a strong sense of the importance of literature and meaning in modern society, something often sensed to be lacking.Paul is a good writer, drawing in the ideas well, and motivates the reader to go further, re-reading the mysteries themselves with new considerations in mind."},{"Title":"A History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas","review":"History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas focuses on piracy in the Caribbean sea, from the 1500s to the early 1800s.The biggest problem with the book is that it is not particularly well organized. The chapters are relatively well ordered but internal to the chapter, the author will introduce one topic, then drift away from it, before returning to his reported topic. This led me to need to reread some passages, to determine exactly who or what he was writing about. This is particulary evident as he starts to discuss an individual pirate, begins discussing an associated pirate or two, and then returns to the first one.The information seems accurate enough, but much f it appears to be drawn from the writings of other authors. Fortunately, it is not written from a standard academic (Self-important and wordy) approach and is relatively easy to read. In many places it even seems to draw the reader on.I would have preferred a more organized approach, and possibly an appendix of famous pirates, but overall I found the book an adequate diversion."},{"Title":"A History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas","review":"A rambling work at best. The author does indeed drift around at times, leaving a topic unfinished to explore other avenues before returning to the original topic. We, also, are not talking about much in the way of original material (much of it comes from Captain Charles Johnson, Alexandre Exquemelin, and recent authors like David Cordingly).However, there are redeeming qualities to the book. For one it is an entertaining read, the author uses a smooth style that makes for easy reading. The author covers a range of topics from ships, weapons and havens to the origins of and suppression of piracy during the Golden Age. There are numerous names mentioned, from the well known and notorious to the lesser know footnotes in history. The period covered spans from the early 1500s to the early 1800s, told for the most part from the English and French point of view.In short, a good book for an overview or brief reference (although I still recommend David Cordingly or Angus Konstam for broader, more polished coverage or pirates).P-)"},{"Title":"A History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas","review":"I picked up this book this afternoon, looking forward to an entertaining evening, but after 20 pages I doubt that I will return to it. The rambling, disorganized style is indeed one reason, but when that is combined with typo after typo, it is simply too distracting to continue. The cover says Cawthorne has contributed to and edited over 100 books. He couldn't edit a high school essay from what I see (I am a retired English teacher). Sadly, a few dollars spent on a professional editor could have made this a fun read."},{"Title":"A History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas","review":"Cawthorne' History of Pirates, although not academically rigorous, is approached in a somewhat systematic fashion and provides an interesting, readable description of a unique chapter in history. Rather than compose a treatise on particular pirates and their idiosyncrasies, Cawthorne describes the prate era, roughly 1780 - 1830, with a wide brush. The author explores the global political situation of the times, the constant warfare between Britain, France and Spain, the booming colonial expansion, and the role pirates played in shaping the New World. In addition, Cawthorne depicts a pirate's life aboard ship and the unique social structure which accompanies life on the high seas. If I could make a suggestion, Cawthorne could have spent more time on his chapters on weapons and ships. The work in these segments was marginal at best and seems out of place wedged between sections on \\"the richest and wickedest city in the new world,\\" and life aboard ships. Nevertheless, I found History of Pirates an interesting and insightful beginning to a more in depth understanding of the Caribbean pirates, but this work would not be a one volume history of the subject."},{"Title":"A History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas","review":"This book focuses on the Pirates of the Caribbean during the near 50 year time span that made up the \\"Golden Age of Piracy\\". The content of the book is good, goes into detail, yet a tad too much. The Structure of the book is well done, but the chapters are something else. A topic will be introduced, talked about and then he will go on to ramble about this and that and then before the end of the chapter he returns to the original topic and then concludes it. Despite this, it is a well written book, but if your looking for \\"perfect\\" this isn't for you.Though the content seems to come from men like Daniel Defoe, he does have at least one aspect of his book that is original unlike past Pirate books I've read, where he goes on to talk about HOW the Piracy issue was solved, such as David Porter, father of the US Civil War Admiral David Porter, pretty much crushed the Pirates operating along the US coastal lines and the Caribbean."},{"Title":"A History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas","review":"Nigel Cawthorne brings a book to us about pirates which can be read by anyone and you don't have to be an historian to understand the book. It's laid out in plain terms and covers the era of piracy in the varied aspects of weaponry, ships, locales, and the pirates themselves. The book could have been a bit more thorough on weapons and ships but then the lay-person would lose interest with any more detail, I think. He covers pirates such as Calico Jack, Henry Morgan, Anne Bonny, Blackbeard, and Captain Kidd among others. The coverage is in depth enough to hold your interest but not bogged down with meaningless details that only an historian would care about (this coming from an historian). You'll learn some nifty trivia and dispel numerous movie myths about pirates like buried treasure and walking the plank to name two. Overall, great book for someone looking to pick up the basics on piracy history but not overbearing. My only complaint is I wish there were more on Blackbeard but then that's what biographies are for."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"I dont need to comment about the book because there are plenty of reviewers that have done an adequate job.
